UPM said it expected to cut 160 jobs at the Plattling mill near the Czech border and reduce the annual capacity of coated mechanical paper by 155,000 tonnes.
UPM is one of the world's largest makers of magazine paper, a sector which has been among the worst hit by a shift to digital publishing.

UPM will book 30 million euros ($34 million) in restructuring charges in the second quarter related to the closure, which will generate annual savings of 17 million euros.

While Germany would be happy to host “lots of” lenders from all over the world, the country and its export-led economy need “strong banks” that can support German businesses in the rest of the world, Scholz said late Monday in Munich, reinforcing the government’s key argument for a merger.
The Finance Ministry played a key role behind the scenes in pushing Germany’s largest listed lenders into talks. Scholz and his deputy Joerg Kukies, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker, are seeking to shore up Deutsche Bank before a potential downturn on the grounds that the country needs a national champion to support German businesses at home and overseas.
Discussions over the combination, which has sparked opposition from labor unions and politicians over job cuts and financial risks, are reaching a decisive point. Deutsche Bank Chairman Paul Achleitner has said a decision on whether to proceed with a deal will be made by April 26.
Unpopular Stance
Since the banks announced official merger talks in mid-March, the government has gone silent, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel distancing herself from the deal, saying it’s a private business matter.
A survey published last week in widely read Bild newspaper showed 43 percent against a merger and only 17 percent in favor. Scholz’s popularity dropped by 10 percentage points in a poll published Monday by Spiegel as he was widely criticized for his banking stance.
Meanwhile, the two German lenders are lining up more Wall Street advisers. Deutsche Bank hired  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to support it in the merger talks, according to people familiar with the matter, adding to a plethora of U.S. firms advising the two German lenders and underscoring American dominance in investment banking.
“Just being a host country -- as some European countries are -- is not the best thing to strive for,” Scholz said, indicating that he would like to see a German bank leading potential cross-border consolidation in Europe.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose about 9 percent in the first quarter of 2019, its biggest quarterly gain since January-March 2012. That propelled the index's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) to a 10-month high of 12.89 at the end of March.
However, it was still less than the MSCI All Country World index's forward 12 month P/E of 14.78, the data showed.
South Korea, Hong Kong and China were the lowest-cost shares in the region, with P/E multiples of about 12 or less. 
India and Malaysia were the most expensive, with ratios of 18.3 and 15.8 respectively.
""The region trades at a steep discount to global equities,"" DBS Bank said in a note.
""The China equity market is particularly attractive on aggressive policy tailwinds and MSCI index re-weighting,"" it said.

(NS:TISC) submitted concessions to European Union regulators in an effort to win antitrust approval for their steel joint venture.
The European Commission didn’t provide any details on what they pledged to do, but typically companies offer to sell overlapping units to allay concerns that the merged firm would have too much power to increase prices or curb supplies.
The companies are prepared to sell part of car body sheet production, including Thyssenkrupp’s Spanish unit Galmed, Handelsblatt reported, citing anonymous sources. The newspaper said the proposal had packaging steel assets including plants in Belgium and the U.K. They also offered to give customers access to raw steel production.
Asset sales outside of Germany would satisfy demands by Thyssenkrupp’s labor leaders that the joint venture won’t cause job losses in Germany. Union representatives at the company control half of all votes on the company’s supervisory board and would fiercely oppose concessions that cut German steelworkers.
The EU usually sends the proposal to rivals and customers for feedback. The European Commission extended its deadline to June 5 to make a decision, a spokesman said.
The plan to create a European steel company jointly owned by Germany’s Thyssenkrupp and India’s Tata “raised several issues,” the EU said last year when it opened an in-depth probe into the transaction. These were related to the supply of galvanized steel for cars and car parts, metallic-coated steel for food and aerosol cans and steel used for transformers and other engineering products.
Only four European companies currently provide steel to the auto industry: ArcelorMittal, Thyssen, Tata and Voestalpine AG.
The merged entity, under the proposed name of Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel B.V., would focus on high-quality flat steel production.

8,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",Nestle Races Burger King to Serve Meatless Hamburger Patties,"(Bloomberg) -- The race to feed the world’s growing vegetarian population is heating up as Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) unveiled plans to introduce its soy-protein-based burgers across Europe and the U.S. this year.
Nestle’s meatless Incredible Burger will go on sale in supermarkets in Europe under the Garden Gourmet brand this month, starting out in countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. Near the end of the year, a version designed for American palates called the Awesome Burger will be available where Sweet Earth brand products are sold, the world’s largest food company said in a statement Tuesday.
As consumers reduce their meat intake, food companies are rushing in with alternatives. Nestle’s announcement comes the day after Restaurant Brands International Inc.'s (NYSE:QSR) Burger King said it will start a test run of meatless burgers using patties from Impossible Foods Inc. in the St. Louis area.
“It’s a big trend,” said Alain Oberhuber, an analyst at MainFirst in Zurich who has tasted Nestle’s meat substitute product. “I liked it a lot. Even without sauce, you didn’t really taste a big difference.”
Meatless also sells well to millennials, because it creates fewer greenhouse emissions than raising beef, Oberhuber said. The product may also have a higher gross margin, and because it’s hard to replicate meat, the new market segment is hard for new entrants to conquer.
Wheat, Beetroot
Nestle’s product includes wheat and extracts of beetroot, carrot and bell peppers to help make it look like meat. The company is launching it in the chilled and frozen aisles of supermarkets across Europe, while Burger King’s test run is currently confined to 59 fast-food restaurants near St. Louis.
The field is growing, with new entrants like Beyond Meat, backed by Bill Gates, competing with The Vegetarian Butcher, recently acquired by  Unilever  (LON:ULVR).
Burger King isn’t the first restaurant chain to try selling Impossible Food meat substitutes. They’re available in more than 5,000 restaurants in the U.S., including White Castle.
While Nestle doesn’t have a product at restaurants yet, the Swiss company is in a race with Impossible Foods to reach store shelves. The U.S. startup also aims to sell meatless burgers in U.S. supermarkets this year, but it first needs approval from the Food and Drug Administration for the key ingredient in its patties. Nestle’s patties don’t use the substance, a molecule called heme.
Impossible Foods has told U.S. regulators it aims to raise more capital. Temasek, one of its shareholders, is considering investing $75 million in the new funding round, the Financial Times said Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
The Swiss company’s plant-based business may reach more than 1 billion francs ($1 billion) in sales within a decade, Laurent Freixe, chief executive officer of the Americas region, has forecast. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Norway are the other countries where the patties will be available this month, and Nestle plans to expand them to other countries later.
In February, Nestle put its Herta lunch-meat business up for sale as Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider tries to spur sales growth.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 04:25AM ET</span>",Boeing to submit 737 MAX software upgrade 'in the coming weeks',"By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Monday it planned to submit a proposed software enhancement package for the grounded 737 MAX in ""the coming weeks"" after the company had previously said it planned to deliver the fix for government approval by last week.
The company on Monday confirmed a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration that it would submit the upgrade later than previously announced.
""We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,"" Boeing said. ""We will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.""
More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after two crashes - in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month - killed nearly 350 people.
Boeing, facing one of its worst crises in years, is under pressure from crash victims' families, airlines, lawmakers in Washington and regulators around the world to prove that the automated flight control systems of its 737 MAX aircraft are safe and that pilots have the training required to override the system in an emergency.
Two people briefed on the matter said a Boeing review uncovered issues with ""integration"" when the new software is loaded into an aircraft. One of the people added that the issues uncovered had ""nothing to do with Ethiopian.""
One analyst indicated it was too early to determine how much time this would add to the grounding, with approval from non-U.S. regulators still expected to be the main factor in determining when the planes would fly again globally.
In a sign the plane may be out of service for longer than some forecast, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co said on Monday it was ""publishing a revised schedule for April and May that is built around the currently available Southwest fleet and intends to reduce drastically last-minute trip disruptions and same-day cancellations.""
American Airlines Group Inc said it was aware that the resumption of service for its 737 MAX aircraft may be further delayed and said it was working with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations.
Earlier on Monday, FAA spokesman Greg Martin said that ""time is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 MAX Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.""
Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said last week the agency would not unground the planes until its analysis ""of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate.""
On Monday, the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent letters to Boeing and FAA seeking records related to the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.
“Understanding where things went wrong is critically important because tragedies like this should not happen,"" said Representative Peter DeFazio, the committee’s chair. ""These request letters represent only the start of our investigation and finding answers to our questions will take some time.""
DeFazio wants records related to pilot training and communication with international aviation authorities, officials said.
Boeing said last week that it had reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.
The world's largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in the Indonesia accident, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.
It would also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure the ""angle of attack,"" or angle of the wing to the airflow, a fundamental parameter of flight, offered widely different readings, Boeing said last week. 

Federal prosecutors, the Transportation Department's inspector general and U.S. lawmakers are investigating the FAA's certification of the 737 MAX. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has also said she is naming an outside panel to review the issue.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were higher after early trading on Tuesday but looked like they need a pause for breath after rallying strongly on Monday in response to encouraging manufacturing surveys from China and the U.S.
At 04:15 AM ET (08:15 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was effectively changed at 383.74. Germany’s Dax was also flat, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 owed most of its 0.4% gain to yet another kick to sterling in the wake of another failure by parliament to find a way out of the Brexit impasse on Monday night.
U.K. stocks seem to have succumbed to Brexit fatigue, unwilling to respond to incremental news that still leaves a wide range of outcomes possible.
Four days after the U.K. was due to leave the EU, the country’s final destination is still anywhere between a disruptive “Hard Brexit” with no transitional arrangements, and a parliamentary vote to scrap the whole process of leaving.
Parliament voted last night against all of the other options that represented attempts to find a compromise, leaving No Deal on April 12th as the legal default, and revocation of the so-called Article 50 process as the only legally guaranteed way of avoiding it. Anything else, such as a long extension of the deadline that Prime Minister Theresa May is reportedly preparing to ask the EU for, would be conditional on the unanimous approval of the 27 other EU member states.
In a generally quiet morning for corporate news, iron and steel stocks are in focus after BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB) became the second big FTSE-listed miner to warn about reduced output due to cyclone damage in Western Australia.  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) had warned earlier that its full-year output would now be at the low end of its forecast range as a result of disruptions to its operations there.
The Australian disruptions aggravate a supply squeeze going back to January caused by the suspension of some of Brazilian giant Vale’s operations in the wake of a fatal dam collapse. Iron ore prices have risen some 40% since then, providing a windfall for those lucky enough to be unaffected, such as  Ferrexpo  (LON:FXPO), which is based in Ukraine but listed in London. It was up 0.3% by 0800 GMT and is up over 10% over the last week."

Price tags for products listed on Apple's China website were lowered on Monday morning, including a discount of up to 500 yuan ($74.44) for some of its latest iPhone models. 
Suggested retail prices for brands including LVMH's Louis Vuitton and Kering's Gucci were also cut by around 3 percent, according to local media reports. 
It follows announcements last month from car brands BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz, which said prices for several car models would drop following the tax changes.
Apple declined to comment on the price cuts, while  Kering  (PA:PRTP) did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
A spokeswoman for Louis Vuitton confirmed its China business adjusted prices on Friday and said the brand is ""fully supportive of the Chinese government's ongoing efforts to narrow the price gap between China and overseas"".
Beijing said in March that it would cut taxes and fees for all companies by nearly 2 trillion yuan in 2019, with the manufacturing, transportation and construction sectors set to benefit as it looks to stimulate a slowing economy. 
The world's second-largest economy is growing at its weakest pace in almost three decades amid lower domestic demand and a trade war with the United States. 

Several Chinese electronics retailers lowered prices for iPhones in January, discounting latest models by up to $118, after weaker-than-expected sales at end-2018.

Sainsbury's sales fell 1.8 percent over the 12 weeks to March 24, reducing its market share to 15.3 percent from 15.8 percent in the same period last year, researcher Kantar said.
That meant Asda, the British arm of U.S. retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT), overtook Sainsbury's with a market share of 15.4 percent as its sales edged up 0.1 percent in the period.
Kantar said Sainsbury's remained the biggest seller of food and drink out of the two retailers as its figures do not include the Argos general merchandise business it acquired in 2016.
Sainsbury's agreed 7.3 billion pound ($9.5 billion) takeover of Asda is currently being considered by Britain's competition regulator.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said last month its initial view was that the deal should be blocked in the absence of the sale of a large number of stores, or even one of the brands. A final report is due by April 30.
Kantar's data showed Tesco's sales rose 0.5 percent in the period and it remained the clear market leader with a share of 27.4 percent. Sales at No. 4 player Morrisons fell 0.1 percent, giving it a market share of 10.3 percent.

However, all of Britain's so called ""big four"" supermarkets lost market share to German-owned discounters Aldiand Lidl. Their sales increased 10.6 percent and 5.8 percent respectively, giving them a combined market share of 13.6 percent.

The jets have been removed from service pending engine replacement, the airline said in a statement.
The Trent 1000 TEN is the latest version of an engine that has had a problematic entry into service. As of late February, Rolls-Royce said 35 787s were grounded globally due to engine blades corroding or cracking prematurely. The manufacturer said it was aiming to reduce the number to 10 by the end of the year.
In February, the company raised a Trent 1000 accounting charge to 790 million pounds ($1.03 billion) from 554 million pounds at the half year, contributing to a full-year operating loss of 1.16 billion pounds. It also allocated another 100 million pounds in cash to the problem.
Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday that since the entry into service of the Trent 1000 TEN, it had communicated to operators that the high-pressure turbine blades in the engine would have a limited life.
""Working with operators, we have been sampling a small population of the Trent 1000 TEN fleet that has flown in more arduous conditions,"" the manufacturer said in a statement. ""This work has shown that a small number of these engines need to have their blades replaced earlier than scheduled.""
Rolls-Royce said its engineers were already developing and testing an enhanced version of the turbine blade.

""We will now work closely with any impacted customers to deliver an accelerated program to implement the enhanced blade and to ensure that we can deliver on our Trent 1000 TEN future commitments,"" the company said. ""We regret any disruption this causes to airline operations.""

18,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 11:00PM ET</span>",Indonesia's Market Selloff Seen as Just a Speed Bump for Bonds,"(Bloomberg) -- Bank Indonesia’s intervention should stabilize its financial markets, so lower bond yields -- even a rate cut -- are still a possibility later this year, according to analysts.
The central bank has been buying local bonds and selling dollars to help prop up the rupiah -- one of the most sensitive currencies in Asia to risk sentiment -- as investors sold high-beta assets on global growth jitters and turmoil in Turkey. While Indonesian assets are once again under pressure, any financial pain is seen as short-lived.
“BI is prioritizing market stability right now,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. Once the presidential election is over in April, “I’m leaning toward a rate cut after their 175 pips of hikes last year. That will be good for bond investors.”

Fears of a U.S. recession and Turkey’s funding crisis have dulled the appeal of risk assets, leading to an erosion of gains in emerging markets. BI Governor Perry Warjiyo has sought to distance the nation from the turbulence in Turkey and pledged last Thursday to intervene during a sell-off.
The bank has repeatedly injected liquidity into markets through currency swaps and repo auctions, in addition to buying bonds, to safeguard the currency. The rupiah slipped 1.2 percent in March against the dollar.
Yield Expectations
Investors had been warming to Indonesian securities since the start of the year, helped by a dovish pivot from global central banks and optimism over a U.S.-China trade resolution. While the median analyst forecast is for the policy rate to stay unchanged this year, some market participants including Mizuho, PT Mirae Asset Sekuritas and TD Securities say a cut is possible, and overall expectations for bond yields are falling.
The median end-of-year estimate for Indonesia’s 10-year yield has slipped to 7.90 percent from 8.15 percent in November, according to the latest Bloomberg survey. The benchmark fell 2 basis points to 7.61 percent on Monday, adding to the 18 basis points decline in March.
The most recent intervention “aims to help restore confidence in anticipation of profit-taking activities by foreign investors,” said Jennifer Kusuma, senior Asia rates strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore.
“Bond markets have taken a cue from the softening money market rates and BI’s liquidity injection via regular term repo and FX swap facilities,” she said. “We expect these and more macroprudential measures to slowly guide bond yields lower throughout the year.”

19,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 10:50PM ET</span>",UK lawmakers want Big Four accounting firms broken up,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's ""Big Four"" accounting firms should be broken up to improve standards and transparency in book-keeping after audit failures at construction company Carillion and retailer BHS, British lawmakers said on Tuesday.
Parliament's business committee urged Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to force EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC to legally separate audit and consultancy services.
The CMA published interim proposals last December to require a less draconian operational separation of auditing and more lucrative consultancy to avoid the former being cross-subsidized and prioritized by the latter.
The CMA has yet to publish final recommendations.
The report seeks to keep up reform momentum after past attempts to end the so-called Big Four's dominance of book-keeping made little headway.
EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC have sought to head off being split up by voluntarily agreeing not to offer consultancy services to audit clients.
The cross-party report said that if the CMA opts for only operational separation, it should be reviewed after three years to see if it ends cross-subsidies and improved audit quality.
""If not, we recommend that the CMA then move to implement a full structural break-up of the Big Four into audit and non-audit businesses in the UK,"" the report said.
Deloitte said a structural split would harm audit quality, and could materially damage Britain's competitive position as a leading capital market. The ""Big Four"" are global but the reforms could only apply in Britain.
They check the books of nearly all large listed companies, employing thousands more partners than their nearest rivals like Grant Thornton and BDO.
MARKET CAP
The CMA proposed joint audits for all of Britain's top 350 listed companies, meaning a smaller accounting firm would have to be hired alongside any appointment of a ""Big Four"" firm.
But the lawmaker report takes a more cautious approach by recommending a pilot of joint audits in the ""upper reaches"" of the top 100 companies, but supplemented with a ""segmented"" market cap on the Big Four for the rest of the top 350 companies.
The CMA kept market caps in reserve despite proposals last year from the top four accounting firms to help challengers get the experience to audit bigger customers.
The government should also examine if special safeguards are needed for auditing banks, the report said.
It also looks at ""imprudent"" dividends paid by companies like Carillion from profits that were either optimistically booked or unrealized.
The government and the Financial Reporting Council, which polices accountants, should urgently produce a prudent definition for realized profits and tighten the UK dividend regime, the report said.
Auditors should also play a key role in spotting fraud, it added. A separate, independent review recommended last December replacing the FRC with a more powerful body.

The government is expected to propose legislation to implement the audit shake up once the CMA has published its final recommendations in coming weeks.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both traded 0.2% higher by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.1%.
Chinese stocks jumped almost 3% on Monday after surveys showed the country’s manufacturing activity unexpectedly rebounded in March.
The private Caixin PMI came in at 50.8 for March, higher than the expected 49.9, snapping three straight months of declines.
The National Bureau of Statistics reported on Sunday that the official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 50.5 in March from February’s three-year low of 49.2. It was the first expansion in four months.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.3%. Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.4%.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.2%. Although not a directional driver, the country’s headline inflation slowed to its weakest pace since July 2016 in March, Statistics Korea said on Tuesday.
The consumer price index rose 0.4% in March from a year earlier, compared to the expected 0.9% price growth.
In the U.K., the Brexit saga made headlines on Tuesday after Parliament rejected all the options to replace Prime Minister Theresa May’s unpopular deal.
While May is still trying to get her twice-rejected deal through Parliament, the legal default, for now, will be for the U.K. to leave the European Union in 11 days with no deal in place.
“The House has voted in favor of nothing. As a result in 11 days time, the U.K. will leave the EU without an agreement unless the prime minister acts,” said Labour member of Parliament Hilary Benn.
Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade talks will resume when Vice Premier Liu He leads a delegation to Washington later this week. High-level officials from both sides, including He, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, concluded the latest round of trade discussions last week in Beijing. It was reported following the meetings that it could take “weeks, or even months” before China and the U.S. could reach a trade deal."
22,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 10:12PM ET</span>","Uber's Kalanick, directors win dismissal of investor lawsuit","By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Travis Kalanick, the co-founder of ride-hailing company Uber, and the company's directors won the dismissal of an investor lawsuit that sought to hold them liable for a fight over trade secrets that slowed Uber's push into autonomous vehicles.
The lawsuit by California investor Lenza McElrath sought to pin damages on Kalanick and board members for the cost of its high-profile battle with Google's parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, which accused Uber of stealing self-driving technology.
The ruling on Monday by Delaware Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock dismissing the lawsuit closes a difficult chapter for Uber, which paid $245 million to Alphabet in February 2018 to settle their trade secrets fight. 
Uber is scheduled for an IPO this month. Its rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) made a soaring stock market debut last week, opening with a share price of $87.24 but it was down 10 percent on Monday.
Michael Barry, a lawyer with Grant & Eisenhofer in Wilmington who represented McElrath, declined to comment.
An Uber spokesman said the company was ""pleased with the court’s decision to dismiss this meritless complaint.""
The decision can be appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.
The dismissed lawsuit accused Kalanick and Uber's directors of breaching their fiduciary duties to investors by approving Uber's $680 million deal in 2016 for Ottomotto LLC. The self-driving trucking company was founded and staffed by former employees of Waymo, which is owned by Alphabet.
Uber struck the deal shortly after Otto founder Anthony Levandowski resigned from Waymo. 
Just months after the deal closed, Waymo sued Uber in federal court over allegations that Levandowski brought with him thousands of secret files. 
The Waymo fight set back Uber's self-driving development and led to the shuttering of its autonomous trucking efforts.
The lawsuit said the Uber board ignored intellectual property risks from the Otto deal and should have been more skeptical of Kalanick's judgment.
The Court of Chancery judge, however, said there was no evidence that the board simply rubberstamped a deal. 
A due diligence report on the deal had been prepared but directors did not review it in full before the board gave its initial approval, and the board had some discussion of potential legal liability from acquiring Otto.

""Their decision ultimately damaged Uber,"" wrote Glasscock. ""Nonetheless, a failure to follow best practices is not necessarily a breach of fiduciary duty.""

23,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 10:08PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Investors drop out of two groups vying for Petrobras' gas pipeline unit - sources,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - At least three investors left separate groups interested in acquiring a gas network pipeline that will be sold by Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Those departures will likely leave a third group, led by France's Engie SA with Canadian pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, stronger. The final bids for TAG, as the unit is known, are due on Tuesday. 
After the previously reported departure of Australia's Macquarie Group Ltd from one of the groups, which still includes Brazilian investment firm Itausa Investimentos SA and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, the other two investors that were supporting the bid, sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, known as Adia, and investment manager Wren House Infrastructure, also pulled out.
A second group, led by Mubadala Investment Company and EIG Global Energy Partners, had been in talks with the world's largest investment firm, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), but the company gave up.
Wrenhouse, Adia, EIG, Mubadala and Itausa did not immediately comment on the matter. BlackRock, which would have a small stake in TAG, declined to comment.
The weakening of the Itausa Investimentos and Mubadala groups raises the chance of Engie, which was the winner of the first bid round, winning the deal. It is not clear if the three groups will deliver the proposals as it was previously expected.
The sale of TAG is expected to be the largest divestment in Petrobras' asset sale program. The oil company expects to fetch around $8 billion.

All bids were expected to use a large amount of debt to finance the acquisition, as banks are eager to fund the pipeline, which has an extremely stable cash flow. Still, last-minute changes in the group complicate the financing, one of the sources said.

The private equity giant made roughly a 40 percent return on the CICC shares it sold, the person said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. TPG took advantage of a Chinese stock market rally this year that drove CICC up more than 60 percent from an October low. The U.S. firm sold more stock than it had planned because of strong demand from investors, according to the person.
TPG’s investment in CICC was at times a rocky one, with the buyout firm deciding in 2012 to write down its stake to 60 cents on the dollar following a slump in stock and bond underwriting in China. It has also been a lengthy holding period by the standards of private equity firms, which typically seek to exit after about five years.
CICC, whose partnership with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) starting in the 1990s became a test case for foreign investment banks’ forays into China, went public in Hong Kong in 2015. The stock is up 84 percent from the initial public offering price through Monday. TPG sold 75 percent of its shares for HK$18.58 apiece, a 2 percent discount to Monday’s close, the person said.
Shares of CICC slipped 0.4 percent to HK$18.88 in early trading Tuesday. Representatives for CICC and TPG, which is based in San Francisco and Fort Worth, Texas, weren’t immediately available for comment.
The CICC sell-down comes at a time when private equity firms are gathering firepower to step up investing in Asia, home to some of the world’s fastest-growing economies. TPG raised more than $4.6 billion for its Asia private equity fund in February, almost 40 percent larger its previous pool of capital dedicated to the region.

26,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 06:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Renault alerts prosecutors to Oman dealer payments under Ghosn,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) has alerted French prosecutors to payments made to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman under former Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, three sources told Reuters.
This follows an internal investigation by the French carmaker after Ghosn's November arrest in Japan for suspected financial misconduct at its alliance partner Nissan Motor Co Ltd .
Renault has established it paid out millions of euros described as dealer incentives to Omani distributor Suhail Bahwan Automobiles (SBA) over five years from around 2011, said the sources, who were briefed on the findings. Nissan previously found that its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to SBA.
But the information sent to French prosecutors shows that much of the cash was then channeled to a Lebanese company controlled by Ghosn associates, the sources said.
The total sum paid by Renault is in the double-digit millions, one source said.
""We categorically deny the allegations of potential embezzlement in Oman,"" Ghosn's French lawyer Jean-Yves Le Borgne said, declining further comment.
Renault spokesman Frederic Texier declined to comment, while the French financial prosecutor's office did not respond to requests for comment and SBA could not be reached for comment.
Responding last month to earlier reports about the Nissan payments via SBA, a Ghosn family spokesman said: ""The dealer incentive payments were directed by regional heads, not the CEO, and rewarded top performing dealers around the world.""
Ghosn is awaiting trial in Japan on charges that he failed to report $82 million in Nissan pay he had arranged to receive after retirement. He has also been indicted for transferring personal investment losses to Nissan and steering $14.7 million in company funds to Saudi businessman Khaled Al-Juffali.
Renault initially sought to avoid being drawn into the investigation initiated by Nissan - which ousted Ghosn as chairman days after his arrest - and for weeks avoided sharing the Japanese partner's findings with its own board.
But Ghosn was eventually forced out as Renault chairman and CEO in January, when  Michelin  (PA:MICP) veteran Jean-Dominique Senard was appointed chairman, and the alliance partners embarked on an independent audit of their joint finances the following month.
FOUR JETS
Born in Brazil to Lebanese parents, Ghosn, 65, returned to Lebanon as a child and retains a powerful network of friends and associates there. A Beirut house was among several properties around the world that were purchased by Nissan for his use, as the company's investigation revealed early on.
The joint audit of the Renault-Nissan BV alliance management organization has tallied 1.2 million euros ($1.34 million) in Lebanese donations and other spending of questionable benefit to the carmakers, among preliminary results presented to Renault directors this week, two people familiar with the matter said.
The audit is examining the use of four corporate jets financed by the Dutch-registered subsidiary and payments of around 170,000 euros annually to Carlos Abou Jaoude, Ghosn's personal lawyer in Lebanon, over six years, the sources said. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the lawyer.
In an earlier complaint filed with French prosecutors in February, Renault turned over evidence that the 50,000-euro rental cost of Ghosn's Chateau de Versailles wedding in 2016 had been improperly charged to the company.
But the alleged Oman connection may deepen Renault's exposure to the scandal unearthed by its Japanese partner, which has strained their 20-year-old alliance, and raises questions about governance at the French parent company.
Cash from Ghosn's own ""CEO office"" budgets at Renault as well as Nissan moved through the regional sales divisions to SBA and on to a Lebanese intermediary, ""Good Faith Investments Holding"", the three people briefed on the findings said.
From there it flowed on to privately held entities including a British Virgin Islands-registered vehicle that paid for a $15 million yacht, they said.
Renault's findings, delivered to prosecutors late last week, also include evidence suggesting that some of the funds were passed to a California-based company co-founded by Carlos Ghosn's son, Anthony Ghosn, the sources said.
There was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Anthony Ghosn or that he knew about the origin of the funds invested in his firm, Shogun Investments LLC. The Ghosn family spokesman, who also represents Anthony, declined to comment.

Carlos Ghosn has not been charged with any offences in relation to the findings of either carmaker concerning incentive payments to SBA, the Omani partner, the spokesman added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) was awarded a $2.4 billion Pentagon contract on Monday for THAAD interceptor missiles, some of which are slated to be delivered to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Reuters had reported Lockheed was nearing the deal earlier on Monday.
In November, Saudi and U.S. officials signed letters of offer and acceptance formalizing terms for Saudi Arabia's purchase of 44 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense launchers, missiles and related equipment.
The Pentagon said the Saudi government would pay $1.5 billion of the $2.4 billion. 
The November deal was inked amid concerns about the role of the kingdom's leadership in the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi critic who lived in the United States and was a columnist for the Washington Post. 
Representatives for Lockheed Martin declined to comment. 
Lockheed Martin, the biggest U.S. arms maker, builds and integrates the THAAD system, which is designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), another U.S. firm, builds its advanced radar.

As a part of the scope of work outlined by the Pentagon, obsolete systems currently in place will be updated to prepare the current Saudi missile defense infrastructure for the new THAAD technology.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve board announced on Monday it would hold an open meeting April 8 to discuss proposed changes to rules for foreign banks and resolution plans submitted by domestic and foreign firms.
The proposed changes would implement provisions of a bank deregulation law passed by Congress in May, which directed the Fed to ease requirements in several areas for banks with less than $250 billion in assets.
The proposed rules for foreign banks are a follow-up to rules the Fed proposed in October easing capital and liquidity requirements for larger domestic firms, as directed by the new law. There, the Fed proposed easier rules for smaller firms while ratcheting up requirements as banks got larger in size.
However, Reuters reported in March the Fed was considering tighter rules on foreign bank branches over concerns they could allow overseas lenders to shield assets from the toughest U.S. bank rules.
After the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed ordered foreign banks to place their non-branch U.S. assets into a new holding company, which would be subject to the same heightened post-crisis rules as domestic U.S. banks. Branches, however, fell outside that purview, as they are legally part of the overseas parent.

On resolution plans, otherwise known as ""living wills,"" the Fed was given discretion under the new law to ease requirements for banks with less than $250 billion in assets. The Fed could reduce how often banks must submit the reports and otherwise ease requirements for the document, which details how a bank could safely be unwound.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rally in the S&P 500 on Monday resulted in a technical benchmark, known as a golden cross pattern, that could, if history holds true, indicate more gains in the near term.
Considered a bullish signal by chart analysts and other market watchers, a golden cross forms when an index's near-term moving average of daily closing prices rises above a longer-term moving average.
It formed on Monday for the S&P 500 index, for the first time since April 2016, with recent gains in the U.S. benchmark for large stocks pushing the index's 50-day moving average above its 200-day moving average. GRAPHIC: Golden cross"" triggered, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2HQDB6I 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average had triggered a golden cross signal about two weeks ago, but as an investment strategy, the golden cross historically has been a more reliable indicator of future performance for the S&P 500, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA in New York.
""The statistics say it does, from the standpoint of at least going back to 1990,"" he said.
Employing the golden cross strategy resulted in a return that equaled or beat the market more than half the time since at least 1990, based on the compound annual growth rate for the S&P 500, Stovall said.
The S&P 500 index rose 1.16 percent on Monday, after closing out the first quarter on Friday with its best quarterly gain since 2009, boosted by optimism over recent trade talks between the United States and China.
The index, which triggered a death cross in early December when the 50-day moving average fell below the declining 200-day moving average, is now up more than 20 percent since its Dec. 24 close, the trough of its late-year selloff.
Not everyone in the market tracks such signals or considers them important, but some say it is good to see something that confirms the trend in stocks.

""It's another positive in a basically positive background. It's one more thing on the market's right side,"" said Frank Gretz, market analyst and technician for Wellington Shields & Co in New York.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.27%, the S&P 500 added 1.16%, while the Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.29%.
Financials, mostly banks, racked up gains as 10-year bond yields rose as better-than-expected manufacturing data from China and the U.S. prompted traders to bet global growth is set for a soft landing.
Rising government bond yields boost banks' ability to generate net interest income.
The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLF) ETF rose 2.5%, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) closing more than 3% higher.
The upbeat manufacturing data overshadowed an unexpected decline in U.S. retail sales, led by a slump in transactions for building materials and garden supplies.
Industrials also underpinned the broader market on improving sentiment on trade after China reportedly suspended U.S. tariffs ahead of trade talks in Washington set for later this week.
U.S. officials last week said China was warming up to the idea of an enforcement framework, which the Trump administration argues is important to ensure China complies with eventual terms of a trade deal.

36,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>","Wall Street rallies on upbeat China, U.S. manufacturing data","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, starting off the second quarter on a strong note, as upbeat manufacturing numbers from China and the United States eased worries about slowing global growth.
The benchmark S&P 500 index, which is only 2.2 percent below its record closing high in September, triggered a ""golden cross"" pattern, in which its 50-day moving average crosses above its 200-day moving average. Many believe the technical signal could portend more gains for stocks in the short term.
Gains in global equities were spurred by data showing that China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth in March for the first time in four months.
""The Chinese numbers bounced back, and people are taking more risk today because of it,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
U.S. manufacturing numbers for March were also better than expected, helping investors overlook soft retail sales data for February.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 329.74 points, or 1.27 percent, to 26,258.42, the S&P 500 gained 32.79 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,867.19, and the Nasdaq Composite added 99.59 points, or 1.29 percent, to 7,828.91.
Concerns about a global economic slowdown have dimmed sentiment since the Federal Reserve announced in late January that its monetary tightening would end earlier than expected, as it cited ""cross currents"" affecting the economy. The shift in Fed policy drove yields on 10-year Treasury notes below those of three-month bills last week for the first time in more than a decade.
Yields on 10-year notes have since risen back above three-month bill rates and on Monday hit a one-week high. Monday's rise in the 10-year Treasury yield helped lift financial shares, which provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 among the index's 11 sectors. S&P 500 bank shares jumped 2.9 percent.
""Treasury yields had priced in a gloomy outlook, and now they're unwinding some of that negativity,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""So we're seeing money moving back into cyclical areas, which is why financials are big leaders today.""
Concerns about slowing momentum have not entirely dissipated. With the first-quarter corporate earnings reporting season about two weeks away, investors are bracing for what may be the first U.S. profit decline since 2016. Analysts expect quarterly earnings to fall 2 percent, according to Refinitiv data.
Still, on Monday, most S&P sectors rose. Only consumer staples, real estate and utilities shares, which tend to decline as 10-year Treasury yields rise, were in the red.
Auto shares rose after China's State Council said on Sunday that the country would continue to suspend additional tariffs on import of U.S. vehicles and auto parts after April 1.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) shares added 1.8 percent and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co shares gained 2.3 percent.
Chipmakers, which draw much of their revenue from China, also rose. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index advanced 2.5 percent.
Shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd jumped 8.4 percent, the most among S&P 500 companies, as March gambling revenue from the Chinese territory of Macau rose from the previous month.
 Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares tumbled 11.9 percent to end below their IPO price after brokerage Guggenheim Securities started coverage of the ride-hailing company's shares with a ""neutral"" rating. Lyft debuted on the Nasdaq on Friday.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.99-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 63 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 68 new highs and 28 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.11 billion shares, compared to the 7.47 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

The prosecutor said 18 months of the sentence should be suspended, and that Richard should be barred from working in the public service for five years.
Richard has denied the allegations, saying he was doing his job and only played a secondary role in the arbitration process in which Tapie was awarded 403 million euros ($452 million) in the state-funded settlement.
Tapie is locked in a fight over the sale of his stake in sportswear firm Adidas (DE:ADSGN) in 1993 to Credit Lyonnais, then government-owned, and the compensation he won over the transaction 15 years later. 
Richard is accused of complicity over the disputed payment. He was working as chief of staff to then-finance minister Christine Lagarde when it was made.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 03:02PM ET</span>","U.S. to probe thousands of fires connected to Kia, Hyundai vehicles","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. auto safety regulator said on Monday it will open an investigation into 3 million Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors Corp vehicles after reviewing reports of more than 3,000 fires that injured over 100 people.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the investigation is in response to a petition seeking a probe filed in June by the Center for Auto Safety. The auto safety agency since 2007 has been investigating some Hyundai and Kia vehicles for fire risks. The South Korean automakers have recalled more than 2.3 million vehicles since 2015 to address various engine fire risks.
The probe covers the 2011-2014 Kia Optima and Sorento; and 2010-2015 Kia Soul, along with the 2011-2014 Hyundai Sonata and Santa Fe.
Hyundai said in a statement it was cooperating and added it has been in ""frequent, open and transparent dialogue regarding non-collision engine fires.""
Kia said it will continue to work with NHTSA and ""openly shares information and data with NHTSA on all matters pertaining to vehicle safety.""
NHTSA said the decision to initiate the probe was based on its analysis of information received from multiple manufacturers, consumer complaints and other sources. The agency said prior Kia and Hyundai vehicle recalls covered by the probe are primarily related to engine fires the new probe ""is not limited to engine components and may cover additional vehicle systems or components."" 
Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said it was ""long past time for the full power of the federal government to be brought to bear to answer why so many thousands of Kia and Hyundai vehicles have been involved in non-crash fires.""
He added he hoped the probe will quickly lead to new recalls. ""The evidence is now clear — Hyundai and Kia should have acted to recall these vehicles far earlier,"" he said.
Last month, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said a group of U.S. states is investigating Hyundai and Kia for potential unfair and deceptive acts related to reports of hundreds of vehicle fires.
In November, Reuters reported federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Hyundai and Kia to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects had been conducted properly.
In January, the automakers agreed to offer software upgrades for 3.7 million vehicles not being recalled.
A South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to NHTSA, which has been probing the timeliness of three U.S. recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles.
In 2015, Hyundai recalled 470,000 U.S. Sonata sedans, saying engine failure would result in a vehicle stall, increasing the risk of a crash. At the time, Kia did not recall its vehicles, which share the same “Theta II” engines.

In March 2017, Hyundai expanded its original U.S. recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles with those Theta II engines, citing the same issue involving manufacturing debris. On the same day, Kia also recalled 618,000 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles, all of which use the same engine.

Hari Sankaran, the former chairman and managing director of IL&FS, was arrested for ""abusing his powers in IL&FS Financial Services Ltd through his fraudulent conduct"" and will be in SFIO's custody until April 4, the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
IL&FS, a major infrastructure financing and construction company, has a total debt of 910 billion rupees ($12.97 billion) and has been trying to sell its assets to repay debt after several defaults forced the government to overhaul its management.
Sankaran granted loans to entities, which were not creditworthy or have been declared non-performing assets, causing wrongful loss to the company and its creditors, the official added.
IL&FS could not be immediately reached for comment.
IL&FS Financial Services had borrowings of more than 170 billion rupees ($2.46 billion) from debt instruments, bank loans and other investment firms, the official said.
A third of the total outstanding loans by a unit of IL&FS to borrowers were either unsecured or had inadequate collateral, a Grant Thornton India audit of the firm reported last month. 

Bad loans at Indian banks reached a record $150 billion at the end of March, with state-run banks accounting for the lion's share. The huge pile of bad debt has hurt the bottom lines of state-run banks and hindered their ability to issue new loans.

40,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>","In North America’s Biggest Uber Holdout, It Pays to Know Chinese","(Bloomberg) -- The white BMW luxury sedan glides up to a Taiwanese noodle shop in a Vancouver suburb, hailed courtesy of a Chinese-language app. The eight-minute ride in its spotless leather interior is smooth, cheap -- and utterly illicit.
Welcome to Vancouver, one of Uber’s most obstinate holdouts -- the largest North American metro region without legal ride sharing, where underground services for Chinese speakers is thriving.
Fleets of vehicles -- often fancy ones, at that -- ferry passengers around the city and its suburbs. But to access them, you need to navigate a Chinese app and preferably speak Mandarin or Cantonese so the drivers don’t think you’re a cop.
“Our goal isn’t the Chinese market -- of course we’d rather have a larger market, all Canadians,"" says Daniel Xiao, finance director at Gokabu Group, whose ride-hailing platform Kabu claims to hold an estimated 90 percent share of the market and has an English service ready to go. Other services -- there have been as many as 18 at one point -- go by the names of Longmao and Udi Kuaiche.
British Columbia Premier John Horgan’s government passed legislation last fall that was supposed to pave the way for ride sharing this year -- seven years after Uber Technologies Inc. first tried to crack the Pacific Coast province. But the way the law is crafted, Uber fans -- and English speakers -- may have to wait longer for a broader rollout, if it ever happens at all.
Driver Cap
“We know that people are frustrated and have been waiting far too long,"" Transportation Minister Claire Trevena said, as she announced the ""milestone"" legislation.
Maddening may be a more apt description. The legislation could allow the provincial Passenger Transportation Board to cap the number of vehicles, restrict the areas in which they can operate, and set the rates they can charge. In other words, to regulate ride sharing so that it looks more like the dysfunctional taxi industry it already oversees.
At present, a cab taking a passenger from one Vancouver suburb to another can’t pick up a customer on the return trip unless it’s also licensed in the drop zone. Getting licensed across the region of 2.5 million people would mean getting scarce, costly permits from 21 different municipalities. Vancouver International Airport restricts which taxis can operate at the terminal, with its own permits starting at C$3,120 ($2,325) a year.
Taxi Nightmare
That balkanized governance structure has saddled metro Vancouver with a taxi nightmare. In summer months, when cruise ships dock at the harbor, flagging a cab downtown becomes next to impossible. Drivers facing little competition refuse rides that take them beyond their home zone or from customers wanting to pay by credit card. In early February, hundreds queued for cabs at the airport during a rare Vancouver snowstorm, including shivering children dressed in sandals after trips to warmer climes.
Two ride-sharing giants have already indicated they may just move on to more hospitable markets given the slew of regulations.
""We’ve never entered a market with all of those things in place,"" Joseph Okpaku,  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT).’s vice president of government relations, told lawmakers in the capital Victoria in January.
Uber, which is slated to join Lyft with an initial public offering this month, says the rules could ""prohibit ride sharing through regulations,"" Michael van Hemmen, Uber’s business manager for Western Canada, said in an email.
Thriving Business
Against that backdrop, Kabu and its Chinese-language competitors are thriving. Xiao says user demand has been growing on average 26 percent per month since Kabu started in 2016. Reams of data it collects reveal that the greatest demand is for short, last-mile journeys that patch the gaps in Vancouver’s spotty public transit network.
“This is a commentary on the fact that we have not been able to move fast enough,"" says Jas Johal, an opposition Liberal Party lawmaker on a ride-sharing committee. ""The market has moved ahead of governments.""
Regulators are taking some steps to crack down on illegal rides, issuing 43 violation tickets and 32 cease and desist orders as of the end of February, the ministry of transportation said in an email. Currently, drivers can face a C$5,000 fine per day for convicted penalties. The new legislation will raise the stakes significantly to C$100,000 a day, the ministry said.
Canada’s Competition Bureau has weighed in, telling the province to ""re-think provincial taxi regulations."" So has local billionaire Francesco Aquilini, owner of the Vancouver Canucks National Hockey League team, sparring on Twitter with the airport authority when it urged ""a level playing field for existing operators.""
""Saskatoon has fricking Uber....come on Vancouver,"" read a post on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group Bring Uber to Vancouver last month. Public opinion polls have consistently shown at least 60 percent support for ride sharing.
For a tourism and technology-driven city that aspires to be Silicon Valley North, the opposition to ride sharing can often be head scratching.
""I don’t support Uber at all,"" the mayor of Surrey, British Columbia, Doug McCallum, said in a live debate in October, as he campaigned against ride sharing. Surrey is a sprawling suburb that’s the heart of the powerful taxi-industry lobby. At its peak, a Vancouver taxi license was worth as much as C$1 million and drivers were mortgaging homes to purchase them.
In the meantime, the Chinese-language operators have stayed out of the debate and gotten on with business.
Kabu has signed on 1,800 drivers, averages 2,500 rides a day, and has rolled out food delivery services. It has loftier aspirations of ushering Canada into a cashless era in which users could use Kabu to pay bills, arrange document deliveries, buy tickets and more.
“We want to be the Alipay of Canada,"" says Gokabu co-founder Hill Huang. ""Car riding is only one part. If Uber can solve the problem, perfect.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Novartis AG must face a U.S. government lawsuit accusing it of paying millions of dollars in kickbacks to doctors so they would prescribe its drugs, after a federal judge ruled in a decision released on Monday that the government had offered evidence of a ""company-wide kickback scheme.""
U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan also rejected the Swiss drugmaker's bid to keep key government evidence out of the case, and ruled that the government does not have to prove a direct ""quid pro quo"" agreement between Novartis and doctors for the company to be liable.
The ruling means that, unless Novartis settles, the case is headed for trial.
""We are disappointed in today's decision and look forward to presenting our case at trial,"" Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said in an email. ""We continue to believe that the government has insufficient evidence to support its claims.""
The case began in 2011 as a whistleblower lawsuit filed by Oswald Bilotta, a former Novartis sales representative. Such lawsuits, brought under the federal False Claims Act, allow individuals to sue on behalf of the government, which may choose to intervene.
The U.S. government and the state of New York both intervened in the case in 2013, accusing Novartis of paying doctors kickbacks so they would prescribe several of its drugs, including hypertension drugs Lotrel and Valturna and diabetes drug Starlix.
Those kickbacks included speaking fees for doctors at ""sham"" educational events, the lawsuit said, with one doctor being paid to speak at his own office eight times. The company also treated doctors to lavish meals, including a $9,750 dinner for three at a Japanese restaurant, according to the lawsuit.
Government health insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid were billed millions of dollars from 2002 to 2011 for drugs prescribed by doctors who took kickbacks, the lawsuit said, violating the False Claims Act. The government is seeking damages of three times what it was billed for allegedly fraudulent claims.
Novartis has previously settled U.S. allegations that it used illegal methods to promote its medicines.
In 2010, it agreed to pay $422 million to settle various civil and criminal allegations, including claims of paying kickbacks to doctors. Novartis pleaded guilty to mislabeling one drug as part of that settlement, but otherwise did not admit wrongdoing.
In October 2015, Novartis agreed to pay $390 million to settle claims that it paid rebates to specialty pharmacies to push two of its drugs, without admitting wrongdoing.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Labor on Monday issued a proposal that would make it more difficult to prove companies are liable for the wage law violations of their contractors or franchisees, a top priority for business groups. 
If adopted, the rule would likely help fast-food companies and other franchisors who have been sued by workers in recent years for wage-law violations by franchisees.
The department in 2017 had already repudiated legal guidance issued by the Obama administration that had expanded the circumstances in which a company could be considered a so-called joint employer under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta in a statement said Monday's proposal would reduce litigation under the FLSA and provide clarity to businesses and courts. The FLSA mandates that workers be paid the minimum wage and overtime, among other requirements. 
Publication of the rule kicked off a 60-day public comment period.
Under the proposal, companies would be considered joint employers only if they hire, fire, and supervise employees, set their pay, and maintain employment records. That would likely exclude many franchisors and companies that hire contract labor.
The Obama administration's guidance included several other factors, such as the nature of the work being performed and whether workers were integral to a company's business. That definition of joint employment had rankled the business community, which said it threatened the franchise business model and would lead to a spike in lawsuits.
Matt Haller, vice president at the International Franchise Association, a trade group, said the Obama-era rule had led to frivolous lawsuits and changed the way franchisors interacted with franchisees.
“Through this proposal, the Department of Labor has the chance to undo one of the most harmful economic regulations from the past administration,"" he said.
The Obama-era regulation was not legally binding, but Monday's proposal would be if it is adopted. That would make it more difficult for future administrations to undo, but also open it up to legal challenges. 
The proposal comes as the National Labor Relations Board is moving to roll back a separate Obama-era standard for determining joint employment under federal labor law, which governs union organizing and workers' rights to advocate for better working conditions. Under a rule the NLRB proposed in September, companies would have to possess direct control over working conditions to be considered the joint employer of franchise or contract workers.

(Reuters) - Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd said on Monday that it was in talks with U.S. government authorities about whether it should continue to own popular gay dating app Grindr LLC. 
Reuters reported last week that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a U.S. government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security risks, had asked Kunlun to sell Grindr, spurred on by data privacy concerns.
""We are in talks with CFIUS at the moment. We have not reached any agreement with CFIUS as of the day of the announcement. We will disclose any future development,"" Kunlun said in a brief filing with the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission.
The development represents a rare high-profile example of CFIUS seeking to undo an acquisition that has already been completed. Kunlun took over Grindr through two separate deals between 2016 and 2018 without submitting the acquisition for CFIUS review, making it vulnerable to such an intervention, Reuters reported last week.
CFIUS has not disclosed its specific concerns. However, the United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the safety of personal data, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel.
Grindr collects personal information submitted by users, including location, messages, and in some cases even someone's HIV status, according to its privacy policy.
Kunlun said last August it was preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) of Grindr. 
As a result of CFIUS' intervention, Kunlun has shifted its focus to an auction process to sell Grindr outright, given that the IPO would have kept Grindr under Kunlun's control for longer, Reuters reported.
Kunlun's control of Grindr has fueled concerns among privacy advocates in the United States. U.S. Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to Grindr last year demanding answers about how the app would protect users' privacy under its Chinese owner.
Kunlun is one of China's largest mobile gaming companies. It was part of a buyout consortium that acquired Norwegian internet browser business Opera Ltd for $600 million in 2016.
Founded in 2008 by Tsinghua University graduate Zhou Yahui, Kunlun also owns Qudian Inc, a Chinese consumer credit provider, and Xianlai Huyu, a Chinese mobile gaming company.

Zhou has said that the overseas market is the root of Kunlun's business, accounting for 70 percent of Kunlun's revenue.

55,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 12:15PM ET</span>",UK watchdog to investigate handling of London Capital & Finance failure,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog will carry out an independent review of its handling of London Capital & Finance, which went into administration in January with losses of up to 237 million pounds from unregulated ""mini bond"" investments, it said on Monday.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said its board decided at a meeting last Thursday that the probe will also look at whether the existing regulatory system adequately protects retail buyers of mini-bonds, which raise funds for small businesses.
The FCA said its board had decided to ask the Treasury for an official direction to commission the review, to ensure it had a ""broad and comprehensive"" remit. 
Britain's finance ministry said it had agreed to direct the FCA to undertake an investigation into LC&F.
""The recent stories of those affected by the collapse of LC&F are incredibly concerning,"" said John Glen, Britain's financial services minister.
Smith & Williamson, appointed administrators for LC&F in January, said last week in a report that 11,500 bondholders were unlikely to get more than 20 percent of their 237 million pound investment back.
LC&F effectively ceased trading in December after the FCA intervened to direct the firm to withdraw its promotional material for mini bonds.
Staff were made redundant in February, leaving just 3.6 million pounds of cash in the bank.
""There are a number of highly suspicious transactions involving a small group of connected people which have led to large sums of the bondholders’ money ending up in their personal possession or control,"" the administrators' report said.
Nicky Morgan, chair of parliament's Treasury Select Committee, called last month for the FCA to consider if a statutory investigation was needed into possible regulatory failure.
The FCA said detailed terms of reference of the review and identity of the independent reviewer will be published when it is available.

Last week Britain's Serious Fraud Office opened its own investigation into LCF, saying it had arrested four people associated with the firm.

The Federal Aviation Administration said the root of the problem was caused by the program provided by Scottsdale, Arizona-based AeroData Inc that helps airlines measure and manage weight and balance.
The agency released a statement around 8.30 a.m. ET, saying the issue had been resolved and an FAA spokesman said it plans to look into the outage.
American Airlines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) had reported outages. United Airlines said it was unable to create paperwork for some time.

Other airlines also reported a series of delays. 
Southwest Airlines was the first carrier to report that the problem had been resolved and it would get travelers moving soon, but added that customers could expect flight delays.
A Southwest spokesman could not confirm how many flights were delayed, but said it was safe to say hundreds.
FlightAware, an airline tracking website, said Southwest had delayed 775 flights, or 18 percent of its U.S. flights on Monday.
American Airlines, JetBlue Airways Corp, United Airlines and other carriers later said the technical issue had been resolved. JetBlue added it was still dealing with residual delays, while United said about 150 flights were delayed.
Last week, several airlines had reported issues with Sabre Corp's flight reservation and booking system due to which passengers had difficulty accessing flight check-in systems.

59,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>",Ex-CEO tells Lynch trial HP did not need Autonomy at any cost,"By Georgina Prodhan and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard did not have to buy Britain's Autonomy to solve the U.S. company's other problems in 2011, its former chief executive told the $5 billion fraud trial of Mike Lynch.
Lynch is accused of fraudulently inflating the value of Autonomy, which HP bought for $11.1 billion and then wrote down by $8.8 billion a year later. He argues that HP itself, a ""vast but floundering company"", botched the acquisition.
Autonomy was a market leader in software for unstructured data, helping companies extract the meaning from emails, video or voice calls, which are hard to analyze in traditional ways.
And Leo Apotheker, architect of the deal and HP's CEO between November 2010 and September 2011, had sought to boost HP's languishing profitability by integrating its legacy computer and printer business with higher-margin software.
But the former CEO of Europe's leading business software group SAP resisted suggestions from Lynch's defense lawyer in London's High Court that the acquisition of Autonomy was central to a desperate strategy.
""Unstructured data was at the center of your plans,"" Robert Miles QC, acting for Lynch, told Apotheker, who was called as a witness in the case.
""No, that's not right, it was part of the plan,"" Apotheker said, adding that HP had considered buying either Autonomy or German group Software AG in the first half of 2011, but decided on the British firm because it would provide the ""technological uplift"" that HP wanted.
It was not clear cut, Apotheker said:
""Looking at financial markets, investors, I think they would have preferred Software AG,"" he said.
Apotheker who said in his witness statement that he had ""never told the due diligence team to prioritize due diligence of Autonomy's technology over its financials"", also rejected the idea that HP was in crisis.
""But it wasn't doing well. I was very unhappy with the results but that doesn't mean the company was about to go under.""
HP is suing Lynch, once hailed as Britain's answer to Bill Gates, along with his former finance chief Sushovan Hussain for more than $5 billion. Lynch also faces criminal fraud charges in the United States, which carry a maximum term of 20 years. Hussain has been convicted of fraud in a related U.S. case.
ONLY SOFTWARE
At the opening of the case last week, HP's lawyer Laurence Rabinowitz QC said the U.S. company believed it was buying a fast-growing software firm with no hardware business.
Apotheker recalled that Lynch told him Autonomy was a ""very focused"" pure software company when they first met in Palo Alton, California, in April 2011.
He said he understood that to mean Autonomy's strategy was driven by ""software and software only"".
HP argues that covertly selling hardware was one of the ways that Autonomy inflated its revenue, while Lynch's lawyers have said it was commercially justified. 
Apotheker was replaced by Meg Whitman, who planned to refocus the company on its core hardware strengths after an outcry from shareholders over the new strategy and a steep decline in HP's share price.
Hewlett Packard Company in 2015 split into two separate publicly traded companies - HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ). and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
Whitman is expected to be called as a witness later in the trial, while Lynch himself is expected to appear around July.

The case is expected to last until the end of the year.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) has agreed a 10-day extension of its deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with United States authorities over Iranian sanctions violations, suggesting the conclusion of a probe into its behavior may be near.
The bank said on Monday the short extension will run until April 10, implying it could soon reach a settlement with U.S. authorities over whether it continued to violate sanctions after 2007 when it said it would no longer do business with Iran.
""This brief extension will allow additional time to resolve the outstanding investigation into our historical U.S. sanctions compliance,"" a StanChart spokeswoman said.
The bank has already paid $667 million for sanctions violations prior to 2007, and has warned in its most recent annual report that resolving the U.S. probe could mean ""substantial monetary penalties.""
The lender said that the fresh agreement does not include the independent monitor installed in the bank and tasked with checking on its efforts to improve sanctions compliance, meaning the monitor's term ended on March 31.
StanChart has been subject to the DPA with the United States since 2012, when it promised to end dealings with clients linked to Iran and to improve its compliance systems to prevent such activity happening again.
The DPA, which carries the threat of a bigger penalty if Standard Chartered breaks the terms of the settlement, had been due to expire on March 31 after it was extended in 2014, 2017 and 2018.

67,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 10:18AM ET</span>","The biggest company you've never heard of is more profitable than Apple, Amazon, and Google combined","Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant blows the rest of the world out of the water with its gargantuan profits. 
Saudi Aramco reported $111.1 billion in net income last year,  according to Moody's, making it more profitable than Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet combined. It comes as the company  filed for its debut international bond on Monday, a $10 billion issuance following a doubling of its profits after oil prices rose last year.
For context, Apple's earnings shot up to $60 billion last year while Amazon brought in $10 billion in profits making Aramco's figures stratospheric in comparison. Similarly, oil majors  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) made profits of $20.8 billion and $17.5 billion in 2018, emphasising Aramco's sheer vastness. 
The company's credit rating, A1 from Moody's, is tied to that of Saudi Arabia given the huge intrinsic links between the two entities. 
""The company is wholly-owned by the state and is expected to remain largely under government ownership even after any potential IPO in the future,""  said Moody's. ""The oil sector also comprises a substantial portion of Saudi Arabia's GDP and dominates its exports.""
It's the first major opportunity for investors to scrutinize the offering of one of the world's largest energy companies given the usually secretive nature of Aramco's disclosures. It's part of a transparency push on behalf of Saudi Arabia as part of a will-they-won't-they over the company's IPO plans which it shelved last year. One of the main advantages of issuing the bond is to gain high ratings from the various credit agencies. (Aramco doesn't need the money, after all.)
Among the key risk factors purported by the company are environmental issues and other climate change-related challenges indicating a broad understanding of the manifold demand constraints which face the oil and gas industry. Saudi Aramco produced approximately one in every eight barrels of crude oil produced globally from 2016 to 2018, according to the prospectus. 
Oil prices were boosted last  year after Saudi led efforts at an OPEC+ meeting secured supply cuts in an attempt to improve languishing prices by taking approximately 1.2 million barrels a day out of the market. 
Saudi Arabia is attempting to transition its economy away from hydrocarbons in order to diversify its oil-heavy economy and attract new capital to the Kingdom. "

Here they are.,"Icelandic ultra-low-cost carrier Wow Air announced on Thursday that it has ceased operations. Reykjavik-based Wow Air suffered through a challenging 2018 which culminated with the airline slashing 111 jobs and cutting its fleet size by half. 
In the first nine months of 2018, the airline's losses more than doubled, to $33.6 million from $13.5 million in the same period in 2017, even as revenue surged by 31%, to $501 million.
Read more: Wow Air has shut down. Here's what went wrong, according to the company's CEO.
Still, the airline's sudden collapse took both its employees and passengers by surprise, stranding hundreds around the world. 
""My heart broke into 100 pieces this morning when I got the news,"" a Wow Air flight attendant told Business Insider on Thursday. ""I loved every single flight that I operated, even though it was sometimes a bit of a struggle waking up at 3 a.m. for a morning flight.""
After launching in 2012, Wow Air became known for its brightly painted purple planes, no-frills in-flight products, and low prices. In some cases, the airline offered one-way flights between the US and Europe for as little as $49.
Unfortunately, the carrier's decision to acquire wide-body Airbus A330-300 jetliners and a move away from its traditional ultra-low-cost business model proved to be a mistake, Wow Air founder and CEO Skuli Mogensen told Business Insider in January.

Sadly, the collapse of Wow Air is an old story we've heard before. In fact, no fewer than five European airlines have gone out of business since October. 
Here's a closer look at those five airlines. 
Primera Air was a subsidiary of Icelandic tourism company Primera Travel Group. Primera Air had been in the process of expanding into the low-cost inter trans-Atlantic airline with a fleet of Airbus A321neo aircraft. The carrier ceased operations on October 2, 2018. 
Cypress-based Cobalt Air was founded in late 2015 following the shutdown of the country's national airline Cypress Airways earlier that year. Unfortunately, the airline could not sustain its operation financially and shut down on October 17, 2018. 
Founded in 1978, Berlin-based Germania offered by charter and scheduled passenger service. The airline ceased operations on February 5, 2019, citing financial insolvency due to high fuel prices and the devaluation of the Euro against the US dollar.

ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB lacked effective internal controls over parts of its financial reporting at the end of last year, Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said, resulting in reduced bonuses for some of its executive committee members.
ABB, which two years ago suffered a separate $100 million blow in South Korea linked to financial controls weakness, is in the process of remedying the latest shortcomings, a spokesman said on Monday. They were discovered by KPMG as the audit firm scrutinized ABB's books for 2018. 
The spokesman declined to describe the weaknesses in detail, calling them ""certain IT failures"" in some North American and group applications. He also did not say how long the weaknesses existed. 
""These control failures did not lead to any financial misstatement and there was no need to restate numbers,"" ABB said in a statement.
""However, the controls failures could have led to a potential misstatement of the company's financial statements and are therefore called out as a material weakness.""
Among remedial plans for the 2018 weaknesses, ABB said it is boosting its risk-identification processes, training and trying to clearly communicate control responsibilities.
""We cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and expect to take, will be sufficient to address the deficiencies identified or ensure that our internal control over financial reporting is effective,"" ABB said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. 
BONUSES
The failures have had financial consequences for ABB executive committee members, the Zurich-based company said. 
Short-term incentives ""reflected, for some executives, the material weakness in controls"", ABB said, without specifying which top managers were affected. 
According to ABB's annual report, Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer's short-term compensation fell to 2.1 million Swiss francs ($2.1 million) in 2018 from 2.4 million francs a year earlier. His total pay package slipped about 8 percent to 8.5 million francs. 
Chief Financial Officer Timo Ihamuotila, who earned 3.5 million francs in 2018, saw his short-term compensation rise, while Americas boss Greg Scheu also saw an increase.
Three division leaders including Power Grids head Claudio Facchin saw their bonuses fall.
On average, ABB's executive committee (EC) members including Spiesshofer hit 85 percent of performance objectives, the 2018 annual report showed, well off the 95.4 percent average in 2017.
This is the latest instance of financial controls problems at ABB in recent years. In 2017, the maker of factory robots, circuit breakers and switchgear replaced senior management in South Korea after an executive disappeared with $100 million.

70,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 10:03AM ET</span>",Romania's Black Sea gas projects hanging by a thread,"By Luiza Ilie and Kirsti Knolle
BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's new energy regulations risk undermining plans by companies to develop big offshore gas projects in the Black Sea, putting billions of dollars of revenue at risk and squandering a chance to challenge Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) in the region.
Oil industry officials have warned the changes, which include a cap on some gas prices for local producers until 2022 and a 2 percent turnover tax on all energy firms bar state-owned coal-fired power plants, could slash investment plans.
OMV Petrom, which is developing a Romanian gas field with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), said key conditions for the project were still not in place while Black Sea Oil & Gas, controlled by private equity firm The  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), warned it could pull out of another project if the rules remain.
The European Commission also told Romania in March that gas export restrictions and regulated prices probably contravene EU rules and could be challenged by Brussels.
Most of the new measures, first announced in an emergency decree in December, were confirmed on Friday.
The government made a last-minute concession, eliminating a cap on gas prices for industrial consumers. That means producers only have to sell about a third of their output at a fixed price - to households and heating plants - rather than more than half.
But the concession was not enough to placate the companies, given that the turnover tax and new export restrictions approved last year remain in force, coupled with the risk the state could simply shift the goal posts again. 
Romania now risks delaying offshore gas projects and playing into the hands of Russia, which blocked Ukraine from exploring its Black Sea resources by occupying Crimea, analysts said. 
""Postponement doesn't benefit anyone, not the state, consumers, the economy, investors,"" said Razvan Nicolescu, executive lead advisor in Deloitte's energy and resources division in Bucharest. ""The only winner is Gazprom, the sole gas provider in the region.""
Romania's Black Sea gas has the potential to challenge Gazprom's dominant role in central and eastern Europe, diversify gas supplies and bring the Romanian government revenue of $26 billion by 2040, according to the consultancy.
Romania's offshore gas reserves are estimated at 200 billion cubic metres. Russia, meanwhile, has proven reserves of 35 trillion cubic metres, according to BP's statistical review. 
But while German consumption alone would empty the Romanian gas fields in two years, they could cover the combined 2017 demand of Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary and Moldova for more than six years.
""Any cubic metre of gas produced in Romania means one less cubic metre produced and sold by Russia. Access to markets and a market share as high as possible are very important economic stakes,"" said Nicolescu.
DEAL BREAKERS?
Several gas producers have spent upwards of a decade and billions of dollars preparing to tap Romania's Black Sea gas, but they were blindsided by the government decree. Lawmakers also approved export restrictions on offshore gas producers.
The ruling Social Democrats, gearing up for four elections this year and next, have said the gas price cap was designed to keep tariffs low for domestic users.
""As we have said before, we want to protect the household consumer,"" Energy Minister Anton Anton said on Friday.
Black Sea Oil & Gas (BSOG) decided earlier this year to press ahead with plans to extract an estimated 10 billion cubic metres of gas from shallow waters - given the amount of money it has already invested. 
But CEO Mark Beacom told Reuters the changes undermined the willingness of investors to move forward and were contrary to earlier assurances and legal provisions provided by the state.
""The new proposed measures taken by the government are not the best way to protect vulnerable consumers and are not sufficient to mitigate all the harmful measures recently put in place,"" he said on Monday.
Beacom said the entire emergency decree should be revoked, as well as additional fees and export restrictions brought in by parliament last year.
""There are always deal breakers in many different areas that could cause the investment to be terminated,"" he said in March. 
""We look forward to having a constructive engagement with the relevant authorities to seek resolution on these issues but do not exclude the possibility of pursuing a legal course of action should such engagement not result in a positive outcome.""
ExxonMobil and OMV Petrom, controlled by Austria's OMV, had planned to give the final green light for their deep water Neptun project last year, having spent nearly $2 billion to prepare for production at one of the EU's most significant natural gas deposits.
The project is now on hold.
OMV Petrom chief executive Christina Verchere said on Friday that removing the gas price cap for industrial customers answered some but not all of the industry's concerns and further talks were needed.
""Development of the Black Sea is a huge opportunity for both OMV Petrom and Romania, however, key requirements are currently not in place,"" she said. ""Consultation with the business environment, predictability and legislative and fiscal stability are the foundation for stimulating investment.""
ExxonMobil spokeswoman Julie King said the company was looking forward ""to continuing our discussions with the Romanian government, parliament and relevant institutions as project evaluations continue"".
SORE POINT
According to a study commissioned by Romanian oil producers (ROPEPCA), the measures would cost the government $540 million in taxes a year and slash investment and production.
While Romania is almost energy independent - it only gets 10 percent of its needs from Russia - gas imports in the first month of 2019 were roughly 60 percent higher than a year ago, data from gas pipeline operator Transgaz showed. 
""It is a negative message for the business sector in general, and the result is a feeling of uncertainty and distrust,"" ROPEPCA told Reuters.
""Major infrastructure and development projects, both on and offshore will most likely be suspended.""
In March, Transgaz shareholders rejected its 1.9 billion euro ($2.1 billion) investment program, which includes works on an EU-backed pipeline connecting Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria (BRUA) as well as a domestic pipeline to transport future offshore gas production. 
A sore point for gas producers is the obligation to sell gas at 68 lei ($16) per megawatt hour until Feb. 2022, about 15 percent lower than the estimated average market price. 
While only capping prices for some gas consumers takes some of the sting out of the measures, energy companies said enforcing it solely for producers but excluding distributors was discriminatory as they could pass on their costs to households.

""You can look after the vulnerable customer while at the same time not taking it at the cost of energy supply that you want on the market,"" OMV Petrom's Verchere has said.

72,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 09:31AM ET</span>",Ex-Barclays bankers jailed in Britain for rigging Euribor,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Two former  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bankers were sentenced on Monday to a total of nine years in jail after they were convicted by a London jury of conspiring to rig the Euribor global interest rate benchmark. 
Colin Bermingham, 62, a British former cash market expert and senior rate submitter, was sentenced to five years while Anglo-Italian Carlo Palombo, a 40-year-old former derivatives trader, received a four-year term.
A ""devastated"" Palombo and his family needed time to come to terms with the decision while considering any appeal, his lawyer John Hartley, of Hodge Jones & Allen, said in an email, while Bermingham's legal team had no immediate comment.
Bermingham and Palombo had both denied any wrongdoing. 
Sisse Bohart, a Danish junior Barclays trader and submitter, 41, was acquitted last week. The three had faced a re-trial after a previous jury was last year unable to reach a verdict.
The men were convicted by a jury at Southwark Crown Court in the sixth rate-rigging prosecution brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after a near seven year criminal investigation. It is the second re-trial after a hung jury, underlining the tricky nature of the financial fraud cases.
Prosecutors alleged the defendants conspired to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate) - a benchmark that helps determine rates on an estimated $150 trillion to $180 trillion of financial contracts and loans worldwide - between January 2005 and December 2009.
Eleven banks and brokerages have been fined a total of $9 billion to settle rate-rigging allegations in a global investigation. Barclays paid a $453 million penalty in 2012, sparking a backlash that forced out former CEO Bob Diamond, the British fraud inquiry and an overhaul of rate-setting rules. 
The sentences are a welcome fillip for the SFO, which has prosecuted five men and one woman over Euribor rigging to date and secured four convictions, including former  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) star trader Christian Bittar and one-time Barclays trader Phillipe Moryoussef in 2018.
""These men deliberately undermined the integrity of the financial system to line their pockets and advance the interests of their employers,"" said Lisa Osofsky, the head of the SFO.
""We are committed to tracking down and bringing to justice those who defraud others and abuse the system.""
JAILED
Bittar, one of the world's best-paid traders who earned more than 57 million pounds ($74 million) over the indictment period, was sentenced to five years and four months after pleading guilty. 
Moryoussef, tried in absentia after fleeing to France when Bittar's plea was made public, was handed an eight-year term. He remains in France.
Prosecutors said that traders cheated counterparties by requesting rates from colleagues that would benefit their trading positions - and that submitters then entered false or misleading numbers by nudging them up or down accordingly.
Brussels-based Euribor, like its Libor (London interbank offered rate) counterpart, is designed to reflect the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing over various periods to an administrator, who calculates an average.
Palombo, who joined the bank in his early twenties, said he had been trained by Moryoussef and had thought it ""perfectly legitimate practice"" to ask submitters for preferential rates until Barclays banned the practice in 2009 as a U.S. inquiry into rate-rigging allegations gathered steam.
Bermingham, who joined Barclays at 18, said he did not believe he had ever submitted a rate that was not justified by real flows of cash in the money market. He said he had not known that Moryoussef sometimes made rate requests on Bittar's behalf but would have reported this, because Deutsche Bank was a rival.

Nine men have been convicted and 10 acquitted in London over rate-rigging to date. The SFO says other lines of enquiry in the investigation remain open.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish bank Santander (MC:SAN) is expected to take a cautious stance on its British business in a strategy update on Wednesday, seeking to reassure investors after its aborted recruitment of former UBS banker Andrea Orcel as CEO.
Though Brexit uncertainty is casting a shadow over the bank's third-biggest market, the euro zone's largest lender by market value is benefiting from its global diversification and expects solid growth in Latin America, which accounts for 43 percent of its earnings.
The bank is expected to further protect its balance sheet in Britain, where higher costs have dented profitability, by setting stricter conditions for lending, a banking source said. 
Globally, Santander is likely to reinforce efficiency measures as part of its digital transformation to persuade investors that its latest profitability and capital targets can be maintained, analysts said.
The bank declined to comment before the event.
""This time the strategy update won't be as much about setting new targets but rather outlining how they will be met,"" a second banking source said, adding that cost-saving measures in mature European markets would also be key to offsetting a squeeze on lending from low interest rates.
In January Santander said it was aiming to lift its return on tangible equity (ROTE) -- a measure of profitability -- to 13-15 percent in the medium term from 11.7 percent in 2018.
It also set a mid-term core Tier 1 capital ratio target of 11-12 percent, against 11.3 percent in 2018 but below the average of more than 12.5 percent among its European peers.
CAPITAL CONCERNS
Analysts such as Jefferies still express some concern over the targets and capital adequacy.
The bank says it is comfortable with its capital buffers because of its lower-risk retail model. It recently said it was considering reintroducing a scrip dividend in 2019, which UBS estimates would add 25 basis points to its capital through 2021.
Continuing robust growth in lending volumes in Brazil, its biggest market, is expected to offset some pressure on pricing and financial margins, though other challenges remain. 
In the United States it is working to lift low profitability ratios of around 4 percent while savings from the integration of Banco Popular remain a focus in Spain, its second-biggest market. 
Investment firm Alantra expects Santander to deliver 600 million euros in cost cuts from the integration, compared with a target of 500 million euros as part of its attempt to improve its 10.8 percent underlying ROTE in Spain. 
The aborted hiring of Orcel is not on Wednesday's agenda, but investors are likely to question the management over Santander's decision in January to withdraw its job offer.
""Orcel was seen as a potential dealmaker. Now that he is not on board, the bank wants to be seen as a robust retail bank with Latin America as its core growth story,"" said Enrique Quemada, chief executive of investment bank ONEtoONE.

Santander has said it is sticking with Jose Antonio Alvarez as CEO, but investors say a replacement in the medium term is not to be ruled out.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson's baby shampoo samples failed quality tests conducted by the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan, according to a public notice from the state's drugs watchdog, findings that were rejected by the U.S. drugmaker.
This comes just a few months after Indian authorities launched an investigation into J&J's Baby Powder to see if it contains cancer-causing asbestos. J&J (NYSE:JNJ) said in late February it had resumed production of baby talc after government tests found no asbestos in the product.
The Rajasthan Drugs Control Organisation's notice dated March 5 said that the samples of J&J's baby shampoo taken from two batches had failed the quality test as they contained ""harmful ingredients"". It did not elaborate.
A J&J spokeswoman said that the results it received from the watchdog indicated that formaldehyde had been discovered in the samples. Formaldehyde, used in making building materials, is a known carcinogen.
""We do not accept the interim results given to us, which mentioned samples to 'contain harmful ingredients- identification positive for formaldehyde,'"" she told Reuters. 
""We unequivocally maintain that our products are safe and our assurance process is amongst the most rigorous in the world,"" the J&J spokeswoman said, adding that the company has contested the interim test results of the government analysis that were based on ""unknown and unspecified methods"".
The two batches of the baby shampoo tested are due to expire in September 2021 and were manufactured at the company's plant in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, according to the watchdog's notice.
""We have confirmed to the Indian authorities that we do not add formaldehyde as an ingredient in our shampoo nor does Johnson's baby shampoo contain any ingredient that can release formaldehyde over time,"" the company spokeswoman said. 
The Rajasthan Drugs Control Organisation and India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) were not immediately available to comment.
The federal regulator and its counterparts in Indian states launched an investigation into J&J's Baby Powder following a Reuters report in December that the firm knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos could be found in the product.
J&J has described the Reuters article as ""one-sided, false and inflammatory"".

J&J's Baby Powder is one of the most recognised foreign brands in the country. The company leads sales in the Indian baby and child toiletries market, according to market research provider Euromonitor.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks surged on Monday, extending gains from their best quarter since 2010, as strong Chinese factory activity data and signs of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations gave investors reason to cheer.
European stocks posted their best daily gains since mid-February, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index up 0.8 percent. Germany's trade-sensitive DAX outperformed with a 1 percent rise, helped by gains in auto maker stocks. (EU)
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.4 percent on the day. It had just posted its best quarter since 2010. S&P 500 futures were up about 0.7 percent, indicating a higher open on Wall Street. (N)
""Investors' sentiment seems to be tilting to the side of optimism at the beginning of the second quarter, following a robust manufacturing report from China,"" said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS.
China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) released on Sunday showed factory activity unexpectedly grew for the first time in four months in March. A private business survey, the Caixin/Markit PMI, released on Monday, also showed manufacturing.
""This news helps ease market participants' worries over the odds of an upcoming recession on a global scale, even though there are plenty of signs suggesting caution,"" Anthis said.
Recent signals from bond markets have alerted investors to the possibility of an slowdown in the global economy. Yields on short-dated government bonds in the United States had fallen below those of longer-dated bonds - a phenomenon known as yield curve inversion, which has preceded every major recession.
""We don't see recession in 2019 or early 2020 — we believe the Federal Reserve unambiguously ending three years of tightening, and other central banks’ dovish tilts, have extended the cycle,"" wrote Bob Michele, CIO and head of global fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in a note to clients. 
""We left the probability of recession unchanged at 10 percent, although even a minor policy error could raise that."" 
The 3-month-to-10-year yield spread has since pulled back from negative territory and stood around 3 basis points.
TRADE OPTIMISM
Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 1 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index rallied 2.6 percent.
Australian stocks climbed 0.6 percent, South Korea's KOSPI gained 1.3 percent and Japan's Nikkei advanced 1.4 percent.
""The rebound (in the Chinese data) likely reflects both the resumption of production after the Chinese New Year break and renewed stimulus and policy easing,"" UBS strategists wrote in a note to clients.
""We expect China to continue easing policy, with signs of economic stabilization backing our overweight position on offshore Chinese equities in our Asia portfolios.""
Stocks in Asia also took their cues from Wall Street, with the S&P 500 posting its best quarterly gain in a decade on Friday amid trade optimism.
The United States and China said they made progress in trade talks that concluded on Friday in Beijing. Washington called the negotiations ""candid and constructive"".
In currencies, the dollar fell 0.18 percent against a basket of currencies to 97.112.
Sterling was over half a percent higher to the dollar at $1.3104 on Monday as investors prepared for British parliament to vote on a series of Brexit options. Some hoped the current uncertainty will end in a softer Brexit than Prime Minister Theresa May's defeated withdrawal agreement. 
The Australian dollar advanced as much as 0.45 percent to $0.7127, also benefiting from the China data. The Aussie is sensitive to shifts in the economic outlook for China, the country's main trading partner. It last traded 0.25 percent higher at $0.7113. 
The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.1230.
Oil rose, building on its largest first-quarter gains in nearly a decade, as tight supply and positive signs for the global economy supported prices.

(Reuters) - Vegetarian burgers may finally be getting the recognition they need to go main stream. On Monday Burger King and Silicon Valley startup Impossible Foods announced the roll-out of the Impossible Whopper in 59 stores in and around St. Louis, Missouri.
To mark the launch on April Fool’s day, the burger giant released a hidden-camera-style promo video showing the serving of plant-based Whoppers instead of meat to customers who marvel that they cannot tell the difference.
""We wanted to make sure we had something that lived up to the expectations of the Whopper,"" said Burger King's North America president, Christopher Finazzo. ""We've done sort of a blind taste test with our franchisees, with people in the office, with my partners on the executive team, and virtually nobody can tell the difference.""
The Impossible Whopper comes at an extra cost - about a dollar more than the beef patty Whopper. But Finazzo said research shows consumers are willing to pay more for the plant-based burger.
Plant-based meat has been gaining popularity as more attention is focused on the environmental hazards of industrial ranching. Finazzo said his research shows customers mainly like it for the health benefits. The Impossible Burger patty has zero cholesterol.
Impossible Foods, based in Redwood City, California, launched its first faux meat patty over two years ago. A genetically modified yeast creates the key ingredient, called heme, which makes the patties appear to bleed and taste like real meat.
Burger King is not the first to serve up a no-meat burger. Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat in early January announced it was rolling out its plant-based burger at fast-food chain Carl's Jr. Beyond Meat counts actor Leonardo Di Caprio and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates as investors. 
Finazzo said Burger King also researched Beyond Meat, but decided that Impossible Food's offering was a better fit. ""Around the taste, around the brand recognition, around the price, all those things were important factors in choosing Impossible,"" he said 
Impossible Foods, which also counts Gates as an investor, tailored a patty specifically for the Whopper, according to Chief Executive Pat Brown. 

“We're now in well over 6,000 restaurants. If the Burger King launch is as successful as I expect it to be, and we go nationwide, that will add more than 7,000 restaurants that serve the Impossible Burger,” Brown said.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>","Avocado shortages, virgin margaritas: Border shutdown would hit American palates","By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's threat to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border would hit American consumers - in the gut. 
From the avocados on avocado toast, to the limes and tequila in margaritas, the United States is heavily reliant on Mexican imports of fruit, vegetables and alcohol to meet consumer demand. Nearly half of all imported U.S. vegetables and 40 percent of imported fruit are grown in Mexico, according to the latest data from the United States Department of Agriculture.
Americans would run out of avocados in three weeks if imports from Mexico were stopped, said Steve Barnard, president and chief executive of Mission Produce, the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world. 
""You couldn't pick a worse time of year because Mexico supplies virtually 100 percent of the avocados in the U.S. right now. California is just starting and they have a very small crop, but they're not relevant right now and won't be for another month or so,"" said Barnard. 
Trump said on Friday that there was a ""very good likelihood"" he would close the border this week if Mexico did not stop immigrants from reaching the United States. A complete shutdown would disrupt millions of legal border crossings in addition to asylum seekers, as well as billions of dollars in trade, about $137 billion of which is in food imports.
""When a border is closed or barriers to trade are put in place, I absolutely expect there would be an impact on consumers,"" said Monica Ganley, principal at Quarterra, a consultancy specializing in Latin American agricultural issues and trade.
""We're absolutely going to see higher prices. This is a very real and very relevant concern for American consumers.""
The effects of a shutdown would run both ways.
Mexico is the largest importer of U.S. exports of refined fuels like diesel and gasoline, some of which moves by rail. It is unclear if rail terminals would be affected by closures.
As changing palates have increased demand for fresh produce, and a greater variety of it, the United States has increasingly come to depend on Mexico to meet that need. Imports have nearly tripled since 1999. In that period, Mexico has gone from supplying less than a third of imported produce to 44 percent today. 
In addition to avocados, the majority of imported tomatoes, cucumbers, blackberries and raspberries come from Mexico. While there are other producers of these goods globally, opening those trade channels would take time, said Ganley.
Although the share prices of U.S. supermarket chains like Walmart (N:WMT) and Kroger (N:KR) did not appear affected by Friday's announcement, food companies would ultimately feel the pain. 
""We would be out of business for a while,"" said Barnard.

(Reuters) - European shares were on course for their biggest daily gain in eight weeks on Monday, as a surprise recovery in China's factory data and signs of progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks boosted investor sentiment on the first trading day of second quarter.
Following the best quarterly performance in four years, the pan-European index climbed 0.9 percent at 0922 GMT, with all major sectors higher. 
While gains spread across all regional bourses, Germany's trade-sensitive DAX outperformed with its 1.3 percent rise, helped by 3 percent jump in auto stocks which were set for their best daily surge since Jan. 4.
 Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) rose about 3 percent while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles gained 1.6 percent on a report that the two companies are exploring a partnership to share investments to build cars in Europe.
European chip stocks were another bright spot after better-than-expected results from Apple-supplier Foxconn Industrial. 
Shares in Dialog Semiconductor Plc, Infineon Technologies, Ams AG and Siltronic AG and STMicroelectronics N.V. rose between 3 percent and 5 percent.
The upbeat mood spilled over from Asian markets, after both official and private surveys showed factory activity in China unexpectedly grew for the first time in four months in March.
China's economic data comes on the heels of fresh concerns over a slowing world economy that resurfaced last month after the U.S. Federal Reserve abruptly ended its plans for policy tightening this year and signals from the bond market of an imminent recession.
""The economic growth in China will strengthen from here and that is the strongest signal which is driving the markets today,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets (UK) Ltd in London.
In contrast, markets seemed to shrug off a survey that found factories in the euro zone had their worst month in March for almost six years. Another survey showed Germany's Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing fell to an 80-month low reading of 44.1.
""The German number is nothing short of a disaster. We are talking of recession territory over here and this is a huge concern for the European Central Bank. But for the markets today, the focus is on China and the optimism around it,"" Aslam said. 
Adding to the buoyant mood, China said over the weekend that it would continue to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. vehicles and auto parts after April 1, the latest sign of optimism as the world's two largest economies work out a deal to end their trade dispute.
Swiss logistics group Panalpina jumped 14 percent on bowing to an increased 4.6 billion Swiss francs ($4.6 billion) bid from Danish rival DSV, ending a more than two-month takeover battle designed to build scale in the consolidating transport sector.
EasyJet slipped 7 percent, among the biggest decliners on the STOXX, after the British low-cost airline warned that demand and pricing were suffering from Brexit jitters and a weaker economic outlook.
Ryanair Holdings also shed over 3 percent.
London's FTSE 100 and the Dublin bourse, often seen as a barometer for Brexit sentiment, rose 0.7 percent each.
Britain's exit from the European Union was in disarray after a third defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May's divorce deal left her under pressure from rival factions to leave without a deal, go for an election or forge a much softer divorce.
Parliament will vote on different Brexit options on Monday and then May could try to bring her deal back to a vote in parliament one more time, possibly as early as Tuesday.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) says the balance of risks around Brexit outcomes is tilted toward a softer, longer departure from the European Union, after a May's withdrawal agreement was rejected for a third time.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has no immediate plans to allow Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft to operate in the kingdom, its transport minister said on Monday, as state airline flyadeal potentially reconsiders an order for the jets.
Boeing's top-selling MAX has been grounded globally since last month after two fatal crashes involving the same model in five months, the first in Indonesia in October and another on March 10 in Ethiopia.
""There were no 737 MAX flying in the kingdom at the time and there aren’t plans for them to be back in the near future,"" minister Nabeel al-Amudi told reporters at an aviation conference in Riyadh. 
Budget carrier flyadeal has said its waiting until investigations into the two crashes are completed before deciding if it proceeds with an order for 30 MAX jets.
The order, which includes purchasing operations for 20 more of the same aircraft, is worth $5.9 billion at list prices, according to Boeing.
Attention has focused on the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in at least one of the crashes. The system pushes the plane’s nose down if it believes it is ascending at too steep an angle.
Boeing last week said it had reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system.

Saudi Arabia will follow the global aviation industry in any recertification of the MAX, Amudi said.

The FT was one of the first newspapers to introduce a paywall, in 2002, charging online readers for news they had come to expect for free on the internet in a trend that challenged the business model of printed news media.
The New York Times followed in 2011 following years of debate and in November said it had more than 3 million paying digital-only subscribers and more than 4 million subscribers in total, including the print edition.
The FT's digital subscribers account for more than three-quarters of its circulation. The pink-paged print edition continues to be profitable, the FT said.
It established a metered access model in 2007, requiring users to register and charging them if they read more than a certain number per month, before switching to paid trials as its primary pay model in 2015, in which readers would get access to most FT content for a month for a small sum.
The FT's operating profit was 25 million pounds ($33 million) in 2018 and operating revenue was 383 million.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets have started the second quarter with a bang, in another emphatic reminder of how China’s economy seems to be more important than the domestic one.
At 04:15 AM ET (08:15 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was at 382.74, up 3.66 points, or 1.0%.
It’s no exaggeration to say that this is all due to news from China, where the private-sector Caixin Purchasing Managers’ Index leaped to its highest since August, suggesting that the worst of the global economic slowdown could be past.
By contrast, local PMIs have again disappointed, with flash readings in France, Germany and Italy all heading lower and falling short of expectations. The flash reading for the euro zone’s PMI fell unexpectectly to 47.5, still deep in contractionary territory.
No matter: if China is recovering, it will drag Europe with it. It’s no accident that the most export-sensitive of Europe’s markets, Gernamy, is leading the pack with a rise of nearly 1.4%, with the big auto names and other cyclicals such as Covestro (DE:1COV) and BASF (DE:BASFN) faring well. The Midcap DAX, made up largely of suppliers to the big names of German industry, is also up over 1%.
Elsewhere, the U.K. FTSE 100 is up 1.0%, while France’s CAC 40 is up 0.9%
On a quiet day for corporate news so far, the airlines are standing out, falling after a profit warning from EasyJet (LON:EZJ). The U.K.-based discounter said its net loss for the first half of its fiscal 2019 year widened sharply to 275 million pounds ($358 million) and said it expected only a modest improvement in the second half. Its shares fell over 7% in early trading in London, dragging down rivals Ryanair Holdings (LON:RYA) by 5% and Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) by 3%."

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose about 9 percent in the first quarter of 2019, its biggest quarterly gain since March 2012. Last month, the index rose 0.7 percent.
Ongoing negotiations between the United States and China drove expectations that the two countries are inching towards a deal to end a tariff war that had rattled the markets over the past year.
On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said that trade talks with China were going very well, but cautioned , he would not accept anything less than a ""great deal"", after the latest round of negotiations in Beijing. 
Asian shares were also lifted in the past month by the U.S. Federal Reserve's dovish shift, abandoning projections for any interest rate hikes this year after raising rates four times in 2018, and the European Central Bank's pushing back its policy tightening plan to 2020. 
In March, Indian equities led gains in the region with a 7.7 percent rise, followed by New Zealand and China. The rise in Indian equities' was their biggest monthly gain since March 2016. 
On the flip side, Sri lanka and Malaysia were the biggest losers, declining 4.45 percent and 3.75 percent respectively.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan revealed the name of its new imperial era on Monday, Internet users rushed to register domain names linked to the choice, ""Reiwa"", which also sparked a jump in name-related stocks. 
For weeks, anticipation had mounted over the new era name, or ""gengo,"" which is used on coins, calendars, newspapers and in official paperwork, and over time captures a national mood.
Traffic on Japan's largest registration site for website names surged tenfold after the news. The name, drawn from an ancient Japanese text, takes effect on May 1, when Crown Prince Naruhito becomes emperor.
""Most of our (Reiwa-related) domain names have been taken,"" said a spokeswoman for GMO Internet, which runs the website, onamae.com.
The rush of those trying to check the meaning and the correct way to write the name also disrupted some services at website alc.co.jp of language service provider Alc Press, a spokeswoman said. 
The first character of the name means ""good"" and ""beautiful"" as well as ""order"" or ""command"", while the second means ""peace"" or ""harmony"".
The announcement came a month early so government offices and companies can update computer software and make preparations to avoid glitches when the new era begins next month.
When the closely guarded secret was finally announced, investors spurred a ""Reiwa"" rise in some stocks.
Shares of book retailer Bunkyodo Group Holdings jumped as much as 29 percent on expectations that Japanese will buy copies of the Manyoshu anthology of poems that inspired the name. The stock closed up 4 percent. 
Companies with tenuous links to the new name also received a boost.
Advertising firm Ray Corp, whose name sounds like the first syllable of Reiwa, rose as much at 19 percent before closing up 7 percent. 
Daiwa Industries, known in Japanese as Daiwa Reiki Kogyo, rose 5 percent in heavy volume trade. 
Companies outside Japan also experienced the impact.
Western Australian real estate portal REIWA, which runs the website reiwa.com, said 70 percent of its internet traffic on Monday came from Japan. 

The surge could be an ""opportunity to entice migration and foreign investment back into our state,"" Chief Executive Neville Pozzi said in a statement.

After Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected by parliament for a third time last week there is pressure from rival factions for a no-deal exit, a much softer divorce or an election.
""Where the UK used to be beacon for stability, we are now becoming a laughing stock,"" Juergen Maier said in open letter to lawmakers published by website Politico. 
""It has been clear for weeks, that the only way that this will be resolved is through compromise between the government and parliament,"" Maier said, calling for a softer Brexit.
Maier said it was becoming hard for him to win support from his board for investment decisions as Britain heads toward a ""hugely damaging no-deal Brexit.""
""Enough is enough. We are all running out of patience. Make a decision and unite around a customs union compromise that delivers economic security and stability,"" he said. 

In year to September 2018, Siemens UK generated revenue of 5 billion pounds ($6.53 billion), the company's website said. At the end of September 2018, the company had 15,000 employees in Britain.

89,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 03:48AM ET</span>","EasyJet blames Brexit for weak outlook, shares fall 7 percent","(Reuters) - British low-cost carrier easyJet (LON:EZJ) warned on Monday that demand and pricing were suffering from Brexit jitters and a weaker economic outlook, sending shares in European airlines lower.
EasyJet said it was set to rack up a 275 million pounds ($359 million) loss for the first half of its financial year, in line with earlier guidance, while expecting revenue for the six months ended March to grow 7.3 percent to about 2.34 billion pounds.
However, revenue per seat at constant currency is expected to have declined by about 7.4 percent and the company said it was seeing weakness in ticket yields across Europe, in contrast to guidance last November. 
""For the second half, we are seeing softness in both the UK and Europe, which we believe comes from macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered questions surrounding Brexit,""  Easyjet  Chief Executive Officer Johan Lundgren said.
Shares in the company fell 7 percent in response, making them the biggest loser on London's blue chip index and dragging other European airlines lower. IAG (LON:ICAG), owner of British Airways, slipped 1.8 percent and Ryanair fell around 5 percent.
""The outlook is the challenge, with management having less confidence on the second half - the summer,"" Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said.
""Brexit uncertainty is the main issue, but management sees macro uncertainty beyond the UK too."" 
European airlines are battling over-capacity and high fuel costs. Iceland's WOW air was the latest budget airline casualty last Thursday, halting operations and cancelling all future flights after efforts to raise more funds failed.
Airline chiefs said last month that while carriers will be able to withstand the impact of Britain leaving the European Union, even without a deal, the lack of political progress is frustrating and has dampened consumer demand.
Britain and the EU have said that flights will continue, even in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit and Easyjet said it was sure that it would be flying as usual. 

EasyJet, which is the largest operator at Britain's second-biggest airport Gatwick, said costs were set to rise 18.8 percent, driven by fuel costs and its investment in capacity.

90,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 03:46AM ET</span>",Denmark's DSV to buy logistics company Panalpina in $4.6 billion deal,"By Teis Jensen and John Miller
COPENHAGEN/ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss logistics group Panalpina has bowed to an increased 4.6 billion Swiss francs ($4.6 billion) bid from Danish rival DSV, ending a more than two month takeover battle designed to build scale in the consolidating transport sector.
DSV, whose Chief Executive Jens Bjorn Andersen has been on the hunt for targets to broaden his company's global reach and help cut costs, said on Monday Panalpina had accepted an all-share offer of 2.375 DSV shares for each Panalpina share.
Shares in DSV rose 2.5 percent in early trade while Panalpina shares jumped 15 percent.
DSV's combination with Panalpina's air- and sea-freight operations will create the world's No. 4 freight-forwarding company, with only DHL Logistics, Kuehne & Nagel and DB Schenker now bigger. 
The 20 largest freight forwarders control just a third of the market, making the industry ripe for takeovers or partnerships as companies look for ways to improve profitability and take advantage of economies of scale.
The new bid gives an implied price of 195.8 Swiss francs for each Panalpina share, compared with DSV's Feb. 15 cash offer of 180 francs per share and an initial cash and shares offer then worth 170 francs made in January.
The bid ends a fight between Panalpina's shareholder and activist investors over the company's future.
The Ernst Goehner Foundation, which has 46 percent of Panalpina, had previously resisted pressure from 12.3 percent shareholder Cevian Capital as well as 9.9 percent owner Artisan Partners to sell the company to DSV. 
The Foundation and Cevian said they both backed the deal. 
""We welcome the agreement between Panalpina and DSV,"" Cevian co-founder Lars Forberg said in a statement. ""We believe the combination has great industrial logic and will create one of the best companies in the logistics industry."" 
Andersen said he believed DSV would be able to integrate Panalpina into DSV within two to three years and he felt confident that competition authorities would approve the deal.
He said he aimed to lift the profit margin of the combined company towards that of DSV but declined to give more specific guidance. DSV's earnings before interest and tax margin was almost 7 percent in 2018, while Panalpina's was around 2 percent, according to analysts at Sydbank.
DSV has previously managed to lift the margins of companies they have acquired, meaning shareholders will give DSV the benefit of the doubt, Sydbank Mikkel Emil Jensen analyst said. 

Andersen said DSV would call a shareholders' meeting to get their approval for the deal.

91,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 03:20AM ET</span>",DSV to Buy Panalpina in $4.6 Billion European Logistics Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- DSV A/S (CO:DSV) agreed to acquire Swiss rival  Panalpina Welttransport Holding  AG (SIX:PWTN) in a deal worth $4.6 billion that will create a European powerhouse in logistics and freight forwarding.
The board of directors of Panalpina, which had been fighting for its independence, recommended shareholders accept the mostly stock offer worth 196 Swiss francs a share, the companies said in an emailed statement on Monday.
The price represents a 43 percent premium from Jan. 15, the day before DSV’s initial proposal, and has the backing of investors holding 69.9 percent of registered shares including the Ernst Goehner Foundation, which owns 46 percent of Panalpina, according to the statement. Panalpina shares were indicated 16.6 percent higher in the pre-market.
The deal ends months of speculation about the future of Panalpina, which in mid-February announced talks with Agility for a logistics tie-up of its own in an effort to avoid being taken over by Denmark’s DSV. Panalpina minority shareholders, including Cevian Capital AB and Artisan Partners, went public with comments in favor of a DSV takeover, adding pressure on Panalpina’s management and the foundation. Both investors back the offer, the companies said Monday.
“We welcome the agreement between Panalpina and DSV,” Lars Forberg, managing partner at Cevian Capital, said in a separate statement. “We believe the combination has great industrial logic and will create one of the best companies in the logistics industry.”
DSV made a first unsolicited offer worth 17O Swiss francs a share before sweetening the bid to 180 Swiss francs per share, valuing the target at about 4.3 billion Swiss francs. After the deal, the Ernst Goehner foundation will become DSV’s top holder.
The takeover comes months after DSV walked away from another Swiss target, Ceva Logistics AG, after its offer worth $1.7 billion was rejected. DSV said at the time it would pursue other targets. Panalpina will help boost its air-cargo volumes and ocean-going containers operations, complementing the Danish group’s strength in road shipments.
The global freight-forwarding industry is coming under increasing pressure amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Leading players in the highly fragmented sector are also targeting bigger deals to tap new markets and add cutting edge processing systems to safeguard them from disruptive technology.

Sports Direct, which has a near 30 percent stake in Debenhams, did not say how many Debenhams shareholders were backing it or name any of them.
Last year Sports Direct bought department store chain House of Fraser out of administration and has been trying to wrest control of Debenhams for months.
Sports Direct said it has set up a template letter on its website to enable any shareholders in Debenhams to make their views known.
On Friday Debenhams secured 200 million pounds ($261.4 million) in new funds but warned shareholders still faced being wiped out unless Sports Direct gave its support.
Debenhams said Sports Direct needed to either make a firm offer for the group, underwrite a rights issue, or provide debt funding if it wanted to prevent Debenhams' ownership falling into the hands of lenders.

Sports Direct said last week it was considering a 61.4 million pound offer.

The deal, for the IFM subsidiary IFM Tre, could eventually reach nearly $1.6 billion, IFM said, should its portfolio meet certain milestones. IFM Tre has one molecule, IFM-2427, in an early Phase 1 trial, and a pair of less-developed assets. 
IFM, whose research head Martin Seidel spent more than a decade at Novartis before assuming R&D duties at IFM in 2017, focuses on immune system modulation. In buying three potential drugs, Novartis is hoping for agents to fight chronic inflammatory disorders like gout, atherosclerosis and fatty liver disease (NASH), as well as inflammatory bowel disease. 
""These programs complement the existing Novartis pipeline of anti-inflammatory medicines,"" said Novartis, adding studies have shown IFM Tre's molecules can selectively suppress disease-causing inflammation, while allowing the rest of the immune system to continue normal operations.

IFM Therapeutics is part of the portfolio of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Atlas Venture, whose other stakes include Intellia Therapeutics that is also working with Novartis. The IFM Tre deal is seen closing before July.

Moody’s rated the oil giant at A1, while Fitch assigned it A+, both with stable outlook. The state-owned company has the same rating as the sovereign from both Moody’s and Fitch.
Aramco has mandated banks to hold a roadshow for dollar-denominated notes from April 1, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company picked JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) and NCB Capital to manage the offering.
Investor meetings will be held in London, New York, Boston, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Los Angeles and Chicago.
Proceeds from the sale, which Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said in January could raise about $10 billion, will be used to help fund its purchase of a 70 percent stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp. The offering forces Aramco to disclose its accounts to investors for the first time since its nationalization about four decades ago. It’s also a precursor to even greater transparency required for its initial public offering, planned for 2021.
Fitch’s A+ rating for Aramco is one level below the AA- for both Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and  Total  SA (PA:TOTF).  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). has a top Aaa rating from Moody’s and the second-highest at AA+ from S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings.
The Saudi oil producer follows state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., which got a AA long-term credit rating at Fitch in February. Adnoc’s standalone rating was AA+, Fitch said.

Small caps also continued their strong run, with the ChiNext gauge jumping 3.1 percent, building on its world-beating 35-percent rally in the first quarter and close to erasing all of its loss from last year.
China’s manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 50.5 in March, the biggest increase since 2012 and beating economists’ estimates, according to data released Sunday. The mood was bolstered Monday morning as the Caixin manufacturing index also signaled expansion.
“The sharp rebound of PMI for medium and small enterprises show that supporting measures from the government such as VAT cut may start to take effect,” wrote Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. “Looking at the details from the PMI, the recovery is beyond the seasonal pattern.”
After a rout in 2018, Chinese equities are rebounding strongly this year and outrunning other markets as the government pledges to support growth and trade talks with the U.S. show signs of progress. China’s Vice Premier Liu He is due for talks in Washington from Wednesday following another round of negotiations in Beijing last week.

With markets already pricing in a U.S.-China trade deal, we need to see further improvement in the economic data for the rally to be sustained.”
The yuan rose 0.1 percent to 6.7054 per dollar, following its 0.4 percent advance on Friday, its biggest gain in a month. The yuan is one of the strongest currencies in Asia this year, rising 2.6 percent, just behind the Thai baht’s 2.7 percent rally.
Futures on 10-year Chinese government bonds fell 0.43 percent, the biggest intraday drop since Feb. 26, to 97.48. The yield on 10-year Chinese government bonds rose 5 basis points, the most since Dec. 13, to 3.12 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 1.7 percent, the most since Feb. 18. The gauge is up 20 percent from an Oct. 30 low, meaning it is in line to close in a bull market if it maintains its gains.
“China acted much earlier than policymakers in other major economies to announce stimulus policies and we’re starting to see some initial results now with March PMI returning to expansionary territory,” said Linus Yip, a strategist with First Shanghai Securities Ltd.

Beijing temporarily scrapped the 25 percent tariff imposed on vehicles as a tit-for-tat measure on Jan. 1, after the White House delayed a rise in tariffs on $200 billion of products that had been due that day. An end date for the extended suspension will be announced separately, the Ministry of Finance said.
The move seeks to “continue to create a good atmosphere for China-U.S. economic and trade talks” and is a “positive response” to the U.S. decision to delay tariff increases, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on Sunday. Vice Premier Liu He is due to return to Washington this week as negotiators finalize the details of an agreement text.
Chinese officials also pledged to tighten regulation on fentanyl on Monday, a promise Xi made to Trump at a December meeting in Argentina.

Japan Display, one of the world's top vendors of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels used in iPhones, has been battered by Apple's shifting fortunes. It has been particularly hurt by a slowdown in iPhone sales and a proliferation of new models that use newer, organic light-emitting displays (OLED).

It did not name the external investors, although two sources with direct knowledge of the matter had previously told Reuters it was looking to an investor group, led by China Silkroad Investment Capital, for a bailout.
The remainder of the financing would come through preferred shares to refinance existing debt held by its largest shareholder, the state-backed INCJ Ltd, Japan Display said in its statement.
Japan Display, formed in 2012 in a government-backedmerger of the ailing display units of Sony Corp (T:6758),Toshiba Corp and Hitachi Ltd, flagged its fifth straight year of net losses in February.

Shares of Japan Display rose as much as 16 percent in early trade on Monday and were up 13 percent at 78 yen as of 0211 GMT.

LONDON (Reuters) - This year's roaring rally in world equities ran into sand by the end of the quarter, with warning signs from bond markets, U-turns from central banks and persistent trade worries scattering consensus about what happens over the rest of 2019.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index has climbed 12.2 percent in the first three months of the year, its best quarter in four years, while the S&P 500 is on track for its biggest quarterly gain in nearly a decade.
A bounceback was expected after the historic rout in late 2018, but few investors predicted the size of the rebound or the scale of the about-turn by European and U.S. central banks on interest rates that helped fuel it.
The majority of the gains were logged in January - between 6 and 8 percent - as dovish comments from the Federal Reserve, economic stimulus in China and easing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington soothed worries about slowing economic growth.
In March, however, the pace slowed to 1 percent as euphoria over slower rate hikes turned to worries about what the uber-dovish Fed and ECB stance said about the world economy amid tepid U.S. and euro-zone growth.
Now few are taking a strong view.
""People are wondering if they've missed the rally and then they think it doesn't make sense to invest when the curve is inverted and the economy is slowing,"" said Willem Sels, chief market strategist at HSBC Private Banking.
He reckons global stocks have the potential to rise another 5 to 7 percent, with the inversion of the bond yield curve overdone.
""The next few weeks will be more volatile, people are going to be concerned until they see the data improve and Q1 earnings might not be very good so we're in a zone of higher volatility,"" he said.
A poll of investors across the globe in February revealed the wide dispersion of views about how equities will fare over the next 12 months, illustrating the lack of consensus across the market.
Take the estimates for the S&P 500: The highest called for the index to rise 25 percent, while the most bearish pegged the market falling by around 10 percent by mid-2020.
Europe displayed a similar disparity, with estimates ranging between a 15 percent rise and a plus-20 percent increase for the STOXX 600.
In the end, the median forecast for the pan-European STOXX 600 and FTSE 100 were level with the current markets, suggesting that gains across stocks have run their course.

Implied volatility in European and U.S. stock markets, often viewed as a gauge of fear, also plunged in the first quarter. The Wall Street fear gauge has more than halved to 13 points from the December peaks, while the same measure in Europe dropped to a third of its late-2018 highs.

YIELD CURVEBALL
Capping off a wild quarter were big gyrations in U.S. bond yields last week, which plunged investors deeper into confusion.
With 10-year U.S. bond yields below 3-month T-bill rates for the first time in more than a decade, recession fears were swirling.
But the 2- to 10-year yield curve steepened, offering conflicting signals that there was no cause for alarm.
After all, the world economy is actually chugging along at a decent clip, company earnings are still growing, albeit more slowly, and leading central banks are increasingly dovish.
While it might take months before the markets settle - and it's dependent on decent macroeconomic data - Wouter Sturkenboom, chief investment strategist for EMEA and APAC at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS), reckons the bond moves have been overplayed.
""We believe government bonds are overdoing it right now. That's a vote of no confidence in the Fed and its communication strategy. That's why we are not de-risking right now,"" he said.
(Graphic: U.S. yield curve inverts for first time since 2007 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UNVc1P)
To break stocks out of their lethargy, investors need some decent macroeconomic data and first-quarter earnings to restore battered confidence.
""We've gone a long way now toward pricing in the central banks, and for risk assets to push on into Q2 we are going to need growth to pick up the baton,"" said Paul O'Connor, head of Janus Henderson's UK-based multi-asset team.
""The way risk assets have begun to react to the yield curve is further confirmation that risk assets have probably extracted as much positivity as they can from lower yields."" 
But analysts have slashed their 2019 earnings forecasts to their lowest in three years, and most expect the coming earnings season to be weak.
Companies listed on the S&P 500 index are expected to report a 1.9 percent contraction in earnings in the first quarter, down from almost 17 percent growth in the fourth quarter and the worst performance in years, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv.
European STOXX 600-listed companies are expected to deliver 2.1-percent year-on-year earnings growth, the slowest since the third quarter of 2017.
After such a breathtaking run-up, Justin Onuekwusi, fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management, said he's not overly concerned that stocks are now taking a breather.
""We have had such a strong bounceback, but markets don't go in a straight line. It is inevitable you will get some kind of respite,"" he said.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component jumped 2% and 2.9% respectively by 10:35 PM ET (02:35 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 1.9%.
A pick up in China’s manufacturing activity was cited as the catalyst for the buying in Chinese stocks, as both the private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index and the official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) expanded unexpectedly in March.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) came in at 50.8 for March, higher than the expected 49.9.
On Sunday, the National Bureau of Statistics reported that the official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 50.5 in March from February’s three-year low of 49.2. It was the first expansion in four months.
A reading below 50 signals contraction, while a reading above that level indicates expansion.
On the Sino-U.S. trade front, discussions will continue when Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and his team head to Washington later this week, days after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer travelled to Beijing.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.1% even after a quarterly Tankan survey released by the Bank of Japan showed sentiment among Japan’s large manufacturers dropped to 12 in March from 19 in December.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier  Japan Display Inc  (T:6740) surged as much as 12% on reports that the company might soon reach a financing agreement worth 60 to 80 billion yen ($540 to $720 million).
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 1.2%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 traded 0.7% higher. The reading of the country’s business confidence fell to zero in March from 2 the previous month, a National Australia Bank Ltd. report showed Monday."
104,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 31, 2019 09:30PM ET</span>",Why Stocks May Be Able to Look Past the Big Bond-Volatility Jump,"(Bloomberg) -- Tumbling bond yields since the Federal Reserve’s dovish March statement may not necessarily suggest the growth outlook is so bad that equities need to fall in sympathy.
That’s one potential interpretation of the disconnect between the surge in volatility in U.S. Treasuries the past two weeks and the relatively subdued fluctuations in stocks. Sundial Capital Research Inc. looked at what’s happened historically when volatility in Treasuries hit a 100-day low -- as occurred before the pivotal Fed meeting on March 20 -- then surged by at least 25 percent while outpacing any spike in equity fluctuations.
The bottom line: equities don’t always follow with turmoil of their own. Three times since 1990, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, mostly rose over the next month, and three times it fell, Jason Goepfert, president and founder of Sundial, wrote in a March 28 note. “The risk/reward was about even.”
The analysis also showed that the Merrill Option Volatility Estimate Index, a gauge of swings in Treasury prices, consistently declined after those episodes -- “usually right away.”
“A common belief is that bond investors are smarter than stock investors. We’ve looked at that idea a bunch of ways in the past, with the conclusion that it’s kinda-sorta true,” Goepfert wrote. “But it’s not consistent enough to automatically assume that the bond market suddenly knows something that stock investors don’t.”

107,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>","Nippon Steel to bolster overseas business, focus on India","By Yuka Obayashi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nippon Steel Corp, is set to bolster overseas operations, especially in fast-growing India, to bypass growing nationalism and capitalize on growth abroad as it faces shrinking demand at home.
""India is the fastest-growing market in the world and our investment on Essar's operations will be our key project for this year,"" said Nippon Steel's new president, Eiji Hashimoto.
Creditors of Essar Steel India approved a joint offer by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for the debt-laden asset in October, and the two have drawn up plans to double output of the unit in coming years.
""It's a big investment, but this deal was a bargain,"" Hashimoto told reporters in March. The deal also gives Nippon Steel access to a country that is difficult for foreign companies to enter amid a ""Make in India"" policy and that has often implemented safeguard duties on steel imports.
From April 1 this year, the 63-year-old Hashimoto - with extensive overseas experience - took the helm of the world's third-biggest steelmaker, which changed its name from Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp.
""The change reflects our commitment to growing globally and winning global competition as a Japan-born company,"" he said, adding that it wants to regain and maintain it previous No.1 status by market capitalization.
Nippon Steel was intermittently the world's No.1 by market cap between 2013 and 2016, but its market cap now stand at $16.8 billion, behind peers Baoshan Iron & Steel at $23.4 billion, ArcelorMittal at $20.3 billion, Posco at $19.4 billion and  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE) at $17.5 billion, according to data on Refinitiv Eikon.
(For a graphic on 'Market cap of major steel producers' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2VagS8s)
The 69-year-old steel company is also feeling threatened by Chinese rivals as they improve and upgrade their technology.
""China, which makes half of global steel, is a big threat. We need to keep improving our products and cost competitiveness,"" he said.
Nippon Steel has aggressively invested overseas in the past several years, including its 2018 acquisition of Sweden's Ovako, which makes speciality steel used in industries.
Some analysts say, though, the more urgent challenge for Nippon Steel is to fix problems at its domestic plants.
""Production overhaul is more pressing issue,"" said Yuji Matsumoto, an analyst at Nomura Securities.
In February, the steelmaker cut its annual profit forecast for the year ending on March 31 by 6 percent, as technical troubles at its mills reduced its crude steel output.
Hashimoto said aging facilities and a lack of skilled labor were behind the problems and one of his priorities is to tackle these issues.
""We need to raise our production capability as stable output is our base for global competition and higher profits.""
Japanese steelmakers are enjoying solid domestic demand from automakers and the construction sector, which is busy with projects for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but natural disasters and a series of glitches have prevented them from producing as much steel as they had planned.

Jet has delayed payments to pilots, suppliers and lessors for months and defaulted on loans after racking up more than $1 billion in debt. The airline was bailed out on Monday by state-run banks, which have temporarily taken a majority stake in the company and given it a new loan of $218 million.
The National Aviators Guild, the union of Jet pilots, had planned to go on strike from April 1 because of non-payment of salaries. Jet on Saturday said it will pay December salaries to pilots and aircraft maintenance engineers but for now cannot pay more recent overdue wages.
The pilots' union has decided to give Jet's new interim management until April 14 to clear salary dues ""in conjunction with interim funding"", and deferred the plans of a strike until then, the National Aviators Guild said in a statement to its members, which was seen by Reuters.

Once India's leading full service carrier, Jet struggled to compete with low-cost carriers in recent years. In the past few weeks, its chairman stepped down from the airline's board and lenders stepped in to rescue the airline from the brink of bankruptcy.

Sunday's blast involved a container of scrap metal that exploded in the outdoor yard of a metal-molding plant in a bonded area in the city of Kunshan, causing the plant to catch fire, the local government said on its official Weibo account.
""The cause of the incident is being investigated,"" it said of the blast that killed seven people and injured five others, one of whom was severely hurt.
Plant owner Kunshan Waffer Technology Corp Ltd, a Taiwan-based maker of magnesium alloy injection molding products and aluminum alloy die castings, was not immediately available for comment. 
The company was fined last May by the Kunshan environmental protection bureau for violating water pollution rules, according to state-owned newspaper the Beijing News. 
Kunshan, about 70 km (43 miles) west of Shanghai, is home to more than 1,000 technology companies and manufacturers, including many Taiwanese firms.
Sunday's incident follows a deadly blast on March 21 at a chemical park in the city of Yancheng, also in Jiangsu province, that killed 78 people and focused attention on safety at small chemical firms.
Beijing said last week it will launch a month-long, nationwide inspection campaign into hazardous chemicals, mines, transportation and fire safety, adding that authorities needed to absorb lessons from the Yancheng disaster.
The country has a history of major work safety accidents which often trigger inspection campaigns aimed at rooting out violations and punishing officials for cutting corners or shirking their supervisory duties.

China has clamped down on scrap metal imports as part of an environmental campaign against ""foreign garbage"", tightening supply sources for metal producers, as it aims to cut solid waste imports by the end of 2020.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian automaker CAOA has signed a confidentiality agreement to negotiate a potential purchase of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's plant in the industrial city of Sao Bernardo do Campo, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
Ford in February announced it would shut down the plant, its oldest one in the country, amid a global restructuring plan, costing 3,000 jobs. 
The announcement triggered a campaign led by Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria to find a buyer for the space. 
Reuters reported CAOA's interest in the factory last month, but at the time there were up to three different companies interested in buying it up.
Ford declined to comment on the confidentiality agreement or whether CAOA had been the one to sign it. CAOA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Negotiations are not final, but it is a sign that the two companies are closer to reaching a deal, the source said. 
Brazil has long been South America's automaking hub and has led many brand name global carmakers to set up shop here. But CAOA is the rare company that is actually domestically owned. It currently produces cars for Hyundai and owns a 50 percent stake in China's Chery operation in Brazil, which led to the rebranding of the cars as CAOA Chery. 

It also has a close relationship with Ford as its single largest distributor in Brazil.

The bank said the ECB wanted to give the three administrators enough time to complete actions needed for Carige to comply with capital requirements in a sustainable manner.
The ECB has also extended the mandate of a three-member supervisory committee, the bank said.
Carige was placed under special administration at the start of the year after its top investor in December blocked a planned capital raising, derailing a rescue plan financed by the industry.
The bank has said it needs to fill a 630 million euro ($707 million) capital shortfall and the temporary administrators are seeking offers from potential buyers by mid-April.
Sources have told Reuters that Minnesota-based Varde Partners and a specialist fund affiliated with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) plan to submit bids.

No final decision on submitting bids has yet been taken, one source said. A second source said the tight April deadline made things difficult.
Under emergency measures approved in January following the ECB's move, the Italian government stands ready to inject up to 1 billion euros in capital into Carige by end-September should a private solution fail to come through.

118,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2019 07:30AM ET</span>",Russia's Inter RAO says seeks gas turbines deal with GE by October,"KRASNOYARSK, Russia (Reuters) - The chief executive of Russia's Inter RAO said on Saturday the energy holding hoped to reach a deal with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co by October to produce powerful gas turbines in Russia, either as a joint venture or by buying a license from GE.
Russia, which does not currently produce mid- or high-power gas-fired power turbines, recently launched a 1.9 trillion rouble ($29 billion) program to modernize a quarter of its power generation, or 41 gigawatt of coal- and gas-based plants.
It is seen as a rare opportunity for Western producers amid falling global demand for gas turbines in recent years, but Moscow has said investors must only use fully localised -- domestically produced -- equipment as part of a local content push.
Inter RAO CEO Boris Kovalchuk said the modernization program would open a large market for GE for 10 years.
""We hope to reach all the agreements with them within half a year,"" Kovalchuk told reporters during a conference in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk.
A plant jointly owned by Inter RAO, GE and Russian state conglomerate Rostec produces 77-megawatt turbines in Russia's central region of Yaroslavl.
The ongoing talks between GE and Inter RAO are for the local production of 185-195 megawatt turbines. Inter RAO may purchase Rostec's stake in the plant as part of the deal with GE, Kovalchuk added.
A joint venture between Siemens and Russian firm Power Machines is already producing turbines in Russia. Siemens, which owns a 65-percent stake in the venture, has pledged to raise the level of localization in the production process.
Russian state-controlled firms -- Rostec, Rosnano and Inter RAO -- have been trying to create their own gas turbine production but their prototype project failed testing, sources, familiar with the matter, told Reuters a year ago.
Kovalchuk said on Saturday that the project was continuing, and that Inter RAO had passed the second turbine to the project's operator for improvement.

119,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2019 04:00AM ET</span>",U.S. investors seek comfort in flood of data,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street will be watching next week's economic data with a laser focus after a dismal February jobs report and recessionary warning signals from U.S. Treasury yields.
After the longest U.S. government shutdown on record, bad weather and a late 2018 equities sell-off muddied market participants' view on the U.S. economy in recent months, they are hoping for a clearer view from upcoming data. 
Investors have been anxious for reassurance since U.S. Treasury 10-year note yields last Friday fell below three-month Treasury bill yields for the first time since 2007. 
The S&P fell almost 2 percent that day as yield curve inversions are widely viewed as recessionary indicators and this one occurred two days after the U.S. Federal Reserve pulled back on expected rate hikes amid signs of slowing economic growth. 
""Investors are going to be hyper-sensitive to data,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. ""The yield curve inversion is the manifestation of investors' fears that the U.S. is getting caught up in a global slowdown.""
Many investors say they do not expect a U.S. recession any time soon. But they are seeking confirmation for this optimism in next week's data, which includes retail sales, manufacturing activity, durable goods orders and non-farm payrolls.
Reports that meet or beat expectations ""would suggest the soft patch we entered the year with is temporary"" and would confirm economic projections for 2019, said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Troy, Michigan.
February's U.S. retail sales data, due on Monday, and the March jobs report, scheduled for Friday, may be the most closely watched indicators as economists want reassurance on the spending power and confidence of U.S. consumers, which represent about 70 percent of the U.S. economy.
U.S. non-farm payroll growth almost stalled in February, with only 20,000 jobs created. Economists polled by Reuters last expected an average of 170,000 new jobs for March. 
January retail sales rose a modest 0.2 percent after a December decline, but were not seen as strong enough to alter slowing U.S. economic momentum. Economists, on average, expect a February increase of 0.3 percent. 
""If we were to witness a faltering of the U.S consumer, that would be very difficult for markets, which are relying on the U.S. consumer to propel the cycle through at least another year,"" said Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife in Toronto.
Graphic: Jobs rebound sharply in month following last two slowdowns - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HNQePZ 
But Donald expects a rebound in both retail sales and jobs, since the last reports were weakened by the December-January government shutdown. She will also watch durable goods data, due on Tuesday, for a view on corporate capital spending. 
""I have less conviction capex will take off markedly, but if we do see an improvement, that would be a substantial surprise,"" said Donald.
Strong capex would also surprise TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist JJ Kinahan, who says companies have stalled spending as they await the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks.
Kinahan says U.S.-China tensions could mute market reactions to data ""unless it's so far off to the upside or the downside."" The two countries are due to negotiate in Washington, D.C., next week after what Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said were ""constructive"" talks in Beijing this week.
Options contracts on the S&P 500 Index and its tracking fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (AX:SPY), show a modest uptick in the volatility priced into contracts expiring next Friday, compared with other near-term expirations. 
“We should expect more volatile days,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “Probably the job numbers will be the biggest focus, partly because of February’s miss and partly due to the overall concerns about slower growth.""
Manufacturing data will also be under close scrutiny on Monday after weak U.S. and German March data last Friday, according to Cresset's Ablin. 

While Ameriprise's Price is expecting solid data, he cautions: ""The market has more downside risk than upside risk primarily because of the yield inversion, the concern over the tone of economic data over the past few months, not just in the United States, but around the world.""

120,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 30, 2019 03:24AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Jury Still out on China Rebound?
The latest China Beige Book report suggests there's plenty of fight left in Beijing's economy as growth rebounded in the first quarter. But it's not the good kind of growth, raising fears the world's second-largest economy will resume its drift lower in the months to come.
China mounted ""an unmistakable first-quarter recovery,"" driven by a credit binge, according to China Beige Book (CBB), a quarterly review of the economy based on a survey of more than 3,300 Chinese businesses.
Beijing appears willing to sacrifice its pledge to wean itself off government credit in a bid to stop its economic stall.
China's addiction to credit has been well documented over the years, but Leland Miller, president of China Beige Book, said Beijing's latest credit binge was coupled with an increase, rather than a decrease, in borrowing costs, casting doubt on the sustainability of the rebound.
The report also noted that corporate borrowing reached the highest point since the middle of 2013, with each sector and region of China reporting a rise in credit costs for the quarter compared with the prior one.
China's Premier Li Keqiang also talked up the rebound in economic growth earlier this week, saying that changes in the Chinese economy exceeded expectations in March.
""Fixed asset investment has rebounded steadily, consumer confidence index, manufacturing new orders index went up significantly, and capital market transactions were active,” Li said.
Still, there are many who question the accuracy of China's data.
China's statistics bureau has attempted to reassure market participants that it has no need to artificially inflate data as the government wants quality growth, not rapid expansion.
When asked if he believed the numbers coming out of China, former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein famously once said: “Do I believe the numbers? I believe there are numbers.""
But given the importance of China, which accounts for about a third of global growth, market participants appear willing to give the numbers the benefit of the doubt.
""There are signs that China is now pursuing policies that should allow economic growth to stabilize, but we expect only stabilization rather than a large stimulus given low unemployment, record-high leverage and a lack of term limits for President Xi,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note to clients.
2. Playing Polo Pays Off
There were a lot retail stories in the market this week, from Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) soaring after being challenged for board seats by an activist investor to  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) hitting all-time highs on quarterly results.
What some may have missed is Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), which not only got a big vote of confidence, but has become one of the darling stocks of the year.
On Wednesday,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) upgraded the fashion company’s stock to outperform from market perform, with a price target of $150.
Wells Fargo analyst Ike Bochurow said the maker of the iconic Polo clothing can expect China, Europe and global e-commerce to drive top-line growth, which will improve valuation.
The stock is a “rare standout” in apparel, Bochurow said.
That endorsement on valuation looks especially strong considering shares of Ralph Lauren, rather stealthily, have risen more than 25% year to date.
That’s nearly twice the performance of the S&P 500, up about 13%, its best quarter since the third quarter of 2009 when it rose nearly 15%.
Ralph Lauren also beat the gains of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT), which is up less than 10%.
3. The Present Isn’t Looking as Good
Things ain’t what they used to be. In fact, things right now look a lot worse than they did just a month ago.
That’s the general consensus of consumers surveyed this week by the Conference Board.
The headline of the Conference Board’s monthly report is its consumer confidence index (which fell unexpectedly in its latest measure issued Tuesday). But it provides a host of other measures, including the present situation index.
In March the present situation index posted the biggest drop since Lehman Bros. collapsed in 2008.
The index, which is based on consumers’ assessments of current business and labor market conditions, sank 12.2 points, to 160.6 this month from 172.8 in February.
The present situation index was 61.1 for September 2008. Lehman filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15. By October, the present situation index had tumbled 17.6 to 43.5.
The good news for bulls is that the main consumer confidence index stands about 100 points higher than its recent nadir hit shortly after Lehman’s collapse.

""This will impact the lines in May, but, now that the decision has been made, we can construct our schedule without those flights well in advance in hopes to minimize the daily disruptions,"" the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association and the company said in the joint memorandum.

Boeing's top-selling 737 MAX jetliner has been grounded in the wake of two deadly crashes involving that model in five months, one in Indonesia last October and another on March 10 in Ethiopia.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 05:39PM ET</span>",Honda says 16th U.S. death confirmed in air bag rupture,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Friday it had confirmed a 16th U.S. death has been tied to a faulty Takata air bag inflator.
The Japanese automaker said that after a joint inspection Friday with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration it had confirmed a faulty air bag inflator was to blame for a June 2018 death of a driver after the crash of a 2002 Honda Civic in Buckeye, Arizona.
The defect, which leads in rare instances to air bag inflators rupturing and sending metal fragments flying, has prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history and is tied to 14 U.S. deaths in Honda vehicles and two in Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co vehicles since 2009.
The most recent confirmed death in the United States was the July 2017 death of a 34-year-old Florida woman.
Another seven deaths have been confirmed in Honda vehicles with faulty Takata air bag inflators in Malaysia, while a crash death in Australia in a Honda is still under investigation.
More than 290 injuries worldwide have been linked to Takata inflators that could explode. In total, 19 automakers are recalling more than 100 million potentially faulty inflators worldwide.
To date, 56 million inflators have been recalled in the United States in 41.6 million vehicles. Takata, which pleaded guilty to a felony charge of wire fraud to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation, filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2017.
In the most recent fatal crash death, Honda said the Civic had been under recall since December 2014 and at least 12 recall notices were sent to prior registered owners, but the recall repairs were not completed.
The driver killed had purchased the Civic less than three months before the crash. Honda said it was unaware of the ownership change and was unable to send recall notices to the latest owner.

Earlier this month, Honda said it would recall another 1.2 million Honda and Acura vehicles in North America to replace defective Takata airbags on the driver's side. The company became aware of the issue after a Honda Odyssey crash, where the front airbag deployed and injured the driver's arm.

123,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 05:27PM ET</span>","Lyft shares soar on Nasdaq debut, setting stage for Uber","By Heather Somerville and Joshua Franklin
LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc's shares rose as much as 23 percent in their market debut on Friday, amid strong investor demand for the ride-hailing service that bodes well for larger rival Uber Technologies Inc.
Lyft's IPO, which is the year's biggest thus far, sets the stage for other Silicon Valley unicorns seeking to debut in the stock market this year, including Pinterest Inc, Postmates Inc and Slack Technologies Inc.
The success of the IPO came despite Lyft's steep loses, criticism of its dual-class share structure, and some concerns over its strategy for autonomous driving and new laws aimed at increasing driver pay.
Public market investors, keen on Lyft's revenue growth and after enduring a long stretch with few IPOs from highly valued tech companies, piled into the offering. 
""There's money that wants to be invested into tech. This is a new area and people are definitely interested in exploring it,"" said Catherine McCarthy, an Allianz (DE:ALVG) research analyst. 
On Thursday, Lyft priced 32.5 million shares, slightly more than it was offering originally, at $72, the top of its already elevated $70-$72 per share target range, raising $2.34 billion in its initial public offering.
The stock opened at $87.24 but later pared gains to close up 8.7 percent at $78.29, giving Lyft a market capitalization of around $22.2 billion.
Lyft's offering ended up 20 times oversubscribed, similar to other high-profile IPOs, with more than 500 orders from institutional investors such as mutual funds, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Despite the optimism, there are also mounting concerns that these tech IPOs may be coming at the peak of the market, when the benchmark S&P 500 Index has risen more than 200 percent since 2008.
LOSS-MAKING 'UNICORNS'
Lyft's 2018 loss widened to $911 million from $688 million in 2017, despite revenue doubling in 2018 to $2.16 billion. The company has not laid out a timeline for when it will turn a profit. 
As a result, the IPOs of Lyft and other loss-making unicorns present a predicament for investors sitting on the fence - they do not want to miss out on popular companies with fast growth, but must weigh the risks of businesses with unproven economics.
""Every portfolio manager is going to have to make a decision in the next 12 to 18 months about these new IPOs. It's a growing part of the market,"" said JMP Securities President Mark Lehmann.
Uber, which is also loss-making, would be valued at about $128 billion at its IPO if awarded the same multiple as Lyft. Uber is planning to launch its IPO in April, sources have said.
Some of the companies' losses come from subsidizing rides, a tactic to attract riders with discounts. 
""With Uber and Lyft becoming public companies, shareholders will expect them to rationalize prices on rides toward sustainable levels,"" said Paul Hudson, founding partner at Glade Brook Capital Partners.
Lyft, as of December, had 39 percent market share in the United States, up from 35 percent early last year. 
Its success in battling better-funded Uber for market share surprised even its own investors. 
""Nobody knew they (Lyft) would catch up to this level,"" said Navin Chaddha, a venture capitalist with Silicon Valley firm Mayfield, which invested in Lyft in 2011.
From its earliest days, Uber aggressively outraised Lyft by billions of dollars, employing tactics such as prohibiting prospective investors who reviewed Uber's financial data from investing in the smaller competitor. 
Just five years ago, some investors were convinced that Lyft would fail, and board members discussed finding a replacement for CEO Logan Green.
Lyft Chairman Sean Aggarwal said on Friday the company will continue to prioritize North American growth over international expansion after completing its IPO. Uber is in more than 70 countries, although it has consolidated certain overseas markets, while Lyft has stuck to the United States and Canada.
""Sticking with that playbook of owning this market (North America) and expanding in this market is how we get to deliver to our public shareholders and the long-term expectations that we set,"" Aggarwal said on the sidelines of Lyft's IPO celebration Friday.
Lyft has explored expanding its service to Australia and Mexico, sources previously told Reuters.
Aggarwal also said the company's co-founders, CEO Green and President John Zimmer, worked in recent weeks to make investors comfortable with Lyft's dual-class share structure, which has faced criticism from some investors and corporate governance advocates.
Although it is common among highly valued tech companies, public market investors still balk at this structure, which gives founders more votes per share and outsized control of the company, long after it is startup-sized. Lyft's structure will give the founders and certain other shareholders 20 votes per share.
CELEBRATION AT AN AUTO DEALERSHIP
Instead of celebrating the first day of trading at the Nasdaq in New York, Lyft opted to mark the occasion at a defunct auto dealership in downtown Los Angeles.
Lyft's staff, with family and friends, and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti gathered before dawn for the kickoff. The building, unmarked on the outside, gave away nothing about the celebration tucked away in the bowels of the old facility, which had been outfitted with pink confetti and Lyft-branded scooters. 
Lyft recently bought the facility to turn it into a driver services center, the first of several it plans to open across the United States in the coming months, where drivers can obtain services like help with taxes or charging electric vehicles.
Garcetti said in his remarks that the old warehouse symbolizes ""a transformation of our economy.""
He pointed out that CEO Green is a native of Los Angeles, adding that ""some good did come out of Los Angeles traffic.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German carmaker Daimler has complained to EU antitrust regulators about Nokia (HE:NOKIA) patents essential to car communications, a move underlining the tensions between tech companies and the car industry on the use of key technologies.
Tech companies and mobile telecoms providers are playing an increasingly important role in the auto industry, with their technologies used in navigation systems, vehicle-to-vehicle communication and self-driving cars.
Daimler did not respond to a request for comment sent during out-of-office hours. The European Commission confirmed receipt of Daimler's complaint.
""The Commission has received a complaint by Daimler against Nokia and we are assessing it,"" spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email.
Nokia said Daimler was seeking to side-step taking out license.
""Though we offer a wide range of options for automakers, including through their tier 1 suppliers, Daimler has resisted taking a license to the Nokia inventions it is already using,"" Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said. 
""Daimler's allegations in its complaint to the EU are simply the latest in a long series of actions to avoid taking a license,"" he said.
Nokia has a highly profitable patent business, a legacy of its history as the market-leading mobile phone maker. 

Patent disputes between Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (KS:005930), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and others have triggered mutual lawsuits worldwide in the last decade, with analysts saying the patent war could next move to the auto industry.

The S&P 500 added 0.67% for the day and was up 13.1% for the first quarter. That's its best performance since the third quarter of 2009, when the broad-market index rose nearly 15%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.82% today, while the Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.78%.
Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin concluded their two-day meeting in Beijing, with both sides touting progress on the latest round of trade talks.
Mnuchin described the talks as ""constructive,"" ahead of another set of talks with China’s Vice Premier Liu He in Washington next week.
Positive sentiment on trade has gathered momentum this week as both sides have appeared to be willing to find common ground, easing investor worries that both nations were on a collision course.
The U.S. has hinted that it may lift tariffs on China. Beijing reportedly is warming up to the idea of an enforcement framework, which the Trump administration argues is important to ensure China complies with eventual terms of a trade deal.
The optimism on trade was captured by trade-sensitive industrials, with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) ending the day higher. The two accounted for nearly a third of the Dow's 211-point gain.
Trade aside, consumer discretionaries also boosted the broader market thanks to a rally in CarMax (NYSE:KMX) after the used-car re-seller posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
In health care, Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) rallied as independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co. backed Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE:BMY) merger proposal for the company.
The move prompted hedge fund Starboard Value to retract its proxy solicitation to vote against the deal, paving the way for a merger.
""While Starboard Value is still opposed to the deal, we now think it is much more likely that the BMY-CELG transaction will go through. Wellington Management Company, another huge opponent of the deal, has not provided any updated comment,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider.
The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to shareholder approval.
Sentiment on tech was boosted by gains in chip stocks, led by a 5% surge in Micron (NASDAQ:MU) on expectations the chipmaker may benefit from Samsung's (KS:005930) DRAM quality issues.
Given Amazon's issues with Samsung, the e-commerce giant may reach out to Micron/Hynix, which would afford the two parties the ability to gain market share, CLSA said in a note.
Real Estate and energy stocks were the exception to the Wall Street rally , with the latter unable to capitalize on gains in U.S. oil prices, which posted their best quarter since 2009.
On the economic front, a trio of reports showing a rebound in new home sales, subdued inflation and weaker consumer spending added somewhat to expectations the Fed could soon cut interest rates.
Calls for a rate cut strengthened late Friday as White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Axios the Fed should ""immediately"" cut interest rates by 50 basis points.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended the final trading day of the first quarter on a strong note on Friday and the S&P 500 posted its best quarterly gain since 2009, boosted by optimism over the latest round of trade talks between the United States and China.
The two sides said they made progress in trade talks that concluded on Friday in Beijing. The talks, aimed at resolving a nearly nine-month trade dispute between the world's two largest economies, were called ""candid and constructive"" by Washington.
A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He will head to Washington next week for another round of talks.
""The prospect of the trade war ending in the very near term is giving a boost to investor confidence, and in turn, we're closing the quarter with some pretty good gains,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
The benchmark S&P 500 rose 13.1 percent in the quarter, its biggest quarterly gain since the third quarter of 2009 and its best first quarter since 1998.
Trade-sensitive industrials rose 1 percent, while chipmakers, which have a large revenue exposure to China, also gained, with the Philadelphia chip index up 1.6 percent.
The broader technology sector gained 1 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 211.22 points, or 0.82 percent, to 25,928.68, the S&P 500 gained 18.96 points, or 0.67 percent, to 2,834.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 60.16 points, or 0.78 percent, to 7,729.32.
For the quarter, the Dow gained 11.2 percent, its biggest quarterly rise since 2013, while the Nasdaq jumped 16.5 percent in its best quarter since 2012. 
All three major indexes posted gains of at least 1 percent each for the week and registered gains for the month as well.
Ride-hailing startup  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) surged more than 20 percent after making its debut on the Nasdaq. The stock ended up 8.7 percent. 
Data released on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending barely rose in January and income increased modestly in February, suggesting the economy was losing momentum after growth slowed in the fourth quarter.
Growth fears were triggered last week, when the Federal Reserve abandoned projections for interest rate hikes in 2019 and the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time since 2007, historically a harbinger of recession.
However, the yield curve between three-month bills and 10-year notes turned slightly positive on Friday, after being inverted for a week.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Axios on Friday that the Fed should ""immediately"" cut interest rates by half a percentage point. 
With the first quarter earnings reporting season just about two weeks away, investors are bracing for what may be the first U.S. profit decline since 2016. Analysts expect quarterly earnings to fall 1.9 percent from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data.
Wall Street will be watching economic data with a laser focus next week after the recent warning signals from Treasury yields.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.73-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 47 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.41 billion shares, compared to the 7.52 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 05:03PM ET</span>","Apple, in rare reversal, pulls plug on wireless charging mat","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Friday said it is canceling the AirPower wireless charging mat that the company announced in 2017 on the same day as its iPhone X, a rare public retreat for the gadget maker known for splashy product launches.
The mat was intended to wirelessly charge up to three Apple products at once, such as an iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods wireless headphones. 
While wireless charging has spread through the gadget industry, charging three devices at once with higher wattage ""fast charging"" has proved challenging. Furniture seller Ikea, for example, sells a $60 matt that can handle three phones but it only features slower 5-watt charging.
In a statement, Apple said that it had concluded that its AirPower mat ""will not achieve our high standards."" 
""We apologize to those customers who were looking forward to this launch,"" Dan Riccio, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, said in the statement. ""We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward.""
The announcement was a rare move for Apple, known in the electronics industry for keeping tight wraps on product plans until it publicly launches them at splashy events in Silicon Valley. The early announcement of AirPower, along with a wirelessly charged version of its AirPods headphones, was a break in that tradition. Apple released the updated AirPods last week, heightening speculation that the accompanying charging mat would come soon.
Daring Fireball, a website that covers Apple news, previously reported that Apple engineers had issues with devices overheating on the AirPower pad. Apple declined to comment beyond its statement on the project.
Apple offered wireless charging in the iPhone in 2017, after many of its rivals such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd had offered the feature for several years. While rumors circulated that Apple might create its own unique wireless charging technology, the company instead chose to use a system that works with Qi, an open industry standard already in use by Samsung and others.

Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) did not move on the news, and shares of NXP Semiconductors and STMicroelectronics, two major suppliers of chips used in Qi systems, appeared to be unaffected also.

128,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo's Insider CEO Failed to Outrun Political Fury,"(Bloomberg) -- Maybe Tim Sloan was doomed from the start as  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.’s chief executive officer -- a situation summed up by Elizabeth Warren’s reaction to his departure: “About damn time.”
After 2 1/2 years running Wells Fargo, and more than three decades working there, Sloan said this week that his leadership had become a distraction and the best way for the bank to move forward was without him. Chair Betsy Duke said the board will look externally for a new CEO.
Sloan, 58, wasn’t brought down by a new scandal, or by some revelation he was directly involved in Wells Fargo’s past wrongdoing. Instead, his exit followed unyielding criticism from politicians and mounting pressure from regulators. This month, two of the bank’s most important overseers -- the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency -- bluntly proclaimed their dissatisfaction, signaling they weren’t about to stop inflicting pain that’s included a cap on the lender’s growth and a $1 billion settlement.
“It seems like it is the culmination of an extraordinarily slow realization by the board that there’s no way that they could turn the corner with Sloan in the leadership position,” said Jeremy Robinson-Leon, president of corporate communications firm Group Gordon. “The fact that Sloan was promoted to the CEO position in 2016 was a blatant unforced error.”
Wells Fargo’s choice for a successor to John Stumpf raised eyebrows from day one. Stumpf was ousted after the revelation that employees had opened millions of potentially fake accounts to meet sales goals. From the board’s perspective, Sloan was the obvious choice for an orderly transition: He had been groomed for the post, serving as finance chief, operating chief and president. None of the nation’s four largest commercial banks has installed an outsider as CEO since they were created in a wave of mergers in the 1990s.
Yet some quickly questioned how a longtime insider could be the right person to clean up the bank. Warren, among others, argued unequivocally that he was not: “His hands are too dirty from overseeing years of scams and scandals,” she said earlier this year.
Ironically, such criticisms only gained steam as Sloan and regulators set out to overhaul the San Francisco-based company, rooting through past complaints and employee testimonials to unearth more scandals across a range of business lines. For critics, every discovery amounted to new evidence that an insider shouldn’t be in charge.
Throughout his tenure as CEO, Sloan and the board tried touting efforts to overhaul Wells Fargo. “You name it, we’ve changed it,” he said last year in an interview with Bloomberg. At times, the bank even noted that his team -- not regulators -- had found a glitch or abuse, fixed it and was already making customers whole. But to the public, the drumbeat of new allegations, probes and fines was just too loud.
At the same time, authorities kept telegraphing that Sloan’s reforms weren’t enough. Wells Fargo has more than a dozen unresolved consent orders with regulators -- meaning that the company hasn’t yet finished fixing internal controls or taking other steps to address lapses or weaknesses. In January, the bank told analysts and investors the Fed’s asset cap would likely stay in place longer than previously expected.
Presence in Washington
Wells Fargo never seemed totally comfortable in the world of Capitol Hill politics, some 2,400 miles away from its headquarters. It viewed itself as simpler than Wall Street behemoths, and under Stumpf even quit the main lobbying association for the largest bank’s CEOs. Its low-key strategy worked for a time, especially during the financial crisis, when Wells Fargo avoided much of the political furor that engulfed the industry. But the bank’s light touch also left it with fewer allies.
Though Wells Fargo revamped its Washington office in 2017 as scandals widened, its presence remained muted. Before Sloan appeared before the House Financial Services Committee this month, one lawmaker who often backs legislative proposals from the financial-services industry and raises money from it, told Bloomberg he was surprised that he had never met anyone from Wells Fargo’s Washington office. He said he knew lobbyists from all other major banks.
The situation came to a head at this month’s hearing, where Sloan spent four hours responding to tough questions from lawmakers in both parties. Even after he calmly described the bank’s commitment to improving, the OCC issued an unusual public rebuke.
“We continue to be disappointed with Wells Fargo Bank N.A.’s performance under our consent orders and its inability to execute effective corporate governance and a successful risk-management program,” the agency said in a statement on March 12.
‘Series of Breakdowns’
The terse statement did more damage to Sloan than hours of criticism from both parties, Capital Alpha Partners analyst Ian Katz wrote in a note to clients this week.
“That was a clear message to the bank’s board that management wasn’t doing its job,” Katz said. “It’s not at all uncommon for lawmakers such as Maxine Waters, the committee chairwoman, to verbally rip into companies and executives. But for the generally bank-friendly OCC to do so on the record is rare indeed.”
A week later, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank won’t lift its asset cap on Wells Fargo until the firm’s problems are addressed. The Fed barred Wells Fargo from growing beyond its size at the end of 2017 until the bank rights its missteps to the regulator’s satisfaction.
“What happened at Wells Fargo really was a remarkably widespread series of breakdowns,” Powell said, noting that, “it’s gone on and on.” It eventually became clear “that these are deep problems that needed to be addressed in a fundamental kind of a way.”

131,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 03:53PM ET</span>",Outsider CEO won't be a quick fix for Wells Fargo: analysts,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's plan to bring in an outsider as its next chief executive could give the scandal-plagued bank a much needed fresh start, but a turnaround will not be easy for whoever takes the helm, analysts said.
The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets said on Thursday that CEO Tim Sloan, a 31-year Wells Fargo veteran, would resign immediately and a committee would meet on Friday to start looking for a replacement from outside the bank.
More than two years after its wide-ranging sales practices scandal first came to light, Wells Fargo is still struggling to repair its reputation and relationship with U.S. regulators. 
""Reforming decades of past mistakes at an institution as large as Wells is a difficult and time-consuming endeavor,"" said Morningstar analyst Eric Compton in a note on Friday. 
Wells Fargo shares were down 2.2 percent to $48.02 on Friday, after jumping more than 2.7 percent after the bank announced Sloan's resignation on Thursday.
Investors are pondering what the change in leadership will actually mean for the bank over the next year or two, Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining Sparks IBG, said in a note on Friday.
""The intermediate transition period will not likely be as productive as we had been assuming, and the longer-term ramifications won't be played out for years,"" Mosby said.
Admissions by the bank that it opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts and improperly charged customers for services have resulted in billions of dollars in fines and settlements since 2016.
The Federal Reserve has also placed an unprecedented restriction on Wells Fargo to keep it from growing its balance sheet until it proves risk management controls are improved.
""It does seem that Wells Fargo management has lost the confidence of regulators,"" Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari told Reuters on Friday. ""It will be important to put in a CEO that can regain that confidence.""
It remained unclear what exactly triggered Sloan's abrupt departure. Sloan, who had been CEO since after the scandal erupted in 2016, said he made the decision because the focus on him was hampering the bank's recovery. 
Sloan twice disappointed investors by pushing back the date he expected to get the asset cap removed. 
When the consent order was announced in February 2018, he said reviews of its plan to meet the Fed's request would be completed in October of that year. In May he said the cap would be lifted in early 2019, but in January he told analysts he expected the bank to operate under the cap through 2019. 
Analysts still say that timeline is too ambitious.
""We do not expect the asset cap to get lifted until mid-2020,"" said  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Inc' analyst Keith Horowitz in a note on Thursday. 
KBW'S Brian Kleinhanzl also wrote in a note that the bank seems to be far from convincing the Fed that it has made sufficient changes.
Banks typically operate under consent orders from the Fed for many years. The Fed has yet to end a 2013 enforcement order against JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) related to its London Whale scandal, according to an analysis of the U.S. central bank's public notices. A 2011 consent order against 10 banks related to crisis-era mortgage practices ended last year. 
Wells Fargo executives did not provide new information about when they expected the Fed to lift the asset cap on Thursday.
TRIMMING COSTS
Outside of regulatory pressures, the new CEO will also be faced with investors who want management to shore up the bank's core business. Wells Fargo was the only bank among the top four U.S. lenders to not grow loans or deposits over the past two years, according to Refinitiv data. 
While current executives have suspended the bank's 2020 expense target to give a new CEO room for a novel strategy, analysts expect incoming management to maintain Wells Fargo's approach of growing profits by getting leaner. 
""I think the new CEO is going to take the path of trimming costs and buying back stocks and you still won't see a lot of balance sheet expansion in terms of loan growth because they are under that cap,"" said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders.
Wells Fargo Board Chair Betsy Duke did not give clear guidelines on what kinds of candidates the board is looking for.
The next CEO will likely be a finance executive with experience with consumer banking and digital strategy, as well as the ability to smooth relationships with Washington, analysts said. 
Citi's Horowitz said JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, who has experience running the consumer bank at the largest U.S. bank by assets, would be his first call. 

A seasoned executive from a financial technology company already based in San Francisco could also be a good fit, said Edward Jones' Sanders.

132,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 03:40PM ET</span>",A New CEO at Wells Fargo Will Pay off for Investors With Patience,"By Charley Blaine
Investing.com - Much of the news coverage about Tim Sloan's departure as  Wells Fargo  CEO on Friday is about who will succeed him.
As important is if Sloan's decision to retire after 31 years now will boost Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) shares.
The shares were up after hours Thursday after Sloan surprised Wall Street by announcing he was stepping aside as CEO immediately and retiring on June 30.
But there was no follow-through on Friday. The shares were off 2.2% even as the stock market was rallying in the best quarter since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
Once, Wells Fargo was among the top-performing U.S. banks, widely respected for getting through the financial crisis intact. Then, an ugly fake account scandal erupted in 2016 and gutted the bank's reputation and relationship with regulators. Bank employees would open accounts in customers' names and assess them fees and other charges. Also, several hundred customers lost their homes to foreclosure due to a Wells Fargo computer error.
Since then, Wells Fargo stock has been a laggard.
It's up about 4% this quarter. But over the last few years, all its major peers, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) and US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) have done better.
Revenue has been flat in the last few quarters at around $21 billion. Earnings  have hovered around $1.10 a share per quarter. The first quarter estimate of 32 analysts polled by Investing.com is $1.11 a share on revenue of $21 billion.
Sixteen of the analysts polled by Investing.com rate the stock a buy as of Thursday. There were just four with sell ratings. The consensus 12-month target is $56.70, which would be a 15.7% gain.
But, despite $1 billion in fines, nasty public scrutiny and even a Federal Reserve decision capping its growth, Wells Fargo has been slow to fix all its problems, probably because it's had to spend so much time finding them.
Critics in Congress haven't let up. Sen. Elizabeth Warren's reaction to Sloan's departure: ""About damn time."" Even the regulators publicly chastised the bank for being slow at fixing its problems.
Wells Fargo has a few things going for it.
It's not going broke. It has a huge branch network across the country. And a third of the shares are controlled by some of the biggest names in U.S. finance. The biggest is Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRKb), which owns nearly 8.9% of the equity.
Elizabeth Duke, who chairs Wells Fargo's board, said the bank will look outside for a new CEO.
There are lots of the usual suspects being talked about to succeed Sloan, including Marianne Lake, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, and Matt Zames, president of private equity giant Cerberus and a former chief operating office at JPMorgan.
The perfect candidate will understand operations, how to communicate with customers and employees and be able to gain the confidence of its regulators.
The search will take time, which will hold the stock back, and the signing will be expensive, especially if the new boss has a lot of deferred compensation that would terminate if hired away.
With a new CEO coming and probably changing the management cadre, Wells Fargo has a shot to get its house in order and be able to leverage its considerable muscle. But the investor thinking about buying shares now must do so thinking very long term.
But Duke was hopeful on an investor call late Thursday.
“Somewhere there is a highly accomplished leader out there who is going to look at the challenge and opportunity and say ‘I’m a really good fit for Wells Fargo’ and we’re going to say, ‘Yeah, we believe that,"" she said."
133,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 02:47PM ET</span>",UK's top fraud prosecutor backs U.S.-style plea bargaining deals,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - The UK's top fraud prosecutor has thrown her weight behind American-style corporate plea bargains amid criticism that they can allow companies to admit wrongdoing without leading to successful prosecutions of individuals.
Lisa Osofsky, an Anglo-American former FBI lawyer now in charge at the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), said the use of deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) was effective in ensuring companies clean up their act - and was still in its infancy.
""I don't think the DPA system is in disrepute in any way, shape or form,"" she told Reuters in an interview.
Retailer  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) and aero-engines group Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) agreed DPAs with the SFO in 2017, paying fines of 129 million pounds and nearly 500 million pounds ($650 million) over an accounting and a bribery scandal respectively. 
Plea bargains are a common feature of the U.S. legal system but have only been used in Britain since 2015. They allow companies to avoid criminal prosecution in a court-approved deal that often includes a fine and compliance monitoring. Since Osofosky took up her post at the end of last August, a re-trial of former Tesco directors collapsed and she has closed an investigation into individuals linked to the Rolls-Royce case.
Osofsky says even if there is not enough evidence to prosecute individuals over the misconduct outlined in DPAs, they still serve an important purpose. ""Corporates (are run) by individuals. But how do you reprimand, discipline, punish bad corporate behavior...? 

""I see (cases against companies and individuals) as two very different things and I think the role of the DPA is to make sure that the company engages with prosecutors, comes forward and cleans up its act."" NO 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT' Prosecuting white collar crime is notoriously tricky, time-consuming and costly. This has long spawned speculation that the SFO, tasked with investigating and prosecuting the most complex corruption, will be rolled into a broader crime fighting force. But Osofsky says she feels she has support from her political paymasters. ""I signed a 5-year contract that says that they want me here,"" she said. ""Whatever existential threat the organization may have felt it was under ... I don't feel one whiff of that"". She declined to be drawn into whether she might close more of the 70 cases she inherited, including high-profile investigations into miner  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), European aerospace group Airbus,  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS), Tata Steel and miner ENRC. But she said meaningful cases don't have to involve huge companies. She highlighted a solar panel energy scam, where last year six men were sentenced to a total of more than 30 years in jail for a 17 million pound fraud on 1,500 often elderly, retired and vulnerable people. ""That, to me, is a big case,"" she said.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 02:23PM ET</span>","Ex-TPG executive, others in U.S. college admissions scandal to appear in court","By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A former senior executive at private equity firm TPG Capital is among 15 people set to appear in court on Friday after being charged with participating in what prosecutors say was the largest college admissions scam uncovered in U.S. history.
Former TPG senior executive Bill McGlashan is one of the wealthy parents slated to make their initial appearances in federal court in Boston after being accused of engaging in fraud and bribery schemes to help get their children into colleges.
Fifty people, including the actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, have been charged with participating in the scheme, headed by college admissions counseling service operator Rick Singer.
Prosecutors said the California consultant helped parents use bribes and cheating to illegally secure admission for their children to universities including Yale University, the University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California and Georgetown University.
Some $25 million in bribes were paid to coaches who helped Singer's clients secure spots for their children as fake athletic prospects, prosecutors said.
Singer also facilitated cheating on college entrance exams, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty on March 12 to charges including racketeering conspiracy and is cooperating with investigators.
McGlashan was accused of arranging with Singer to pay to have an associate correct his son's answers on an ACT college entrance exam at a test center that Singer ""controlled,"" according to a criminal complaint.
McGlashan also conspired to bribe a senior associate athletic director at the University of Southern California in order to help get his son admitted to the school as a recruited athlete, the complaint said.

In a court filing on Wednesday, lawyers for McGlashan denied the allegations, saying he ""did not pay for the use of a so-called 'side door' to obtain admission for his son at USC or any other college for that matter.""

141,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 02:04PM ET</span>","Versum opens books, begins to warm to rival suitor Merck KGaA","(Reuters) - Versum Materials Inc has opened its books to suitor Merck KGaA, saying the German group's unsolicited $5.9 billion offer might be sweetened and could edge out an agreed merger with Entegris.
""Merck’s proposal could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal,"" Versum, a maker of chemicals for the semiconductor industry, cited its board as saying in a statement on Friday. 
However, the U.S. company again urged its shareholders to snub the hostile all-cash bid that Merck launched on Tuesday, adding its support for the tie-up with Entegris was unchanged for now. 
The board ""has authorized Versum's management and its advisers to engage in further discussions with, and provide non-public information to, Merck,"" the statement added.
Versum's share price, which dropped 27 percent last year, was up less than 1 percent on Friday afternoon, at $50.29, above the $48 a share offered by Merck. 
Merck, a science company with three divisions that include specialty chemicals, welcomed Versum's move but maintained the pressure by keeping the June 7 deadline and all other terms of its tender offer unchanged, and by urging Versum investors not to back the Entegris deal.
Versum, the former specialty chemicals division of industrial gases group Air Products (NYSE:APD), has opposed Merck's bid since it was proposed last month, saying it was committed to the all-share merger with Entegris, agreed in January.
In a meeting between Versum Chairman Seifi Ghasemi and Merck Chief Executive Stefan Oschmann on Thursday - under a limited waiver granted by Entegris - Oschmann hinted at a sweetened bid, Versum said.
""Mr. Oschmann conveyed the possibility that Merck would improve the terms of the offer"" after due diligence, Versum said in filings.
""As a disciplined buyer, we will begin a thorough due diligence process as soon as possible,"" a Merck spokesman said. ""Once this process has been concluded, we will provide further information.""
The German group's tender offer is the first major hostile bid by a German company for a U.S. target since BASF's 2006 approach for catalytic converter maker Engelhard, which ended up an agreed deal.
The moves by Merck and Entegris are viewed by some analysts as an effort to seize on beaten down stock prices in the volatile semiconductor industry after demand for mobile devices slowed and prices for memory chips sank.
Entegris is a producer of materials and systems for semiconductor fabrication.

LONDON (Reuters) - What goes down must come up! Three months after one of the worst years on record, investors have seen world stocks and key commodity markets roar back with their best first quarter since 2012.
It may seem a little incongruous when bond markets are screaming recession warnings, but it's all good when the world's two biggest economies are trying to mend their differences and major central banks are going all soft and cuddly again.
The numbers are quite astonishing. The value of MSCI's world share index has surged $6 trillion. Wall Street is up 13 percent, Europe 12 percent and China has jumped 25 percent, which is almost everything it lost last year and has only been bettered by Colombia.
Oil has raced up 30 percent, which is its best performance in any quarter since 2009. That has also helped Russia's rouble top the currency charts and copper and nickel have led metals markets to their best start to a year since 2012.
Chief investment officer of asset manager Prime Partners, Francois Savary, thinks the turnaround has been remarkable.
""It has been the return of Goldilocks,"" he said referring to the prime conditions for risk assets where borrowing is cheap and inflation is low. 
With the global economy clearly slowing he suspects stocks are likely to now pause but for fixed income that is all music to the ears. 
German Bunds - Europe's benchmark government IOUs - have had their best quarter in three years, making roughly 2 percent, with the yield on 10-year debt having dropped a week ago below zero percent for the first time since 2016. 
Despite almost daily Brexit chaos, UK Gilts returns have jumped 5.5 percent, while U.S. Treasuries have made 3.2 percent as their yields have fallen 27 basis points. That followed a 37 basis point fall the previous quarter, whereas in the five quarters prior to that they had consistently risen.
Graphic: Global market asset performance 2019 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HMUijc 
Currency markets have been on the turn too. 
The dollar index will squeeze out its fourth quarterly rise in a row, but it is largely because the euro is set for its weakest Q1 since 2015 after a dive in euro zone growth scuppered the ECB's rate hike aspirations.
The yen is down a touch too, but sterling and others are up and especially against the euro with the pound's 4 percent gain set be its best quarter since the start of 2015, long before Brexit worries struck. 
The Canadian, Aussie and Kiwi dollars have also done well but as usual the wilder swings have been in emerging markets.
Argentina's peso and Turkey's lira, 2018's punchbags, have taken another beating and especially in recent weeks as worries about both countries' political and economic trajectories have started to bite again.
Central Europe has suffered from the euro's slide whereas at the other end of the spectrum, the rouble is up 7.3 percent and China's yuan, Mexico's and Colombia's pesos, Egypt's pound and the Thai baht are all up between 1.5 and 3.5 percent. 
Graphic: Global FX in 2019 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2V7nnck 
FANGTASTIC
Wall Street's rally has put the S&P 500 and Nasdaq up for their strongest quarters since 2009 and 2012 respectively. The S&P also now only 4 percent off its record high with the so-called FANG tech stocks once again providing all the torque. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has surged 27 percent, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 19 percent, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) 12 percent and streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has soared more than 30 percent.
""The selloff in December was too sharp,"" said chief investment officer of New York-based hedge fund ValueWorks, Charles Lemonides. ""If the Fed stays accommodative the economy will do well.""
Silicon Valley startups have also enjoyed a frenzy. Ride-hailing service  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), which has been unable to say when it will stop losing money, was valued at more than $24 billion in its IPO on Thursday. 
The Renaissance IPO ETF, which invests in recently listed companies including Spotify and software seller Okta, has also gained a whopping 31 percent since the start of the year.
Graphic: World stocks index surges $6 trillion in 2019 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HNzc4v 
And if you think that's good, China's tech sector has flown up 46 percent with online behemoth  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) up more than 30 percent alone. 
That's all against the backdrop of Beijing swinging back into stimulus after the economy slowed to a 28-year low.
""It is a challenge for the Chinese equity market to be able to show as good a performance in the next 9 months,"" said Khiem Do, head of Greater China investments, Global Markets, at Barings, in Hong Kong.
""A lot of good news have been reflected in the prices. But the Chinese government will still be biased towards reflating the economy.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP on Friday abandoned a campaign to convince Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co shareholders to vote down the drugmaker's proposed $74 billion takeover of biotech  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) after the two leading proxy advisory firms backed the deal.
The firms, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, said earlier on Friday that Bristol-Myers shareholders should vote in favor of the deal.
""Despite the substantial swell of support against this transaction, it is extremely difficult for shareholders to prevail without a supportive recommendation from ISS and Glass Lewis to vote against the transaction,"" Starboard said in a statement.
The hedge fund said it still plans to vote its shares against what it believes is a bad deal, but it will withdraw its proxy solicitation to get other shareholders to vote against it.
The move is a victory for New York-based drugmaker Bristol-Myers and its Chief Executive Giovanni Caforio, who have mounted their own campaign to shore up investor support for the deal. Bristol-Myers' shareholders are set to vote on the acquisition on April 12. 
Shares of Celgene rose 7.5 percent to $93.99 in early afternoon trading. Bristol-Myers shares were off 1.1 percent at $47.29. 
Bristol-Myers announced in early January that it planned to buy Celgene in a cash and stock transaction valued at roughly $74 billion that would bring together companies that specialize in oncology and cardiovascular drugs in what would be the largest pharmaceutical industry merger ever.
But Starboard and the company's second largest shareholder, Wellington Management, have opposed the deal. Starboard has called it ""poorly conceived and ill-advised."" Wellington did not respond to requests for comment. 
PROXY FIRMS ENDORSE DEAL
ISS and Glass Lewis, which advise large institutional investors as to how to vote on shareholder proxy proposals, both endorsed the strategic rationale for the deal, significantly increasing the chances that many big mutual funds would also back it. 
The spread between Celgene’s share price and the value of the Bristol-Myers bid - a measure of investor confidence in the deal - tightened significantly on Friday to less than 4 percent, suggesting optimism that the transaction will close. It had been as wide as about 20 percent after the large investors announced their initial opposition to the deal.
If the deal is approved, Bristol-Myers shareholders will own 69 percent of the company and Celgene shareholders would own the remainder.
This is the biggest transaction Starboard has ever opposed. The firm argues the merger could destroy billions in shareholder value and that Bristol-Myers should not feel forced to do a deal right now.
Starboard has said it is ready to nominate five directors for the board. Glass Lewis argued that if the deal goes through, ""we suspect Starboard won't seek to get its director candidates on the board, but ultimately that could depend on the margin of votes cast on the merger proposal.""
Starboard has been stepping up its healthcare campaigns lately but has had mixed success previously in healthcare.
Perrigo Company Plc shares have lost more than a third of their value since giving Starboard board representation in 2017. Assertio Therapeutics Inc, previously known as Depomed, explored a sale three years ago under pressure from Starboard but did not reach a deal. Its shares have lost half their value since then.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has dismissed a lawsuit seeking to hold nine large European banks liable for allegedly providing banking services to Iran that enabled militants to conduct 55 attacks against U.S. armed forces in neighboring Iraq.
In a decision on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan said the banks' alleged misconduct was too far removed from the attacks, which occurred from 2003 to 2011, to support civil liability under federal anti-terrorism laws.
The U.S. Department of State has designated Iran a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA,  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG,  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc had been sued by military personnel who survived the attacks, and relatives and estates of those killed.
The plaintiffs accused the banks in a 533-page complaint of concealing their work for Iran through such practices as altering wire transfers, and masking the identities of those transferring funds.
But the judge found the complaint ""devoid"" of allegations that the banks knew they were enabling attacks in Iraq linked to Hezbollah, al Qaeda and other groups that the U.S. government has designated as foreign terrorist organizations.
Swain found no proof, as required under a 2013 decision from the federal appeals court in Manhattan, that the services were a substantial factor in the attacks, and that the plaintiffs' injuries were a reasonably foreseeable consequence.
""The complaint does not allege plausibly that the provision of banking services, which are not inherently violent or dangerous, can be considered as acts dangerous to human life,"" Swain wrote.
In seeking a dismissal, the banks said attacks on U.S. soldiers, including during the Iraq War, were ""abhorrent,"" but that they committed none of the attacks in question and ""did not support any terrorists.""
A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.
Iran's Bank Saderat was also named as a defendant. It was declared in default last May because it did not respond to the Nov. 2017 complaint.
The case is O'Sullivan et al v Deutsche Bank AG et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 17-08709.

LONDON(Reuters) - Cboe and other share trading platforms have put on hold plans to move share trading from London to Amsterdam on Monday as Britain delays Brexit for at least two weeks.
British lawmakers voted down Prime Minister Theresa May's divorce settlement for the third time on Friday. Britain will now leave the EU on April 12 unless an alternative is agreed with Brussels.
Stock, bond and trading platforms have largely favored Amsterdam for opening new EU hubs, several of which were due to start trading on April 1, given that Britain had been due to leave the bloc on Friday, March 29.
""Cboe continues to discuss launch timing with our regulators and customers,"" the European arm of the U.S. exchange said. It will provide a further update at the end of next week.
Cboe accounts for nearly a fifth of pan-European share trading, and dealings in euro denominated shares had been due to move from its London unit to Amsterdam on April 1.
The London Stock Exchange's Turquoise pan-European share trading unit has also opened a hub in Amsterdam. It said that its start has now been delayed until further clarity on the Brexit timetable emerges.
Aquis Exchange began offering trading in 12 stocks on its new Paris platform on March 20, but said it will now only add more stocks as members require and clarity on Brexit emerges.
However U.S. exchange CME moved trading in European government bonds and euro repurchase agreements from London to Amsterdam on March 18.
""They are trading from Amsterdam,"" a CME spokeswoman said. Clearing in those contracts, the second leg of a securities trade, has moved from London to Paris.
MarketAxess's new Amsterdam hub is still due to go live on Monday to trade the same range of fixed income products in London.
The new hubs are unlikely to be shelved any time soon given the risk of a no-deal Brexit.
The EU's European Securities and Markets Authority has said that under a no-deal Brexit, over 6,000 European shares and 14 UK shares can only be traded on platforms inside the bloc.
Furthermore, banks play a core role in share trading, and many in London have opened up new hubs in Frankfurt and elsewhere to avoid disruption from Brexit.

They took with them a trillion pounds in stocks, bonds and derivatives belonging to EU customers, making it more likely they will trade inside the bloc in future.

According to a report on wages published by the group, Atlantia Chief Executive Giovanni Castellucci received 3.7 million euros ($4.15 million) in bonuses and incentives last year. 
Group Chairman Fabio Cerchiai received 560,000 euros in variable non-equity premiums, the report said.
Both Castellucci and Cerchiai also served as CEO and chairman respectively of Atlantia's motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia until the beginning of this year.
Last August, a section of the 50-year-old Morandi bridge managed by Autostrade in the northern city of Genoa collapsed, sending dozens of cars plunging to the ground.
""No comment is needed in front of millionaire bonuses paid out after the tragedy in Genoa. We need a revolution of the concession system. This is what we are doing,"" Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli wrote on Twitter.
The government has accused Autostrade of serious oversights in its maintenance of the doomed bridge and has said it intends to revoke its Italian motorway concession. Autostrade has denied wrongdoing, saying regular, state-supervised inspections had indicated the ageing bridge was safe.

155,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 10:55AM ET</span>",GM Brushed Off Union Concessions Before Idling Ohio Car Plant,"(Bloomberg) -- The union hall in Lordstown, Ohio, is a hive of confusion, anxiety and anger. Mostly anger.
Three weeks after employees at the town’s General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). compact car plant assembled their last Chevrolet Cruze, employees are filing into the United Auto Workers Local 1112 hall to sign up for unemployment benefits and try to figure out if they should take a transfer to another GM plant, or wait it out in the one factory most have ever worked and see if it survives.
Union workers are livid that they agreed to make $118 million a year in annual concessions to save the plant in mid 2017, only to have GM effectively threaten to close it down a year and a half later. Unless GM reverses its course, Lordstown will fall victim to the harsh reality that fewer consumers are buying small cars and that Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra is hyper focused on doing business only where GM can earn big returns.
“Everything they asked us to do, we did,” said Dan Morgan, the shop chairman of Local 1112 and chief negotiator of the agreement, the details of which haven’t previously been reported. “And still, we don’t have a product to build.”
GM idled the plant in March saying demand for the Cruze was too weak to continue. In an email, GM spokesman Dan Flores said the union agreed to many concessions, but that they didn’t address the realities the company faces.
The problem isn’t high wages, it’s falling sales -- and GM’s post-bankruptcy cash flow discipline. “We didn’t discontinue the Cruze because of something the local union did or didn’t do,” Flores wrote. “It was a market-driven decision to discontinue the Cruze, and there were no products to allocate to Lordstown.”
Harsh Reality
The union disagrees the Cruze was a loser and thinks their concessions merit adding another product to the plant, perhaps one being built in Mexico. Of the 38 models GM sold in the U.S., only five did more volume than the roughly 143,000 Cruzes delivered last year. But sedans no longer command much of a premium as car buyers shun them in favor of crossovers, SUVs and trucks. And even at the peak of the Cruze’s popularity, profit margins were thin.
“It’s the reality of the marketplace,” said Ron Harbour, a global automotive manufacturing consultant at Oliver Wyman. “With small cars, margins are razor thin so if you go down to one shift, no one can make money.”
The plant’s future will be decided in talks later this year, when GM and the UAW hammer out a new four-year labor deal. President Donald Trump has weighed in, giving GM heat with a demand to reopen the factory or sell it to someone who will. At a rally Thursday in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump gave the company kudos for investing in an electric-car plant in the state, but the praise didn’t last long.
“General Motors did just announce a $300 million dollar investment at its Orion assembly plant here in Michigan,” Trump said. “But I’m also fighting with General Motors and the UAW to take swift action on the GM plants at Hamtramck and Warren, Michigan, and Lordstown, Ohio. Get the damn plants open.”
At stake in Lordstown are the livelihoods of more than 1,400 plant workers and thousands more indirect jobs in the surrounding area of northeast Ohio, a key swing state in presidential elections. Married couple Mark and Sherry Pratt are worried about what’s in store for them, as both have been laid off after more than a decade each working at the plant.
Mark may consider an offer to move to another GM factory to save his pension and retiree health care. But it’s unclear if his wife would be able to work at the same plant, and they’re reluctant to relocate away from their eight grandchildren in the Lordstown area. “We want them to know us,” Sherry says. “We don’t want to be a state away.”
Union’s Concessions
It’s a bitter pill for workers who feel they’ve already given up a lot to keep GM happy.
Before GM’s announcement that it had no future product planned for Lordstown, Morgan said the UAW agreed to what GM called a “Super Competitive Operating Agreement,” which allowed GM to bring in contractors, temps and other lower-wage staff to work in the plant. It was set up to save even more money than the “Competitive Operating Agreement” that GM used to lower costs at its electric-car factory north of Detroit in Orion Township, Michigan.
Morgan started getting nervous in January 2017. GM earned record profit the year before, but sales of the Cruze, the sole vehicle made in the massive Ohio plant, fell 17 percent. GM cut the third shift at the factory along with about 1,200 jobs, leaving more than 3,000 people making almost 190,000 cars a year. As consumers fled to sport utility vehicles, Cruze sales kept falling and GM eliminated the second shift in June 2018, dismissing another 1,500 workers.
At the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources on the Detroit River, Morgan and other union officers met with Scott Sandefur, a GM vice president of labor relations, and Cathy Clegg, GM’s vice president of North American manufacturing, among other executives for a series of meetings from May through July to try to improve profits.
“We knew we were making small cars,” Morgan said. “We wanted to know what we had to do to stay in the game.”
GM declined to make Sandefur or Clegg available. The UAW representatives said GM told them the Cruze wasn’t profitable. Executives also said if the local adopted a more competitive labor agreement to get the car back in the black, it would give them “a way better opportunity to get new products,” Morgan said.
Cost Cuts
To cut costs, the UAW merged Locals 1112 and 1714, which saved the company $3 million a year in administrative costs. Then the union agreed to outsource non-assembly jobs like handling of parts and materials to lower-wage workers employed by a subsidiary called GM Subsystems LLC, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg.
Next, they allowed GM to cut the number of skilled tradesmen including electricians, pipe fitters, mechanics and die makers in half to 130 by letting the company contract out for overtime skilled-trade work and by changing job classifications, said Scott Brubaker, who was chairman of Local 1714.
The union allowed outside firms to send in contractors to repair supplier parts and assembled vehicles at the plant. It also agreed to drop the number of extra workers employed to cover absentee workers to 60, from 150.
Morgan and other union negotiators signed the deal to make all of the concessions GM wanted in late July 2017 and agreed to implement it in January 2018. “All of these things were very unpopular,” Morgan said.
GM also agreed to take action to help the Cruze’s bottom line, Morgan said. Management wanted to bring suppliers on site to get parts ready for the assembly line to improve efficiency. Chevrolet’s sales and marketing group was supposed to advertise the car more aggressively and offer deals on vehicle options that might help sales. None of that was done, Morgan said.
Surprise Announcement
By October 2018, GM told Morgan that the Cruze was making money again. To his surprise, the company announced a restructuring plan the next month that included Lordstown on the list of plants that may close. The automaker elected to idle Lordstown even earlier than planned after Cruze sales sank 22 percent last year. The UAW has sued, arguing GM can’t close the plant under its existing contract.
At an event in Orion Township last week, when Barra announced the $300 million investment in GM’s Chevy Bolt plant, UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, who oversees the union’s GM department, said his team will negotiate hard this summer to keep the plant open.
For workers in Lordstown, it’s like purgatory, said David Green, president of the local. Workers don’t know if they should join the roughly 520 people who’ve taken an offer to transfer to a plant out of state, or see if Lordstown survives. “If you wait, there may not be anything to come back to,” Green said.
Sonja Smith, who has 24 years at the plant, said she will consider a move if it is offered, but she isn’t happy about the prospect. “We did everything they want,” she said. “This is their payback.”"

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss bank Julius Baer is considering Credit Suisse's international wealth management head Iqbal Khan as a possible successor to its chief executive Bernhard Hodler, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Khan, who was hired by Chairman Urs Rohner in 2013 and promoted to lead the newly created International Wealth Management business in 2015, had also been tipped as a potential future chief executive of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Although Hodler has been Julius Baer CEO for less than one-and-a-half years, Baer's board is already assessing potential successors, the sources said.
Julius Baer has axed jobs and cut growth targets this year after it was hit by challenging markets in 2018, and its shares are down 28 percent since Hodler took over.
Switzerland's third-largest listed bank declined to comment on whether it or its new chairman are seeking to replace Hodler, while Credit Suisse declined to comment on the situation.
Hodler was chief risk officer at Zurich-based Julius Baer before the departure of his predecessor Boris Collardi, who also rose through the ranks of Credit Suisse, to unlisted Pictet. 
Since taking the top job, Hodler has been trying to overhaul Julius Baer's compliance practices following several inquiries related to bribery and corruption probes involving its clients.
In Khan, Julius Baer would gain a high-profile private banker in his early forties who has helped bring in a new generation of young, entrepreneurial clients for Credit Suisse.
Credit Suisse's private banking operations outside of Switzerland and Asia Pacific have cut costs and layers of middle management, boosting profits and inflows under Khan, while the bank was undergoing a major restructuring.
If Khan were to leave, there are a handful of Credit Suisse executives who would be in the running to replace him.
These include Benjamin Cavalli, head of private banking in South Asia, Yves Sommerhalder, co-head of the bank's International Trading Solutions, Serge Fehr, head of private banking and wealth management in the Swiss division, Eric Varvel, head of Asset Management in IWM, and Felix Baumgartner, head of premium clients in Switzerland, one source said.
Swiss Universal Bank head Thomas Gottstein and Investment Banking & Capital Markets boss Jim Amine would also be in the mix, the source added.

157,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 10:50AM ET</span>",Wells Fargo Shakeup Gets Lukewarm Reception on Wall Street,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. fell in early Friday trading after Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan abruptly stepped down on Thursday, triggering a hasty search for a successor.
The move came partly as a relief, as Sloan had faced a tough crowd at a House committee hearing earlier this month, topped off by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issuing a rare public criticism of the bank. But the sudden departure is also raising questions about who may step in, how any new CEO will cope with the challenges facing Wells Fargo and which way the bank’s expenses are headed.
The stock dropped as much as 2 percent, while other large banks were posting gains. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). rose about 0.7 percent and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). was ahead by about 0.6 percent.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is rallying, too, with 1.1 percent gain, after announcing President Colm Kelleher, who had navigated the investment bank through the financial crisis, will leave at the end of June.
Here’s a sample of what some analysts are saying:
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Matt O’Connor
O’Connor cut his rating on Wells to hold from buy out of a concern that earnings may suffer as a new CEO re-evaluates savings targets and shifts the bank’s business model. At the same time, a new CEO “should help speed up the process of addressing regulatory issues.”
Raymond James, David Long
Long upgraded his rating to market perform as Sloan’s retirement “removes a headwind.” He sees better investor sentiment and less regulatory scrutiny.
Even so, Long’s enthusiasm is “tempered by still inferior fundamental performance.” He expects revenue will drop again in 2019, earnings-per-share estimates will be cut and profitability metrics will keep trailing peers.
Citi, Keith Horowitz
Sloan’s “decision to step down was the right move,” Horowitz wrote in a note, though picking the right CEO next is more important.
He hopes the board will seek a CEO with “a strong analytical mind,” who can focus on capital management, and “not prioritize chasing short-term growth.” He also recommends significant industry experience, a strong technology background and “a collaborative mindset,” as an outsider will need support. Horowitz’s first call would be to JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake.
He rates Wells a buy, and flags potential positive catalysts including strong Federal Reserve stress test results and a return to positive revenue growth by the fourth quarter, and doesn’t see the asset cap lifted until mid-2020.
Morgan Stanley, Betsy Graseck
Sloan’s resignation “removes a distraction,” but share performance will depend on “who replaces him and how quickly,” Graseck wrote in a note. A delay beyond six months may weigh on shares, while the next CEO needs to be “vibrant, energetic and tech-savvy.”
She expects shares to stay range-bound until a successor is appointed. Rates the stock equal-weight, with a price target of $55.
Goldman, Richard Ramsden
At this stage, it’s “difficult to draw any firm conclusions on what this change means,” particularly as the range of possible successors is wide. Rates Wells a buy, with a price target of $59.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Susan Roth Katzke
“We believe this will be among the most coveted roles in banking, though not without challenges,” Katzke wrote in a note. It’s “absolutely critical that the new CEO can lead Wells Fargo forward and out of the Fed’s Consent Order, sooner rather than later.” She reiterated her $60 target price; rates the shares neutral.
RBC, Gerard Cassidy
A change in leadership had been a “likely outcome of the company’s efforts to distance itself from its sales practice issues,” Cassidy wrote in a note.
Though RBC has “faith that WFC will be able to appoint a new CEO capable of moving the bank beyond its recent missteps,” Cassidy highlighted “the herculean tasks that await Sloan’s successor.” Among them: “Inherited cost saving targets, regulatory constraints such as the asset cap, robust capital return targets,and ongoing headline risks.” He rates the stock sector perform, with a target of $48.
Piper, Kevin Barker
Sloan’s exit “signals a turning point,” and may let Wells Fargo ""operate like a normal bank trying to build relationships rather than constantly putting out fires,” Barker said in a note.
Even so, the bank’s “fundamental outlook remains murky.” He keeps his neutral rating and $55 target.
KBW, Brian Kleinhanzl
“A new CEO can help repair government and regulatory relationships,” Kleinhanzl wrote in a note. At the same time, the search process and uncertainty about expenses create “new risks for shares of Wells Fargo.”
KBW doesn’t expect the near-term regulatory environment will get worse and assumes the asset cap will still be in place in 2020. KBW rates the stock outperform, with a target price of $58.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>",UK regulator to permanently ban binary options from April 2,"(Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog said it will permanently ban the sale of complex derivative products to retail customers from Tuesday to protect them from large and unexpected trading losses.
The Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) permanent ban on the sale of binary options to retail consumers is similar to a temporary retail ban the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has in force across the European Union.
ESMA also has temporary curbs on contracts for difference (CFDs).
Regulators have expressed concern about how these inherently high-risk speculative products are offered to retail investors, potentially leading to significant losses.
Binary options allow people to bet on whether the price of a share, currency or index will go up or down within a certain timeframe. CFDs give an investor exposure to price movements in securities without owning the underlying asset.
The FCA ban goes further by including so-called securitized binary options, which are no currently sold in or from Britain. The watchdog said it wants to prevent a market being developed.

The FCA estimates https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-confirms-permanent-ban-sale-binary-options-retail-consumers the permanent ban on binary options could save retail consumers up to 17 million pounds ($22.28 million)per year, and may reduce the risk of fraud by unauthorised entities claiming to offer these products.
""Binary options are gambling products dressed up as financial instruments. By confirming our ban today we are ensuring that investors don't lose money from an inherently flawed product,"" Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy & Competition at the FCA, said.

Mondelez is negotiating final terms of purchase of the business, which includes Australian cookie brand Arnott's and Danish baked snacks maker Kelsen Group, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
The report said the companies have been discussing a price of around $2.5 billion for the assets, but no final agreement has been reached, and talks could fall apart or another buyer could emerge.
Mondelez, Nutella maker Ferrero SpA and a consortium comprising private equity firms KKR & Co and Bain Capital LP were among the bidders for Campbell's international business, according to a report earlier this month.
Sources told Reuters in December that Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co too had made a bid.
Campbell's international unit, along with its ""fresh"" business, was put up for sale in August after the company was pressured by investors to boost its profitability and stock performance.
The company last month said it expects to name buyers for the business by the end of its fiscal year in July. 
Mondelez and Campbell declined to comment on the report.

Shares of both companies were little changed in early trading on Friday.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 09:17AM ET</span>",Lyft valued at $24.3 billion in first ride-hailing IPO,"By Carl O'Donnell and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) was valued at $24.3 billion in the first initial public offering (IPO) of a ride-hailing startup on Thursday, raising more than it had set off to do as investors overlooked uncertainty over its path to becoming a profitable company. 
Lyft's IPO sets the stage for the stock market debut of larger rival Uber Technologies Inc, which Reuters has reported will kick off in April. Uber has been told by its investment bankers that it could be valued at as much as $120 billion.
The success of the IPO came despite Lyft's steep loses, criticism of its dual-class share structure and some concerns over its strategy for autonomous driving, for fear of missing out on the company's strong revenue growth.
""In a good market, people look beyond things. They don't see the problems as much,"" said Brian Hamilton, co-founder of data firm Sageworks, speaking before the pricing.
The ride-hailing industry is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, as young millennials in big cities choose not to buy their own car. Yet the sector is fraught with questions about the future of automated driving, regulatory pushback and legal challenges over drivers’ pay and benefits. 
Lyft's valuation makes it the biggest company to go public since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd in 2014. It paves the way for other Silicon Valley companies seeking to float in the stock market this year, including Pinterest Inc, Slack Technologies Inc and Postmates Inc. 
Lyft raised $2.34 billion its IPO. It said it priced 32.5 million shares, slightly more that it was offering originally, at $72, the top of its already elevated $70-$72 per share target range. Lyft started its IPO investor road show earlier this month with a target range of $62-$68 per share.
The stock is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq on Friday under the symbol ""LYFT"".
The IPO market had a slow start in 2019 due to volatile markets at the end of last year and the government shutdown in January blocking U.S. regulators from processing new IPO applicants. 
With start-ups like Lyft staying private for longer, there is a backlog of demand to allocate more money to stocks which are considered high-growth in order to diversify away from Wall Street's FAANG trade which is made up of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Nevertheless, there are concerns among some investors that these IPOs may be coming at the peak of the market, when the benchmark S&P 500 Index has risen more than 200 percent since 2008. 
""They're buying at the top of a bull market that's lasted for nine years,"" said Roberts. 
PROFITABILITY QUESTIONS 
Lyft, which was valued at $15 billion in final private fundraising round in 2018, kicked off its 10-day IPO roadshow on March 18. The company's executives made stops in cities such as New York, Baltimore, Kansas and Los Angeles. Reuters reported the IPO was oversubscribed after just two days.
It has now nearly 40 percent of the U.S. ride-sharing market, according to its regulatory filing. 
Lyft's revenue was $2.16 billion for 2018, double the previous year's and far higher than $343 million in 2016. It posted a loss of $911 million in 2018 versus $688 million in 2017.
Lyft was launched in 2012 and is led by its founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer. The company has not laid out a timeline for when it will turn a profit, but stock investors have shown patience in the past if they feel the growth will pay off, with companies like Amazon staying in the red until years after its IPO. 
Lyft is smaller than rival Uber and so far has focused on the U.S. and Canadian markets. Uber, a global logistics and transportation company most recently valued at $76 billion in the private market, is seeking a valuation as high as $120 billion, although some analysts have pegged its value closer to $100 billion based on selected financial figures it has disclosed.

Unlike Uber, which has developed its own self-driving division, Lyft has chosen to strike partnerships to expand in the sector, including with car parts suppliers Magna International Inc and Aptiv Plc. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is an investor in Lyft.

One catalyst for a wave of spending and borrowing is the potential of a record year for initial public offerings as large numbers of private tech companies like  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber finally hit the public markets. Companies are looking to go public not just because the timing is right in the evolution of their companies, or just because market conditions are favorable, but also because to some extent because there’s a herd effect once a few noteworthy companies start to go public.
Employees of these companies will finally be able to unlock the wealth they have that’s been tied up in private tech companies for years. Between the actual IPOs and the expiration of lockup periods months down the road, this will mean tens of billions of dollars of buying power for insiders of those companies. A lot of that will be leveraged as tech workers use their IPO gains as down payments to buy houses with huge mortgages. Significant chunks will go into wealth management and other financial services products. The effect may be concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, where many of these companies are located, but there will be second-order effects — like retirees selling their homes to tech workers and moving to cheaper pastures — as well as some employees cashing out and moving to other metros where housing is more affordable.
The second catalyst is the continued plunge in interest rates. The 10-year Treasury rate is now down to levels it hasn’t seen since 2017, and mortgage rates are dropping below 4 percent. This is the perfect environment for the housing market as we enter the heart of the spring buying season, and in their earnings reports this week homebuilders KB Homes and  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) both said they were optimistic about the impact lower rates would have on the market. More Americans might be willing and able to take out a mortgage, considering that the unemployment rate is lower and wage growth is a fair amount higher than it was when interest rates were at similar levels in 2017.
Those two catalysts could drive up home values. That would have much larger ripples if homeowners revert to an “old normal,” being opportunistic about home equity and interest rates to treat their homes as vehicles for financial engineering.
The balance sheets of homeowners in the aggregate have improved significantly since the depths of the housing bust. Home equity percentage levels are at 16-year highs. While in the early years of the housing recovery, the improvement was mostly in coastal, particularly West Coast, markets, over the past couple years home price appreciation has been most rapid in some of the hardest-hit “bubble markets.” For instance, Las Vegas currently has the fastest home price growth of any market tracked by the Case-Shiller Index, and since the end of 2016 home prices in the Las Vegas market are up 22 percent. A lot of homeowners who may have been underwater or only had a little bit of home equity when interest rates were at current levels in 2017 now have a significant amount of equity they can tap.
If we really are at the end of a cycle of interest rate increases, whether it be for economic or political reasons, it makes a lot of sense for homeowners with equity to start thinking about refinancing or taking cash out of their homes. Sound familiar? It certainly could lead to a return to bubble-era behaviors, with reckless mortgage fraud or using cash-out refinancings to buy boats. But for a lot of households doing a cash-out refi makes a lot of sense. Like with many things, a behavior in moderation can be prudent while excess is what gets you into trouble.
Maybe households have some high-cost credit card debt or need to replace a family car, and by tapping home equity they’re able to restructure their debt or free up cash to buy a car. Depending upon what their current mortgage rate is and how long they’ve been paying their mortgage, they might be able to refinance into a new 30-year mortgage with the same monthly payment as they currently have. The further we get from the financial crisis and as memories of that era fade, the more homeowners will be receptive to these types of scenarios.
Even as a large part of the economic story this decade has been a rise in private tech company valuations and a recovery in home prices, we generally haven’t seen either store of wealth tapped by households. In 2019, we finally may. That could be what allows U.S. economic growth to continue.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 08:39AM ET</span>",AstraZeneca pays up to $6.9 billion in Daiichi Sankyo cancer deal,"By Ludwig Burger, Sam Nussey and Takashi Umekawa
(Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc will pay up to $6.9 billion to work with Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd on a hotly-tipped experimental treatment for breast cancer, in a direct challenge to the world's biggest cancer drug maker Roche.
The deal on the drug known as trastuzumab deruxtecan sent shares in Japan's Daiichi soaring 16 percent, its daily limit, to a record high on Friday. Daiichi's stock has climbed 45 percent this year on optimism about the treatment. 
Britain's AstraZeneca plans to use some of the proceeds of a $3.5 billion share issue to fund the deal. Its shares fell as much as 6 percent.
Under the deal, AstraZeneca will make an upfront payment of $1.35 billion to Daiichi. They will share development and commercialization costs for the drug worldwide, with Daiichi retaining exclusive rights in Japan.
Daiichi's drug, also known as DS-8201, targets the HER2 protein, a major trigger of uncontrolled cell growth in about 20 percent of breast cancers, where Roche has been a pioneer with its aging $7 billion-a-year best-seller Herceptin.
DS-8201 is being tested in a patient group that would typically receive Roche's Kadcyla or Perjeta, products which the Swiss drugmaker hopes will offset a sales decline in Herceptin after loss of patent protection.
AstraZeneca and its partner will also target patients with low levels of HER2, a much larger breast cancer subgroup with poor treatment options and the drug's biggest market opportunity, as well as certain lung and gastric tumors.
""Over the last four years oncology has been focused on pipeline revitalization ... We feel that we have re-emerged and now our sights shift toward true leadership in the oncology space,"" said Dave Fredrickson, AstraZeneca's head of oncology.
The deal is a big bet on Japanese research by AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who is seeking to replicate recent success in fast growing cancer drugs Tagrisso, Lynparza and Imfinzi.
Among the wide range DS-8201 patient trials underway, five are at a final stage where results may be used in requests for marketing approval. 
""$1.35 billion upfront plus significant future milestones likely necessitates blockbuster peak sales to deliver a return,"" said Jefferies analyst Peter Welford, using the industry term for drugs with more than $1 billion in annual sales.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said they saw an 80 percent chance of DS-8201 achieving that status.
""The upfront payment is particularly large. It's a sign that AstraZeneca assumes the drug will become mainstream in the next generation,"" said Takashi Akahane, a senior analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
The two drugmakers have a long-standing relationship which includes a 2015 agreement to jointly commercialize constipation drug Movantik in the United States.
DS-8201 is part of a drug class called antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), which link powerful cell toxins to antibodies that cling to cancer cells, sparing the healthy cells that are damaged during conventional chemotherapy treatments. 
Roche's Kadcyla, also an ADC, won U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2013.
Daiichi is expected to book sales for the drug in the United States, certain countries in Europe and some other markets where it has affiliates. 
AstraZeneca is expected to book sales in all other markets worldwide, including China, Australia, Canada and Russia. 
Daiichi has declared its long-term vision to focus on oncology, targeting 500 billion yen ($4.52 billion) in annual sales from the business in fiscal 2025, from 20 billion in 2017. 
In a separate statement, Daiichi said its President and Chief Operating Officer, Sunao Manabe, would replace George Nakayama as CEO, effective June 17. It did not give a reason for the change.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial regulators have given European Union banks, insurers and asset managers more time to decide whether to continue serving British customers if there is a no-deal Brexit.
Britain introduced a ""temporary permissions regime"" or TPR for EU financial firms to notify UK regulators if they want to continue serving UK customers after March 29 if the United Kingdom left the bloc with no divorce settlement.
Once notified, the firms would have up to three years to apply for a new UK license. If they don't notify regulators, they would have to close their business in Britain.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Friday it has extended the deadline for notifications to April 11, the day before Britain has agreed with Brussels to leave the EU if there is no exit deal.
The Bank of England's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (PRA)has introduced a similar extension.
The FCA also published the final version of its no-deal Brexit contingency plans for financial markets, just hours before parliament is due to vote at 1430 GMT on Friday for the third time on whether to accept the divorce settlement Britain negotiated with Brussels.
""The documents published today are the final stages in our preparations in the event that the UK leaves the EU without an implementation period,"" said Nausicaa Delfas, head of international at the FCA.
""They ensure that firms have certainty of the financial regime they will be operating within, and so can plan accordingly to meet the needs of their customers.""

The FCA said it would publish information about technical standards under EU legislation on capital requirements, banking resolution and financial conglomerates once the PRA has published similar information.

165,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>","In market debut, Lyft counters Uber with 'nice guy' image","By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) has been challenging larger ride-hailing rival Uber Technologies Inc for years by cultivating an image of caring more for its drivers, riders and the environment. As the company debuts in the stock market on Friday, it hopes to convince investors the ""nice guy"" image will pay off.
""In the early days, people misunderstood, 'Oh you guys are the nice guys. You guys are going to get crushed by a more competitive player,"" Lyft President and co-founder John Zimmer told Reuters.
""We said, 'No, we're very competitive but treating our employees well, treating our drivers well, treating the local communities that we work with respect, which is also very good for business.""
Lyft exceeded market expectations with its initial public offering (IPO) on Thursday, raising $2.34 billion and fetching a valuation of $24 billion.
That is still a fraction of the $120 billion valuation that investment bankers have told Uber it could wind up with in its IPO in April, thanks to its international presence and expansion into sectors such as food delivery and freight hauling.
Despite its bigger size, Uber has evolved in lock-step with Lyft, adding new types of rides like car-pooling, changing fares investing in autonomous vehicle development and adding scooters and bikes. 
As a result, Lyft and Uber look a lot alike. Both companies have been losing money, subsidizing rides to boost market share. But Lyft has been making inroads against Uber in the United States, boosting market share to 39 percent as of December from 35 percent in early 2018.
Some of Lyft's gains are due to Uber's woes. The latter is still recovering from a series of scandals in 2017, including allegations of sexual harassment made by female employees, the forced resignation of its chief executive officer and the departure of other senior executives, and its use of illicit software to deceive regulators. 
A #DeleteUber campaign surged on social media. The negative publicity helped Lyft attract new drivers and riders without spending much on marketing. 
Lyft, which operates in the United States and a few Canadian cities, also moved to boost its market share, adding more than 100 new cities since 2017. It targeted socially conscious millennials who are concerned about harming the environment by owning a car.
""We have barely scratched the surface of helping shift the world from a car ownership model to a transportation-as-a-service model,"" Lyft's CEO Logan Green, who is also a co-founder, told Reuters.
Lyft's branding as a warmer, more caring alternative to Uber dates back to its launch in 2012. It borrowed marketing strategies from Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), hoping to portray itself as friendly and customer-centric, and likened itself to the championship Golden State Warriors pro basketball team, according to Lyft executives. 
'PRICE IS MAIN FACTOR'
Anna-Marie Wascher, CEO and founding partner at Flat World Partners, an institutional advisory and asset management firm and early Lyft investor, said market share growth came as ""consumers were being more discerning in their choices,"" and recognizing the gulf in company culture and values between the two firms.
While some Lyft riders have turned into loyalists as a result of its branding efforts and Uber's problems, many say they still pick the app with the lowest price.
""(My choice) is based on price and estimated time of arrival. But I would say price is the main factor,"" said John Nickele, who owns a bicycle in San Francisco and spends about $30 a week on Lyft and Uber.
Both Lyft and Uber have been criticized for causing congestion in cities and creating hazards to bicyclists and pedestrians. A study by the San Francisco County Transportation Authority found that about half of new congestion in San Francisco from 2010 to 2016 was from ride-hailing. 
Lyft said this week it will provide at least $50 million per year to cities to support transportation infrastructure, fight climate change and provide free rides to those in need, such as victims of natural disasters.
The first project will be in Los Angeles, where it will offer rides to individuals who provide services to the homeless.
Lyft's and Uber's relations with their drivers are not without strain. Lyft drivers this week held protests in San Francisco and Los Angeles over what they call wages that are too low to survive on. The company also faces a slew of arbitration claims and lawsuits from drivers who claim they are misclassified as independent contractors and owed back wages and reimbursement for expenses. 

Zimmer told Reuters he believes the company's ongoing work supporting drivers will help it stand apart from Uber. He said he still attends meetings with drivers to hear their grievances and exchanges texts with them.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global funds recommended switching cash back into equities in March as stocks have recovered smartly despite some turbulence this quarter from a deep sell-off late last year, a Reuters poll showed.
While there are clear signs of a global economic slowdown with the latest data showing the U.S. economy growing more slowly than initially thought in the fourth quarter, most major central banks have turned dovish, providing the impetus for stocks to climb higher.
Reuters' latest asset allocation poll of 40 fund managers and chief investment officers in Europe, the United States, Britain and Japan was taken at the tail-end of a more than 12 percent rally in the S&P 500 this quarter, which would mark its best quarterly performance since 2009.
Equity allocations accounted for an average 47.6 percent of their model global portfolio, from 45.9 percent in the previous month. That came at the expense of cash, which was cut to a four-month low of 5.8 percent from a more than three-year high of 7.2 percent in February.
Recommended bond holdings were also increased slightly to 39.8 percent from 39.3 percent in the previous month.
Investors and traders have been on heightened alert since the yield on the 10-year note fell below the three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate last week - widely seen as an indicator of a coming recession. 
But the latest Reuters poll showed a clear shift away from the more defensive approach among long-term investors held over the previous months.
""The rebound in the stock market in the first quarter suggests investors became overly pessimistic,"" said Alan Gayle, president at Via Nova Investment Management in Washington. 
""We believe the risks of a recession near-term remain low, and that favorable developments in monetary policy and trade negotiations can provide positive support for stocks as we head into the summer.""
STUMBLING BLOCKS 
The U.S. Federal Reserve left its federal funds rate on hold last week as expected, but its ""dot plot"" projections shifted and now suggest no hikes in 2019 compared with two in December.
A separate Reuters poll of economists concluded that the U.S. central bank is done with raising interest rates until at least the end of next year, with a significant chance of at least one rate cut by the end of 2020.
That comes after a similar Reuters survey which showed there is a significant risk the European Central Bank goes into the next economic downturn without having raised interest rates at all.
Nearly 85 percent of the fund managers who answered an extra question expect the upswing in U.S. equities to continue for at least another three months, including over 55 percent who said six months or more.
""Earnings expectations for equities are fairly low and valuations moderate. Another year of very supportive monetary and fiscal policy should provide support to higher price multiples,"" said Benjamin Suess, director at UBS Asset Management.
""Clearly, there are potential stumbling blocks ahead ... but as long as we don't run into a recession over the next 12 months, which is our base case, we don't expect a major bear market.""
When asked what is the most likely change to their portfolios over the next six months, more than 55 percent of asset managers who answered an additional question said they would roughly maintain their current risk positioning.
Over 30 percent of them said they would most likely reduce or take more defensive exposure to riskier assets or positions within the same asset class. The remaining said the most probable change would be to increase exposure.

""We are likely to continue to exploit risk rotation during the year, and take opportunities for some market volatility to add risk at more appealing valuations,"" said Pascal Blanqué, group chief investment officer at Amundi Asset Management in Paris.

168,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 07:51AM ET</span>",BP CEO Dudley's 2018 pay slips to $14.7 million,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  (LON:BP) Chief Executive Bob Dudley's pay package slipped to $14.7 million last year from $15.1 million in 2017, even though the oil and gas company's profits doubled to a five-year high.
The 63-year old, who took the helm shortly after the 2010 deadly Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, has overseen a large expansion in the company's production in recent years.
Dudley's wages and those of other executives in the sector have nevertheless come under growing scrutiny from investors, particularly following the 2014 collapse in oil prices. 
His 2017 remuneration was revised up to $15.1 million from the previously reported $13.4 million due to changes in the value of BP's shares over the period.
The drop in the 2018 package was the result of a reduced annual bonus and pension, which was partly offset by a rise in BP's share price, the company said in its 2018 annual report.
Dudley's 2016 pay package was cut by 40 percent after a majority of shareholders opposed the company's pay policy.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) CEO Ben van Beurden saw his pay package more than double to 20.1 million euros ($22.8 million) in 2018, mainly thanks to a bonus and an incentive plan for delivering on targets. It was the second highest pay on record for van Beurden since he became CEO in 2014.
Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne, on the other hand, saw his proposed salary reduced to 3.1 million euros ($3.6 million) from 3.8 million in 2017.

After settling the vast majority of payments for the 2010 spill, totaling nearly $70 billion, BP has more recently focused on growing production into the next decade, including the $10.5 billion purchase of BHP Billiton's U.S. shale assets, BP's largest deal in 30 years.

169,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 07:43AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Goldman’s China-backed fund bucks trade tensions to buy U.S. firm,"By Harry Brumpton, Echo Wang and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) invested money from China's sovereign wealth fund in a California-based industrial company and is looking for more U.S. deals, three sources familiar with the matter said, even after increased scrutiny from Washington all but stopped U.S.-China deals last year. 
The Wall Street bank is managing a private equity fund called China-U.S. Industrial Cooperation Partnership LP, which it launched with state-owned China Investment Corp (CIC) in November 2017 on the sidelines of U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to Beijing. 
The fund invested alongside Goldman to buy Boyd Corp, a Pleasanton, California-based manufacturer of rubber seals and gaskets, for $3 billion last September, the sources said.
Chinese efforts to invest in U.S. companies have been tripped up over the past year by Washington's concerns the Chinese were gaining control of sensitive technology or companies that played key roles in the economy.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a U.S. government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security risks, asked the Chinese owner of the dating app Grindr to divest it, spurred on by data privacy concerns.
Goldman successfully argued to CFIUS, however, that its plan to buy Boyd should be allowed to proceed, the sources said.
CIC's novel partnership with Goldman illustrates how China is adapting to U.S. curbs on its deal-making, which resulted in Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies plunging by 88 percent year-on-year in 2018, according to financial data provider Refinitiv, as trade relations between the world's two largest economies deteriorated. (For a graphic on Chinese acquisitions in the United States: https://tmsnrt.rs/2HzUTVE)
The Cooperation fund was set up expressly to help U.S. companies penetrate the Chinese market. And the fund is touting CIC's involvement as a strategic advantage in accomplishing this goal. 
In a confidential marketing document prepared for Goldman clients and seen by Reuters, the New York-based bank highlighted CIC's ""efficient sourcing of commercial partners and customers,"" promising to ""bring new pathways for growth via China.""
""The Cooperation fund is a U.S. fund run by a U.S. manager, and is managed to be in compliance with all laws and regulations, including CFIUS,"" a Goldman spokeswoman said.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, said the panel does not comment publicly on individual cases. 
CIC did not respond to requests for comment. The sovereign fund said last summer that it planned to press ahead with the Cooperation fund despite U.S.-China trade tensions, but details of its first deal have not been previously reported. The sources asked not to be identified because the Cooperation fund's details are confidential.
RIVAL CHINESE BIDDER BALKED
Even though Goldman received CFIUS clearance for the Boyd deal, it did not disclose publicly the Cooperation fund's involvement in the acquisition and most of Boyd's 4,200 employees were not told about the Chinese money, the sources said.
A Moody's Investors Service Inc credit rating note listed Boyd's acquirer as Goldman's flagship private equity fund West Street Capital Partners VII. After the deal, that fund transferred a minority stake in Boyd to the Cooperation fund, the sources said. 
A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment on why Goldman's Boyd-related announcements did not mention the Cooperation fund.
One Chinese company that sought to acquire Boyd outright had balked at the regulatory hurdles. 
Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co Ltd, a Chinese laminates manufacturer, said in regulatory announcements that it abandoned a bid for Boyd because it thought the ""China-U.S trade friction"" would make regulatory approval of the deal difficult.
Kangde Xin did not respond to a request for comment. Investment bankers said the company's failure to buy Boyd showed CIC would not have been able to do the deal without the structure offered by the Goldman fund. 
""This is a really innovative structure, one which could go a long way to enable them to undertake transactions that would be hard for them to do otherwise,"" said Euan Rellie, co-founder of BDA Partners, an investment bank that specializes in cross-border deals, referring to the Goldman fund and CIC.
ANCHOR INVESTOR
CIC, whose assets under management are approaching $1 trillion, also has investments in other private equity funds. But CIC does not typically help companies acquired by private equity funds it invests in grow in China. 
CIC also calls itself an ""anchor investor"" in the Cooperation fund, and the sources said it holds a sizeable minority stake that is larger than its typical private equity fund investments. 
""CIC is not involved in the investment management of the fund nor the operation of the fund's portfolio companies. CIC's role is to help Goldman Sachs, as the investment manager, identify and pursue opportunities for portfolio companies to do more business in China,"" the Goldman spokeswoman said.
The Cooperation fund, which targets $5 billion in investment capital, plans to execute between one and three deals a year on average, adding up to as many as 12 over the duration of the fund, two of the sources said. 
The fund is the most advanced in a series of similar investments by CIC. In an interview with Chinese state-owned newspaper Securities Times earlier this month, CIC's president, Tu Guangshao, said bilateral cooperation funds were a strategy to ""achieve a more favorable foreign investment regulatory environment"" and ""remove some barriers in cross-border investment."" 
Tu said CIC has inked a letter of intent for a Britain-China fund, signed a contract for a Japan-China Industrial Cooperation Fund and is ""in preparation for” China cooperation funds with Italy and France.

“When you get a couple more cases like this that look successful, other sovereign wealth funds and foreign investors will adopt this model,” said James Lewis, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

170,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 07:29AM ET</span>",Yield-Curve Inversion May Speed Up the Dash for Cash,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Imagine these two investment choices: three-month debt that offers a 2.35 percent annualized yield, or 10-year obligations that yield 2.68 percent. Which is the best option?
That might be a tough call. This might be easier: three months for 2.42 percent, or 10 years for 2.39 percent? 
Denizens of the $15.8 trillion Treasury market probably see where this is going. Those are the prevailing yield levels of three-month bills and 10-year notes at the start of 2019 and now. That part of the curve first inverted a week ago, raising the specter of a future recession and calling into question when the Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest rates. Investors have been on a bond-buying spree ever since, adjusting to the new reality of dovish central banks and potentially slowing global growth. In Europe and Japan, negative-yielding debt is the reality once more.
Yet largely unnoticed during the first quarter is the extent to which individual investors have flocked to shorter-dated Treasuries, enticed by the highest returns in more than a decade on what effectively amounts to cash. The group, which also includes partnerships, personal trusts, estates, nonprofit organizations and foundations, purchased $39 billion of bills at auctions in January and February, the most since at least 2009. 
Of course, bill auctions have also ballooned in size as the Treasury Department grapples with growing budget deficits. But even on a relative basis, individuals are making a statement. At the Jan. 22 auction of 13-week (or three-month) bills, for instance, they took 3.84 percent of the $42 billion sale, the largest share in eight years. One week later, they bought 4.4 percent of the Treasury’s 52-week bill auction, the second-highest allotment of this cycle. (The percentages are small because money-market funds, along with brokers and dealers, make up the overwhelming majority of T-bill buyers.)
It stands to reason that with significant portions of the yield curve inverted, individuals will at least keep up their pace of T-bill purchases, if not buy more. Of course, inversions happen for a reason. Traders are pricing in at least one Fed cut by the end of the year, which, if that happens, would leave bill buyers reinvesting at lower interest rates. If policy makers drop rates multiple times over the next few years, five-year notes yielding 2.2 percent will have looked like a steal (not to mention they’d surge in price). 
That’s part of the reason the core recommendation of interest-rate strategists at FTN Financial Capital Markets is to create a “barbell” portfolio. It combines, for instance, Treasuries maturing in one year, six years and eight years rather than just buying five-year notes outright. “Across four rate scenarios that run from cuts of 50bp to a 50bp hike within 12 months, a 1s/6s/8s approach works with a horizon through the end of this year,” FTN’s Jim Vogel wrote.
It’s basically market consensus at this point that the Fed has lifted interest rates as high as it will go this cycle. I’m not so convinced that officials will soon be lowering rates, but either way, it feels like now’s the time to make one last dash for cash. It wasn’t so long ago that Robinhood Financial LLC caught Wall Street’s attention by seeking to disrupt the traditional bank account with what effectively amounted to a money market fund (it ran into some roadblocks). For now, generic savings accounts from a number of banks still offer rates around the fed funds target range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. Some rates on certificates of deposit are just as high as yields on 30-year Treasuries.
In other words, there are any number of ways for individual investors to get into cash-like assets while short-term rates stay where they are. Purchasing Treasury bills directly isn’t for all mom-and-pop buyers, though with equities not far from record highs, it makes sense that entities like personal trusts and foundations would consider wading into the auction market to cut back on risk.
That sort of thinking will remain top-of-mind as long as the yield curve stays inverted and debate over recession risk intensifies. It just takes another market disruption like the final months of 2018 for cash to rule everything around the bond markets once more."

LONDON (Reuters) - Trade in a host of Europe's emerging economies and nearby Turkey will be hit if Britain crashes out of the European Union without a transition deal in place, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said on Friday.
The EBRD, which pumps in billions of euros into eastern Europe and Turkey each year, said 6.8 percent of the combined region's domestic value-added exports would be affected by any potential disruptions to trade linkages.
The share would be highest for Cyprus, Turkey and Poland, for which the British market accounts for 7.9 to 9.1 percent of total export volume, it added.
""In absolute terms, both Turkey and Poland would face the highest exposure to trade disruptions with domestic value-added exports of around $12 billion being directly and indirectly exported to the UK in 2015,"" an EBRD report said.
European Union diplomats believe Britain is more likely than ever to crash out of the EU, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing EU sources.
Britain will leave the EU on May 22 with a deal if Prime Minister Theresa May manages to push her withdrawal agreement through the UK parliament this week.
British politicians have overwhelmingly rejected the deal twice already, and May submitted a stripped-down version of her Brexit divorce deal to a vote in parliament on Friday in an attempt to break the impasse over the process.
A no-deal Brexit could cause pain not only via direct trade but also indirect exports through Europe's interlinked value chain, the EBRD report said.
It cited the example of car parts exported from Slovakia to Germany, where they are assembled and exported as a final product to Britain.

Affected trade volume is still likely to be relatively small though. On average it amounted to just 0.9 percent of total output of the EBRD countries in 2015, the report said.

Swedish-based H&M was among the shares gaining the most, rising 12.2 percent. The retailer reported its first-quarter pre-tax profit fell less than expected as it sold more products at full price and improved its margins.
H&M shares helped push up the retail index , which has risen nearly 20 percent this quarter.
The European labor market is robust, and the gains in personal income are boosting retail sales, said Bert Colijn an economist at ING.
Stocks also got a boost from reports that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he had a ""productive working dinner"" in Beijing as U.S.-China trade talks ended.
""Anything that's moving in the pro-trade directions is going to have a positive impact on European macros,"" Colijn said.
Shares in Galapagos surged nearly 15.2 percent after the Belgian drugmaker said it had seen positive results from several trials of a rheumatoid arthritis drug.
One of the continent's biggest travel firms, Tui AG, fell nearly 9 percent after it said it would take a 200 million-euro ($225 million) hit to profit in 2019 from the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX aircrafts.
Nordea Bank and Swedbank shed more than 10 percent each. Both went stocks ex-dividend on Friday, and New York's financial regulator reportedly has sent letters to the banks asking for details money-laundering investigation.
Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) fell more than 4 percent, dragging the telecom index lower.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) downgraded its stock to ""neutral"" from ""outperform"".
Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 was up 0.4 percent and Dublin's ISEQ, which typically moves on Brexit- related news, gained 0.1 percent.
Britain's parliament will hold a special sitting on Friday to discuss and vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed agreement for withdrawing from the European Union.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said if May's agreement was rejected, chances would increase for a long extension and a Brexit renegotiation based on new, softer, options. The likelihood of a snap election would also increase, it said.
""A rejection would bring us in unchartered territory again, as the pressure will be high to get the deal through the British Parliament before 12 April and an extension beyond this date becomes uncertain,"" Alexandra Dumitru, an economist at Rabobank, wrote in a note.

176,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chinese EV car maker NIO restricts its IPO banks from working for rivals - sources,"By Julia Fioretti and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker NIO Inc has blocked the eight top investment banks that did its IPO from working for rivals by tying them up in rare year-long non-compete clauses, several people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The move highlights the fierce competition between China's EV makers as they seek the capital needed to survive in a fast-growing market, also the world's largest. 
NIO, for its initial public offering in September, had hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and UBS.
These were also the top eight banks worldwide for equity sales in 2018, according to Refinitiv data.
The non-compete clause prevents them from helping NIO's rivals raise public or private funds for 12 months following the IPO, the sources said, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
NIO and the banks declined to comment. 
The list of rivals covered by the restrictions included up to 10 names, although it may have varied between the individual agreements, the people said.
Xpeng Motors and WM Motor were on that list, three sources said. A separate source said the list included those two and Byton, among others.
NIO's non-compete demands were particularly restrictive both in their breadth and duration, several sources said. 
Typically such deals restrict banks from working with rivals until the transaction closes or for a shorter period such as six months, two of the sources said.
""Issuers sometimes don't like it when you're doing an IPO for the competitors on a concurrent timetable because they will worry that you might divulge information to the benefit of the other clients,"" said Stephen Chan, partner at law firm Dechert LLP, speaking about general industry practices.
One banker involved in the NIO deal said his bank had lost mandates because of the non-compete clause. 
Adding to the banks' frustration, they had signed up to NIO's demands when the IPO was expected to raise about double the $1 billion it actually brought in - meaning banks would initially have expected a much larger payout. 
""It would have been interesting in hindsight seeing if it could have got the same agreement with people knowing what the actual valuation was going to be,"" a senior banker who worked on the deal said.
EV CAPITAL-RAISING RUSH
NIO's move comes at a time when many Chinese EV makers are considering IPOs or have launched private fundraisings as China cuts the subsidies it has historically offered as part of its efforts to curb pollution.
On Wednesday, China said it had raised its standards for NEVs that qualify for subsidies and reduced the amount it was willing to provide.
In January, Byton was seeking to raise at least $500 million to finance its growth, people familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time.
Earlier this month, WM Motor announced it closed its Series C funding round of 3 billion yuan ($446.16 million).
Reuters reported on Friday that Leap Motor, a smaller EV maker, was seeking a private fundraising of 2.5 billion yuan, advised by Deutsche Bank.
NIO itself did not stop with its IPO. 
In January, it sold a $750 million convertible bond to plug the gap between the money it raised in its IPO and what it had expected to raise.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 06:05AM ET</span>",Airports of Thailand to hold duty-free auction in May,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Airports of Thailand Pcl will hold the auction for its biggest duty-free concession at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport in May, the company said on Friday.
The existing duty-free license is set to expire in 2020, and AOT postponed the auction process earlier this month due to public concern over the perceived monopolistic structure of the bidding process and the concession.
The duty-free business is a major beneficiary of a tourism boom in Thailand, where arrivals exceeded 38 million people in 2018.
King Power Group, owner of the English Premier League's Leicester City Football Club, currently holds the licenses for duty-free retail and commercial activity at Suvarnabhumi, the country's main international airport, and also at airports in Chiang Mai, Hat Yai and Phuket.
Under a new arrangement, AOT has divided the new concession into two separate contracts - one for Suvarnabhumi which will be open for bidding in May and another contract covering Chiang Mai, Hat Yai, and Phuket airports that will not be open for bidding yet.
Another license up for auction in May is for non-duty-free commercial activity at Suvarnabhumi, which also expires in 2020.
AOT earned 16.7 billion baht ($526.2 million) from concessions in its last fiscal year, 13.3 percent more than a year earlier.
The concession will start on Sept. 28, 2020 and will expire on March 31, 2031, AOT said in a statement.
The bidding will take place on May 22 and results will be announced by May 31.

178,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 05:57AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, March 29:
1. U.S. stocks set for best quarterly performance since 2009
U.S. futures pointed to a higher open on Friday with the S&P 500 on track for gains of more than 12% in the first three months of the year in what would be its best quarterly performance since 2009.
Traders appeared to show optimism over recent developments in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, while a strong pricing in Lyft’s stock market debut gave the impression that demand for equities is still solid stateside. At 5:55 AM ET (9:55 GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures gained 46 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures rose 4 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 15 points, or 0.2%.
The end of the first quarter on a positive note may overshadow recent unease caused by the sharp drop in bond yields in the last 10 days.
The 10-year U.S. bond yield bounced slightly on Friday, rising to 2.41% by 5:56 AM ET (9:56 GMT) from a 15-month low of 2.35% reached a day earlier. The yield on the U.S. benchmark has undergone a relentless fall since the Federal Reserve last week cut its growth forecast for the year and indicated it didn't expect to raise interest rates till 2020 at the earliest.
2. U.S.-China have ‘productive working dinner’ on trade talks
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday he had a ""productive working dinner"" the previous night in Beijing, kicking off a day of talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.
Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer held meetings in Beijing Friday partly to ensure there were no discrepancies in the English and Chinese-language versions of the text, and also to balance the number of working visits to each capital, according to the officials cited by Bloomberg.
Talks are scheduled to continue with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in Washington next week. President Donald Trump's top economic advisor Larry Kudlow told reporters on Thursday that a deal could still take months to finalize.
3.  Lyft  's $24 billion IPO sets the stage for Uber, Pinterest
Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) was valued at $24.3 billion in the first initial public offering (IPO) of a ride-hailing startup.
The company priced an increased 32.5 million shares at $72 per share, the top of its already-increased price range, indicating strong demand for the deal.
High demand for what will be the biggest U.S. IPO since Snap in 2017 should bode well for Uber and Pinterest, which are also planning to go public in 2019 but, like Lyft, have yet to turn a profit. For what it's worth, Snap is down around 60% from its IPO price.

4. New home sales expected to bounce amid deluge of U.S. economic data
The parade of housing numbers continues on Friday with the latest on new home sales out at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT). On average, economists predict that new home sales bounced back in February to rise 1.3% to an annual rate of 620,000, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Before the bell, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will report personal income and spending numbers at 8:30 AM ET. That report also comes with the Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation gauge, albeit from back in January.
Personal income for February is forecast to have risen 0.3%, while personal spending - which will be reported for January - is expected to post a 0.3% rise as well.
That inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which excludes food and energy, is expected to have risen 0.2% in January, with the annual rate remaining at 1.9%.
The consumer will also be in focus as the University of Michigan issues its final measure of March consumer sentiment at 10:00 AM (15:00 GMT).
The Chicago purchasing manager’s index (PMI), which gives investors insight into manufacturing in the Midwest, will come out at 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT).
5. Pound under pressure ahead of third try on Brexit vote
The pound moved lower against the dollar and euro on Friday ahead of yet another U.K. vote on Britain’s departure from the European Union.
The U.K. House of Commons is set to vote once more on Prime Minister Theresa May’s twice-defeated Withdrawal Agreement later Friday, but the initiative seems doomed to failure, lacking the support of the Northern Irish party that May’s Conservatives rely on, and of hard-line Conservative Brexiteers themselves.
The most likely outcome of the bill failing is that May will ask the EU for a longer extension to the Brexit deadline of April 12th, accepting that this will mean taking part in EU parliamentary elections in May. It is not clear that there is the necessary unanimous support among EU governments for an extension, so a ‘Hard Brexit’ on April 12th remains the default scenario."

KRASNOYARSK, Russia (Reuters) - Russian aluminum giant Rusal has launched new production at its Boguchansk aluminum smelter in Siberia on Friday, doubling its capacity to 298,000 tonnes a year.
The new line, part of a larger project, is being started two months after Rusal was removed from a U.S. sanctions list. The world's largest aluminum producer outside China is now seeking to restore sales contracts to pre-sanctions levels.
""This is a complex big project that has a difficult and very long history,"" Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak told a ceremony in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk.
""It is very important that the Boguchansk aluminum smelter - one of the flagships of the aluminum industry - is being launched today,"" he said.
The smelter, which first started in 2015, previously had capacity of 150,000 tonnes a year.
Rusal produces about 3.8 million tonnes of aluminum a year and plans to keep its output flat in 2019. 
When the smelter project began 13 years ago, Rusal and its partner, Russian power company Rushydro, planned to raise Boguchansk's capacity to 600,000 tonnes a year, requiring $2.6 billion in investment.

The firms said on Friday they had invested a total of $1.6 billion to achieve capacity of 298,000 tonnes a year.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>","As IPO flood recedes, Asia bankers bet on follow-on capital raising","By Julia Fioretti
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Bankers in Asia are betting on newly-listed companies returning to the markets for fresh capital as last year's flood of initial public offerings (IPOs) slows to a trickle, with 2019 seeing the weakest start in equity sales in three years. 
Equity sales in the region, including IPOs, convertible bonds and follow-on sales, fell 41 percent to $49.1 billion in the first quarter, Refinitiv data show, the slowest since 2016.
Fees from equity capital market (ECM) deals have reached $966 million so far, bankers' worst quarterly haul in six years.
The data make for a sobering read after 2018 when Asia's red-hot markets hosted many multi-billion dollar IPOs, including SoftBank Corp's $23.6 billion Tokyo float and Xiaomi's $5.4 billion one in Hong Kong.
But bankers hope some of the gloom will be lifted as many of the companies that went public last year return for additional capital, making 2019 less a year of jumbo IPOs and more of follow-on capital raisings and convertible bonds.
""We are already seeing companies that went public last year coming back ... with follow-on offerings,"" said Goldman Sachs' David Binnion, co-head of equity capital markets, Asia ex-Japan. 
""In many situations these follow-on financings are coming sooner after listing than we have historically seen, reflecting the capital-intensive nature of these growth companies.""
Many firms that went public last year raised less than they had aimed for as investors pushed back against lofty valuations.
That will further drive follow-on activity, bankers said. 
Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, video streaming company iQIYI and e-commerce firm Pinduoduo, all 2018 IPOs, have come back to the market to raise funds. 
NIO raised $750 million in a five-year convertible bond this year, four months after it went public in New York, while iQIYI raised $1.1 billion in six-year convertible bonds this week in its second such issue within a year of its IPO.
Pinduoduo raised $1.6 billion in a follow-on offering in February, the fourth-largest ECM transaction this quarter.
Asian companies have sold $21.3 billion in convertible bonds so far, a record for this point in any year.
(Graphic: Asia ECM fees since 2013 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HJU9NG)
IPO SLOWDOWN 
After a blockbuster IPO year for Asia in 2018, led by Hong Kong that hosted deals worth $36.3 billion - its best year in eight - 2019 is expected to be much slower. 
""Some drivers of last year, such as mega IPOs out of China will probably be fewer,"" said Murli Maiya, co-head of investment banking coverage for Asia Pacific for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). 
""There should be continued investor interest in IPOs, but likely at different price points and in different sectors.""
Hong Kong's largest IPOs this year are likely to be from non-Chinese firms such as UK data centre operator Global Switch, which plans to raise $1 billion, and a spin-off of the Asian interests of the world's largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, which could raise over $5 billion, sources say.
The largest IPO in Asia this year so far was the $687 million float of Embassy Office Parks REIT in India, the country's first real estate investment trust IPO.
But bankers are optimistic the good performance of smaller IPOs, such as CStone Pharmaceuticals and Chinese broker Futu Holdings, will give investors confidence after the bleak performance of many newly-listed shares in 2018. 
Despite the headline-grabbing amounts raised in IPOs last year, many companies languished below their offer prices with Sino-U.S. trade tensions keeping investors on tenterhooks.

Successful floats will give ""investors the confidence that the IPO market is still an important contributor to performance and that's important for the rest of 2019"", said Jason Cox, head of ECM, Asia Pacific for  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).

181,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 05:06AM ET</span>",Huawei urges U.S. to drop 'loser's attitude' as carrier business revenue slips,"By Sijia Jiang and Anne Marie Roantree
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies called on Washington to drop the ""loser's attitude"" and once again rubbished U.S. allegations its gear could be used by Beijing for spying, as its network business weakened amid mounting global scrutiny.
""The U.S. government has a loser's attitude. It wants to smear Huawei because it cannot compete against Huawei,"" Guo Ping, rotating chairman of the world's top producer of telecoms equipment and No.3 maker of smartphones, said on Friday.
""I hope the U.S. can adjust its attitude,"" Guo said at a press briefing that was attended by more than 100 journalists from across the world. 
The U.S. embassy in China declined to comment.
Huawei reported a slower pace of profit growth for 2018 as its network business saw its first drop in revenue in two years, overshadowing a robust 45 percent jump in its smartphone unit.
Huawei's outlook has come under a cloud over the past year with the United States voicing concerns that its equipment could be used for espionage. Washington has also urged its allies to ban Huawei from building next-generation 5G mobile networks.
The latest blow for the company came on Thursday when Britain rebuked it for failing to fix long-standing security flaws in its mobile network equipment and revealed new ""significant technical issues"".
For 2018, the Shenzen-based firm reported a net profit of 59.3 billion yuan ($9 billion), up 25 percent from a year ago, versus a 28 percent rise in 2017. Revenue from its carrier business fell 1.3 percent to 294 billion yuan, which it blamed on telecommunications industry investment cycles. 
However, the surge in its consumer business sales to a record 348.9 billion yuan, driven by demand for its premium smartphone models such as the P series and Mate series, helped push global revenue to above $100 billion for the first time.
Its total revenue rose nearly 20 percent to about 721 billion yuan, marking the fastest pace of growth in two years.
The performance of consumer business was in line with what Huawei flagged in January, when it also said it could become the world's biggest-selling smartphone vendor this year. 
Guo said he expects all three business groups - consumer, carrier and enterprise - to post double-digit growth this year, although he did not provide a specific number.
The company has previously said it was targeting total revenue of $125 billion this year, a record high.
""Moving forward, we will do everything we can to shake off outside distractions, improve management and make progress towards our strategic goals,"" Guo said.
Huawei has ""prepared some inventories for uncertainties"" that has reduced its net cash position, Guo added, without giving any details.
SPYING WOULD BE ""SUICIDE""
To fight global concerns over its gear, Huawei has launched an unprecedented media blitz by opening up its campus to journalists and parading its typically low-key founder, Ren Zhengfei, in front of media.
It has stepped up the campaign in recent months after Meng Wanzhou, Huawei CFO and Ren's daughter, was arrested in Canada in December at U.S. behest on charges of bank and wire fraud in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. She denies wrongdoing.
The company has said the spying concerns are unfounded.
""Spying would be equal to suicide,"" said Song Liuping, Huawei's chief legal officer. 
""We have no intention of committing suicide.""
Huawei derived 48.4 percent of its business from overseas markets in 2018, versus 49.5 percent a year earlier. 
The company's fastest growing region was Europe, Middle East and Africa with a growth of 24.3 percent, followed by Americas with a growth of 21.3 percent. 

A top company executive said earlier this week that the U.S. campaign against Huawei was having little impact on its sales and that it was unlikely many countries would heed the U.S. call to ban its gear.

Japan is preparing to announce the allocation of bandwidth for 5G communications next month and the tension over telecommunications with China has posed problems for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. His government is seeking to rebuild long fractious ties with Beijing and also reliant on the U.S. for its defense.
Abe’s government has been careful not to single out Chinese companies for public criticism. But a December report from Japanese public broadcaster NHK said a change to regulations announced that month will effectively exclude China’s Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp (HK:0763). from Japanese government procurement.
“If the Japanese government’s approach is obviously unfair, it will definitely shake the confidence of mutual trust and business cooperation between the two countries and undermine the momentum of improvement and development of bilateral relations,” Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters Thursday. He said he was already aware of damage to Huawei and ZTE in Japan.
‘Normal Path’
Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Friday that Tokyo is not calling for specific countries or companies to be excluded from procurement. “Ties between Japan and China have returned to a normal path and are beginning to develop further. The government wants to elevate the relationship to a new level through frequent high-level visits,” Suga said.
After inheriting a relationship at its most hostile in decades when he took the helm in 2012 amid a territorial dispute, Abe last year became the first Japanese prime minister to pay an official visit to China since 2011. He hopes to welcome President Xi Jinping to Japan for the Group of 20 leading nations summit in June in what would be the Chinese leader’s first visit since taking office.
Security Risks
Japan’s three largest mobile carriers have banned Huawei and ZTE equipment from their base stations, Kyodo News reported in December. The Nikkei newspaper also said in December that the Japanese government was planning to call on businesses in 14 sectors including water, gas and air transportation, to avoid buying communications equipment seen as posing security risks.
U.S. officials have been pressuring allies to avoid Huawei equipment, citing security concerns. Washington also charges that the company stole intellectual property and violated sanctions on exports to Iran. Huawei has denied wrongdoing and repeated that it doesn’t provide spying back doors for the Chinese government.
The U.K., which is also preparing to roll out 5G services, on Thursday criticized Huawei in a report for failing to address security risks.
The introduction of 5G will provide a huge leap forward in speed, capacity and connectivity. For consumers, the first changes will be faster mobile data speeds -- eventually up to 100 times quicker than those of 4G, letting people download full-length movies in seconds."

Bank Indonesia's (BI) proactive monetary policies for markets, which have heavy foreign ownership, have also boosted investor confidence. It raised rates last year but has signaled readiness to lower them against the backdrop of slowing global demand and a sharp about-turn on policy tightening by the Fed. 
""We expect Indonesia will cut rates later this year to reverse some of its aggressive tightening stance in 2018 to ease monetary conditions as a less hawkish Fed gives central banks policy space to do so,"" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts expect BI to cut rates by 75 basis points in the third quarter, and the MSCI Indonesia index to rise 14.5 percent this year.
""Banks are the biggest beneficiaries from rate cuts, but we are also positive on (consumer) discretionary and real estate stocks,"" they said.

Nationwide Building Society said values in the capital dropped 3.8 percent year-on-year in the first quarter. That’s a seventh straight decline and leaves London as the worst-performing region in the U.K.
Nationally, values rose 0.2 percent in March from February, according to a report on Friday. the annual rate of change improved to 0.7 percent from 0.4 percent, though Nationwide said the market remains “subdued.”
Some of weakness relates to Brexit, which is having an impact on sentiment in the market. Consumer confidence remains close to its lowest level since 2013, according to GfK.
The uncertainty over when and how the U.K. will leave the European Union has gotten worse as the government extended the deadline, having so far failed to get lawmaker approval for its exit deal.

The deal comes after GM closed one of its four South Korean plants in late May and let go thousands of workers, as part of a global restructuring drive which culminated in a major financial support package from the South Korean government.
GM did not disclose the sales price of the Gunsan factory, but auto parts maker Myongshin said it would buy the land and buildings of the GM facility for 113 billion won ($99.5 million)on June 28.
Myongshin, also a Hyundai Motor supplier, is part of a consortium which would initially spend a total of 200 billion won on the factory to produce 50,000 EVs starting 2021 and 150,000 EVs in 2025, according to a statement by a provincial government.
""We aim to close this deal as soon as possible to ensure that there will be ongoing economic activity,"" GM Korea said in a statement. 
The consortium was in talks with an unidentified global automaker to manufacture electric vehicles at the facility, a source with direct knowledge of the matter earlier told Reuters, adding that it was not Tesla.
The plant could take advantage of South Korea’s free trade deal with the United States and Europe, as well as the country's electric car supply chain, he said. 
The electric car factory would create 900 jobs and another 2,000 at suppliers and other firms, the North Jeolla Province government said. 

GM's loss-making South Korean operation used to be a key manufacturing base for the company in Asia but it has been hit hard by the U.S. automaker's exit from Europe, a major export market. GM executives have also complained about labor costs and disputes.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 02:20AM ET</span>",A tax on a tax: U.S. customs demands bigger bonds as trade tariffs rise,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Stephen Wang is counting the costs of President Donald Trump's trade war. He had to put down 12 times more cash as a guarantee to U.S. customs that he would pay the bill for tariffs on the Chinese-made pumps, valves and motors he imports.
The cost of the guarantee - a U.S. customs bond - has shot up, an additional hit to importers already facing steep customs bills adding up to tens of billions of dollars for tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on incoming Chinese goods, as well as steel and aluminum imports.
Since coming into effect last year, the tariffs have pushed up manufacturing costs, upended decades-old global supply chains and inflated prices for consumers, resulting in lower sales and forcing companies to defer investments. This, in turn, has dimmed global growth outlook, roiling financial markets.
Other ripple effects are less obvious, among them the rising expense of U.S. customs bonds. But for small companies that can ill afford the added cost, the impact can be crippling.
Given the extra duties associated with Trump's tariffs, importers have been forced to post bonds that are worth much more to guarantee they can cover the added cost of bringing Chinese imports, and foreign steel and aluminum, into the United States.
In some cases, customs bond requirements have increased 500-fold, according to Reuters interviews with a dozen importers, underwriters and customs brokers.
""Managing the cash flow has become tough,"" said Wang. If the tariff war drags on, he warns, companies operating with thin profit margins and a weak capital base could go bust.
Wang is the chief executive of Hengli America, which procures supplies from China for customers such as CNH Industrial's construction and farm equipment units.
After duties on its merchandise surged from zero to $6 million a year, U.S. Customs required Hengli to post a $600,000 bond. Its previous bond was $50,000.
Other importers reported similarly sharp increases.
Lisa Gelsomino, chief executive officer at underwriting firm Avalon Risk Management, said one client recently had to replace a $50,000 bond with one worth $26 million.
The rise in tariffs means that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has issued thousands of importers with notices that their bonds are inadequate.
The CBP has issued about 3,500 insufficiency notices since January, it said. That compares to an average of 2,070 notices a year for the period between 2006 and 2017, according to data compiled by Roanoke Insurance Group. 
(Graphic on bond insufficiency notices https://tmsnrt.rs/2HwR2IM)
If importers fail to post a new bond within a month of receiving an insufficiency notice, customs officials can hold the cargo and charge additional fees. The CBP has around 224,000 active bonds on file.
No importer can ship goods into the country without posting a customs bond. The bonds are set at 10 percent of the importer's total estimated annual duties, fees and taxes.
The Trump administration's 25 percent import tariff on $50 billion of Chinese imported goods, and another 10 percent on $200 billion of imports, has added up. The annual tariff bill on Chinese goods alone stands at $32.5 billion - requiring $3.25 billion in additional customs bonds.
Separately, Washington has levied a 25 percent duty on imports of steel and a 10 percent duty on those of aluminum.
""You are talking millions of dollars that is going out,"" said David Meyer, head of customs brokerage and freight logistics company DJS International Services Inc.
""But you don't have a million dollar tree that you are shaking in your backyard to make sure that you have got that money...it has definitely become a burden for importers.""
More than half of Meyer's clients have seen at least a tenfold increase in their bond amounts.
SURGING BOND REQUIREMENTS
What is proving painful for some importers has been a bonanza for the firms that underwrite the bonds.
More costly bonds mean higher underwriting fees. They also mean higher collateral requirements. Since underwriters are on the hook if importers fail to pay duties, they want collateral that matches the value of the bond; underwriters usually require 1-1.5 percent of the bond amount to guarantee the bond.
At Roanoke Insurance Group, the workload has increased so much that staff are working on weekends to handle it, said Colleen Clarke, vice president at Roanoke.
In one example, she said, Roanoke required $9 million in collateral from a steel importer that was asked to post a $9 million bond after duties on its imports surged from zero to $90 million a year.
The steel importer also paid $90,000 in premium for the bond. The end result: the importer needed to come up with just over $99 million a year to continue to import $360 million of steel.
That is complicating finances for importers. The trade war has also driven up some raw material, freight and warehousing costs, raising the risks that some importers might default on payment obligations.
""Most of the importers are not used to paying these duties,"" said Roanoke's Clarke. ""The risk is – do they have cash infusion from somewhere else to pay these duties?""
Amy Magnus, who heads the National Customs Brokers & Forwarders Association of America, whose members work with over 250,000 importers and exporters, said a client who used to import Canadian steel went bankrupt after his shipments were subjected to a 25 percent tariff. She declined to share more details.
EXPENSIVE LOANS, DELAYED PAYMENTS
Four customs brokers told Reuters that some of their small-size clients had stopped importing goods altogether.
Hengli's Wang says his cash flow needs have risen fourfold since July, forcing him to delay payments to his Chinese suppliers. In addition to higher costs, he is losing customers - some have switched to cheaper non-Chinese goods suppliers.
Precision Components, whose customers include Fortune 500 companies, imports bearings from China. Since July 6, when U.S. tariffs on bearings imports rose 25 percent, the cost of each container it receives from China has risen by $15,000, said Dave Hull, the firm's president. The company imports around 40 containers a year.
It has been borrowing on average $200,000 a month since last July to meet its working capital requirements, Hull said, up from around $50,000 prior to that.
What's more, custom brokers, who sometimes pay duties on behalf of their clients, are demanding quicker repayment, said Jane Sorensen, president of the Chicago Customs Brokers & Forwarders Association.
They are asking importers to repay in 7-10 days, she said, compared with the more typical 30-day time frame.
Bill Sharpe, a customs broker in Chicago, says he has halved his collection time to 15 days. Even so, he worries about the risks of clients defaulting.

""We are having to keep a close eye on all our clients to make sure they don't turn into a credit risk,"" Sharpe said.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 02:02AM ET</span>",Regulators knew before crashes that 737 MAX trim control was confusing in some conditions: document,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. and European regulators knew at least two years before a Lion Air crash that the usual method for controlling the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX's nose angle might not work in conditions similar to those in two recent disasters, a document shows.
The European Aviation and Space Agency (EASA) certified the plane as safe in part because it said additional procedures and training would ""clearly explain"" to pilots the ""unusual"" situations in which they would need to manipulate a rarely used manual wheel to control, or ""trim,"" the plane's angle. 
Those situations, however, were not listed in the flight manual, according to a copy from American Airlines seen by Reuters.
The undated EASA certification document, available online, was issued in February 2016, an agency spokesman said.
It specifically noted that at speeds greater than 230 knots (265mph, 425kph) with flaps retracted, pilots might have to use the wheel in the cockpit's center console rather than an electric thumb switch on the control yoke.
EASA and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ultimately determined that set-up was safe enough for the plane to be certified, with the European agency citing training plans and the relative rarity of conditions requiring the trim wheel. 
In the deadly Lion Air crash in October, the pilots lost control after initially countering the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), a new automated anti-stall feature that was pushing the nose down based on data from a faulty sensor, according to a preliminary report from Indonesian investigators released in November. 
The flight conditions were similar to those described in the EASA document, a source at Lion Air said. The source said that training materials before the crash did not say the wheel could be required under those conditions but that Boeing advised the airline about it after the crash.
Boeing declined to comment on the EASA document or its advice to Lion Air, citing the ongoing investigation into the crash.
Ethiopia's Transport Ministry, France's BEA air accident authority and the FAA have all pointed to similarities between the Lion Air crash and an Ethiopian Airlines disaster this month. But safety officials stress that the Ethiopian investigation is at an early stage. 
'NOT PHYSICALLY EASY'
The crashes have also heightened scrutiny of the certification and pilot training for the latest model of Boeing Co's best-selling workhorse narrowbody, now grounded globally. 
In the EASA document, the regulator said simulations showed the electric thumb switches could not keep the 737 MAX properly trimmed under certain conditions, including those of the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, according to the Indonesian preliminary report and a source with knowledge of the Ethiopian air traffic control recordings. 
The trim system adjusts the angle of the nose. If the nose is too far up, the jet risks entering a stall.
Additional procedures and training needed to ""clearly explain"" when the manual wheel might be needed, according to the document. The EASA spokesman said that was a reference to the Boeing flight crew operations manual.
An American Airlines Group Inc flight manual for 737 MAX pilots dated October 2017 said the thumb switches had less ability to move the nose than the manual wheel. 
The manual, which is 1,400 pages long, did not specify the flight conditions in which the wheel might be needed.
The trim wheel is a relic of the Boeing 737's 1960s origins and does not appear in more modern planes like the 787 and Airbus SE A350. It is not often used, several current and former 737 pilots told Reuters.
""It would be very unusual to use the trim wheel in flight. I have only used manual trim once in the simulator,"" said a 737 pilot. ""It is not physically easy to make large trim changes to correct, say, an MCAS input. You - or more than likely the other pilot - have to flip out a little handle and wind, much like a boat winch.""
The EASA document said that after flight testing, the FAA's Transport Airplane Directorate, which oversees design approvals and modifications, was concerned about whether the 737 MAX system complied with regulations because the thumb switches could not control trim on their own in all conditions. 
FAA declined to comment on the European document. A trim-related ""equivalent level of safety"" (ELOS) memorandum listed in its 737 MAX certification document is not available on the FAA website. The agency declined to provide it to Reuters.
CONFUSING SIGNALS 
The night before the Lion Air crash, different pilots on the same plane faced a similar problem with MCAS and tried to use electric trim to counteract it, according to the preliminary report from Indonesian investigators. 
After the third time MCAS forced the nose down, the first officer commented that the control column was ""too heavy to hold back"" to counter the automated movements, the preliminary report said.
Former FAA accident investigator Mike Daniel said that to prevent stalls, the control column was designed to require more force for a pilot to pull back than to push forward. 
Boeing on Wednesday said software changes to MCAS would provide additional layers of protection, including making it impossible for the system to keep the flight crew from counteracting it. 
On the 737 MAX, Boeing removed the ""yoke jerk"" function that enabled pilots to disable the automated trim system with a hard pull on the control column rather than hitting two cut-out switches on the center console.
In a blog post on his personal website, former Boeing engineer Peter Lemme said that could make things harder for a pilot in a crisis.
""In the scenario where the stabilizer is running away nose down, the pilot may only fixate on pulling the column back in response,"" he said. ""They may not be mentally capable to trim back or cutout the trim - instead they just keep pulling.""
Ultimately the crew the evening before the Lion Air crash stopped the automated nose-down movement with the cut-out switches and used the wheel to control trim for the remainder of the flight, the preliminary report said. 
That was the proper procedure to deal with a runaway stabilizer, according to Boeing. 
However, current and former pilots told Reuters that the way the trim wheel and other controls behaved in practice compared with in training may have confused the Lion Air crews, who were also dealing with warnings about unreliable airspeed and altitude.
""MCAS activation produces conditions similar to a runaway trim, but the training is not done with a stick shaker active and multiple other failures, which make the diagnosis much more difficult,"" said John Cox, an aviation safety consultant and former commercial pilot. The stick shaker alerts pilots to a potential stall by vibrating the control column.
Reuters this month reported that an off-duty pilot in the cockpit on the night before the Lion Air crash spotted the runaway stabilizer problem, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

Boeing on Wednesday said changes to the MCAS software would help ""reduce the crew's workload in non-normal flight situations.""

190,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 02:00AM ET</span>",Global M&A slides in first quarter as Brexit weighs on Europe,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Liana B. Baker
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) sank 17 percent in the first quarter of 2019, as concerns about an economic slowdown and fears of a no-deal Brexit in Europe spooked chief executives and corporate boardrooms from pursuing big tie-ups.
While dealmakers expected a slowdown after 2018 emerged as the third-strongest year on record for M&A around the world, some worrying signs emerged, including a major drop in cross-border activity. 
Cross-border M&A fell 45 percent in the first quarter of the year, as companies focused mainly on building scale on their home turf. Activity in Europe plunged 67 percent, according to Refinitiv data, and dragged down global M&A volumes to $927 billion.
""Many companies feel there is a lot at stake given all the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the trade tensions between the U.S. and China,"" said Dirk Albersmeier, co-head of EMEA M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
While megadeals in the United States, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co's $74 billion deal to buy  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG), were a bright spot lifting global activity, Europe saw the average deal size shrinking well below the $5 billion mark.
Britain lost its ranking as the world's third-biggest M&A market to Saudi Arabia, with activity down 62 percent to $40 million while German M&A tanked 76 percent to $17 million.
The region could remain anemic for deals for some time, investment bankers said, with the exception of some companies having to merge to build national champions, such as German lenders  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
British companies planning their post-Brexit survival could also turn to deals to better withstand a possible downturn, said Philip Noblet, head of UK investment banking at Jefferies. 
""The amount of pressure on these companies will accelerate in the coming months and for some the choice will be between domestic consolidation and restructuring,"" Noblet said.
Currency volatility in Britain has so far deterred overseas buyers from bidding for global champions trading in London, but that could change after Brexit, Noblet added.
While global stock markets rose in the first quarter, central banks appeared to be bracing for decelerating growth. Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Reserve abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year amid signs of an economic slowdown. 
""The macro-economic outlook is murky,"" said Wilhelm Schulz, chairman of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Inc's EMEA M&A. ""It's not just because of Brexit or trade tensions. The main reason why people are sitting on the sidelines is the slowdown in global growth.""
U.S. OFF TO A STRONG START
In contrast to Europe, the United States, which is the largest M&A market, got off to its strongest start since 2000, with $489.52 billion dollars in announced deals, up 9.4 percent compared to a year ago. 
The number of deals was down by 40 percent year-over-year, however, indicating that big-ticket transactions were the main driver. 
Consolidation in the healthcare industry, which was the busiest sector with $181 billion in value, shows no signs of slowing down, said Sullivan & Cromwell LLP M&A lawyer Krishna Veeraraghavan.
""Between competition for new drugs, improving technology, the aging of the global population, a number of factors will continue to drive M&A in the healthcare sector, whether it's biotech or insurance providers,"" Veeraraghavan said.
Unsolicited approaches, such as Barrick Gold Corp's $18 billion bid for  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM) in February, made a comeback, as well as offers to gatecrash previously announced deals. This exuberance could be a sign of the M&A markets overheating, investment bankers said. 
In March, Germany's pharma group Merck KGaA launched a hostile $5.9 billion all-cash takeover offer for Versum Materials, which already had agreed to a merger with U.S. rival Entegris.
British packager RPC Group ditched a previous deal to be acquired by Apollo Global Management LLC after receiving a higher offer from plastics maker Berry Global Group Inc worth 3.34 billion pounds ($4.4 billion).
""We haven’t seen this volume of deal jumps in a long time, especially cross-border activity, until this quarter. This is significant because it signals an elevated level of energy and a willingness to take more risk,"" said Michael Carr, co-head of Goldman Sachs' Mergers & Acquisitions Group.
Companies could now time their deals to get out ahead of the start of the 2020 election cycle, said UBS Group AG's co-head of Americas M&A said Marc-Anthony Hourihan. 
""No technology or healthcare company would want their deal to become a talking point during the U.S. primaries,"" Hourihan said. ""Clients are already thinking about their game plans for political football.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese refineries have put a halt on imports of Iranian oil after buying 15.3 million barrels between January and March ahead of the expiry of a temporary waiver on U.S. sanctions, according to industry sources and data on Refinitiv Eikon.
The waiver, which allowed Japan to buy some Iranian oil for another 180 days, expires in early May. However, Japanese refiners want to ensure enough time for all cargoes already loaded to arrive in Japan and for payments to be completed.
""We think it would be difficult to keep on lifting Iranian oil after March,"" a Fuji Oil spokesman said, noting that banks and insurance companies want to make sure all the transactions and deliveries are done well before the waivers expire.
The last Iranian oil cargo onboard supertanker Kisogawa is expected to arrive at Chiba, Japan, on April 9, the data showed.
The United States last year demanded that nations cut all Iranian oil imports when it reimposed sanctions on the country's petroleum sector on Nov. 4 over Tehran's nuclear program.
However, Washington granted temporary exemptions to Iran's biggest oil clients - Japan, China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Italy, Greece and Turkey.
Refiners in Japan, the world's fourth-biggest oil consumer, had stopped loading Iranian oil by mid-September, and only resumed loading in late January after banks received government assurances about processing payments to Iran.
Japan has loaded 15.3 million barrels of Iranian crude in the first three months this year, which is equivalent to 86,430 barrels per day (bpd) during the six-month waiver period, according to Refinitiv data and Reuters calculations.
This represents a 33 percent drop from an average of 129,300 bpd that Japanese companies lifted between January and September last year before the sanctions kicked in, Refinitiv data showed.
The drop was more than the 20 percent reduction in supplies that Washington was said to have sought from each country over the six-month waiver period.
Japan has increased imports from the Middle East, Russia and the Americas as its Iranian imports fell, according to government data. 
Japanese refiners have been pushing the government to seek an extension of the U.S. sanctions waivers after the initial exemption period expires.
Japanese officials and their U.S. counterparts met earlier this month in Washington to discuss the U.S. sanctions.
""I think the waiver could be extended, but maybe for a smaller volume and for a smaller number of countries,"" said Takayuki Nogami, chief economist at Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. 
""If the U.S. government does not extend the waiver, it could push crude oil prices up significantly as the gasoline season approaches and it could hurt Trump's reputation,"" he said.
On Wednesday, Japan extended state-backed insurance to cover imports of oil from Iran for another year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday delayed a controversial plan aimed at evaluating how stock exchange fees and incentives affect how brokers trade, while the exchanges sue the regulator in an attempt to kill the experiment.
The SEC approved its so-called Transaction Fee Pilot in December, aimed at testing how lucrative rebate payments from exchanges to brokers for stock orders that others can trade against influences brokers' behavior. 
But Nasdaq Inc, Cboe Global Markets and Intercontinental Exchange Inc's NYSE, which together own 12 of the 13 U.S. stock exchanges, all filed lawsuits against the SEC in February saying the plan was an exercise in government price-setting and would put controls on competition.
""Without addressing the merits of petitioners' challenges to the rule or the pilot program, the Commission has determined to exercise that discretion to grant a stay, in part. Pending a decision by the court of appeals,"" the SEC said as it put the plan on hold on Thursday.
The big exchange operators had said the one-to-two-year pilot program would hurt the companies whose stocks would not be eligible to receive rebates for liquidity-adding stock orders.
""The Commission's action is a positive development for publicly-traded companies and Main Street investors, as it recognizes the arbitrary nature of the program and the complexity of its implementation,"" Nasdaq spokesman Joseph Christinat said following the SEC's announcement.
Cboe also said it was ""pleased"" with the SEC's decision.
The SEC, in part, aimed to gather data from the experiment that could show if the rebates, which added up to around $2.5 billion last year, create conflicts of interest by giving incentives to brokers to send customer orders to the exchanges that pay the biggest rebates.
Those customers might get better results elsewhere, say critics of the rebate regime, which include some of the world's largest asset managers.
The exchanges say rebates help attract liquidity, while also compensating brokers, especially market makers, for taking the risk of providing two-sided bid and ask prices for others to trade against.
The pilot program was recommended by a SEC-appointed committee of market experts, as well as by the U.S. Treasury in a report in late 2017.

Because the SEC granted only a partial stay of the pilot, the exchanges will still have to begin gathering data on broker order routing behavior to provide to the regulator if the pilot goes ahead.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's two largest state-controlled banks warned bad loans could rise and interest margins would shrink, as they posted their weakest quarterly profit growth in more than two years.
Top lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) reported flat net profit of 58.05 billion yuan ($8.63 billion) for the fourth quarter, the first time it has seen no growth in a quarter since the July-September 2016 quarter.
And China Construction Bank Corp, the country's second-largest lender, posted on Wednesday a 1 percent drop in net profit, its first quarterly decline since the October-December 2015 quarter.
While non-performing loan (NPL) ratios edged down by 0.01 percentage points at each bank, both sharply increased their provisions for future bad debt to cushion themselves against a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy and festering China-U.S trade tensions.
""We deeply feel it's quite difficult to maintain the low bad loan level. There are external factors, our own reasons, problems with multi layers of local governments and other pressure,"" said Xu Yiming, CCB's chief financial officer, in Beijing on Thursday.
""Do not think we are doing so well with 1.46 percent NPL ratio. It is very fragile. Once the environment changes, it can increase.""
China's economy grew last year at its slowest pace since 1990, partially due to the trade war and Beijing's crackdown on financial risks, which raised corporate borrowing costs.
To spur growth, Beijing is pushing banks to significantly boost lending to small businesses by at least 30 percent this year - a move that some analysts say could worsen banks' future asset quality as those borrowers are riskier and more vulnerable to slowdowns.
ICBC set aside more than 160 billion yuan in provisions last year and lifted its provisions to 176 percent of its non-performing loans at end-December from 154 percent a year earlier, President Gu Shu said on Thursday. 
CCB's ratio rose to 208 percent at end-December from 171 percent a year earlier.
""With a slowing economy and with also industrial profits undershooting meaningfully, for us it's no surprise that provisions will have to go up from here,"" said Gaël Combes, Geneva-based head of equities fundamental research at fund manager Unigestion, which has a small holding of Chinese bank shares.
ICBC's board on Thursday approved a plan to sell 80 billion yuan in perpetual bonds to boost capital. Peer Bank of China (BoC), the country's fourth-largest lender, sold 40 billion yuan worth of perps in January.
SHRINKING MARGINS
Net interest margin (NIM) - the difference between interest paid and earned by banks and a key gauge of profitability - narrowed at CCB and stayed flat at ICBC, while bankers and analysts say the pressure on NIM will only increase this year.
Margins are being squeezed by increased competition for deposits as well as the pressure from Beijing to boost lending but keep borrowing costs down. 
""We are facing challenges in maintaining NIM this year. It will not be as comfortable as last year,"" said ICBC's Gu, who said the bank would work hard to avoid passing on higher borrowing costs to its clients.
""It is not easy for the real economy these days so we will not pursue high pricing on the asset side,"" he said.
The other three of China's so-called Big Five state banks, including Agricultural Bank of China Ltd and Bank of Communications Co Ltd,, will report fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Friday.

""2019 is bound to be different - acceleration in loan growth, especially to the private sector, but less margin as banks will be pushed to pass on the reduction in cost of funding to their clients especially SMEs,"" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist of Natixis Asia Pacific.

The trade talks were in focus after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the U.S. is prepared to negotiate with China for moths in order to reach a trade deal.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 1.4% and 1.6% by 10:15 PM ET (02:15 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.6%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 advanced 1%. South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.2%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 traded 0.4% higher.
The focus remained on the U.S.-China trade negotiations. In a speech in Washington on Thursday, Kudlow said negotiations could take a few more weeks, or even months.
“We have to get a great deal, as the president says, that works for the United States. That’s our principal interest,” he said.
Kudlow also said the U.S. may remove some of the tariffs on Chinese goods.
“We’re not going to give up our leverage,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that all of the tariffs would be kept in place. Some of the tariffs would be kept there. Again, when Bob Lighthizer comes back, he will illuminate all of us on that. That’s part of the negotiations and we’ll see.""
His comments eased investor worries that a lack of progress on talks could lead to an all-out trade war.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin began a two-days meeting with Chinese negotiators in Beijing on Thursday. Mnuchin told reporters that he had a “productive working dinner.” Officials are set to continue the discussions today.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Washington next to meet with U.S. negotiators as well as President Donald Trump, according to Kudlow."
197,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 10:14PM ET</span>",U.S. lawsuit filed against Boeing over Ethiopian Airlines crash,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A lawsuit against Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co was filed in U.S. federal court on Thursday in what appeared to be the first suit over a March 10 Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash that killed 157 people.
The lawsuit was filed in Chicago federal court by the family of Jackson Musoni, a citizen of Rwanda, and alleges that Boeing, which manufactures the 737 MAX, had defectively designed the automated flight control system.
Boeing said it could not comment on the lawsuit.
""Boeing ... is working with the authorities to evaluate new information as it becomes available,"" it said, adding all inquiries about the ongoing accident investigation must be directed to the investigating authorities. 
The 737 MAX planes were grounded worldwide following the Ethiopian Airlines disaster, which came five months after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia that killed 189 people.
Boeing said on Wednesday it had reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is facing mounting scrutiny in the wake of two deadly nose-down crashes in the past five months.
The planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in at least one of the accidents, in Indonesia last October, would only do so once per event after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.
The crash of Boeing's passenger jet in Ethiopia raised the chances that families of the victims, even non-U.S. residents, will be able to sue in U.S. courts, where payouts are much larger than in other countries, some legal experts have said.
Wednesday's complaint was filed by Musoni's three minor children, who are Dutch citizens residing in Belgium.
The lawsuit says Boeing failed to warn the public, airlines and pilots of the airplane's allegedly erroneous sensors, causing the aircraft to dive automatically and uncontrollably.

Ethiopian officials and some analysts have said the Ethiopian Airlines jet behaved in a similar pattern as the 737 MAX involved in October's Lion Air disaster. The investigation into the March crash, which is being led by the Ethiopian Transport Ministry, is still at an early stage.

The airline will continue working with team members, union leaders and other key stakeholders to restart service when conditions are right, a company spokeswoman told Reuters on Thursday.
American Airlines had temporarily suspended its flights to the country earlier this month after its pilots union urged its workers to deny trips in the wake of a travel advisory issued by the U.S. State Department.

200,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 08:05PM ET</span>",No call for simulators in new Boeing 737 MAX training proposals,"By Eric M. Johnson, Alwyn Scott and Allison Lampert
SEATTLE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said it will submit by the end of this week a training package that 737 MAX pilots are required to take before a worldwide ban can be lifted, proposing as it did before two deadly crashes that those pilots do not need time on flight simulators to safely operate the aircraft. 
In making that assessment, the world's largest planemaker is doubling down on a strategy it promoted to American Airlines Group Inc and other customers years ago. Boeing told airlines their pilots could switch from the older 737NG to the new MAX without costly flight simulator training and without compromising on safety, three former Boeing employees said. 
At the time billions of dollars in plane orders hung on Boeing's ability to deliver a new plane that matched European rival Airbus SE in performance but kept changes and training for pilots converting from a previous model to a minimum. Airbus had already booked hundreds of orders for its A320neo jet, which came to market nine months ahead of Boeing.
At Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington, managers told engineers working on the MAX, including its anti-stall system known as MCAS, their designs could not trigger Level C or D training designations from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, the three former Boeing employees and a senior industry executive with knowledge of MAX development told Reuters. Otherwise, pilots would have to spend time in simulators before flying the new planes. Instead pilots will need to complete a roughly 30-minute training program on a computer.
""Boeing said all along that we believe that we can design this new MAX with all the fuel efficiencies and design improvements over the NG and it will only require Level B training,"" said a former Boeing test pilot with direct knowledge of the matter, referring to an earlier iteration of the 737 jetliner. 
Level B training does not involve simulators. 
On Wednesday, Boeing outlined a series of changes to the MCAS system. It continues to believe existing emergency protocols allow pilots to correct a runaway stabilizer, which can be caused by a MCAS failure among other things. Boeing says its new changes give pilots more authority. (Graphic: Understanding controls on the Boeing 737 MAX, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2OjLSAt)
SYSTEM UNDER SCRUTINY
The amount and quality of training that Boeing and airlines provided to 737 MAX pilots is one of the issues as investigators around the world try to determine the causes of two 737 MAX crashes within five months that claimed 346 lives. All 737 MAX airliners are grounded until regulators around the world approve the new software and training protocols.
The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Boeing's development process and what Boeing disclosed about MCAS.
A Boeing spokeswoman said the company followed industry standards and conducted thorough safety analyses in designing the MAX flight controls and other systems. 
""The design and certification of the MCAS flight control law adhered to these processes and assumptions,"" she said. 
The decisions to avoid simulator training had their roots in the company's decision under intense pressure from the aircraft market over a weekend in 2011 to change strategy and outfit an upgraded 737 with more efficient engines similar to those on the new Airbus, rather than build an all-new design. 
The new 737 MAX engines had to be mounted further forward on the wing, raising the risk that the plane's nose would tilt up, threatening a stall in some situations.
MCAS was designed to automatically and powerfully push the nose down if data from an ""angle of attack"" sensor mounted near the front of the plane showed risk of a stall. 
Former Boeing engineers who worked on MCAS said there was no pressure to compromise safety. After analyzing solutions for MCAS, Boeing's engineers chose a simpler design for solving the jet's pitch-up tendency, according to the three former Boeing employees and an industry executive with knowledge of the decision. 
""It wasn't necessarily the simplest way to get around the regulations,"" said Mike Renzelmann, a former Boeing engineer who worked on flight controls on the 737 MAX. ""It was the safest way to get around the regulations.""
MCAS was just one of many so-called control laws on the 737 MAX, a few lines of code embedded into the flight control system. 
""It's always a balance between complexity and availability of the function. The more complex you make something, the more likely it is to be unavailable when you need it,"" a Boeing official said.
LAST LINE OF DEFENSE Boeing rated MCAS a ""hazardous"" risk, an FAA term that means multiple deaths could result if the system failed, the Boeing official said. That is a step below ""catastrophic,"" which could cause loss of the plane and death of all on board. 
Boeing's rationale was that trained pilots would know how to respond if MCAS failed, the official said. Long-established procedures for runaway stabilizer trim would prompt pilots to shut down MCAS, whether they knew it existed or not.
Under FAA rules, hazardous risks are allowed to happen more frequently than catastrophic ones.
One industry source familiar with plane certification said he was ""astonished"" that Boeing was able to gain FAA approval for the MCAS system with one angle of attack sensor and pilots as backup. 
""In reality, no single device is that robust and reliable which is why there needs to be mitigations,"" he said.
On Wednesday, Boeing said the MCAS system would now rely on two sensors. 
During nine to 12 months of MAX flight testing, test pilots injected errors into the flight system that tested stall conditions and runaway stabilizer, among other scenarios, the people said. But no one was aware of a specific test of an MCAS failure mode triggered by erroneous sensor data.

""The problem with these two accidents is that there were failure modes that people didn't analyze properly or consider they could happen that way,"" according to an FAA official with direct knowledge of the 737 MAX certification.

201,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 07:42PM ET</span>",U.S. charges Facebook with racial discrimination in targeted housing ads,"By Katie Paul and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - The Trump administration accused  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) on Thursday of selling targeted advertising that discriminated on the basis of race, in violation of the U.S. Fair Housing Act.
Seeking damages and unspecified relief for harm caused, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_19_035 in its civil charge that Facebook also restricted who could see housing-related ads based on national origin, religion, familial status, sex and disability.
Facebook said it had been working with the department to address the concerns and was surprised by the decision to issue the charge, having taken ""significant steps"" to prevent ads that discriminate across its platforms.
The company also said the government had ""insisted on access to sensitive information - like user data - without adequate safeguards,"" adding that it was willing to provide aggregate reports but not user-level personal information.
The Housing Department claims Facebook mines data about its users and then employs machine learning to predict their responses to ads in ways that may recreate groupings defined by characteristics such as race.
A spokesman for the department declined to comment on the details of the discussions.
The social media giant last week agreed to overhaul its paid advertising platform as part of a wide-ranging settlement with U.S. civil rights groups, which had filed five separate lawsuits accusing the company of enabling discrimination in advertising.
Under U.S. law, including the federal Fair Housing Act, it is illegal to publish certain types of ads - including online ads - if they indicate a preference based on race, religion, sex or other specified classifications.
As part of last week's settlement, Facebook said it would create a new advertising portal for ads linked to housing and employment that would limit targeting options for advertisers. It also pledged to build a tool that would allow users to search all current housing ads listed in the United States, regardless of whether the ads were directed at them. 
The government charge said Facebook enabled advertisers to exclude people whom the social network's data classified as parents, non-American-born, non-Christian, or a variety of other interests that closely align with the Fair Housing Act's protected classes. 
""Facebook is discriminating against people based upon who they are and where they live,"" Department Secretary Ben Carson said. ""Using a computer to limit a person's housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone's face.""
GROWING DISCONTENT
The Housing Department has also requested information about ad targeting from Twitter and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook's main competition for online advertising dollars, but has not launched an investigation into either company, the spokesman said.
Both Twitter and Google denied allowing discriminatory advertising, although they said that they do allow advertisers to target by gender.
Researchers have told Reuters that gender targeting could potentially be a violation of the Fair Housing Act.
Discrimination against transgender individuals was prohibited, Google said.
""We've had policies in place for many years that prohibit targeting ads on the basis of sensitive categories,"" Google said in a statement.
Advertising practices at Facebook, the world's largest social network with 2.7 billion users and $56 billion in annual revenue, have been in the spotlight for two years amid growing discontent over its approach to privacy and user data.
News organization ProPublica reported as far back as 2016 that advertisers could target ads through Facebook based on people's self-reported jobs, even if the job was ""Jew hater.""
ProPublica later reported that it was able to buy discriminatory housing ads and slip them past Facebook's review process, despite the company's claims it was blocking such ads.
Since then, Facebook has faced legal pressure over the issue from the National Fair Housing Alliance, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Communications Workers of America, among others.
The ACLU welcomed the complaint, saying it would add ""much-needed pressure"" on the company on top of last week's settlement. It encouraged the department to investigate other online ad targeting platforms.
""Although the settlement we reached with Facebook will result in removing many of the most troubling of Facebook's advertising practices, there is more work to be done,"" Galen Sherwin, an ACLU attorney, said in a statement.

The charge will be heard by a judge who can award damages for harm caused by the discrimination, along with fines, injunctions and other relief.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 07:40PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan steps down,"By Imani Moise and David Henry
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Thursday Tim Sloan will resign immediately as chief executive, becoming the second CEO to leave the bank in the fallout of a wide-ranging sales practices scandal.
The board said in a statement it concluded it was best to seek an outside candidate to replace Sloan. The bank's general counsel, C. Allen Parker, one of the few newcomers in the bank's top ranks, will serve as interim chief executive.
The move amounted to an admission that the board erred three years ago by appointing another insider after the previous CEO, John Stumpf, resigned following revelations that Wells Fargo had opened potentially millions of unauthorized consumer accounts. Prior to becoming CEO, Sloan served as chief operating officer and head of the wholesale bank.
In a Thursday conference call, Sloan, 58, said he decided to leave because the focus on him had become a distraction inhibiting the bank from moving forward.
""I want to assure all of our stakeholders that this was my decision and is not related to our first-quarter financial performance, the long-term outlook for the company or any newly discovered issues,"" he said. 
On the call, analysts tried unsuccessfully to get a direct answer to whether regulators had given Sloan the final push, or even whether the bank had been surprised by the most recent criticism from the Comptroller of the Currency.
Board Chair Betsy Duke declined to say what qualifications directors want in the next CEO, including whether they will insist on having an executive with banking industry experience. She said the person will be someone who really wants ""the challenge and the opportunity...That is the person we want.""
She added the bank has not yet spoken with anyone regarding the CEO position, and the search committee will meet for the first time on Friday. As recently as a week ago, the board had reiterated its unanimous support for Sloan. 
Critics had accused Sloan, who was part of the management team while the wrongdoing was happening, of being too entrenched in Wells Fargo's culture to change it, even as the bank tried to do just that and move past its scandals.
In March 2018, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed an unprecedented asset cap on Wells Fargo, barring it from growing its balance sheet until it improved risk management controls. Wells Fargo has said it expects to operate under the cap for the remainder of the year.
It is not yet clear what was the final straw for Sloan. However, the banks primary regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, criticized the bank in recent weeks. ""What happened at Wells Fargo really was a remarkably widespread series of breakdowns really in their risk management apparatus,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said.
The Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency both declined to comment on Sloan's departure.
As Wells Fargo tried to move on, it got rid of the lofty sales incentives that led to the fake accounts and repaid millions to customers who were improperly charged fees. But reputational issues continued to hang over the bank as it racked up billions in settlements and fines.
Wells Fargo has long prided itself on its homegrown culture. But the bank's insularity proved burdensome in recovering from the scandal. 
""The best thing he (Sloan) could do for the company was to retire. In the long run, it is the right move,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy said.
Sloan had become a perpetual target for politicians who repeatedly called for his removal. U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown recently called for his resignation. Earlier this month, he was grilled by the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. 
Parker, the interim head, joined Wells Fargo from an outside law firm as general counsel in March 2017 to help turn around the bank. At the time he was the only one of 11 top executives who had not been at the bank during the scandal.
Parker will receive an annual base salary of $2 million, according to filings. Sloan's departure came two weeks before the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets was due to report first-quarter results and a month before its annual shareholder meeting. In 2016, the bank agreed to pay $185 million to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies, the largest fine of its kind, to settle a sales practice scandal in its consumer retail bank. Two weeks ago, the bank said Sloan received a 5 percent pay raise for 2018, with base salary of $2.4 million, $14 million in stock awards and a $2 million bonus based on the bank's financial performance.

The bank said in a filing that Sloan will not receive any additional compensation for his sudden exit, though he still stands to earn millions in stock awards as part of the company's retirement plan.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday rejected Nestle SA's bid to dismiss a revised lawsuit claiming that it defrauded consumers by filling bottles of its Poland Spring water with ordinary groundwater.
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Alker Meyer said consumers from eight northeastern states may pursue claims that Nestle Waters North America deceived them into overpaying by labeling Poland Spring as ""100% Natural Spring Water.""
The New Haven, Connecticut-based judge allowed claims on behalf of consumers from Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. He said federal law preempted claims from Vermont consumers.
Nestle Waters had argued there was ""no fraud"" because its water met the various state requirements. Meyer had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit last May.
""We remain highly confident in our legal position and will continue to defend our Poland Spring brand vigorously against this meritless lawsuit,"" a Nestle Waters spokeswoman said in a statement on Thursday. ""Poland Spring brand natural spring water is just what it says it is -- 100 percent natural spring water.""
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to the amended complaint, Nestle Waters sells 1 billion gallons of Poland Spring a year in the United States, and ""not one drop"" of its water ""emanates from a water source that qualifies as a genuine legal 'natural spring.'""
The actual Poland Spring in Maine, which the defendant's labels said is a source of Poland Spring water, ""commercially ran dry"" nearly 50 years ago, the complaint said.
In his earlier dismissal, Meyer said the plaintiffs were trying merely to enforce guidelines for spring water under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and that this preempted their state law claims.
But in Thursday's decision, he said he was ""convinced"" the plaintiffs would try to show only that Poland Spring water did not meet the states' individual spring water standards, though they appeared to ""mirror"" the federal standard.

The case is Patane v. Nestle Waters North America Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut, No. 17-01381.

GENEVA/PARIS (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization said on Thursday the United States had ignored its request to halt a subsidized tax break for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co in its main plane-making state of Washington as a 15-year-old transatlantic trade row edges towards tit-for-tat sanctions.
The European Union said the WTO appeal ruling had vindicated its claims that Boeing continued to receive illegal subsidies, but the United States said only one measure, a Washington state tax break worth around $100 million annually, had been found still to violate the rules.
The trade powers have been battling since 2004 over mutual claims of illegal aid to plane giants Boeing and Airbus, with parallel cases generating thousands of pages of findings and dense litigation that put a burden on the already congested WTO.
Both sides have been caught paying billions of dollars of subsidies to gain advantage in the global jet business, and asked to stop or face potential sanctions. Thursday's appeal ruling showed that the United States did not stop all subsidies when asked to do so, echoing an earlier finding against the EU.
The WTO's Appellate Body, effectively the supreme court of world trade, ruled that the business and occupancy (B&O) tax rate reduction in Washington state had significantly cut Airbus sales in five particularly price-sensitive sales campaigns. 
""The Appellate Body has now settled this case definitively, confirming our view the U.S. has continued to subsidize Boeing despite WTO rulings to the contrary,"" European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a statement. 
But U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer called the ruling a victory for the United States, since the WTO had found only one illegal subsidy while upholding an earlier rejection of EU claims that Boeing's commercial aircraft programs received over $10 billion in illegal U.S. subsidies.
""This report confirms what every other WTO report on these issues has found: the United States does not provide support even remotely comparable to the exceptionally large and harmful EU subsidies to Airbus,"" Lighthizer said in a statement.
Boeing said it would support the new decision.
Any sanctions could broadly target industries beyond aerospace, but the impact of the record trade dispute on Boeing and Airbus themselves has so far been modest.
Analysts have long predicted the case would peter out or be settled without a trade war, but the prospect of retaliation is grabbing more attention than before amid global trade tensions.
COUNTERMEASURES
Airbus said Boeing still received a raft of support and urged the United States to negotiate a ""fair-trade environment"" - a settlement proposal that Washington has so far rejected.
In a technical point, it said the WTO had resurrected a wider group of U.S. subsidies which could be challenged later.
But Boeing said the slate had now been wiped clean of any unlawful subsidies in the United States, except for the Washington state measure which it agreed would now be amended. 
""We trust that our example will prompt Airbus and the European Union to immediately bring themselves into full compliance with the substantial rulings against these parties by the WTO,"" Boeing said in a statement.
In a parallel ruling last year, the WTO said the European Union had failed to remove illegal subsidies for two airplane programs, the A350 and the A380 - the world's largest airliner which Airbus has since decided to stop building due to poor sales.
That part of the row simmers on as Airbus argues the case against European government loans for the A380 no longer counts because of its plans to shut production. The United States says the partly unpaid loans continue to damage Boeing indirectly.

The two sides are now in arbitration to decide the size of any countermeasures, starting with a U.S. request for authorization to impose $11 billion in sanctions on EU goods.

The Italian-American automaker plans to eliminate the third shift at its assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, beginning Sept. 30, according to an emailed statement. The company produces Chrysler Pacifica and Dodge Grand Caravan minivans at the facility, which employed more than 6,100 workers as of January.
“This is devastating for the city of Windsor,” David Cassidy, head of the Local 444 branch of Unifor, Canada’s auto union, told reporters at a press conference aired by public broadcaster CBC.
Fiat Chrysler’s indefinite layoffs are a fresh blow to an already struggling Canadian auto industry. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). announced in November it has no future product planned for its factory in Oshawa, Ontario. The plant, which employs about 2,600 assembly workers and has produced cars for more than half a century, may shut down as GM discontinues the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS sedans.

1.  Lyft  to Start Trading After Raising $2.34 Billion
Ride-sharing company LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) will start trading tomorrow on the Nasdaq after raising $2.34 billion with its initial public offering.
Lyft priced an increased 32.5 million shares at $72 per share tonight, the top of its boosted range, indicating strong demand for the deal. That values the company at $24.3 billion, Reuters reported.
The widely-anticipated IPO had a host of big-name lead underwriters, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), UBS and Jefferies.
The deal is being watched as an early signal for demand in the market for more gig-economy companies looking to debut, including Lyft rival Uber.
The stock will trade under the symbol LYFT.
2. New Home Sales Expected to Bounce Back
The parade of housing numbers continues tomorrow with the latest on new home sales.
The Commerce Department will report February figures on sales of new homes at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists predict that new home sales bounced back in February to rise 1.3% to an annual rate of 620,000, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Before the bell, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will report personal income and spending numbers at 8:30 AM ET. That report also comes with the Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation gauge, albeit from back in January.
Personal income for February is forecast to have risen 0.3%, while personal spending - which will be reported for January - is expected to post a 0.3% rise as well.
That inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which excludes food and energy, is expected to have risen 0.2% in January, with the annual rate remaining at 1.9%.
3. Chicago PMI, Michigan Sentiment Also on Tap
Also on the economic calendar are measures of manufacturing activity and consumer sentiment.
The Chicago purchasing manager’s index (PMI), which gives investors insight into manufacturing in the Midwest, will come out at 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT).
The March PMI is expected to fall to 61, according to economists.
At 10:00 AM, the University of Michigan issues its final measure of March consumer sentiment.
Economists predict the sentiment index remained the same as the preliminary measure at 97.8."

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Thursday said it has no plan to cut the sticker price on its electric Chevrolet Bolt sedan after a federal tax credit drops by half to $3,750 on Monday.
Last year, GM became the second automaker in the United States to hit the 200,000 cumulative electric vehicles sales figure, which triggers a phaseout of the $7,500 federal tax credit over 15 months.
GM has laid out an aggressive electric vehicle strategy, vowing to bring at least 20 EV models to market by 2023.
In January, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc cut the prices of its EVs by $2,000 after its EV tax credit fell from $7,500 to $3,750 after it hit the 200,000 EV sales milestone.
Asked why GM is not cutting the price to account for the lower tax credit, spokesman Jim Cain said ""it is easier to react to the market by working with dealers and your marketing team than it is to change sticker prices.""
Tesla aggressively urged buyers to take advantage of the full credit shortly before it expired. ""Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days!"" Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted in December.
Last week, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra announced the company would invest $300 million in a suburban Detroit assembly plant, adding 400 jobs to build a new Chevrolet EV based on the Bolt platform. Barra said GM planned to boost EV marketing soon, but made no mention of the tax credit phaseout.
Michelle Krebs, an analyst at AutoTrader, calls government incentives a big factor in consumer purchase decisions. ""Tax credits make a difference,"" she said.
GM will offer new incentives next week for EVs as the current monthly incentives expire, the company said.
GM is currently offering an incentive on Bolt EVs of 14 percent of the suggested retail price, Cain said.
Cain said GM is ""sensitive to affordability"" of EVs for customers but declined to specify what future incentives GM will offer.
Both GM and Tesla have been lobbying Congress for more than a year to extend or expand the EV tax credit.
GM's credit drops to $1,875 in October and will completely disappear by April 2020, while Tesla's credit falls to $1,875 in July and expires at the end of the year.
GM has been exporting Bolt EVs to both South Korea and Canada, which has impacted U.S. sales

GM sold 18,000 Bolts in the United States last year, down nearly 23 percent over 2017. The No. 1 U.S. automaker ended production of its plug-in electric Chevrolet Volt in February.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said Thursday that its president, Colm Kelleher, will retire at the end of June, according to an internal memo viewed by Reuters. 
Kelleher, 61, worked for the firm for roughly 30 years and will stay on as senior adviser to the firm, according to the memo from Chief Executive James Gorman. Kelleher's replacement was not immediately named.
""Every time I have faced an issue of real significance Colm has been the most important person I have sought advice from,"" Gorman wrote in the memo. 
Kelleher joined the bank's fixed income division in 1989 and was named co-head of the European division in 2004.
From October 2007 to December 2009, Kelleher held the roles of chief financial officer and co-head of corporate strategy. Gorman called Kelleher's role during that period of the financial crisis ""instrumental"" in the memo.
Kelleher has served as president of the firm since January 2016.

A factor in the gains: Traders appeared willing to endure prolonged U.S.-China trade talks if they avert the possibility of further rifts between the two nations.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.36%, the S&P 500 added 0.36%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.34%.
U.S. Treasury yields, which has dominated direction in recent sessions, rose from lows despite data showing a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 2.2% annual rate in the October-December period, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected a 2.4% growth rate.
On the trade front, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the U.S. may remove some of the tariffs on Chinese goods, but not all, easing investor worries that a lack of progress on talks could lead to an all-out trade war.
The apparent olive branch could also mean more drawn-out talks, Kudlow suggested.
""If it takes a few more weeks, or if it takes months, so be it. We have to get a great deal, as the president says, that works for the United States,"" Kudlow said in a speech in Washington. ""That’s our principal interest.""
The somewhat upbeat remarks arrived as Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a two-day meeting.
China, meanwhile, has put forward proposals to more closely address a range of issues that have plagued talks, Reuters reported, citing U.S. officials.
The U.S. has demanded that China adopt measures to improve treatment of U.S. intellectual property and open up its markets to U.S. companies.
Most importantly, China also appeared more responsive to an enforcement framework, which the Trump administration has argued is needed to ensure Beijing complies with eventual terms of a trade deal.

212,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Toyota Sees the Fed’s Pause Rescuing the Auto Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. said the Federal Reserve putting interest rates on hold will be supportive to the U.S. auto market, which has slowed down in large part due to costlier borrowing costs.
The pause Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced this month was the “right call” in the sense that it’ll help support car sales, Jim Lentz, chief executive officer of Toyota Motor North America, said in a phone interview Thursday. He predicted the U.S. auto sales rate in March may be in line with February’s pace, which was the slowest in 18 months.
“We are seeing this year the impact of rising interest rates from last year,” Lentz said after hosting Ivanka Trump for a visit to Toyota’s largest assembly plant in Georgetown, Kentucky. “We’ve seen this succession of interest rates in the past, and typically you don’t see an interest rate increase and an immediate affect the next 30 days. It takes time to work its way through.”
After boosting interest rates four times in 2018, Powell said last week that they could be on hold for “some time” as global risks weigh on the economic outlook and inflation remains muted. While the auto market was buoyant last year, analysts expect sales to drop again in March after declining in the first two months of the year. Consumers are paying the highest interest rates to finance new-vehicle purchases in a decade, according to market researcher Edmunds.
Toyota began the year expecting auto sales to drop to between 16.6 million and 16.8 million in 2019, Lentz said. He estimated the annualized industry sales rate for March will be about 16.6 million, in line with February’s pace.
While Lentz, 63, said the Fed’s pause looks positive for the auto market, he cautioned he couldn’t speak to the broader implications of the central bank’s rate policy.
“We want to see the economy remain strong, but we don’t want to see it overheated to the degree that inflation starts taking over,” he said. “Only the Fed knows if that’s the right call, and time will tell.”"
213,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 04:40PM ET</span>",WTO Issues Mixed Decision in EU-Boeing Subsidy Dispute,"(Bloomberg) -- The World Trade Organization said that most U.S. subsidies for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. comply with international trade rules in a mixed ruling that also ordered Washington State to end a $325 million tax program for the Chicago-based plane maker.
The WTO urged the U.S. to bring its remaining WTO-inconsistent measures ""into conformity with its obligations,"" according to the text of the ruling.
On Thursday the WTO appellate body partially upheld a 2017 compliance ruling that found the U.S. brought much of its trade-distorting subsidy programs for Boeing aircraft in compliance with WTO rules.
But the Geneva-based trade body didn’t completely vindicate the U.S. and the panel confirmed that Washington State failed to withdraw certain preferential tax cuts that disadvantaged Boeing’s European rival, Airbus SE.
The WTO appellate body also reversed several of the previous panel’s findings regarding U.S. subsidies to Boeing but it said it was unable to determine if many of those programs had actually harmed Airbus sales.
Both the U.S. and EU praised the ruling as a major win for their respective aerospace industries in separate statements.
Unlawful Subsidies
“The WTO has now rejected every allegation of unlawful subsidies to Boeing with the single exception of one measure -- a Washington State business and occupancy tax rate,” Boeing said in a press release.
The Washington State tax measure -- which had a total value of $325 million between 2013 and 2015 -- represents a fraction of the $10.4 billion worth of illegal subsidies that the EU alleged the U.S. conferred to Boeing over a six-year period.
“This is a clear victory for the EU and Airbus,"" said Airbus General Council John Harrison. ""In the absence of a constructive approach, the EU now has a very strong legal case to move forward to countermeasures.""
Boeing shares traded little changed at $374.21 as of 12:33 p.m. in New York, while shares of Airbus were up 0.5 percent to 116 euros.
The news comes as Boeing struggles to address safety concerns with its 737 Max jetliner following two deadly crashes in five months. The plane maker plans to submit software changes to the Federal Aviation Administration for approval.
The ruling marks the latest chapter in a decades-long dispute between the EU and the U.S., two traditional allies whose Transatlantic relationship has frayed after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on the imports of steel and aluminum and withdrew from the Iran nuclear treaty.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A decision this week by a U.S. Appeals Court in a lawsuit related to Puerto Rico's bankruptcy raises concerns over the payment of municipal bonds backed by specific revenues during future Chapter 9 cases, Fitch Ratings said on Thursday. 
The Boston-based First Circuit court on Tuesday determined that municipalities are not required to make payments on debt secured by special revenues while bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, although municipalities can voluntarily opt to do so.
""The ruling, by stating such payments are optional,
creates uncertainty about full and timely payment of special revenue obligations during bankruptcy of the related municipality,"" Fitch said.
The credit rating agency added that if the ruling stands, it could negatively affect ratings on certain bonds secured by utility, transportation and tax revenue.
The appeals court affirmed a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is overseeing the island's bankruptcy, which was filed in 2017 in an effort to restructure about $120 billion of the U.S. commonwealth's debt and pension obligations. 
Swain had dismissed a lawsuit by insurance companies guaranteeing payments on defaulted Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority bonds. The bond insurers claimed that payments on the debt from pledged toll and other revenue should not be halted during the bankruptcy.
Assured Guaranty Corporation, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said on Thursday it is assessing options, including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“We disagree with the court’s ruling, which is at odds with prior court decisions and the legislative history relating to special revenue bonds and has potential negative implications for revenue bonds throughout the municipal bond market,"" Assured said in a statement.  
Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy expert James Spiotto, managing director of Chapman Strategic Advisors, said the appeals court decision came as a surprise to the municipal bond market, which had assumed Swain's ruling would be reversed.
""This could have a very adverse effect on the use of special revenues all over,"" he said. 
Revenue bonds accounted for an average of 64 percent of annual issuance in the $3.8 trillion municipal market since 1990, according to Refinitiv data. Not all revenue bonds qualify as being backed by special revenues under the bankruptcy code, which specifies special excise taxes or revenue derived from governmental projects or systems providing transportation, utilities or other services.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Thursday said he could not predict the success of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's new suite of services but was confident the public would benefit as content providers vie for their wallets.
The billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, which owns big stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines, also said that industry would weather fears about safety even after Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX planes were pulled from service.
He also said the pace of growth in the U.S. economy, which expanded at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in last year's fourth quarter, appeared to have slowed down, but ""that doesn't change anything we do"" at Berkshire.
""You really want to bet on America,"" said Buffett, who was speaking in Grapevine, Texas at an event broadcast by CNBC.
Apple on Monday announced an ambitious plan to reorient itself as an entertainment and financial services company, including a plunge into video streaming and the launch of a Goldman Sachs-branded credit card.
Buffett, whose company owned $40.3 billion of Apple stock at year end, said the iPhone maker ""can afford a mistake or two"" as companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co compete for customer attention.
""Eyeballs aren't going to double,"" he said. ""That's not an easy game to predict, because you have very smart people with lots of resources trying to figure out how to grab another half hour of your time.""
But he said a decade from now, as the delivery of entertainment content improves, ""the public will be the winner.""
Buffett also defended Berkshire's roughly one-tenth stakes in American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and United Continental Holdings Inc, despite problems with the 737 MAX.
Berkshire began amassing those stakes in 2016, surprising many investors because Buffett had viewed the sector as too competitive and capital-intensive after making an investment in USAir Group he later regretted.
""I don't think it's a suicidal business any more,"" he said on Thursday.
Buffett added that Boeing, which has not been a Berkshire investment, ""has a lot of work to do very promptly,"" but that ""the airline industry has been so safe.""
Buffett also showed his usual humor, prompting audience laughter as he removed a flip phone from his pocket during the Apple discussion.

""Alexander Graham Bell lent it to me and I forgot to return it,"" said Buffett, 88, who was born eight years after the telephone inventor died.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on Thursday, helped by optimism over progress in U.S.-China trade talks, but concerns about an economic slowdown after a cut in fourth-quarter GDP growth limited the day's advance.
The domestic economy slowed more than initially thought in the fourth quarter, keeping growth in 2018 below the 3 percent annual target, and corporate profits failed to rise for the first time in more than two years, data showed.
Worries about economic growth hit markets last week after the Federal Reserve abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year and the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time since 2007.
The benchmark 10-year yields rose off their 15-month lows on Thursday but the yield curve prolonged its inversion. An inverted yield could indicate that a recession is likely in one to two years.
While investors cheered the Fed's move, they are more worried now about a weakening earnings and economic outlook, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York. 
""All of a sudden we've started to examine whether this is the end of the cycle. My answer is, it's not the end of the cycle - for the stock market, the economy - but there's not much left,"" he said.
U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday that China had made proposals in talks with the United States on a range of issues that go further than it has before, including on forced technology transfer.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Washington could lift some tariffs on Beijing, while leaving others in place as part of an enforcement mechanism on the deal.
Senior U.S. officials arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a fresh round of trade talks, which will be followed by a round in Washington next week. Trade sensitive industrial stocks rose 0.6 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 81.4 points, or 0.32 percent, to 25,706.99, the S&P 500 gained 8.45 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,813.82 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.27 points, or 0.29 percent, to 7,665.64.
Consumer discretionary stocks rose 0.6 percent, helped by gains in shares of PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH). 
The Calvin Klein owner forecast full-year adjusted profit and sales above Wall Street expectations.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.65-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.56-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Ulta is the fifth-best performer of stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index this year. It has hit 52-week highs for three-straight days. But the last seemed to generate a small pause that pulled shares back slightly on Thursday, albeit they still enjoying a small gain.
The Bolingbrook, Ill.-based Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA), founded in 1989, has been growing rapidly and profitably. It sells cosmetics, beauty products and skincare products for men and women in stores and online. Each store has a salon.
Earnings of $3.61 a share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were up 6.2% from a year earlier and 31% if you take out the one-time effects of the 2017 tax law.
Revenue was up 9.7% in the quarter to $2.1 billion and 14.1% to $6.71 billion for the full year.
It sees $12.50 to $12.85 a share in earnings in the 2019 fiscal year, up from $10.94 in the last fiscal year and expects to open 80 new stores. At the end of 2018, Ulta operated 1,174 stores in all 50 states. That's up from 675 stores at the end of 2013.
It has a robust balance sheet with no debt. The company bought $616.2 million in shares in the 2018 fiscal year alone, compared with capital expenditures of $319 million, according to the company's fourth-quarter earnings release.
That's all well and good and the growth is expected to continue. Of 24 analysts who watch the stock, 18 rate it a buy.
The stock price is the issue. When 52-week highs are reached regularly, getting more gains from a stock becomes harder, especially if the economy softens.
The consensus 12-month target from analysts polled by Investing.com is $349.52, implying upside of just 0.9%.
While one analyst sees the stock hitting $390, one of the seven who are neutral see it maybe dropping to $300. There are no analysts who see the stock as a sell.
Technical indicators are starting to show some sell flashes and that's because of the speed of the run-up."

224,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>","De Blasio’s Ferry System Needs 10 Times More Subsidy Than Subways, Buses","(Bloomberg) -- New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s system of ferry boats linking Manhattan with transit-poor sections of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx is costing city taxpayers almost $11 per ride, 10 times more than they pay to subsidize subways and buses, according to the Citizens Budget Commission.
The system’s dependence on high taxpayer subsidies comes as city and state officials move toward enacting congestion pricing fees for motorists entering midtown Manhattan. That plan would cost commuters more and could increase demand for mass transit service, including the heavily-subsidized ferries. De Blasio has said he wants the cash-strapped Metropolitan Transportation Authority to take over and help finance the waterway system.
Last year, NYC Ferry ran operating costs of $56.7 million. Its 4 million riders paid only $2.75 -- the cost of a subway trip -- for a service costing $13.83 per ride. The $10.73 difference is made up with per-ride subsidies that are about twice that of the Staten Island Ferry, which is free.
Expansion plans for Coney Island service would only boost its expenses. Capital costs of boats and dock construction would be paid through municipal bonds, which will total $639 million through fiscal year 2022. The debt service would come to $48.6 billion, the business-supported fiscal watchdog reported Thursday. Officials at the city Economic Development Corp, which owns the ferry service, didn’t immediately respond to the report.
“The high subsidy is due to high operating costs and low revenue, which are the product of policy choices to keep fares low and to provide daily service on routes with variable demand, low ridership, and high fixed operating costs,” the report said. Although future per-ride subsidies may decline, the ferry system would still serve fewer passengers and require more taxpayer support than other forms of mass transit, the report concluded."

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was down 0.2%, but is up nearly 19% for the quarter.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) struggled to advance, rising just 0.3%, despite RBC resuming coverage on the stock with an outperform rating, saying the chipmaker is set to improve performance in the second half of the year.
The bullish outlook on the chipmaker comes as the bank sees a bottoming out of expectations on Micron and a rebound in data center spending in the second half of the year.
Like many of its rivals, Micron has faced pressure from falling memory prices as demand has slumped at various levels. Lower demand for smartphones has often been blamed as one of the driving forces behind the plunge in memory demand, but RBC said non-Apple smartphone demand will ramp up in second half of the year.
 Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC), meanwhile, advanced 1.92% after RBC resumed coverage on the storage company's stock with an outperform rating and a $55 price target.
The bank was impressed by the ""operational excellence"" in Western Digital's core hard drive business. Better-than-expected hyperscale spending growth in Chinese handsets is also expected to prove a tailwind for the company, the bank said.

228,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 01:31PM ET</span>",Exclusive: J. Crew turns again to debt restructuring lawyers - sources,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - J. Crew Group Inc has tapped restructuring lawyers for the second time in as many years to explore options for reworking its debt, as the U.S. clothing chain struggles with falling sales and a dwindling cash pile, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The company's decision to once again seek help with its debt underscores the persistent business challenges J. Crew faces. A shift to pricier apparel turned off some shoppers, and the company faces competition from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other e-commerce firms that have squeezed an array of traditional retailers.
The preppy fashion retailer in recent weeks enlisted restructuring attorneys at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, the law firm that helped negotiate a previous debt workout for the company and most recently steered department store operator Sears Holdings Corp through bankruptcy proceedings, the sources said. 
Weil lawyers with capital markets and mergers and acquisitions expertise are also involved in the discussions with J. Crew, one of the sources said. 
J. Crew, which was taken private in 2011 by TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners in a roughly $3 billion leveraged buyout, is also interviewing restructuring specialists at investment banks, the sources said. 
In a statement to Reuters on Thursday, the company did not directly address whether it has approached restructuring lawyers but said it has ""been evaluating and executing on opportunities to strengthen J. Crew's balance sheet"" and that its top priority this year is to return its flagship brand to profitability and sustain momentum for its quickly growing Madewell apparel business.
A TPG spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for Leonard Green and Weil did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
A bankruptcy filing is not currently on the horizon for J. Crew, which carries a debt load exceeding $1.7 billion, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition they will not be identified because the deliberations are confidential. 
The New York-based retailer is in the early stages of exploring options for its debt that could include a refinancing, the sources said. The discussions are aimed at addressing looming debt maturities in 2021, one of the sources added. 
The company has not yet approached creditors about a restructuring, though it could eventually do so, one of the sources said. J. Crew has previously considered hiving off Madewell through a sale or public offering, Reuters has reported.
J. Crew's term loan was trading around 66 cents on the dollar on Wednesday, according to financial information provider Refinitiv, reflecting investor concerns about the retailer's financial health. 
The retailer's operations chief, Michael Nicholson, this month called full-year 2018 financial results for the company's J. Crew brand ""disappointing"" and said new strategies were not successful and hurt the chain's financial performance. He added that the company’s leaders took immediate action to improve profits. 
In January, Millard ""Mickey"" S. Drexler, J. Crew's former chief executive, stepped down as chairman and now serves as an adviser to the board. 
J. Crew in 2017 reached a deal with creditors, including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP's GSO Capital Partners and Anchorage Capital Group, on a debt exchange that roughly cut in half nearly $567 million in bond obligations, and extended their due date by two years.
Talks in 2014 to sell J. Crew to Japan’s Fast Retailing Co, the owner of the Uniqlo apparel chain, fell apart. 

J. Crew, which has sold clothes once donned by former first lady Michelle Obama, had about $25.7 million in cash as of the beginning of February, down from roughly $107 million a year earlier, and the company has booked financial losses in seven of the last eight quarters, according to securities filings.

Steinhoff admitted ""accounting irregularities"" in December 2017, shocking investors who had backed its reinvention from a small South African business to a multinational retailer at the vanguard of the European discount furniture retail industry.
Findings from an independent report by PwC said earlier this month that Steinhoff had overstated profits over several years in a $7.4 billion accounting fraud involving a small group of top executives and outsiders.
The FSCA said it had met with representatives of Steinhoff who agreed to provide them with all relevant documents, without waiving confidentiality agreements from the PwC report, which Steinhoff has repeatedly refused to share in full with regulators.
The FSCA added that Steinhoff had confirmed the disclosure will enable it to act against all persons implicated in the transgressions. 
Steinhoff said it could not comment on the FSCA's investigations or beyond what was released in the PwC report.
Former Steinhoff Chief Executive Markus Jooste and seven others were named by the new CEO as being involved in a 6.5 billion euro ($7.4 billion) accounting fraud, during a session in parliament.
News of the irregularities in 2017 wiped about 85 percent off its market value and threw the company into a liquidity crisis.

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - A row over who is in charge at Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica could drag on for two years or more after the recently merged group's executive chairman filed an arbitration request after alleged violations of a power-sharing agreement.
French lenses producer Essilor and Italian frame manufacturer Luxottica merged last October, creating the world's largest eyewear maker in a 54 billion euro ($61 billion) deal. 
The two groups were supposed to have equal weighting in the combined company's leadership under an agreement which expires in 2021, but they now accuse each other of trying to gain the upper hand. 
EssilorLuxottica's shares fell 2.7 percent by 1510 GMT on Thursday after the holding of Luxottica's founder Leonardo Del Vecchio said it had filed an arbitration request with the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce.
While there is no set duration for arbitration cases, it usually takes two years from when a request is filed to a ruling being issued. The defeated party can then appeal.
Del Vecchio's Delfin holding said in a statement on Wednesday the deadlock within EssilorLuxottica's board was hampering the integration process and planned synergies from the merger. 
Del Vecchio, 83, has been engaged in a dispute with his French counterpart Hubert Sagnieres, who came from Essilor and is vice-chairman of the new entity.
Del Vecchio is EssilorLuxottica's largest investor with a 31 percent voting stake, well above the 4 percent holding owned by Essilor's employees. 
An Italian source close to the situation said Del Vecchio, Italy's second-richest man, was in no mood for compromise even if that meant leaving the combined group essentially paralyzed until the end of the power-sharing accords in two years' time. 
""It's war between the French and the Italians. All this risks blocking the planned synergies. It's very bad for the stock. At one moment or another, one of the parties will have to take control,"" said Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Geneva-based investment firm Prime Partners.
Prime Partners is steering clear of the stock, given the management problems within the company. The shares have fallen 12 percent over the last month.
Tensions have increased since last November, when Del Vecchio appeared to tap his right-hand man, Francesco Milleri, for the chief executive's role, irking the French side. 
The company has said it will appoint a CEO by the end of 2020. However, two sources told Reuters that the appointment of a head hunter to find the new company's head, has been frozen.

234,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 12:32PM ET</span>",Bayer shares sag after U.S. jury verdict in Roundup cancer trial,"By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) shares sank to their lowest in almost seven years on Thursday after a U.S. jury awarded $80 million to a man who claimed use of the group's weed killer Roundup caused his cancer, with thousands of similar lawsuits looming.
The jury in San Francisco federal court on Wednesday found Bayer liable because its  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit did not warn plaintiff Edwin Hardeman of the herbicide's alleged cancer risks.
German chemicals giant Bayer, which bought Roundup maker Monsanto last year for $63 billion, said it would appeal the verdict.
Its shares were down 1.3 percent at 55.59 euros at 1023 GMT. That added to last week's 9.6 percent plunge after the jury concluded part-way into the trial that there was a causal link between the weedkiller and Hardeman's disease.
The steep, steady slide since the first adverse verdict in a Roundup lawsuit in August 2018 has pushed Bayer's value down to about 52 billion euros ($58 billion), which is several billion dollars less than what the drugs and crop chemicals group paid to acquire Monsanto in 2016.
On Wednesday, the jury awarded Hardeman $5 million in compensatory and $75 million in punitive damages. Under a 2003 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, punitive damages are generally limited to less than 10 times the compensatory damages award, meaning the current verdict will likely be reduced, said Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Los Angeles-based Loyola Law School.
The trial is only the second of more than 11,200 Roundup lawsuits set to go to trial in the United States. 
In the first trial, a California man was awarded damages by a jury in state court in August, which were later reduced to $78 million from an original $289 million that Monsanto sought to throw out. The case is on appeal.
A third Roundup trial, handled by the same plaintiff lawyers who won the August verdict, is scheduled to start in California's Superior Court in Oakland on Thursday. 
It was brought by California couple Alva and Alberta Pilliod who were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2011 and 2015 respectively. They allege their decades-long use of Roundup caused their cancers.
Analysts at JP Morgan and Liberum said Bayer's stock price shows the market expects an eventual settlement of up to 20 billion euros or 40 billion euros. They said that was overly pessimistic and they expected the final amount to be ""substantially lower"" than that.
""Even if Monsanto/Bayer may win some cases, there is great uncertainty about the number of victories and defeats. That is why we expect Bayer to try to settle the remaining cases,"" said Bryan Garnier analyst Jean-Jacques Le Fur.
Peter Verdult, an analyst at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), said more focus should be paid to trials later in the year outside of California to better determine settlement estimates. At least two trials are scheduled to take place in St. Louis, Missouri state court this fall.
Hardeman's case was considered a bellwether trial to help determine the range of damages and define settlement options for the more than 760 other federal cases pending in the same court before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria. Other cases will be heard in state courts.
""This verdict does not change the weight of over four decades of extensive science and the conclusions of regulators worldwide that support the safety of our glyphosate-based herbicides and that they are not carcinogenic,"" Bayer said.
Monsanto's Roundup was the first to contain glyphosate, the world's most widely used weed killer. But it is no longer patent-protected and many other versions are available. 
Bayer does not provide sales figures for the product and analysts no longer deem it a major profit driver.
Genetically modified crops that resist glyphosate's plant-killing effect, however, contribute heavily to earnings at Bayer's agricultural division.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators have found that glyphosate is not likely carcinogenic to humans. The World Health Organization's cancer arm in 2015 reached a different conclusion, classifying glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""

235,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 12:30PM ET</span>",WWE's next battle royale: Investor fans vs. shorts,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - A brawl between World Wrestling Entertainment Inc's bears and bulls could reach a peak this year as the company renegotiates overseas contracts. 
While a large contingent of short sellers have been betting that the stock will fall, WWE's most ardent Wall Street fans say it will continue to rise even after outperforming the stock market last year and for much of 2019.
Shares in WWE soared 144 percent in 2018 as U.S. TV license deals blew past analyst expectations with a 3.6-times hike in average annual value from its previous agreements. 
The stock has risen another 12.6 percent so far this year as investors are betting on license renewals being negotiated in countries including India and the United Kingdom, which WWE expects to announce by mid-year. 
Ten out of 13 analysts have buy ratings on the stock while three recommend holding the stock which last traded at $84.87. The mean share price target is $102.70 with the highest target at $157 and the lowest at $85, according to Refinitiv.
While the stock has already risen a lot on expectations for new business, Gabelli Funds analyst Alexandra Cowie says it still has room to gain further. 
""I wouldn't be selling before the contract news. Going in and coming out of announcements, it gets a double bump,"" said Cowie, whose firm owns more than 174,000 WWE shares. 
WWE is in an unusual entertainment category. Unlike traditional sports, its fights are scripted, but analysts measure its popularity against sports because it still involves athleticism and suspense.
The creator of Smackdown and Raw TV shows boasted a U.S. cable television viewership second only to the National Football League in 2018, according to Nielsen data. And in India, WWE viewership was second only to cricket, according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council.
Guggenheim Securities analyst Curry Baker expects a UK renewal similar to WWE's current contract there. But he anticipates a fivefold boost to its average annual revenue in India to $124 million. 
""The market is underappreciating the India opportunity,"" said Baker who has a $105 price target and a buy rating on WWE.
MKM analyst Eric Handler, who raised his price target for the stock to $110 from $95 on Tuesday, says a possible U.S. deal for a third weekly hour of Smackdown could add $50 million to annual revenue. The company declined to comment on the prospect of an additional hour. 
WWE shares have fallen roughly 9 percent since last Thursday. On Wednesday, Chief Executive Vincent McMahon sold 3.2 million of his shares, or four percent of WWE's shares outstanding, to fund a separate entity. The stock last traded down 0.9 percent on Thursday in active trade though analysts said the news did not change their outlook 
It has also come under pressure as the broader market has been losing ground on worries about global economic growth. But analysts say WWE contracts - which are for around three to five years - provide some insulation against economic fluctuations. 
In the United States, live sports have been a key draw for cable TV subscribers, at a time when many consumers are cutting the chord to avoid high monthly fees. 
""It feels like one of the lower-risk higher-return names in the media space,"" said Baker.
Still, about 17 percent of WWE's float is sold short, according to data from S3 Partners which estimates short seller mark-to-market losses of $359 million since the start of 2018. 
The bets against the stock can be partly attributed to hedging by investors in its convertible bonds due in 2023, according to BTIG analyst Brandon Ross. “That’s contributed to it,” he said.
Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker is Wall Street's biggest fan, with a price target of $157. 
Wall Street expects 2020 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $460.59 million on $1.33 billion revenue, according to Refinitiv data. Ryvicker expects EBITDA of $510 million on revenue of $1.423 billion. 
With this in mind, Ryvicker says WWE looks cheap compared with other sports peers, including Knicks basketball team owner Madison Square (NYSE:SQ) Garden Co and a Liberty Media Corp (NASDAQ:FWONA) subsidiary which owns Formula One rights and Liberty's subsidiary that owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team.
WWE's enterprise value is roughly 14.8 times her 2020 EBITDA estimates compared with multiples of 32 for Madison Square Garden, 33.2 for Liberty's Atlanta Braves subsidiary and 12.6 for the Formula One subsidiary, the analyst wrote. 

WWE ""has no reason not to trade right in-line with its closest peers,"" Ryvicker said.

(Reuters) - Purdue Pharma LP fraudulently transferred funds to members of the wealthy Sackler family who control the OxyContin maker despite knowing it faced major liabilities that had made it already insolvent, New York's attorney general alleged on Thursday.
New York Attorney General Letitia James made the claims in a revised lawsuit already pending against Purdue over its role in the opioid epidemic that added members of the Sackler family and other drug manufacturers and distributors as defendants.
The lawsuit alleged Purdue and other manufacturers engaged in deceptive marketing that downplayed the dangers of the addictive painkillers and accused distributors of failing to detect the diversion of the drugs for illicit purposes.
""As the Sackler family and the other defendants grew richer, New Yorkers' health grew poorer and our state was left to foot the bill,"" James said in a statement.
The revised lawsuit also added as defendants units of opioid manufacturers Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Endo International Plc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd and distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp.
In a statement, the Sackler family called the lawsuit ""a misguided attempt to place blame where it does not belong for a complex public health crisis.""
Representatives for the other defendants did not respond to requests for comment.
The case is among roughly 2,000 lawsuits filed by state and local governments seeking to hold Purdue and other pharmaceutical companies responsible for the U.S. opioid crisis.
Opioids were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017 in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The complaint came after Purdue and the Sacklers on Tuesday reached a $270 million settlement with Oklahoma resolving similar allegations. Purdue had been exploring filing for bankruptcy prior the accord's announcement.
In her lawsuit, James accused Purdue of seeking to ""intimidate"" states pursuing lawsuits against it by threatening bankruptcy, which would hinder their cases and limit their ability to recover damages.
Yet James said Purdue, which is fighting lawsuits by 34 other states and hundreds of localities, has continued in the face of its liabilities to pay millions of dollars to the Sacklers.
The lawsuit argued Purdue was either insolvent or near insolvency when it transferred those funds, making the transfers illegal under New York law.

The payments meant Purdue, which had average annual sales of $3 billion, no longer had assets that could satisfy the state's claims, the lawsuit said.

(Reuters) - Shares of yoga-pants specialists Lululemon Athletica Inc rose 15 percent on Thursday, with several Wall Street analysts raising their price targets for the company after a blockbuster fourth quarter. 
Wednesday's results showed the Vancouver-based athleisure wear maker moving strongly into menswear, improving online sales and potentially challenging bigger rival  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) on its home turf.
Lululemon forecast a strong 2019, said North America was doing well and reported a 37 percent jump in direct-to-consumer net revenue for the three months ended Feb. 3.
The company is reaping the benefits from heavy investments in boosting its online presence, opening more stores and refreshing its clothing line.
Online sales in China were particularly robust, rising more than 140 percent in the quarter, Chief Operating Officer Stuart Haselden said on a post-earnings conference call. 
""Lulu captured the women's market, that's where they started with yogawear being their staple. Now they've evolved some of that collection into everyday-wear and that's been really successful for them,"" Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez said.
Design oriented and fashion forward apparel also allow Lululemon to charge premium prices, Ramirez said. 
Its success in North America, which contributes close to 90 percent of its business, stood out in a quarter where Nike, which introduced yogawear at the end of last year, fell short of Wall Street estimates for U.S. sales the first time in a year.
""There's a lot of runway for us to continue to grow our men's business,"" Chief Operating Officer Stuart Haselden said in a post earnings conference call with analysts. 
""We really believe that Lululemon can be a dual-gender brand, and that our men's business can ultimately be as big as our women's.""
Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy firm Metaforce, said that Lululemon's expansion into menswear and fitness will add to headaches for Nike and Adidas (DE:ADSGN), already in a brutal war over market share in their core markets. 
""They play in the same neighborhood but not on the same block,"" he said. ""Lululemon has one foot in the fashion world and one foot in athletics while Nike has both feet in athletics.""
Adamson said Lululemon could pose more of a threat to Nike in newer markets like China where consumers' definitions of the circumstances in which they can wear fitness, athletics and sports clothing are shifting quickly.
At least 11 brokerages have raised their price targets on Lululemon's stock, with Stifel raising it the most by $35 to $187. JP Morgan held the highest target price of $197.
""We expect Lululemon to continue to rise above others who sell active wear, through targeted and nuanced customer engagement both online and in stores,"" Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser said.

Shares of the company were up 15 percent at $168.60 in mid-day trade.

Wirecard has filed a suit at the Munich regional court against both the FT and its reporter, Dan McCrum, seeking a ruling on the merits of its case. If successful, the company would then press for monetary redress.
""Our objective is to seek a halt to the incorrect use of business secrets for the purposes of reporting, as well as damages,"" Wirecard said in a statement. No comment was immediately available from the FT.
The fightback comes after the FT alleged in January that Wirecard's Singapore staff had engaged in fraud and false accounting, basing its reporting on a law firm's probe of allegations made by an unnamed whistleblower.
The newspaper's revelations wiped billions off the market value of Wirecard, Germany's leading 'fintech' company that only last year was promoted to the blue-chip DAX index, and triggered an investigation by Singapore police.

Wirecard said on Monday that the final results of a probe by outside law firm Rajah & Tann had found that local staff in Singapore may have committed financial crimes, but that these were not material and there was no evidence that its German head office was complicit.

The company also said it was in talks with its North America apparel partner G-III Apparel Group LTD to license out the brand's women's jeans unit.
G-III also operates Tommy Hilfiger women's business, which helped boost PVH's strong financial results in the fourth quarter, lifting its shares nearly 18 percent in morning trading.
""We believe this was the right decision for the long-term health of the brand (Calvin Klein) as the existing high-end business was not resonating with our core consumer,"" Chief Executive Officer Emanuel Chirico said on a post earnings call.
Fashion missteps at high-end Calvin Klein's 205W39NYC line of clothing have hit sales in recent quarters as customers baulked at the high prices of the ready-to-wear luxury clothing label that offered oversized sweaters, tie-dyed and silk dresses.
The New York-based company said the decision to exit the label and license out its women's jeans unit would lower its fiscal 2019 revenue by $100 million.
However, the restructuring of Calvin Klein and the lack of a need for big promotions in its jeans business were likely to improve profit margins in the second half of 2019, the company said.
PRESSURE IN CHINA
Chirico said the trade tensions has impacted the company's retail business in China and the United States.
""Business is softer than we saw the first half of 2018... We're looking for that trend to continue throughout the first half of 2019,"" Chirico said referring to China. 

Still, PVH forecast full-year adjusted profit between $10.30 and $10.40 per share, the midpoint of which was above analysts' expectation of $10.31.

The bill would provide sought-after clarity to banks across the country that want to do business with the growing industry, where companies have struggled to gain access to the financial system.
The measure, which was broadly backed by a mixture of Democrats and Republicans, now proceeds to the full House, where it is expected to be passed by the Democrat-led chamber in the near future. However, the bill faces an uncertain future in the Republican-led Senate, according to analysts.
While all but 3 states allow for some form of legal cannabis use, marijuana is still illegal on the federal level. That has left banks largely unwilling to do business with businesses that sell marijuana or related enterprises, out of concern they could run afoul of federal laws.
In particular, banks are wary that taking deposits from pot businesses while marijuana remains illegal at the federal level could violate anti-money laundering laws, which in turn could put at risk their federal charters or access to federal payments systems.
Currently, companies in the marijuana industry have extremely limited options for dealing with their finances, with many relying on strictly cash to do business.
Numerous lawmakers noted that operating exclusively in cash can be extremely dangerous, making companies a target for theft.
The bill has the backing of the banking industry, where firms are eager for reassurance from the federal government they can engage in this sort of business. The American Bankers Association has told Congress it takes no stance on the legality of marijuana, but its widespread adoption by states ""raises practical issues that must be addressed.""
Some Republican lawmakers expressed concern over permitting banks to engage in business that is still technically illegal. If Congress wants to allow banks to get into the marijuana business, it should legalize marijuana, they said.
But proponents of the bill argued that with the vast majority of U.S. states taking steps to further legalize marijuana use, it makes no sense to refuse those businesses access to banks. 

""The toothpaste is out of the tube, my friends,"" said Representative Denny Heck, a Democrat from Washington.

LONDON (Reuters) - A second former  Barclays  (LON:BARC) banker has been convicted of conspiring to manipulate global Euribor interest rates, taking to nine the number of people found guilty in six rate-rigging trials.
The jury of nine men and three women on Thursday found Colin Bermingham, a 62-year-old veteran banker, guilty by a majority verdict after a two-month re-trial brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) at Southwark Crown Court. 
Bermingham, the last of three former Barclays bankers to hear his verdict in the case, bowed his head in the dock and his supporters gasped in shock in the public gallery. Just hours before, the jury had been in deadlock.
Co-defendant Carlo Palombo, a 40-year-old Anglo-Italian former derivatives trader, was convicted by a majority verdict on Tuesday while Sisse Bohart, a 41-year-old Dane, was acquitted. She was not in court to hear her verdict.
Bermingham and Palombo will be sentenced next Monday.
In the glass-surrounded dock, a composed Bermingham had placed a comforting hand on Palombo's back when the former trader-turned-academic, visibly shaken, turned to gaze at his distraught, heavily-pregnant wife in the public gallery after he heard his verdict earlier this week.
Bermingham, Palombo and Bohart were tried twice after a previous jury was unable to reach a verdict in their case last July.

Eleven powerful banks and brokerages have been fined a total of $9 billion to settle rate-rigging allegations in a global investigation. Barclays paid a $453 million penalty in 2012, sparking a backlash that forced out former CEO Bob Diamond.
The defendants denied a charge that they had conspired to dishonestly manipulate Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate) - a benchmark that helps determine rates on more than $150 trillion of global financial contracts and loans - between 2005 and 2009.
Prosecutors alleged that bankers tilted the odds in their favor for profit, tweaking rates to gain a dishonest trading advantage, deliberately ignoring rules that rates should be set independently of commercial interests and prejudicing the economic interest of others. 
The jury was told that two French bankers, former Barclays colleague Philippe Moryoussef and Christian Bittar, a one-time  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) star trader, had already been convicted over the conspiracy.
Bittar, once one of the world's best-paid traders, pleaded guilty ahead of last year's trial, at which a jury convicted Moryoussef. But he was tried in absentia and remains in France after fleeing when Bittar's plea was made public. 
The jury was asked whether Palombo, who joined Barclays as a graduate trainee and reported to Moryoussef, Bohart, a junior trader and rate submitter and her boss, 38-year Barclays veteran Bermingham, had been knowingly involved in the same conspiracy.
SFO'S ROLE
The former bankers denied dishonesty. 
They said they had followed instructions and learnt on the job, had acted openly, believed there was a range of equally justifiable rates, that taking account of a bank's commercial interest was common market practice - and that Euribor rates accounted for an insignificant part of their jobs.
The verdicts represent a mixed result for the taxpayer-funded SFO in a complex case. The agency's original plans to prosecute 11 individuals were hampered when Germany and France refused to extradite five. 
Brussels-based Euribor, like its Libor (London interbank offered rate) counterpart, is designed to reflect the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing over various periods to an administrator, who calculates an average.

In six benchmark rate-rigging trials to date, 10 have been acquitted.

The athletic-apparel retailer earned an adjusted $1.85 a share on revenue of $1.2 billion, topping the $1.74 and $1.15 billion that was expected by the Bloomberg consensus. The revenue number was particullarly impressive as Lululemon in January raised its guidance for Q4 to a range between $1.14 billion and $1.15 billion. 
Luluemon said it sees full-year earnings per share of between $4.48 and $4.55 a share, beating the $4.41 that Wall Street analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were anticipating. 
The impressive results sent shares soaring in after-hours trading on Wednesday. They were set to open higher on Thursday by about 14%, at what would be a record high of $167.25. 
But the Jefferies analyst Randal Konik says that while the fundamentals of the company are still strong, the stock is fully valued. 
""Strong traffic has continued into 1Q, and the biz is progressing across categories, geographies, and channels,"" he wrote in a note sent out to clients on Thursday.
""We see further oppty ahead, as digital initiatives take hold and the int'l growth story continues. That said, valuation already reflects a lot of these prospects, so we remain Hold-rated.""
Konik has a $156 price target — almost 7% below where shares were set to open on Thursday.
Lululemon was up almost 21% this year through Wednesday.

HANOVER (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has signed a deal to develop a pickup truck with U.S. rival Ford and continues discussions about extending its alliance to include autonomous driving and mobility services, the German carmaker said on Thursday.
In June, VW and Ford said they were in talks to develop a range of commercial vehicles, later extending the discussions to include electric and autonomous cars as part of an alliance designed to save billions in costs.
""We are in constructive talks about taking a stake in Argo, the Ford division for autonomous driving. A joint company for offering mobility as a service is also a possibility,"" Volkswagen's commercial vehicles chief executive Thomas Sedran said on Thursday.
The talks will conclude in the coming months, Sedran said.

The Dow gained 49 points or 0.2% by 9:53 AM ET (13:53 GMT) while the S&P 500 rose 1 point or 0.1% and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was up 4 points or 0.1%.
Initial jobless claims fell to their lowest level in two months last week, offering some reassurance about the strength of the labor market despite February's weak employment report. The news did more to raise spirits than a downward revision to fourth-quarter gross domestic product did to damp them. Growth slowed to an annualized rate of 2.2% in the last three months of the year, well down from the 3,4% rate registered in the third quarter and also less than the 2.6% originally reported.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was among the top gainers, jumping 1.9%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 0.3% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was up 0.7%.  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) skyrocketed 13.6% its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and sales were better than expected due to strong holiday sales, while Accenture (NYSE:ACN) gained 4% after its earnings also beat estimates.

Trade talks with China also remain in focus, although incremental news on their progress has lost the ability to generate big market moves in recent days.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's beleaguered investment banks are preparing to report one of their toughest first quarters as qualms over Brexit and global trade tensions dampened investors trading appetite.
European banks could see stock trading income down 15 to 20 percent and bond trading revenues down around 20 percent from the same period a year ago, research firm Coalition predicts.
Declining expectations for European Central Bank rate hikes, slowing economic growth and concerns about Brexit have left European investment bank trading floors struggling for business.
""It's one of the weaker quarters we've ever seen in terms of client flows,"" Amrit Shahani, Coalition research director, said.
This follows a rough fourth quarter, in which Europe's top banks all saw stock trading plunge, while U.S. rivals gained.
Brexit and the global economy have also hit fees from advising companies on mergers and acquisitions.
""First quarter activity levels across the market have definitely been subdued, there's a focus on the top quartile of companies with strong earnings growth and those that are not going to suffer too much from whatever Brexit outcome we get,"" Jonathan Arrowsmith, head of advisory at Investec, said.
UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said last week that investment banking conditions were among the toughest in years in a foretaste of what is likely to be a bleak earnings season for most European investment banks.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is first up among major players to report on April 24, with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) the next day.
The British bank flashed a warning sign to the market on Wednesday, ousting its investment banking head as chief executive Jes Staley took more direct control.

TRANSATLANTIC GULF
Europe's top trading houses are already losing ground to U.S. rivals as a result of a tougher regulatory environment and their lack of scale in the relatively strong U.S. stock markets.
Wall Street’s dominance over struggling European banks last year reached record levels with U.S. investment banks claiming 62 percent of revenues among the world's top 12.
European lenders have attempted to cope by a constant cost-cutting and strategic tinkering, but some think more radical decisions need to be taken. 
Barclays is under attack from an activist investor who wants it to slash its trading business, echoing calls in 2016 by UBS investor Knight Vinke to split the Swiss bank's profitable wealth management business from its investment bank.
""It's way too easy to blame the markets for the underperformance of European banks,"" Kerim Derhalli, a former senior trader at Deutsche Bank and founder of investing App Investr, said.

""The U.S. banks took their pain 10 years ago and recapitalized and rebuilt their businesses much quicker, the Europeans have been putting off their problems and they're going to need to fundamentally rethink how to use technology to change the model,"" he said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedbank dismissed Chief Executive Birgitte Bonnesen on Thursday just before its annual shareholder meeting, after mounting investor criticism over allegations the bank was involved in money laundering in the Baltics.
The allegations against Swedbank first came to light in a media report last month and have sparked fears that the largest bank in the Baltic region will become embroiled in a scandal already engulfing rival Danske Bank, and face the threat of lawsuits, fines and other sanctions.
Bonnesen has repeatedly said she has confidence in the bank's anti-money laundering procedures and that Swebank had reported suspicious transactions to authorities.
But in the past few days, investors have become critical of Swedbank's handling of the issue, putting them on course for a showdown with management at the annual general meeting later on Thursday. 
Investors have criticized Bonnesen over her responses to the allegations. Their discontent came to a head on Wednesday after the Swedish Economic Crime Authority decided to extend its Swedbank probe to include a charge of suspected fraud.
""The developments during the past days have created an enormous pressure for the bank. Therefore, the board has decided to dismiss Birgitte Bonnesen from her position,"" Swedbank Chairman Lars Idermark said on Thursday.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach Bonnesen to seek comment.
Swedbank's announcement of Bonnesen's dismissal came just an hour before the bank holds its annual general meeting.
Ahead of the meeting, three of Swedbank's top investors, in a rare public expression of discontent, said they would not grant Bonnesen freedom from liability for the 2018 fiscal year, leaving her position all but untenable. 
Bonnesen's career path before she become CEO at Sweden's biggest retail bank included a role as the bank's chief audit executive between 2009 and 2011, which encompassed oversight of the bank's anti-money laundering policy. She then moved on to running the lender's Baltic operations until 2014. 

Swedbank said Chief Financial Officer Anders Karlsson had been appointed on Thursday as acting CEO and would also continue to hold his CFO role until further notice. The bank also said it had begun a process to recruit a new permanent CEO.

“Equities have had a hell of a run and valuations are fairly rich in the U.S. for sure, but there are a lot of places -- Japan being an example and emerging markets -- were there is considerable value,” Chief Executive Officer and President Seth Bernstein said at a briefing in Sydney on Thursday. “We are going to see less correlation in some of these markets as valuation issues become more apparent.’’
The S&P 500 Index has risen 12 percent in 2019, just days away from its best quarter since 2012. At the same time, Japanese stocks are headed for the first monthly loss this year as the sharp decline in developed-market sovereign bond yields escalates concerns surrounding global economic growth.
Bernstein is less concerned about a closely watched segment of the U.S. yield curve inverting last week, which he attributes mainly to increased issuance. Inverted curves are “an okay predictor of recessions, they are a terrible predictor of the timing of that recession,” he said. He expects the curve to be flat “for a very long time and it will invert as we get closer to a recession.’’
Ultimately, markets are more concerned about the shift in the global trade landscape, said Bernstein, who joined the money manager with about $547 billion in assets in a shakeup in 2017 after a 32-year career at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
“What I think the market is increasingly worried about are macro events, which are less about the longer-term cycles of economic expansion and contraction and more concerned about the ongoing transition of the global trade framework,’’ Bernstein said.
The Federal Reserve is done with raising interest rates, though the authority won’t be cutting them this year because the U.S. is not yet going into a recession, he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A firm hired by the U.S. Treasury Department is auditing Russian aluminum giant Rusal to check whether it is complying with the terms of a deal under which Washington agreed to lift sanctions on the company, Rusal said.
The audit is the first glimpse of how Treasury is policing whether Rusal and its parent company En+ are adhering to the deal - in particular the stipulation that Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska's control over the business be severed. 
A source familiar with the situation said the audit included checks on the telephone and email records of a small circle of Rusal senior executives and board members to establish whether they remained in contact with Deripaska, who is himself still on a U.S. sanctions blacklist.
There was no word from Rusal or sources familiar with the situation on whether the audit had found anything that might be at odds with the deal on lifting sanctions.
In reply to Reuters questions about the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) inspecting Rusal's offices, the company issued a statement saying: ""These are not checks by OFAC but an audit which was agreed as part of conditions for lifting of sanctions."" 
A firm hired by the U.S. authorities is conducting the audit, Rusal said, giving no further detail. OFAC did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.
Deripaska reduced his ownership as part of the sanctions deal, which also stipulated that he sever control of Rusal and En+. 
Rusal and En+ agreed to change their corporate governance, such as by seeking ""unprecedented transparency"" by undertaking extensive, ongoing auditing, the U.S. Treasury said in December.
FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS
The checks on behalf of OFAC started more than a week ago, and representatives of the firm conducting the audit are in Moscow meeting face to face with some Rusal board members and executives, the source familiar with the situation said.
Those representatives are running the checks on email and phone records of the same Rusal executives and board members for evidence of any contact with Deripaska, the source said.
The checks affect a select group of executives and are happening in line with Rusal's deal with the U.S. authorities, a second source familiar with the situation said.
The Treasury Department has said previously it would vigorously monitor arrangements to ensure Deripaska cannot influence board members of the businesses.
The deal requires En+ and Rusal to maintain records of any contact between Deripaska and the boards, management, employees or agents of En+. Information provided by En+ and its companies will supplement and be confirmed by a team of U.S. investigators, Washington said previously.
""As the U.S. Treasury stated, he (Deripaska) was the intended target of the U.S. economic actions and not the company. Rusal will be subject to ongoing compliance and will face consequences should it fail to comply,"" Fitch rating agency said in a report this week.

Deripaska sued the United States earlier this month, alleging that it had overstepped its legal bounds in imposing sanctions on him and made him the ""latest victim"" in the U.S. probe into Moscow's alleged election interference.

260,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Pimco and BlackRock Have a Contrarian Bet on Inflation,"(Bloomberg) -- With the bond market painting such a bleak picture of the U.S. economy, it might seem a little odd to bet on a pickup in inflation.
Yet for Pimco, Vanguard and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), that is exactly where the money’s at.
While inflation has failed to consistently reach the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target for years and the die-hards have been stymied by false starts time and again, the fund giants say the central bank’s dovish pivot is a game-changer. A tight labor market, and the Fed’s willingness to consider putting off raising interest rates this year and letting inflation run hot, are bound to raise expectations and push up consumer prices. That means getting into inflation-protected Treasuries, commonly known as TIPS.
“The Fed told us that they would like inflation and inflation expectations to go higher,” said Mihir Worah, CIO of asset allocation and real return at Pimco, which manages $1.7 trillion. “This is the one asset class that the Fed is directly trying to impact. So it makes sense to own them.’’
Indeed, even with all the bond market’s worries about a recession (see the inverted yield curve) and a full-blown rally in plain-vanilla Treasuries in the past week, TIPS have actually outperformed this year. Inflation-protected securities have returned 3.1 percent in the first quarter, wiping out all of last year’s decline, index data compiled by Bloomberg show. Their nominal counterparts have gained 2.3 percent.
It’s not simply a matter of keeping score. Throughout the course of the decade-long expansion, inflation has been the one indicator that’s stubbornly failed to return to levels consistent with a healthy U.S. economy, despite the Fed’s best efforts. Based on the central bank’s preferred gauge, inflation has averaged just 1.5 percent a year since the end of the last recession. So, it’s easy to be skeptical of the inflationistas.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said inflation expectations are crucially important to actual price increases. Last week, he emphasized how detrimental a weakening outlook could be if it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
To combat that, the Fed not only scaled back its 2019 rate hike projections to zero, but also discussed the possibility of so-called price-level targeting. If the Fed took that approach, it would make up for years when prices rose less than 2 percent by allowing inflation to run higher than 2 percent in subsequent years, rather than letting past misses be bygones -- which it does now.
In the bond market, the difference between yields on TIPS and nominal Treasuries provides a proxy of investors’ expectations for long-term inflation. Known as the breakeven rate, it currently shows that traders see consumer prices rising average 1.83 percent a year over the next decade. Over 30 years, the expected inflation rate is still under 1.9 percent.
Too Low?
That might be too low, says Vanguard’s Gemma Wright-Casparius. She expects 10- and 30-year TIPS to outperform their nominal counterparts as the inflation outlook over the latter period rises to 2.3 to 2.35 percent. (TIPS offer lower yields than plain-vanilla Treasuries but their principal increases in value along with inflation, which eats into fixed-income payments.)
“Long-dated breakevens are mispriced,” said Wright-Casparius, a senior money manager at Vanguard, which oversees $5.3 trillion globally. “The Fed can’t let it run hot for just one year or two years, given they missed their target for seven years. It has to be for a couple of years.”
To illustrate just how much hotter the Fed could let inflation run, consider a hypothetical. As we know, its preferred rate of inflation has averaged 1.5 percent during the expansion. If the Fed wanted to make up for lost time and lift that long-run average to 2 percent by the end of 2020, it would need to get consumer prices to rise 4.1 percent annually this year and next.
Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, which oversees $6 trillion, said in a note this month that TIPS are “an attractive alternative to nominal bonds.’’ He cited a growing economy, the Fed’s patience on rates and its willingness to let inflation temporarily accelerate past 2 percent.
Diminishing Returns
Morgan Stanley’s Guneet Dhingra isn’t quite sold on the idea that inflation expectations will continue to rise. While TIPS may continue to marginally outperform, most of the optimism over inflation has already been baked into the price. Going forward, any further gains in TIPS will likely be due to the end of the Fed’s rate-hiking cycle. Since the start of last week, the rally has slowed and yields on 10-year TIPS have fallen half as much as nominal notes.
As for the inflation trade, “it’s about the law of diminishing returns,” he said.
Nevertheless, there are signs that investors are stepping up inflation bets. Individuals, who pulled money out of inflation-linked products nearly every week last quarter, have started to return.
Based on her models, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase’s Phoebe White predicted in a report that flows into inflation-linked ETFs and mutual funds by U.S.-based investors for March will be “relatively robust.” Demand for TIPS from large foreign accounts such as sovereign wealth funds and central banks have also increased, according to Wells Fargo’s Boris Rjavinski, citing client interactions.
“They think the U.S. reflation story is real,” Rjavinski said. “Nobody expects the U.S. to go into a deflation scenario.’’

KB Home and PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM)., rose after quarterly earnings reports pointed to better-than-expected new orders.
The S&P Supercomposite Homebuilding Index gained as much as 2.7 percent to the highest since Sept. 19, with Lennar jumping 4 percent and KB Home surging 5.5 percent. PulteGroup added 3.7 percent and Toll Brothers Inc. rose 3.3 percent.
Lennar’s “solid” orders were “another sign of improving housing demand,” Zelman Associates wrote in a note to clients. Lennar reported new orders of 10,463 homes, a 24 percent increase, versus the company’s prior view of 9,700 to 10,000. Analysts had expected 10,100, according to the average two estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Falling mortgage rates are also helping builders’ earnings and stock-price prospects. On Tuesday, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said investor optimism about lower interest rates was likely priming them to overlook any possible disappointments in KB Home and Lennar’s results. A lower 10-year Treasury yield “heals all wounds,” analyst Michael Rehaut wrote in a note. On Wednesday morning, Treasuries resumed their rally, with yields down about 3 basis points to 2.395 percent.
Mortgage rates fell and home prices moderated, “providing a catalyst for the new home market to correct itself,” Lennar Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said in a statement. Lennar is due to host a conference call at 11 a.m. New York time.
On Tuesday, KB Home Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger said his company is “encouraged by improving market conditions,” which should help boost revenues in the second half of this year. Orders of 2,675 topped an estimate of 2,663.

""These were serious and prolonged failures,"" said Mark Steward, the Financial Conduct Authority's executive director of enforcement and market oversight.
Goldman agreed to resolve the case speedily, thus qualifying for a 30 percent discount to avoid a fine of 49 million pounds.
""We are pleased to have resolved this legacy matter. We dealt with the issues proactively at the time and have made significant investments across the period to develop and enhance our reporting procedures,"" the U.S. investment bank said.
The FCA said that Goldman is the 14th financial firm to be fined for transaction reporting failures under the European Union securities law known as MiFID.
Last week it fined Swiss bank UBS 27.6 million pounds, at the time the highest penalty to date.
Accurate data on trades are essential for regulators to monitor for market abuses and combat financial crime, the FCA said, adding that between 2007 and 2017, Goldman made more than 220 million errors in its transaction reporting.
""The FCA also found that GSI failed to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly and effectively in respect of its transaction reporting,"" the FCA said.

U.S. officials have briefed in optimistic terms ahead of the latest talks, with Reuters citing one saying that China has made unprecedented proposals in regards to issues like forced technology transfers. There's been no sign of corroboration of that from China, however.
The latest talks, which will be followed by another round in Washington next week, come after the two sides missed a goal for a summit at the end of March to sign off on a deal.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global bond yields continued to spiral lower on Thursday as recession fears fed expectations of more policy easing by major central banks, while Turkey's lira took a 5 percent beating as pressure ratcheted up on its volatile markets again. 
Europe and Asia's top share markets did manage to steady, but with the end of what has been rollercoaster first quarter of the year for traders there was plenty to try and keep track of. 
Sterling was hit by a bout of Brexit blues after a round of votes in the U.K. parliament failed to produce any clarity or new plan to manage its divorce from the European Union.
A Reuters report that the United States and China had made progress in all areas in trade talks seemed to bolster sentiment a little, though sticking points still remained and there was no definite timetable for a deal. 
Early European moves saw London's FTSE climb 0.75 percent and Frankfurt and Paris both add 0.4, after a 1.6 percent tumble in Tokyo overnight had been offset by much of the rest of Asia-Pacific nudging higher..
Credit rating firm S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) became the latest to chop its euro zone growth forecasts while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 seemed uncertain which way New York would go later. 
Worries that the inversion of the U.S. Treasury curve signaled a future recession only deepened as 10-year yields fell to a fresh 15-month low at 2.34 percent.
""We think that the ongoing flattening, or outright inversion, of the curve is a bad sign for equities, as it usually has been in the past,"" said Oliver Jones, markets economist at Capital Economics.
""Arguments that the yield curve is no longer a reliable indicator seem to resurface every time it inverts, only to be subsequently proved wrong.""
The latest lunge lower in German bunds yields appeared to have eased at least, having dived deeper into negative territory on Wednesday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said a hike in interest rates could be further delayed.
Plans to mitigate the side-effects of negative interest rates could also be considered, suggesting the central bank was preparing for an extended period below zero.
That shift came hot on the heels of a dovish surprise on Wednesday from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which abandoned its neutral bias to say the next rate move would likely be down.
Yields in both New Zealand and neighbor Australia, sank to record lows in response. 
LIRA FREEFALL 
Turkey's lira, one of the currencies at the heart of last year's emerging market meltdown, plunged as much as 5 percent against the dollar amid worries that the economic and geopolitical risks are on the rise again there.
Authorities were showing the first sign of easing a draconian squeeze put on international lira traders ahead of local elections this weekend but a day after the country's stock market also slumped there was little good will.
Ugras Ulku at the International Institute of Finance in Washington said the question was, when the dust settles, whether portfolio managers want to continue to invest in Turkey or not ""we will have to wait and see,"" he said 
Elsewhere, hints of rate cuts from New Zealand's central bank had the desired effect on its currency, which was pinned at $0.6816 after diving 1.6 percent overnight. The Aussie was on the defensive at $0.7090.
Draghi's comments likewise kept the euro back at $1.1250, and left the U.S. dollar a fraction firmer against a basket of its competitors at 96.874.
Only the yen held its own thanks to its safe-haven status and firmed to 110.00 per dollar. 
Sterling had its own troubles as an offer by British Prime Minister Theresa May to quit to get her European Union deal through parliament failed, leaving uncertainty hanging over the Brexit process.
That left the pound down at $1.3150, though that was up from an overnight trough of $1.3140. 
In commodity markets, palladium was the focus of attention after sliding 7 percent on Wednesday as its meteoric rally finally ran into profit-taking. It was down 0.4 percent on Thursday.
Gold was relatively sedate at $1,310.85 per ounce. 
Oil prices nursed modest losses after data showed U.S. crude inventories grew more than expected last week as a Texas chemical spill hampered exports. 
U.S. crude was last down 18 cents at $59.23 a barrel, while Brent crude futures lost 10 cents to $67.73.

Hirai, together with his finance chief Kenichiro Yoshida, helped reinvent Sony as an entertainment company with stable revenue from music content and gaming, after battling years of losses from consumer electronics such as television sets.
Once a market leader in consumer electronics, the maker of the Walkman and Trinitron TV fell behind the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in innovation after the release of the iPod in 2001 and then the iPhone in 2007. It then also lost out to more nimble Asian rivals in price competition.
Under Hirai, who succeeded Howard Stringer as CEO in 2012, Sony sold off its ailing personal computer division and streamlined its television and smartphone businesses.

Yoshida last year took over as chief executive. Hirai will continue to act as a senior adviser to the company, Sony said.

Pontegadea bought the buildings from U.S. investment fund USAA Real Estate, the spokesman said, adding it was the Spanish fund's biggest ever deal in the United States. 
The buildings were sold for $740 million, according to the Seattle Times. Pontegadea declined to comment on the transaction value.
Ortega has made largely debt-free purchases of prime buildings from London to New York, becoming a major commercial real estate player, using the cash from massive dividend payouts from Inditex.
Europe's richest man, who holds a 59.29 percent stake in Inditex, not only rents out his commercial property to Inditex stores like Zara and Massimo Dutti at market rates but also to rivals such as H&M of Sweden and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) of the United States.
Pontegadea bought the Adelphi building in Westminster, London, in the second half of last year, home to the music-streaming service Spotify and media company Conde Nast.

Other properties include a stretch of London's prime shopping drag Oxford Street and the historic E.V. Haughwout Building in SoHo, New York.

FRANKFURT/BEIJING (Reuters) - Daimler will build its next generation of Smart electric cars in China through a joint venture with Geely, as a way to increase economies of scale in a market segment that is struggling to turn a profit.
China's Geely built a stake of almost 10 percent in Daimler last year, saying it wanted to forge an alliance to develop electric and self-driving cars to better compete against new competitors such as Uber and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Daimler said on Thursday it would build the next generation of Smart-branded city cars at a purpose-built factory in China, and planned to share its expertise in manufacturing, engineering and design with Geely.
The high cost of electric car batteries has made it hard for automakers to build affordable zero-emissions vehicles, leading several of them to strike alliances with Chinese partners. 
Daimler's German rival BMW recently unveiled plans to build electric Minis in China, where production costs are low and demand for small electric cars is rising.
Daimler and Geely did not disclose financial terms of their deal. The details of the joint venture will be finalised by the end of 2019, they said in a joint press release.
Daimler currently develops and builds Smart cars with  Renault  (PA:RENA), and constructs the small vehicles at factories in France and Slovenia.
The Daimler factory in Hambach, France, will be retooled to build Mercedes-Benz cars, it said.
Geely has been expanding rapidly through mergers and acquisitions since 2010, when it acquired Swedish carmaker Volvo from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. Last year, Daimler and Geely set up a ride-hailing joint venture in China.

Daimler's Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said last month the German carmaker was in talks to deepen its alliance with Geely after the Chinese's group's chairman Li Shufu bought a 9.69 percent stake in Daimler in 2018.

WOW, focused on low-cost travel across the Atlantic, advised passengers to check available flights with other airlines.
The announcement from WOW came after it had earlier postponed flights on Thursday as it entered the final stages of an equity raising with a group of investors.
WOW had ended talks with rival Icelandair last Sunday.
WOW is the latest budget airline to go out of business as the European airline sector grapples with over-capacity and high fuel costs. Recent failures include Britain's Flybmi and Primea Air.
Founded in 2011, the airline uses smaller single-aisle planes to fly between Iceland and many destinations in the United States and Europe.
Norwegian Air has a little over half of the market share in the fast-growing, low-cost, long-haul transatlantic market, while WOW controlled a quarter in 2018 when it flew a total of 3.5 million passengers.

Japan revised its procurement rules last year, introducing measures to strengthen security that were also a de facto ban on government purchases from Huawei and ZTE. 
The measures have been extended to 5G licensing rules for private companies, meaning Japan's telcos are unlikely to use network equipment from the two Chinese manufacturers.
""We do not hope to see rising protectionism in countries like Japan that are supporters of free trade,"" ministry spokesman Gao Feng told a regular briefing in Beijing.
The ministry had noticed that Huawei and ZTE's business operations have suffered in Japan, he said.
""If Japan's actions are unfair, that would shake mutual trust in both countries as well as the confidence of companies to cooperate, hurting bilateral relations,"" he added. 
Huawei has been facing mounting scrutiny, led by the United States, amid worries its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. The company says the concerns are unfounded. 
Last year, ZTE, the world's fourth-largest telecoms equipment maker, was prevented from buying components from U.S. firms in a crippling row over violations of export restrictions. 
ZTE resumed normal business after paying up to $1.4 billion in fines and replacing its entire board.

Bilateral ties between China and Japan have improved in the past year, with both sides expressing a desire to forge closer ties, both strategically and economically.

Investing.com -- What the ECB giveth, the ECB taketh away.
Bank stocks had outperformed on Wednesday after traders jumped on comments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi suggesting that the ECB would do something to offset the losses that they make on the billions of euros they hold in reserves at the central bank.
But they’re retreating today after the ECB’s chief economist Peter Praet walked back those comments in an interview, saying there would have to be a “monetary policy case” for 'tiering' the rates on excess deposits.
It’s an arcane debate, but one worth paying attention to, because the weakness of the euro zone’s banks is an obvious risk to the broader economy, if the global slowdown persists and triggers another rise in bad loans across the region. And as the Deutsche Bank-Commerzbank merger plans show, it's not like there is an abundance of other bright ideas out there for saving a sector riddled with zombies.
At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 1.32 points, or 0.4% at 378.60. It’s now up 12.0% for the year, while the Euro Stoxx banks sectoral index is up only 2.7%, the worst performing of all the major sectors.
Germany’s Dax was up 0.4%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.7%, sauced by another dip in sterling after Wednesday's inconclusive Brexit votes.
Of course, Europe’s banking problems don’t end with the ECB.  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa) is among the worst performing bank in Europe this morning, down 3.8% as three major shareholders withhold their support from CEO Birgitte Bonnesen over a widening money-laundering scandal. According to the Financial Times, U.S. authorities are now investigating the bank for whether it lied to them about the extent of its involvement in money-laundering documented by the so-called ‘Panama Papers’ leak.
Elsewhere, German chemicals giant Bayer (DE:BAYGN) is down another 1.4% after a U.S. jury said it must pay $80 million to a man for causing his cancer with its weedkiller Roundup. The company faces over 10,000 similar cases but continues to dispute the science behind the ruling.

Representatives for Lendlease and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Gresham did not return requests for comment.
The Australian developer wants to divest the E&S unit, which Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysts have said could fetch about A$500 million ($355.15 million) in cash proceeds, and focus on its other three units - construction, development and property investments.
In a presentation on Thursday, Lendlease said it expected to take a restructuring hit from the sale of between A$450 million to A$550 million.
LendLease last month reported a 96.3 percent drop in first-half profit, dragged down by the underperformance of the E&S businesses, which was hit by delays and low productivity in a tunneling project in Sydney.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Commodity trader Trafigura is shipping this month a second newly built crude tanker with Asian gasoline onboard to South America amid strong demand in the West, four industry sources who closely monitor petrol trade flows said on Thursday.
Although it is not uncommon for traders to use a brand new crude tanker of 150,000 deadweight tonnage (dwt) to ship clean fuels such as diesel, it is rare to use them for gasoline because of the sheer size. 
""South America likely needs gasoline more than gasoil now. The recent fire in Texas would have prompted its buyers including South America to seek gasoline supply options outside of the U.S. Gulf Coast,"" said a veteran oil products trader.
Ship tracking data from Refinitiv shows the 'Marlin Seoul' vessel is en route to Balboa in Panama from South Korea.
The Suezmax was delivered only this month and was built in South Korea by Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd. 
The ship is owned by Trafigura and is carrying more than 900,000 barrels of gasoline, one of the four sources said. 
Marlin Seoul is expected to arrive in Balboa on April 21, while its Marlin Swan, which sailed off earlier from South Korea, is likely to reach Balboa around April 9, data from Refinitiv ship tracking shows. 
Trafigura declined to comment on the fixtures.
Gasoline fundamentals have been strong across regions of Asia and Europe, especially in the United States with a string of refinery outages sharply reducing inventories in the Atlantic basin. 
The Houston Ship Channel connecting Houston to the Gulf of Mexico was earlier affected by chemical spills, which led to Lyondell Basell Industries and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) curbing production this week.
But Lyondell Basell Industries is now preparing to raise production.
In Asia, gasoline crack hit more than a five-month high on March 22 at $7.68 a barrel before easing to $7.53 a barrel on Wednesday.

""Kumho Asiana Group will launch an emergency management committee headed by vice chairman of the group to normalize our management in a short period of time and will hire a respectable person outside the company as the new chairman,"" it said.

Asiana Airlines got its auditor on Tuesday to approve the statements after revising its accounts that widened its annual loss. Trading in Asiana resumed on Tuesday.
The airline had two CEOs, and with Park stepping down, Han Chang-su remains its sole CEO.

277,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 02:25AM ET</span>","Bullish bets on Indian rupee rise, yuan longs recede: Reuters poll","By Rushil Dutta
(Reuters) - Bullish positions in the Indian rupee firmed over the past two weeks, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, ahead of general election, while long positions in the yuan unwound on concerns over slowing domestic demand and uncertainty around Sino-U.S. trade talks.
Investors piled on long rupee bets in a return to bullishness earlier this month after a year, the poll of 12 respondents showed. 
The confidence rode on brightening re-election prospects of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janta Party, translating into inflows of $5.99 billion so far this year into equities.
India will hold general elections in seven stages starting April 11. 
Meanwhile, bullish bets on the Chinese yuan receded after a raft of weak economic data showed faltering momentum of external trade and domestic demand, and lack of clarity on trade negotiations between China and the U.S. 
""A moderate stimulus package and insistence on deleveraging indicate Beijing's increased tolerance for slower growth,"" DBS Bank said in a note. 
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said mid-March the government had additional monetary policy measures as its disposal to support economic growth, and that he hoped trade talks with the U.S. would achieve results.
Reuters on Thursday reported that China and the U.S. had made progress in all areas in trade talks but sticking points still remained and there was no definite timetable for a deal.
Meanwhile, investors upped their bearish bets on the Indonesian rupiah to levels last seen in mid-December.
A global economic slowdown and a sudden end to the U.S. Federal Reserve policy tightening have raised expectations of rate cuts in Asia.
Besides Philippines and India, Indonesia has room to reverse some of last year's multiple interest rate hikes aimed at protecting the local unit from emerging market turmoil, economists said.
Long positions on the Philippine peso reversed course, the poll showed.
Last week, the Philippine central bank kept its benchmark interest rate steady for a third straight meeting. However, it warned that there were risks to economic growth in 2019 if a budget impasse in Congress was not resolved soon.
Investors notched up their long positions on the Thai baht and the Singapore dollar, while cutting bearish bets on the South Korean won and Taiwan dollar.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.

The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Pimco, Elliott and David Kempner Capital Management have discussed the proposal with California lawmakers and other stakeholders, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.
The plan is to form a $14 billion cash trust to pay for the claims linked to the wildfires in 2017 and 2018, it said, citing the proposal seen by the news outlet.
The proposal is being pitched on behalf of an ad hoc committee of PG&E's senior unsecured noteholders and will create a statewide wildfire fund of at least $13 billion. The fund will be financed by statewide bonds, PG&E, other California utilities and state funding sources, according to the report.
PG&E will also be recapitalized through contributions worth $8 billion that will allow it to refinance its debtor-in-possession loan and other maturities, according to Bloomberg.
PG&E, Pimco, Elliott and David Kempner did not respond to requests for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.
San Francisco-based PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January in the aftermath of devastating wildfires that struck California in recent years, some linked or suspected to be linked to the company's equipment.

The bankruptcy was filed in anticipation of liabilities from the wildfires, including a catastrophic 2018 blaze, the Camp Fire. It killed 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.

280,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 02:00AM ET</span>",Global Bond Markets Go ‘Mad’ as Everything Rallies at Once,"(Bloomberg) -- Whether you call it “Japanification,” a dash for safety or a bet on the Fed’s new normal, bond bulls are charging into some of the most notorious corners of developed debt markets.
As benchmark Treasury yields trade at December 2017 lows and those on German bunds sink deeper into negative territory, century bonds riddled with interest-rate risk are suddenly one of the market’s biggest outperformers. And the market value of the world’s investment-grade and high-yield bonds has jumped by almost $1.6 trillion to $55 trillion in the past three weeks, with the index racing toward record highs, according to Bloomberg data.
Investors have vanquished their rate fears and now see central banks spoon-feeding returns through the rest of the credit cycle as the Treasury yield curve flashes recession fears.
“Fixed income has gone mad,’’ said Rishi Mishra, an analyst at Futures First. “It really is a mad search for quality.’’
Take negative-yielding debt. Often cast as the poster child for financial repression, it’s in line for gains as inflation goes AWOL. If anything, the concern is that with price pressures so muted and growth so weak, yields can keep falling and locking in rates now may pay off.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell certainly emboldened the lowflation case last week when he said global risks are weighing on the economic outlook and that tighter policy can wait after slashing projected interest-rate increases this year to zero from two.
“Negative yields reflect low growth and subdued inflation,’’ said Ben Emons, the managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. “They have been relatively consistent in predicting such an environment whereas positive yields have fluctuated on expecting higher growth -- only to find out such high growth lasts just two quarters.’’
Austria’s bonds due 2117 have delivered a total return of about 15 percent this year as investors shrugged off the inherent uncertainty of casting bets one hundred years into the future. German 30-year bonds yielding a paltry 54 basis points are up 7.7 percent, trouncing juicier junk bonds and emerging markets.
For now, the search for yield has swept up corporate debt markets too, even though company balance sheets would be hit in an economic slowdown that would impinge on their abilities to service large debt loads.
“It seems that there is widespread capitulation on strong macro views, so the search for carry is on,’’ said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for fixed income at Axa Investment.
The $9.8 trillion Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate Corporate Index is fast recovering from last year’s meltdown, yielding less than 125 basis points above Treasuries -- below the five-year average.
“Credit should not do well when the yield curve is inverted and recession fears heighten,” Emons wrote in a separate note. “Yet, inverted yield curves, recession and rate cut expectations has driven credit spreads tighter.”

The Bluewater business, which is also attracting interest from closely held Fieldwood Energy LLC, is focused on deep-water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and could fetch about $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a sale, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.
An agreement hasn’t been reached and Blackstone and LLOG could decide not to sell Bluewater, the people said.
Blackstone and LLOG announced the joint venture in 2012, pledging to invest about $1.2 billion in the project. The sale is one of several being planned in the Gulf of Mexico as larger companies look to re-deploy capital into other fields.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). is also selling assets in the area with a potential value of about $1.5 billion, the people said.
BHP, the world’s biggest mining company and also a producer of oil and gas, advanced 0.6 percent to A$38.12 at 12:05 p.m. in Sydney Thursday.
Representatives for Blackstone and BHP, based in Melbourne, Australia, declined to comment. Lafayette, Louisiana-based LLOG, Fieldwood and Exxon didn’t respond to requests for comment.
BHP, fresh from selling its shale business, has said that adding conventional oil assets is one of its top priorities. During the sale process for its shale operations, the company considered exchanging them for oil assets in the Gulf of Mexico, where it’s one of the top producers.
Blackstone’s energy group is raising its third energy fund with a $4.5 billion target. The firm also owns stakes in Ulterra Drilling Technologies LP and Grand Prix Pipeline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The Brexit saga continues to unfold as U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said she would resign if Parliament backs her Brexit deal.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.4%, while the SZSE Component edged up 0.1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed. Shares of China Construction Bank Corp (HK:0939) fell about 1.5% after the company reported its first profit drop since 2015 in the first quarter of 2019.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.5%. South Korea’s KOSPI traded 0.6% lower. Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 was up 0.3%.
In the U.K., May said she would stand down as Prime Minister after her Brexit deal is done.
“I am prepared to leave this job earlier than I intended in order to do what is right for our country and our party,” May said.
“I ask everyone in this room to back the deal so we can complete our historic duty -- to deliver on the decision of the British people and leave the European Union with a smooth and orderly exit.”
Members of Parliament voted on Wednesday on eight possible Brexit options, but rejected all of them, leaving May’s deal, which was already rejected twice in House of Commons, the only one in play.
May is widely expected to bring a third vote to Parliament in the coming days, according to various media.
On the Sino-U.S. trade front, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to have a new round of trade talks with Chinese officials in Beijing today. It was reported earlier that the two sides are hoping to strike a deal before the end of April.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 09:53PM ET</span>",U.S. jury says Bayer must pay $80 million to man in Roundup cancer trial,"By Alexandria Sage and Tina Bellon
SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Wednesday awarded $80 million to a man who claimed his use of Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup caused his cancer, in the latest legal setback for the company facing thousands of similar lawsuits.
The jury in San Francisco federal court said the company was liable for plaintiff Edwin Hardeman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
It awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $75 million in punitive damages to Hardeman after finding that Roundup was defectively designed, that  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) failed to warn of the herbicide's cancer risk and that the company acted negligently.
Bayer bought Roundup maker Monsanto last year for $63 billion.
The company in a statement on Wednesday said it was disappointed with the jury's decision and that it would appeal the verdict.
""This verdict does not change the weight of over four decades of extensive science and the conclusions of regulators worldwide that support the safety of our glyphosate-based herbicides and that they are not carcinogenic,"" Bayer said.
The trial is only the second of more than 11,200 Roundup lawsuits set to go to trial in the United States. Previous litigation setbacks and a prior jury verdict against the company have sent Bayer shares plunging.
The verdict comes after the same jury on March 19 found Roundup to have been a ""substantial factor"" in causing Hardeman's cancer, allowing the trial to proceed to a second phase to determine liability and damages. Bayer shares fell more than 12 percent after last week's jury finding.
In the trial's second phase, Hardeman's lawyers were able to present previously excluded internal documents allegedly showing the company's efforts to influence scientists and regulators about the widely-used product's safety.
Lawyers for Hardeman were seen by a Reuters reporter cheering in the elevator outside the courtroom after the verdict was announced.
""As demonstrated throughout trial, since Roundup's inception over 40 years ago, Monsanto refuses to act responsibly,"" Hardeman's lawyers said in a statement, adding that the company instead focused on ""manipulating public opinion and undermining anyone who raises genuine and legitimate concerns about Roundup.""
'HASN'T SUNK IN'
After the verdict, Hardeman told reporters he was ""overwhelmed.""
""It hasn't sunk in yet,"" he said.
Hardeman's case was considered a bellwether trial to help determine the range of damages and define settlement options for the more than 760 other federal cases pending in the same court before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria.
In the first trial phase of Hardeman's case, the jury deliberated for more than four days before finding Roundup responsible for the man's cancer. Bayer on Wednesday said that was an indication that jurors were ""very likely divided over the scientific evidence.""
The company said its appeal would focus on legal rulings by Chhabria, who allowed some of Hardeman's scientific experts to testify despite calling plaintiffs' expert opinions ""shaky"" in a 2018 ruling.
But legal experts have noted that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees the San Francisco federal court, has generally been permissive in allowing expert testimony.
Monsanto's Roundup was the first to contain glyphosate, the world's most widely used weed killer. But it is no longer patent-protected and many other versions are available. Bayer does not provide sales figures for the product.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators have found that glyphosate is not likely carcinogenic to humans. The World Health Organization's cancer arm in 2015 reached a different conclusion, classifying glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" 
In the first U.S. Roundup trial, another California man was awarded $289 million in August after a state court jury found Roundup caused his cancer. That award was later reduced to $78 million and is on appeal.
Hardeman's case featured a significant difference from that trial after Chhabria decided to split cases before him into two phases: one to decide causation on purely scientific grounds, the other to determine Bayer's potential liability and damages only if the jury first ruled that the weed killer was a substantial factor in causing cancer. 
That decision had been seen as beneficial to Bayer. Legal experts said the jury's verdict in the first phase of the Hardeman case was a significant setback, narrowing the company's legal options going forward.
Chhabria has scheduled another bellwether trial for May and a third trial is likely to also take place this year. All three will be split into causation and liability phases.
Bayer is also scheduled to face another Roundup trial in California state court beginning on March 28 and at least two trials in Missouri state court in the fall.

For Rahul Singh at Tata Asset Management Ltd., chief among his concerns is the possibility of a deadlock on who leads the world’s largest democracy.
“The biggest risk to the recent gains in Indian equities is there may be a hung parliament,” Singh, the chief investment officer, said in an interview at his office last week. “In that case, though a very small probability, nothing will hold the market and it will be in trouble if some weak leader emerges to lead a government that may not last even for a year.”
Key Indian equity indexes have rebounded more than 8 percent from this year’s low on Feb. 19 on the back of a surge in foreign flows. Overseas investors have pumped in more than $6 billion into local equities this year on bets of strong company earnings, lower interest rates and increasing chances of Prime Minister Narendra Modi getting another five-year term.
Tata Asset’s strategy is to bet on shares that failed to participate in the rally. In particular, engineering and construction firms, plus industrial-component makers, may eventually gain as companies boost capital spending and the government increases infrastructure projects, according to the money manager.

At least four opinion polls conducted this month showed the current ruling coalition can either cross or get close to a majority in the 543-seat Indian lower house. Still, market participants are anxious and will wait for the official outcome on May 23 for clarity on investment decisions.
“If we are able to pick the right stocks that have underperformed and the fundamentals are changing at the margin, it’s possible to generate portfolio returns that are higher than the indexes,” said Singh, overseeing about $3.3 billion of equities.
The money manager is accumulating shares of corporate banks -- lenders with substantial portion of loans to companies -- for the past six months across its funds. Even as it finds state-owned companies cheaper, they aren’t an immediate option, according to the fund. Over time, Tata Asset may consider buying state-controlled utilities and fuel retailers.
Still, the strategy differs from the conventional value investing as the asset manager also picks expensive stocks with a robust earnings outlook. “We look at value with possible triggers over the next six months for us to get returns. Secondly, we pick stocks where an earnings upgrade cycle is either underway or likely to begin,” Singh said.
Financial Sector
Earnings at the S&P BSE Bankex, a gauge of 10 lenders, is expected to rise an average 52 percent in the financial year that ends March 31, 2019 and 81 percent in the next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, as most lenders are expected to have fewer bad loans and less provisions for soured debt.
Financial firms constituted 33 percent of total value of Tata Asset’s investments across 222 stocks as on Feb. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, followed by consumer stocks at about 29 percent. Tata Equity P/E Fund -- its biggest portfolio at $740 million -- has returned an average 20 percent in each of the past five years, beating 74 percent rivals. The Sensex rose 13 percent in the same period.

(Reuters) - A New Jersey jury on Wednesday cleared Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) of liability in a lawsuit brought by a man who said that asbestos in the company's talcum powder products caused his mesothelioma.
The jury delivered its unanimous verdict in Middlesex County Superior Court in New Brunswick, just miles from J&J's headquarters, in the case of plaintiff Ricardo Rimondi.
J&J, which faces some 13,000 talc-related lawsuits nationwide, denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free.
Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday also settled three other mesothelioma talc cases pending in state courts in California, Oklahoma and New York, Chris Panatier, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told Reuters.
Panatier declined to provide further details, citing confidentiality agreements.
Addressing the settlements, J&J in a statement said, ""there are one-off situations where settlement is reasonable.""
J&J said it stood by the safety of its talc and would continue to vigorously defend the safety of baby powder.
""We do not have any organized program to settle Johnson's Baby Powder cases, nor are we planning a settlement program,"" the company said. 
Referring to the Rimondi verdict, J&J said the company's track record in the talc litigation underscored ""the decades of clinical evidence and scientific studies by medical experts around the world"" supporting the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder.
J&J shares, which had been down slightly, turned positive after the jury verdict was announced and closed up 13 cents at $138.70.
Lawyers for the 58-year old Rimondi could not be reached for comment.
Rimondi in 2016 was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a type of cancer that has been linked to asbestos exposure. 
He and his wife sued J&J in 2017. They alleged that Rimondi's lifetime exposure to Johnson's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, another powder product containing talc sold by J&J in the past, caused his disease. 
The jury returned its verdict in favor of the company after just half an hour of deliberations, according to a livestream of the proceedings by Courtroom View Network.
The healthcare conglomerate to date has faced 12 trials by plaintiffs claiming asbestos in talc caused their mesothelioma. 
J&J has now been cleared of liability in four trials, with another five resulting in hung juries and mistrials. Three juries have found J&J liable, awarding a total of $172 million in damages. J&J is appealing those verdicts.
The majority of the 13,000 talc lawsuits against the company involve ovarian cancer claims. Juries in those cases have hit the company with verdicts as high as $4.69 billion.
Some of the ovarian cancer verdicts have been overturned on appeal on technical legal grounds, while the company's other appeals are still pending.
""It remains true that of all the talc-related verdicts against Johnson & Johnson that have been through the appeals process, every one has been overturned,"" the company said in its statement on Wednesday. 
Plaintiffs' lawyers have more recently focused on arguing that asbestos contamination in talc caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.
Reuters in December published a report detailing that the company knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results the company did not disclose to regulators or consumers.

J&J denies the findings of the Reuters report, which it describes as inaccurate and misleading. In emphasizing the safety of its baby powder, the company says that repeated tests of the powder never found asbestos and that it has cooperated fully and openly with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other global regulators.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 08:19PM ET</span>","Boeing rolls out software fix to defend 737 MAX franchise, awaits U.S. regulator's approval","By Eric M. Johnson and David Shepardson
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Wednesday took its most aggressive moves yet to defend its core 737 airliner franchise, saying it had developed software fixes to prevent failures of an automated flight control system that is being scrutinized after two deadly crashes in the past five months.
Boeing, in the midst of one its worst crises in years, is under pressure from crash victims' families, airlines, lawmakers in Washington and regulators around the world to prove that the automated flight control systems aboard its 737 MAX aircraft are safe, and that pilots have the training required to override the system in an emergency.
A Boeing official in Seattle said on Wednesday the timing of the software upgrade was ""100 percent independent of the timing of the Ethiopian accident,"" and the company was taking steps to make the anti-stall system ""more robust.""
There was no need to overhaul Boeing's regulatory relationship with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) now, the company said.
""We are going to do everything that we can do to ensure that accidents like these never happen again,"" Mike Sinnett, Vice President for Product Strategy and Future Airplane Development told reporters.
The FAA said it had not reviewed or certified the software upgrade yet. 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and some lawmakers on Wednesday questioned why Boeing did not require safety features on its top-selling plane that might have prevented the crashes. 
""It is very questionable if these were safety-oriented additions, why they were not part of the required template of measures that should go into an airplane,"" she said, adding she was not ready to require that all safety options be retrofitted on existing airplane.
A spokesman for the FAA said the agency had not reviewed or certified the software upgrade yet.
Executives with U.S. airlines welcomed Boeing's moves, but want U.S. regulators to sign off on the upgrade.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, which on Wednesday became the first major airline to formally cut its financial outlook for the year after being forced to pull its MAX fleet of 34 jets out of service, supported Boeing's decision. 
""Boeing's software update appears to add yet another layer of safety to the operation of the MAX aircraft,"" Southwest's certificate chief pilot Bob Waltz said. 
Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Airlines Group Inc pilots, said it was pleased with Boeing's progress but warned the certification process should not be rushed. The fix should be fully vetted and take into account any further information from an investigation into an Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, the association said in a statement.
United Airlines vice president Michael Quiello said the airline was optimistic about the software update, but was counting on the FAA to certify the change.
Airline stocks turned positive after Boeing unveiled the software fix. CFRA analyst Jim Corridore, who has a ""buy"" rating on Boeing, said news from the company and the Washington hearing were positive steps toward getting the MAX jets airborne again.
EXTRA COMPUTER TRAINING 
The world's largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in at least one of the accidents, in Indonesia last October, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.
It will also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure the ""angle of attack,"" or angle of the wing to the airflow, a fundamental parameter of flight, offer widely different readings, Boeing said. Reuters reported those details earlier this week.
The anti-stall system - known as MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System - has been pinpointed by investigators as a possible cause in a fatal Lion Air crash in Indonesia and the one in Ethiopia.
Existing 737 pilots will also have extra computer-based training following criticism that MCAS was not described in the aircraft manual. 
Boeing has previously said existing cockpit procedures would cover any example of runaway controls caused by MCAS.
The changes were drawn up in response to the Lion Air crash but are seen as crucial to regaining the trust of pilots, passengers and regulators after the Ethiopia crash prompted a worldwide grounding of Boeing 737 MAX planes.
Ethiopian officials and some analysts have said the Ethiopian Airlines jet behaved in a similar pattern before crashing shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa, but that investigation is still at an early stage.
Boeing's Sinnett said the software had been through extensive testing, including flights with the FAA. However, he said he could provide no timeframe for when the 737 MAX jets would return to service.
Boeing said it would change the design of the system so that it no longer relied on a single sensor. The changes also would make standard visual warnings to the pilots if the system had stopped working. Previously, those warning messages and displays had been optional. 
Reuters reported in November after the Lion Air disaster that some aviation experts believed the optional alert could have alerted engineers about mechanical faults, leading to an industry debate over whether the system should be mandatory. 
Current 737 MAX pilots have criticized Boeing for not disclosing more details about MCAS initially. Sinnett said the company has added details on MCAS to its flight crew operations manual. All pilots will need to complete this training before returning to the skies, he said.

John Hamilton, chief engineer for 737 Max flight displays, said in a statement that ""all primary flight information required to safely and efficiently operate the 737 MAX"" was already included without the features that would now be offered.

289,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>",Aramco to Acquire $69 Billion Sabic Stake in Record Mideast Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producer, will buy a majority stake in local chemical giant Sabic from the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund for $69.1 billion, transferring a big slug of cash from one arm of the state to another to help finance Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s economic agenda.
The Middle East’s biggest ever deal had been first mooted last year after the initial public offering of Aramco was postponed because investors balked at the crown prince’s $2 trillion valuation. Aramco’s purchase of the Sabic stake gets funds to the PIF by a different route.
The purchase also subtly shifts Aramco’s center of gravity away from its core business of pumping oil -- about one-in-10 barrels globally -- into the chemicals that are the building blocks of plastic goods. Aramco is keen to push into petrochemicals as demand growth for gasoline and other fuels starts to slow because of the global fight against climate change.
“This transaction is a major step in accelerating Saudi Aramco’s transformative downstream growth strategy of integrated refining and petrochemicals,"" Amin Nasser, chief executive officer of Aramco, said in a statement on Wednesday.
The deal values the Public Investment Fund’s 70 percent stake at 123.4 riyals per share, according to the statement. The remaining shares, list on the Saudi stock market, aren’t part of the transaction and will continue trade publicly.
Aramco didn’t say how it plans to finance the acquisition, but in the past the company has said it’s likely to tap the global capital markets for the first time ever. If the Saudi state-owned company issues bonds in dollars, it will be forced to release detailed financial statements for the first time since its nationalization in the late 1970s.
Under the leadership of Yasir Othman Al-Rumayyan, the sovereign wealth fund is shifting its investment focus from domestic assets -- with stakes in the likes of Sabic and National Commercial Bank -- to international, funneling billions of dollars into high-profile overseas deals, including a stake in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. The fund lies at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s effort to reduce its reliance on oil revenue under an economic transformation plan known as Vision 2030. In addition to running the PIF, Othman Al-Rumayyan is also a director at Aramco.
Aramco plans to invest $500 billion over the next decade, and much of that will be on refineries and chemical plants. The company wants to secure future demand for its barrels, and acquiring control of the Middle East’s biggest chemical maker would bring it closer to its goal of becoming one of largest producers of raw materials used to make plastics.
Saudi Aramco may stagger payments for the Sabic acquisition, offering flexibility in how to finance the largest deal in the kingdom’s history, Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said in January.
The company has very little debt, but is planning to issue international bonds for the first time. Saudi Aramco picked banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and National Commercial Bank to manage the bond sale, people familiar with the matter have said.

290,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 07:32PM ET</span>","'Don't blink' on Trump tariffs, steel CEOs tell U.S. lawmakers","By David Lawder and Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chief executives from American steel producers urged lawmakers to maintain strong U.S. tariffs on the metal on Wednesday to protect their industry, as Senate efforts to rein in President Donald Trump's tariff powers gained steam.
The CEOs of top U.S. steelmakers  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE), United States Steel Corp, ArcelorMittal SA and Commercial Metals Co told the Congressional Steel Caucus that the ""Section 232"" steel tariffs were just starting to allow their industry to recover from damage caused by years of dumped imports and needed to be kept in place long-term.
Trump imposed the 25-percent global tariffs on steel imports a year ago to protect the industry from imports, citing national security grounds under a Cold War-era trade law. The move drew retaliation by countries including China, Canada, Mexico, Turkey and the European Union.
Little has been done to reduce excess steel production capacity in China that U.S. producers blame for most of the industry's woes, and without the tariffs, unfairly traded imports would flood back into the U.S. market, the executives said. 
""Now is not the time to blink,"" U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt told the lawmakers at a hearing on Wednesday. ""Section 232 must continue to be applied to all countries, especially the largest import sources, whether that's a tariff or a hard quota. Even our best allies can be conduits for foreign steel from China or elsewhere.""
Canada and Mexico are trying to negotiate a plan to lift U.S. metals tariffs from their products. The Trump administration is demanding quotas to limit import volumes in lieu of tariffs, but Canada and Mexico are resisting.
Earlier this week, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer made little headway in a meeting to resolve the issue, a Canadian official told Reuters.
""There was not a meeting of the minds,"" the official said. ""That of course is an opportunity for the minister to reflect and think about what our next steps are.""
One issue in the negotiations is addressing U.S. concerns about how to prevent Chinese steel from entering the United States duty-free from Canada and Mexico. The Canadian official said Ottawa was willing to work with U.S. authorities to block such imports, but added that Washington had not yet presented convincing evidence that steel was being trans-shipped through Canada.
Canada and Mexico have retaliated against the U.S. steel tariffs with their own tariffs on U.S. beef, pork and other agricultural products, raising the ire of farm-state lawmakers.
Several Republican U.S. senators are combining forces on legislation to limit Trump's ability to impose tariffs under Section 232 of the Cold War-era Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who represents the farming state of Iowa, on Tuesday said he would lead the effort aimed at restoring Congress' constitutional authority over trade matters. His plan calls for Section 232 tariffs to be limited to a defined period of time unless extended by Congress.
United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard told the steel caucus lawmakers that Canada should be exempted from the Section 232 tariffs because of the high level of cross-border integration and common ownership in the industry. His union represents about 9,000 Canadian steel workers and 50,000 at U.S. mills. 
But Representative Mike Bost, a Republican whose district saw U.S. Steel restart two blast furnaces and rehire 800 workers at its Granite City, Illinois mill last year, made clear that he was focused on rebuilding steelmaking capacity in the United States, not Canada. 
""I want to let you know that the focus of this committee should be our U.S. workers,"" Bost said.
The steel executives also called on the lawmakers to boost U.S. demand for steel by passing a significant infrastructure investment package this year.

""Please let this year be the time to stop talking and start investing,"" said ArcelorMittal USA President John Brett.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>",U.S. FAA says handling aircraft approval on its own would cost $1.8 billion,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It would cost $1.8 billion and take 10,000 new employees for the U.S. aviation regulator to handle all aircraft certification internally, the agency's acting chief told a Senate panel on Wednesday, facing tough questions after two Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes on how new planes are approved for flight. 
The Federal Aviation Administration delegates much of the work of airplane certification to manufacturers such as Boeing under a decades-old process. The FAA has agreed to significantly improve its oversight of organizations performing certifications on its behalf by July 2019, U.S. Transportation Department Inspector General Calvin Scovel told the panel.
The FAA's acting head Daniel Elwell was asked why the FAA did not require disclosure of a new anti-stall software system in flight manuals or new pilot training before it certified the now grounded 737 MAX passenger jet in 2017.
Senator Ted Cruz, who chairs the Subcommittee on Science and Space, told Reuters after the hearing Elwell's estimate was ""a little bit of straw man"" and deflected from serious concerns about the FAA delegation of responsibilities to Boeing.
Cruz said ""there have been long standing concerns that have been raised about the closeness of the FAA with Boeing"" and noted a 2012 audit that raised those questions.
""At this point we don't know that's what caused this, but on the face of it, it certainly seems inadequate - the pilot training material did not raise the details of this new system,"" Cruz said.
Boeing said on Wednesday that it had reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.
The planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in at least one of the accidents, in Indonesia last October, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.
Elwell also said that an alert to pilots that Boeing was making standard on all 737 MAX planes as part of a software upgrade was not ""safety critical."" Boeing will stop charging for that alert and will not charge for another optional indicator.
""I find it hard to believe that a safety company like an airline would save a couple thousand dollars on an option that might improve safety,” Elwell said, who also defended the decision not to require new training after it was tested by pilots. ""Fundamentally, the aircraft layout, the handling and the performance of the aircraft was the same.""
A group of 16 Democratic senators wrote Boeing on Wednesday raising ""serious concerns"" that Boeing charges extra for safety features like ""backup fire extinguishers in the cargo hold and oxygen masks for flight crews"" and some said they may introduce legislation to bar the practice.
In earlier comments on Wednesday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao asked why Boeing did not require safety features on its top-selling 737 MAX that might have prevented the crashes and said that would be ""troubling.""
Shortly after Chao spoke, Boeing confirmed the company will make standard a safety feature on its 737 MAX that might have warned earlier of problems that possibly played a role in the crashes of Indonesian and Ethiopian planes that killed almost 350 people. It also said it would stop charging for another optional safety feature.
Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat and pilot, questioned Chao why it took the FAA so long to ground the 737 MAX while regulators around the world moved faster to halt planes.

He also questioned why safety features were not mandated by Boeing or the FAA. ""It looks like we are following,"" Manchin said, adding it was ""just wrong"" not to require the alert.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",Lyft raises IPO price target as investor fret over missing out,"By Joshua Franklin and Diptendu Lahiri
(Reuters) - Lyft Inc on Wednesday raised the price range for its initial public offering, as investors looked past the ride-hailing startup's mounting losses to the company's growing market share against larger rival Uber Technologies Inc.
Lyft raised its IPO price range to between $70 and $72 per share, meaning the ride-hailing company is now targeting a valuation of up to $24.3 billion. The increased range, from $62-$68 previously, is the result of investors worrying about missing out on the biggest U.S. IPO since  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) in 2017.
Lyft's IPO was oversubscribed just two days into its investor roadshow, Reuters reported last week.
At the upper end of the new range, Lyft would have a market capitalization of $20.45 billion, a little larger than Snap Inc when it went public in 2017. At this size, it would be the biggest U.S. IPO since Chinese e-commerce  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd in 2014. 
Counting for things like restricted stock options, Lyft's valuation would be as high as $24.3 billion. Lyft was valued at $15 billion in final private fundraising round in 2018.
At the mid-point of its new target range, $71 per share, Lyft would raise roughly $2.1 billion. 
The increased price range signals a healthy appetite for new stocks after jeans maker Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI) last week priced its targeted range and popped on its market debut. 
It also indicates many investors are willing to overlook uncertainty over Lyft's path to profitability and its strategy for autonomous driving, for fear of missing out on such a high-profile technology IPO.
The IPO market had a slow start in 2019 due to volatile markets at the end of last year and the government shutdown in January blocking U.S. regulators from processing new IPO applicants. 
This all bodes well for the likes of Uber Technologies and Pinterest Inc, which are also planning to go public in 2019 but like Lyft have yet to turn a profit. 
With start-ups like Lyft staying private for longer, there is a backlog of demand to allocate more money to stocks which are considered high-growth in order to diversify away from Wall Street's FAANG trade which is made up of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) , Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc .
Nevertheless, Lyft's strategy and ability to make money has not been without skeptics. 
Union pension fund adviser CtW Investment Group has argued Lyft ""faces an all-but-insurmountable barrier"" to profitability due to issues with the ride-hailing company's pricing strategy and new regulations driving costs higher. 
Lyft's revenue was $2.16 billion for 2018, double the previous year's and far higher than $343 million in 2016. It posted a loss of $911 million in 2018 versus $688 million in 2017.

Lyft's IPO is set to price on Thursday with shares scheduled to begin trading on the Nasdaq on Friday.

293,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 06:52PM ET</span>",EssilorLuxottica's top investor seeks arbitration in governance spat,"By Silvia Aloisi and Matthias Blamont
MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - The top shareholder and executive chairman of EssilorLuxottica has filed an arbitration request to verify alleged violations of a merger agreement between the Italian and French groups, further escalating a spat over power sharing.
Essilor and Luxottica merged last October, creating the world's largest eyewear maker in a 54 billion euro ($61.73 billion) deal.
The two groups were supposed to have equal weighting in the combined company's leadership, but they now accuse each other of trying to gain the upper hand.
Delfin, the holding of Luxottica's founder Leonardo Del Vecchio, said in a statement the arbitration request was filed with the International Chamber of Commerce. It said it was seeking an injunction to ensure that the power-sharing agreement in the merger deal would be respected until it expires in 2021.
The request was due to a deadlock within EssilorLuxottica's board which was hampering the integration process and planned synergies, the statement added.
""Delfin thinks that the request to the International Chamber of Commerce is at present a necessary solution and the most appropriate move to preserve the investments of all shareholders,"" the statement said.
In an interview in French newspaper Le Figaro last week, Del Vecchio - who has a 31 percent voting stake in EssilorLuxottica - accused the vice chairman of the merged group, Hubert Sagnieres, of a power grab and said the Frenchman would only listen to himself. 
As a result of the governance tensions, Del Vecchio said the 400-600 million euros of cost-savings that the merger was expected to yield had fallen behind schedule.
With the division of power unclear, analysts say tensions could undermine the integration process at the group, whose shares have falllen 11 percent since the start of the year.
Sagnieres had earlier on Wednesday sent a letter to Essilor staff seeking to ease concerns over governance.
In the letter, Sagnieres said that the search for a new CEO for EssilorLuxottica was a ""priority"" and that integration work was ongoing within the frame of 20 joint working groups with the support of U.S consulting firm McKinsey.
""We must dedicate our energy to integrating the two businesses under strong leadership and implementing the synergies that we have promised to the market,"" Sagnieres wrote on Wednesday.
""I will continue to ensure we accelerate operational efficiencies rather than becoming derailed by governance matters that often only reflect personal ambitions,"" Sagnieres added.
Sagnieres had previously accused Del Vecchio of a ""de facto attempt to take control of the new group, without any premium offered to shareholders.""
Tensions between the two groups have increased since last November, when Del Vecchio appeared to ear-mark indicate his right-hand man, Francesco Milleri, for the chief executive's role. 

France and Italy have had previous disputes concerning companies while diplomatic rifts between Paris and Rome governments occurred this year.

296,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 05:01PM ET</span>",Swedish authorities widen Swedbank inquiry to include suspected fraud,"By Simon Johnson, Johan Ahlander and Helena Soderpalm
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Economic Crime Authority (EBM) widened its Swedbank investigation to include suspected fraud following a raid on Wednesday on the Swedish bank's headquarters in an inquiry into its handling of money laundering allegations.
""The information paints a picture of Swedbank appearing to have spread misleading information to the public and the market about what the bank knew about suspected money laundering within Swedbank in the Baltic States,"" the EBM said in a statement.
Money laundering allegations against Swedbank have sparked fears that the largest lender in the Baltic region will become embroiled in a scandal engulfing rival Danske Bank, and face the threat of lawsuits, fines and other sanctions.
Swedbank Chief Executive Birgitte Bonessen said she was doing everything she could to handle the situation, adding that nobody at the bank had been charged with committing a crime. 
""This has been a very tough day for Swedbank, our employees and our shareholders. We will cooperate with EBM (Economic Crime Authority) and we await the conclusions of the authority,"" she said in a statement.
Bonnesen also addressed allegations by Swedish state broadcaster SVT that Swedbank was under investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) for having allegedly misled investigators over customer transactions linked to Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm at the center of a global tax avoidance and money laundering scandal.
SVT said it had obtained confidential documents showing that although Swedbank told the DFS it only had customers from Sweden and Norway with ties to Mossack Fonseca, companies with ties to the law firm had done business through Swedbank in the Baltics.
SVT said the DFS had written to Swedbank on Feb. 20 to say it was looking into seven separate matters. The DFS and Sweden's financial watchdog declined to comment.
""Swedbank believes that it has been truthful and accurate in its communications with all government authorities,"" said Bonnesen who oversaw the bank's anti-money laundering policy between 2009 and 2011 before heading its Baltic operations.
Bonnesen has repeatedly said she has confidence in the lender's anti-money laundering procedures and that the bank reported suspicious transactions to authorities. 
But in recent days investors have criticized Swedbank's handling of the issue, setting up a showdown with management at its annual general meeting on Thursday. 
Swedbank, whose shares closed down 11.9 percent, has lost more than a quarter of its stock market value since being linked with Danske Bank, whose Estonian branch was used for as much as 200 billion euros ($227 billion) of suspicious payments between 2007 and 2015.
Regulators in Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania began a joint investigation into Swedbank after SVT in February reported allegations that at least 40 billion Swedish crowns ($4.3 billion) in suspicious transactions took place between Swedbank and Danske Bank's Baltic accounts.
Sweden's EBM said the head office search was part of its inquiry into whether Swedbank breached insider trading regulations by informing major shareholders about SVT's initial report before the information was made public.
Swedbank's third largest shareholder Alecta welcomed the EBM's move, saying in a statement that ""facts are needed"". 
Bill Browder, an investor who campaigns to expose money laundering, has filed a separate criminal complaint with Swedish authorities and SVT previously reported that internal documents show Swedbank's board knew it had missed suspicious transactions but failed to take corrective action.

Swedbank has said it cannot comment on specific transactions or details about clients due to banking confidentiality laws.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks eased on Wednesday as Treasury bond yields fell again and a prolonged inversion in the yield curve fanned fears of a U.S. economic slowdown.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields slid, but came off 15-month lows reached overnight, as investors remained focused on central bank dovishness globally. 
The yield curve inverted for the first time since 2007 on Friday and, if the inversion persists, some experts say it could indicate a recession is likely in one to two years.
Bank and financial stocks fell, with the S&P 500 financial index ending down 0.4 percent.
""The inverted yield curve, that's what worries investors and it's why you're getting selling here.

Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm based in Toledo, Ohio. 
Worries about global growth have risen recently amid weak economic data, and the Federal Reserve last week abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year.
The European Central Bank became the latest central bank to delay a planned increase in rates amid rising threats to growth. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 32.14 points, or 0.13 percent, to 25,625.59, the S&P 500 lost 13.09 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,805.37 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 48.15 points, or 0.63 percent, to 7,643.38.
 Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN) rose 3.9 percent as the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder said it expected the housing market to improve, while shares of KB Home, which reported upbeat results late Tuesday, were up 2.7 percent. 
Also helping was a survey that showed mortgage applications in the week ended March 22 rose nearly 9 percent amid lower interest rates, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp's shares fell 5 percent after the health insurer said it would buy smaller rival WellCare Health Plans Inc for $15.27 billion. Shares of WellCare jumped 12.3 percent.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.39-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in at least one of the accidents, in Indonesia last October, would only do so once per event after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.
It will also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure key flight data offer widely different readings, Boeing said, confirming details reported by Reuters on Tuesday.

""We are going to do everything that we can do to ensure that accidents like these never happen again,"" Mike Sinnett, Vice President for Product Strategy and Future Airplane Development told reporters on Wednesday at a Boeing facility near Seattle.

301,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Fearful of fake news blitz, U.S. Census enlists help of tech giants","By Nick Brown
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Census Bureau has asked tech giants Google, Facebook and Twitter to help it fend off “fake news"" campaigns it fears could disrupt the upcoming 2020 count, according to Census officials and multiple sources briefed on the matter.
The push, the details of which have not been previously reported, follows warnings from data and cybersecurity experts dating back to 2016 that right-wing groups and foreign actors may borrow the “fake news” playbook from the last presidential election to dissuade immigrants from participating in the decennial count, the officials and sources told Reuters.
The sources, who asked not to be named, said evidence included increasing chatter on platforms like ""4chan"" by domestic and foreign networks keen to undermine the survey. The census, they said, is a powerful target because it shapes U.S. election districts and the allocation of more than $800 billion a year in federal spending. 
Ron Jarmin, the Deputy Director of the Census Bureau, confirmed the bureau was anticipating disinformation campaigns, and was enlisting the help of big tech companies to fend off the threat. 
""We expect that (the census) will be a target for those sorts of efforts in 2020,"" he said. 
Census Bureau officials have held multiple meetings with tech companies since 2017 to discuss ways they could help, including as recently as last week, Jarmin said. 
So far, the bureau has gotten initial commitments from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) to help quash disinformation campaigns online, according to documents summarizing some of those meetings reviewed by Reuters. 
But neither Census nor the companies have said how advanced any of the efforts are.
Facebook spokesman Andy Stone confirmed the meetings with Census, but did not provide details of any agreed action. Twitter and Google declined to comment.
The bureau has also embarked on an online landgrab to control census look-alike websites, according to Census officials. These sites could end up in the hands of people who want to dissuade some portions of the population from responding to the survey.
""We came up with a list of 20 to 30 URLs that we wanted to make sure we owned,"" said Census spokesman Stephen Buckner, adding the bureau had done the same before the 2010 count ""to mitigate confusion about where to go.""
Census controls at least two non-government websites with “census” in the name - 2020census.com and 2020census.org - through marketing firm Reingold, Buckner said.
The Census Bureau, until now, has kept mostly mum about how it plans to counter disinformation. The efforts highlight the challenges posed by the internet age to the decennial gathering of data on America’s population. 
So-called ""fake news"" strategies can take myriad forms, according to cyber experts: posing as a demographic group to convey false information under the guise of advocacy; spreading false data by doctoring ads and news stories; or circulating bogus information to drum up fear and opposition. 
Jarmin said activists could target the census ""mostly through attempts to get them to not participate, either by scaring them or telling them it’s not important, or that something they had already done - like paying their taxes - had completed the census."" 
HELP FROM SILICON VALLEY
Former Census Director John Thompson, who left the bureau in 2017, remembers his first briefing about the disinformation threat - shortly after the 2016 presidential election - and said it was the bureau’s catalyst to act. 
Thompson said he had invited data expert danah boyd to speak to top officials in 2016. boyd, who stylizes her name lowercase, said she was seeing chatter on the dark web in white supremacist and other communities about wanting to disrupt the count, according to Thompson and two other people in the room, who declined to be named. boyd declined to be interviewed about her presentation.
Thompson declined to provide details of threats outlined at the meeting, but called them ""chilling.""
One of the sources present said boyd discussed efforts by ""far-right actors and foreign governments"" to use disinformation campaigns to discourage minorities from participating.
A year later, the Census Bureau organized a forum in Silicon Valley, partly about the 2020 disinformation threat, which was attended by boyd, locally elected officials and representatives from tech companies including Twitter, Uber Technologies and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). 
During that gathering, Census officials also visited Facebook and Google campuses to meet with executives.
According to notes from the 2017 meetings reviewed by Reuters, Google told Census it would consider creating a bespoke census-related search project. Twitter also agreed to help mitigate misinformation, according to the notes.
At a meeting with Facebook, Census officials discussed allowing the company to join conversations between Census and the U.S. Department of Defense about security; creating Facebook groups on census topics; and training Census workers through Facebook technology, according to the notes.
Census has held subsequent meetings with these companies, including as recently as this month, according to Census officials.
It remains unclear how many of these ideas Census and tech companies have put into action. 
Census' Jarmin said: ""There were some hits from those meetings, and some things that didn’t pan out.""

Investing.com - Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares are looking more expensive by the day.
The shares for the king of coffee boutiques hit a 52-week high of $73.25 soon after Wednesday's open, but were promptly pulled lower by the overall market slump. Still, Wednesday was the fifth new high for Starbucks in the last six trading days.
The shares are up 13% on the year. And despite falling 12.4% during the November-December slump, the shares ended the fourth quarter up more than 13%. They’re up 54% from a 52-week low of $47.37 reached last June.
The question of priciness is raised because of all those new highs. One result is that Starbucks is trading at 28x trailing 12-month earnings. The Nasdaq's trailing P/E ratio is 23.5x earnings. The S&P 500 is trading at 21.5x earnings.
The stock's gains may not be justified. Same-store sales in the United States were up just 4% in 2018 and basically flat in China, where the company sees the bulk of future growth, the company's fourth-quarter earnings report said.
The company sees comparable sales growth of 4% for 2019, even with a deal to sell coffee products to Nestle.
The company had 29,865 outlets worldwide at the end of 2018 and expects to add 2,100 this year, with more than 600 each in the United States and China.
The guidance seems to assume the global economy continues to grow steadily and that the current trade dispute between the United States and China doesn't affect sales in China.
The consensus estimate on the stock, according to analysts polled by Investing.com, is $69.40, 4.6% below the current price of $72.73. It happens that Wedbush analyst Nick Setya did raise his estimate on the stock on Wednesday by $4 to $70, still below the current price. The value is baked into the price, he wrote, according to Barron's."

304,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 03:07PM ET</span>",Southwest trims first-quarter outlook after 737 MAX groundings,"By Rachit Vats and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co on Wednesday was the first major U.S. airline to formally cut its financial outlook for the year after being forced to pull its new fleet of 34 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes out of service.
The Dallas, Texas-based airline, which has struggled with maintenance problems and a harsh U.S. winter, estimates it will have canceled 9,400 flights between mid-February and March 31, reducing growth in its number of available seats to just 1 percent compared to a year ago. 
That compared with a forecast of around 3.5 percent to 4 percent in late January. The reduction also led it to cut growth in another closely-watched measure - revenue per available seat mile (RASM) - by a full percentage point. 
Overall it estimated it would lose $150 million in revenue in the quarter compared to previous expectations. 
""(We) experienced softness in passenger demand and bookings related to the government shutdown, resulting in an estimated $60 million negative revenue impact in first quarter 2019,"" Southwest said. 
""Trends have also been negatively impacted by more winter weather disruptions than expected, unscheduled maintenance disruptions, further softness in leisure-oriented passenger demand and yields, and the MAX groundings.""
Southwest also now estimates first-quarter unit costs to increase about 10 percent, compared with its previous forecast of about 6 percent because of flight cancellations. This figure excludes fuel costs and profit-sharing expenses.
U.S. airlines and manufacturers, along with Wall Street, have been slow to estimate losses from the fallout of the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, which killed 157 and led to the worldwide grounding of Boeing's new MAX jets. 
Southwest said of its expected cancellations, about 3,800 would be weather-related and about 2,800 due to unscheduled maintenance disruptions and the grounding of the 737 MAX 8.
Its larger rival, American Airlines, has so far said only that it was cancelling around 90 flights per day as a result of the grounding of its own 24 Boeing 737 MAX planes. No. 3 U.S. carrier United Airlines has 14 of the planes.
United Airlines and Air Canada had earlier warned of a hit to their business due to the groundings, with the Canadian carrier suspending its 2019 financial forecasts. 
""The impacts associated with the MAX are contained to Southwest, American, and United, though are most acute for Southwest per today's update,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani said.
Airlines shares, including those of Southwest, were up in late afternoon trading on optimism that the worst is over for the 737 MAX now that Boeing has put forward a plan for fixing the aircraft.
TOUGH APRIL FOR AIRLINES
Boeing is this week briefing airlines on software and training updates for the MAX, with more than 200 airline pilots, technical experts and regulators from around the world due to visit the Renton, Washington, facility where the 737 is assembled.
As well as approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, any MAX software fixes will need a green light from governments around the world, which could take months. 
While shares of the world's biggest plane manufacturer have fallen around 12 percent since the March 10 crash, Wall Street has been slow to predict major financial implications.
""(Our) base case is a multiple-month grounding punctuated by a manageable fix; meaning the stock can resume its move into the $400s with a path to more than $500,"" analysts from U.S. bank Citi said. 
Another analyst, Cai von Rumohr, said most of the immediate impact on airlines was likely to be in March and April given the leisure-oriented spring break travel period.
""We still see a tough Q1, marred by the government shutdown, weather, and MAX grounding; and Q2 will be affected through at least April, probably longer,"" he said.

Boeing shares were down about 1 percent at $367.82 on Wednesday.

San Francisco-based PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January in the aftermath of devastating wildfires that struck California in recent years, some linked or suspected to be linked to the company's equipment.
Judge Dennis Montali of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco approved the debtor-in-possession loan over objections of a committee representing victims of wildfires that wanted PG&E to fund a program for housing, food and other necessities for the victims before getting the financing approved.
PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 29 in anticipation of liabilities from the wildfires, including a catastrophic 2018 blaze, the Camp Fire. It killed 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.
The San Francisco-based owner of the biggest U.S. power utility warned in November it could face significant liability in excess of its insurance coverage if its equipment was found to have caused the Camp Fire that destroyed Paradise, California, last year.
PG&E has said it expects its equipment will be determined to have been an ignition source for the Camp Fire. 
The financing will comprise a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, a $1.5 billion term loan and a $500 million delayed-draw term loan.

Investment banks JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) will provide financing, the company said in a filing.

It’s almost certainly worse to be putting money on the line.
Just some things to consider: The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to as low as 2.35 percent, a level unseen since 2017, from 2.62 percent just a week ago. Yields on two-year notes, which drew strong demand at a $40 billion auction on Tuesday, reached 2.16 percent as more than one full rate cut from the Federal Reserve is priced in by the end of the year. Elsewhere, Germany sold 10-year bunds with a negative yield for the first time since 2016, while New Zealand 10-year yields tumbled by 11 basis points after its central bank said its next move is more likely to be a cut.
If you believe that the world economy is on the verge of a significant slowdown, then sure, the trading decision is easy: Load up on haven assets like Treasuries and bunds, even if yields are the lowest in years. There is certainly enough data to justify such concerns, from the big slump in Germany’s purchasing managers’ index last week to weakening confidence among U.S. consumers and chief executives. Broadly,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s global economic surprise index fell earlier this month to the lowest level since 2013, and it has barely rebounded.
Investors may also be reverting to their playbook of not fighting the central banks’ dovish turn. After all, the alternative is wading through a mess of headlines. Who wants to handicap the odds of various Brexit scenarios? Or grapple with Turkey engineering a currency crunch? Or wondering whether Stephen Moore, whom Donald Trump is expected to nominate for a Fed seat, is serious when he says the central bank should immediately lower interest rates by 50 basis points?
At the same time, it’s hard to shake the feeling that a lot of what’s happening is a rapid repricing that’s more technical in nature. Case in point: A Bloomberg News article titled “Here’s Why U.S. Bond Yields Plunged So Much Over the Past Week.” You won’t find the words “recession,” “slowdown” or “growth” anywhere. Instead, this is the key takeaway:
The Federal Reserve’s surprise policy shift last week shook markets, but, even still, the intensity of the ensuing drop in U.S. bond yields has puzzled many observers. A massive wave of hedging in the swaps market helps explain the scale of the eye-catching move.
Treasuries rallied after the Fed signaled it was done raising interest rates for the moment, driving yields on 10-year notes down to levels last seen in 2017. That forced two sets of traders -- those who had bought mortgage bonds and those who had bet markets would remain calm -- to turn to derivatives markets to tweak their portfolios or stanch their losses. They snapped up positions in interest-rate swaps, pushing Treasury yields down even more.
On top of it all, fund managers are fast approaching the end of the month and the quarter, which is usually a time for rebalancing portfolios. In Japan, March 31 is the end of the fiscal year, and Treasury holdings in the country have increased three consecutive months through January, the longest stretch since early 2017. Japanese investors historically tend to buy in March and then sell in April.
Put it all together, and it’s no surprise that traders are “feeling a bit run over,” in the words of Bloomberg News’s Cameron Crise. “Every time that I think that the U.S. bond market can’t rally much more, yields take another leg lower,” he wrote.
You have to be brave to trade “macro” right now, given just how abruptly global central banks have changed their tune. After all, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell went from saying that U.S. interest rates were a “long way” from neutral and that the balance sheet runoff was on “automatic pilot” to halting further rate increases and specifying the end of tapering in just a matter of months. It seems unlikely that he or his colleagues will flip back to hawkish. It’s easier to imagine them turning extra-dovish in the face of continued economic uncertainty. 
At the risk of getting trampled again, the most likely path forward is yields hovering around their current levels rather than dropping more. As mundane as it may seem, I buy the argument that “mortgage convexity receiving hedging” from money managers and real-estate investment trusts sparked a duration grab. And it seemed pretty clear just two weeks ago that traders were bracing for a range-bound bond market, so it follows that those who got caught selling volatility had to hedge by effectively going long Treasuries. Nothing gets a market moving quite like a short squeeze.
Technical analysis signals that 10-year Treasury yields are bumping up against key levels of 2.37 percent and 2.29 percent. Relative-strength indexes show the 10-year note is overbought. Intuitively, the current fair value of the global borrowing benchmark should be close to 2.5 percent, or the top of the fed funds target range, if Powell’s comments are to be believed that the next rate move could be up or down.
It’s one thing to argue that the bond rally is about done for now. Actually betting on that view, though? That’s an entirely different matter, especially considering that the S&P 500 Index isn’t too far off its record high. If stock investors decide the party’s really over this time, Treasuries will surely extend gains. Indeed, as equities slid on Wednesday, 10-year yields approached new lows, further inverting the yield curve.
After a boring, range-bound start to 2019, it’s no doubt painful to see the highest yield levels in years disappear in what feels like an instant. But as volatility returns, it could be even more perilous for investors to assume they know what will happen next in the world’s biggest bond market."

313,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 01:26PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Told U.S. security at risk, Chinese firm seeks to sell Grindr dating app","By Carl O'Donnell, Liana B. Baker and Echo Wang
(Reuters) - Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd is seeking to sell Grindr LLC, the popular gay dating app it has owned since 2016, after a U.S. government national security panel raised concerns about its ownership, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has informed Kunlun that its ownership of West Hollywood, California-based Grindr constitutes a national security risk, the two sources said. 
CFIUS' specific concerns and whether any attempt was made to mitigate them could not be learned. The United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the safety of personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel.
Kunlun had said last August it was preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) of Grindr. As a result of CFIUS' intervention, Kunlun has now shifted its focus to an auction process to sell Grindr outright, given that the IPO would have kept Grindr under Kunlun's control for a longer period of time, the sources said. 
Grindr has hired investment bank Cowen Inc to handle the sale process, and is soliciting acquisition interest from U.S. investment firms, as well as Grindr's competitors, according to the sources.
The development represents a rare, high-profile example of CFIUS undoing an acquisition that has already been completed. Kunlun took over Grindr through two separate deals between 2016 and 2018 without submitting the acquisition for CFIUS review, according to the sources, making it vulnerable to such an intervention.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. 
Kunlun representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Grindr and Cowen declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, said the panel does not comment publicly on individual cases. 
Grindr, which describes itself as the world's largest social networking app for gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people, had 27 million users as of 2017. The company collects personal information submitted by its users, including a person's location, messages, and in some cases even someone's HIV status, according to its privacy policy. 
CFIUS' intervention in the Grindr deal underscores its focus on the safety of personal data, after it blocked the acquisitions of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc and mobile marketing firm AppLovin by Chinese bidders in the last two years.
CFIUS does not always reveal the reasons it chooses to block a deal to the companies involved, as doing so could potentially reveal classified conclusions by U.S. agencies, said Jason Waite, a partner at law firm Alston & Bird LLP focusing on the regulatory aspects of international trade and investment.
""Personal data has emerged as a mainstream concern of CFIUS,"" Waite said. 
The unraveling of the Grindr deal also highlights the pitfalls facing Chinese acquirers of U.S. companies seeking to bypass the CFIUS review system, which is based mostly on voluntary deal submissions. 
Previous examples of the U.S. ordering the divestment of a company after the acquirer did not file for CFIUS review include China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation's acquisition of Seattle-based aircraft component maker Mamco in 1990, Ralls Corporation's divestment of four wind farms in Oregon in 2012, and Ironshore Inc's sale of Wright & Co, a provider of professional liability coverage to U.S. government employees such as law enforcement personnel and national security officials, to Starr Companies in 2016.
PRIVACY CONCERNS
Kunlun acquired a majority stake in Grindr in 2016 for $93 million. It bought out the remainder of the company in 2018.
Grindr's founder and chief executive officer, Joel Simkhai, stepped down in 2018 after Kunlun bought the remaining stake in the company.
Kunlun's control of Grindr has fueled concerns among privacy advocates in the United States. U.S. senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to Grindr last year demanding answers with regards to how the app would protect users' privacy under its Chinese owner.
Kunlun is one of China's largest mobile gaming companies. It was part of a buyout consortium that acquired Norwegian internet browser business Opera Ltd for $600 million in 2016. 

Founded in 2008 by Tsinghua University graduate Zhou Yahui, Kunlun also owns Qudian Inc, a Chinese consumer credit provider, and Xianlai Huyu, a Chinese mobile gaming company.

 Renault  (PA:RENA) reportedly is set to restart merger talks with Nissan within 12 months, the Financial Times reported. A Renault, Fiat and Nissan merger would create an auto giant that would seek to dethrone leaders Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) rose 2.6%.
It is not the first time that Renault has flirted with the idea of making a bid for Fiat Chrysler. Former Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn held talks with the Italian-American multinational before he was arrested in Japan on financial misconduct charges.
Fiat Chrysler Chairman John Elkann is reportedly open to a potential partnership or merger in a bid to inject some oomph into the company.
Renault, however, is not the only automaker interested in Fiat.
In an interview earlier this month, Robert Peugeot, president of Peugeot family holding company FFP, said that Fiat Chrysler could possibly be an M&A candidate for the French automaker.
Analysts have backed a potential deal, citing the attractive value of Fiat.
""We view the interest in FCAU as largely a reflection of its attractive valuation and think it has strong sales momentum relative to peers with the recent introduction of the Jeep Gladiator, Ram pickups and the Alfa Romeo Stelvio, and like its low China exposure (only 2% of revenue),"" said CFRA, an independent research provider."
316,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>","U.S. Supreme Court backs SEC, safeguards investor-protection laws","By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court safeguarded investor-protection laws on Wednesday in a ruling against a New York investment banker who the Securities and Exchange Commission banned from the industry.
The justices refused to further narrow the scope of who can be held liable for securities fraud, as they upheld on a 6-2 vote a lower court decision siding with the SEC. The agency took action against Francis Lorenzo after he sent emails seeking investors for a startup company's debt offering even though its energy-from-waste technology did not work. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had agreed with the SEC's findings that Lorenzo was liable in a scheme to defraud investors by sending the emails even though he did not personally write the fraudulent statements contained in the messages.
The Supreme Court in 2011 limited the scope of who can be held liable for false statements to those with ultimate authority over the statements. 
Writing on behalf of the court, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said perpetrators of securities fraud could escape liability if the law were interpreted too narrowly.
""Congress intended to root out all manner of fraud in the securities industry. And it gave to the commission the tools to accomplish that job,"" Breyer wrote.
Conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented. Fellow conservative Brett Kavanaugh did not participate because he was involved in the case in his prior role as an appeals court judge in Washington. The high court came to a different conclusion in the case than Kavanaugh did when he served on the lower court.
In his dissenting opinion, Thomas said the ruling ""misconstrues the securities laws and flouts our precedent in a way that is likely to have far-reaching consequences."" Thomas said under the ruling, for example, there would be nothing to stop an executive assistant from being hit with sanctions for merely transmitting a supervisor's email.
The appeals court had partly ruled in favor of Lorenzo, saying the SEC's lifetime ban decision was excessive. The SEC will now reassess what sanction to impose.
""We are disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision today. However we are hopeful that the SEC will acknowledge the arguments we made before the court, and that were accepted by the dissent, when reconsidering Lorenzo's sanctions,"" said Robert Heim, Lorenzo's lawyer.
The SEC declined to comment.
Anti-fraud provisions of U.S. securities laws prohibit false statements and other conduct categorized as acts, devices, practices or schemes. The case hinged on whether a person who did not personally make fraudulent statements but merely passed them along can be found liable for engaging in a fraudulent scheme. 
Lorenzo served as the investment banking director at a broker-dealer called Charles Vista. The SEC in 2015 found that Lorenzo made false statements and participated in a deceptive scheme by sending the emails. The commission fined him $15,000 and barred him from working in the industry for life. 

Lorenzo, who had the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group in the case, argued that the SEC is trying to paint people who might be liable at most for aiding and abetting fraudulent schemes as the primary violators of securities laws.

In a bid to rectify the wealth disparities of apartheid more than two decades after the end of white minority rule, South Africa has demanded that a proportion of a mining company's shares are owned by black investors.
Originally set at 26 percent, the black ownership level was raised to 30 percent in 2017, although companies that had already achieved 26 percent were not required to meet the higher target.
Mining companies have argued that, while they accept the need to raise black ownership to the required level, they should not be required to maintain that level should black investors sell any of their shares later.
The Minerals Council, which represents mining companies, said most aspects of the new charter unveiled in 2018 were ""reasonable and workable"" but said it should be changed to ensure it recognized past deals related to black empowerment.
It said this should be taken into account when a mining firm seeks to renew or transfer mining rights, deals that are now blocked if black investors do not hold an appropriate stake.
The Minerals Council said it had applied for a judicial review to set aside certain clauses in the charter, including those related to the Precious Metals Act and Diamonds Act.
Minerals Council CEO Roger Baxter (NYSE:BAX) said the existing provision in the charter would ""have a severely dampening effect on the attractiveness of mining in the eyes of investors.""
He also said it breached an order by the High Court in April, ruling that mining companies did not have to maintain at least 26 percent black ownership in perpetuity.
The new mining charter, which sets ownership and other industry targets, is part of efforts to provide regulatory and policy certainty and attract more investment.
The mines ministry said it would oppose the application for a judicial review and defended the new charter, calling it a workable framework to economically transformation the industry.
""Delaying the implementation of the charter will impact negatively on the positive climate characterizing mining and economic investment at present,"" the Department of Mineral Resources said in a statement.

321,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 12:27PM ET</span>",Co-op Bank report urges independent capital checks on banks,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks' capital levels should be externally checked to avoid the risk that lenders which run into trouble come close to collapse, an independent report into the near demise of Co-op Bank in 2013 said on Thursday.
The report from Mark Zelmer, a former Bank of Canada official, was commissioned by the Bank of England's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority to see what lessons regulators could learn from Co-op Bank, whose bondholders had to plug a 1.5 billion pound hole in its capital.
""The PRA should consider introducing more formal third-party reviews of key prudential information supplied by banking groups through their regulatory data returns,"" Zelmer said.
This issue was also raised more recently when Metro Bank disclosed in January an accounting error in its capital calculations, forcing it to plan a 350 million pound cash call to bolster its capital reserves.
The Bank of England asked an accounting body in 2014 to look at how bank capital ratios could be audited, but a resulting discussion paper was not taken further.
A separate report in 2014 concluded the root of Co-op Bank's problems lay in its 2009 takeover of the Britannia Building Society and poor management controls. 
Zelmer has recommended improving how regulators consider a banking merger and to continually adapt stress tests.
There was a risk that if Britain experiences a lengthy benign economic environment, prudential oversight at the BoE could ""fade into the background"" in an institution heavily focused on the economy, Zelmer said.
""The PRA and BoE may wish to consider how they can best guard against this risk in the future,"" Zelmer said.
Sam Woods, BoE Deputy Governor and CEO of the PRA, in response, said lessons from Co-op Bank would strengthen the PRA's approach to prudential supervision.
RESOLUTION DOUBTS
Zelmer's report also questioned the effectiveness of rules introduced globally since the financial crisis a decade ago to tackle failing banks and avoid taxpayer bailouts.
He said there was a question of whether the new rules aimed at making it easier to ""resolve"" or close mainly large, failing banks would be sufficient in times of stress.
""Indeed, I think the likelihood of such systemic situations involving smaller institutions may in fact be greater in the future.""
The rules aim to avoid a repeat of taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis and force banks to issue debt that can absorb losses.
The PRA said its work continued on identifying further ways in which to maintain the effectiveness of resolution tools.
Zelmer said that between 2008 and 2013 the then Financial Services Authority was ""busy fighting many fires on a number of fronts"" during and after the global financial crisis.
The FSA approved the merger of Co-Op bank and Britannia, knowing there was a risk that more capital would be needed, Zelmer said.
""I believe the FSA acted reasonably in not intervening to halt the bid,"" Zelmer said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren took aim on Wednesday at agricultural conglomerates, promising her administration would break up big agribusiness mergers that she said have hurt family farmers.
Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and a fierce Wall Street critic, released a broad plan that she said would make it easier for small farmers to survive in the face of growing corporate consolidation in the rural economy.
She singled out several big agriculture corporations, naming Tyson Food Inc, Bayer-Monsanto and Dow-DuPont, and said the Bayer-Monsanto merger should not have been approved. Under her plan, regulators would review ""anti-competitive"" agricultural mergers and break up integrated businesses that control many different levels of the farming chain and markets.
""We can make better policy choices  —  and we can begin by leveling the playing field for America's family farmers,"" Warren wrote in a Medium blog post outlining her proposal.
Warren released the plan ahead of a campaign trip to Iowa, a farm state that kicks off the Democratic presidential nominating contest in February 2020. During her visit, she will participate in a Democratic policy forum on rural issues as the party searches for ways to reverse Republican President Donald Trump's crushing win over Democrat Hillary Clinton in rural areas in 2016.
Earlier this month, Warren also proposed breaking up big tech companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) to promote competition in the technology sector. She has made her populist economic message the heart of her campaign in a growing Democratic field of contenders, arguing the economy is rigged for corporations and the wealthy.
""Bad decisions in Washington have consistently favored the interests of multinational corporations and big business lobbyists over the interests of family farmers,"" Warren said in her agricultural proposal.
""Mergers mean that farmers have fewer and fewer choices for buying and selling, while vertical integration has meant that big agribusinesses face less competition throughout the chain and thus capture more and more of the profits,"" she said.
Warren's plan also would end ""contract farming"" by conglomerates, create a national right-to-repair law that allows farmers to repair their own equipment or take it to a mechanic of their choice instead of an authorized agent, and establish country-of-origin rules to require beef and pork producers to label where their livestock was raised and slaughtered.

Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Chile offer favorable conditions for private investors, Chief Executive David MacLennan said in an interview late on Tuesday, though he declined to provide details of possible purchases by the company in coming years.
U.S.-based Cargill recently bought Colombian poultry processors Pollos El Bucanero and Campollo and expects to invest between $200 and $300 million in the Andean country in the next two years, MacLennan said, mostly to improve efficiency and expand the capacity of two processing plants.
""We don't have exact figures at this time, but I will say that if we have $200 or $300 million in Colombia, in this whole area in five years we could easily reach $1 billion,"" MacLennan said during a visit to Bogota.
Colombia's political stability and geographic position are attractive for investors, said MacLennan, who met with President Ivan Duque on Tuesday.
Despite a deep economic and political crisis in Venezuela, Cargill will continue to produce flour, pasta and cooking oil there, MacLennan said. 
The company employs some 1,600 people in the deeply polarized country, where hunger, shortages of medical supplies and blackouts have spooked many international investors.

""We will not surrender, it's a very important country for us,"" said MacLennan. ""We are very worried for our employees and their security. I think of them every day and hope for a better future.""

325,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 11:46AM ET</span>",U.S. Health insurer Centene to buy smaller rival WellCare for $15.3 billion,"By Michael Erman and Tamara Mathias
(Reuters) - U.S. health insurer  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp on Wednesday said it would buy smaller rival WellCare Health Plans Inc for $15.27 billion in stock and cash, in a move to bulk up its government-backed Medicare and Medicaid businesses while reducing exposure to Obamacare healthcare exchanges.
Shares of WellCare jumped 9.8 percent to $253.98. Centene shares fell about 7.5 percent to 50.71.
The announcement comes days after the Trump administration stepped up its opposition to former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday said it believes the Affordable Care Act (ACA), popularly known as Obamacare, violated the U.S. Constitution and that the law should be struck down.
Centene relies on its Obamacare business for about 40 percent of its earnings, making it among the most vulnerable companies should the law be overturned, according to SVB Leerink analyst Ana Gupte.
The combined company will have 22 million members, up from around 14 million for Centene at the end of 2018.
""The more we can grow in this area, the better the recipients are, the better for the investors ... And there are other very large competitors out there,"" Centene Chief Executive Michael Neidorff said on a conference call. Neidorff will remain CEO of the combined company.
It will have a Medicaid business in 22 states, covering more than 11 million lives, according to Jefferies data. That represents a more than 50 percent increase for Centene. 
Since the beginning of 2014, when Obamacare's Medicaid expansion began taking effect on a significant scale, shares of both companies have surged. Centene's shares are up around 272 percent, while WellCare shares rose around 228 percent.
The two companies Medicaid businesses currently have significant overlap in Illinois, Florida, Georgia and Missouri, according to Jefferies.
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2020, the companies said. They forecast around $500 million in cost savings from the deal in the second year after it closes. 
The deal, including debt, was valued at $17.3 billion. The offer price of $305.39 per share represents a premium of about 32 percent to WellCare's closing price on Tuesday.
Under its terms, WellCare shareholders will get 3.38 shares of Centene common stock and $120 for each WellCare share, giving them about 29 percent ownership of the new company.
Centene's planned acquisition of WellCare continues a wave of consolidation in U.S. healthcare, coming after two large health insurers combined with the two largest U.S. pharmacy benefit managers in deals that closed last year.

In those deals, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) bought  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET) for $69 billion, while  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) acquired Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) Holding Co for $54 billion.

327,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 10:37AM ET</span>","Ford to leave Russian car market, cede control in joint venture","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's Russian joint venture Ford Sollers will close two assembly plants and an engine factory in Russia, exiting the country's passenger vehicle market, resulting in charges of about $450 million to $500 million. 
The move is part of a restructuring that will see Russia's Sollers assume control of the venture, which is currently led by the U.S. automaker, the companies said in a statement on Wednesday. 
Industry sources told Reuters this month that Ford was considering closing Russian plants as it was reviewing operations in unprofitable regions.
The No. 2 U.S. carmaker said the closures would lead to ""significant"" job losses, along with the closure of assembly plants in Naberezhnye Chelny and St. Petersburg, and an engine plant in Elabuga. The restructuring follows similar actions in South America and Europe as Ford works to return to profitability in money-losing markets.
Ford also has been negotiating to expand a commercial vehicle and pickup truck alliance with Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, with investors focused on potential partnerships around the development of electric and self-driving vehicles. Those talks also include working together regionally, including possible plant consolidation. A Ford spokeswoman said the talks are continuing.
A restructured Ford Sollers will focus on commercial vehicles, while passenger vehicle production will cease by the end of June, the companies said.
""The new Ford Sollers structure supports Ford's global redesign strategy to expand our leadership in commercial vehicles and to grow the business in Europe in those market segments that offer better returns on invested capital,"" Steven Armstrong, president of Ford of Europe, said in the statement.
Ford was the first international carmaker to launch vehicle assembly in Russia, opening a plant in St Petersburg in 2002. In 2011, it set up a joint venture with Sollers in which Ford and Sollers each hold a 50 percent stake, but Ford has controlled the business since buying up preferred shares. Under the new structure, Sollers will take a 51 percent controlling interest.
Sales of new cars in Russia are expected to rise 3.6 percent this year, marking a slowdown from last year, according to an estimate from the Association of European Businesses lobby group.
""The Russian passenger vehicle market has been under significant pressure in recent years, with recovery slower than expected and a shift to lower priced passenger vehicle segments,"" Ford said, adding that resulted in underused plants.

Ford said it expects pretax special item charges of $450 million to $500 million, most of which will be recorded this year and are part of the previously announced $11 billion charge that Ford said it would take to globally restructure its business.

329,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 10:33AM ET</span>",Renault reportedly plans to restart Nissan merger talks in bid to buy out Fiat-Chrysler,"One of the world's largest car making alliances may be on a path to become even larger. 
French automaker Renault is planning to restart merger talks with Japanese carmaker Nissan in the next 12 months, according to the Financial Times, citing people familiar with the matter. The merged company may then buy another auto firm, the FT said, with Fiat-Chrysler ""among the preferred targets."" 
Renault and Nissan have had a strategic partnership, which later included Mitsubishi, since 1999. 
Fiat-Chrysler has a market capitalization of about €21 billion ($24 billion). Combined, Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, have a value of more than €50 billion, the FT said.
Fiat-Chrysler shares jumped more than 3.5% on the news. Renault was up 2.9% in French trading. 
A Renault-Nissan merger was partly the brainchild of former executive at the automakers, Carlos Ghosn. The 64 year-old was recently released on bail from Japanese jail having been arrested in  November for allegedly misreporting his salary and compensation, charges which he denies. 
FCA has previously floated the idea of potentially merging or partnering up with another carmaker, but a deal with Renault and Nissan may not work out if their deal takes a long time to complete, according to sources familiar with the matter, cited by the FT.
The car making alliance is also planning to shelve €10 billion cost cutting plans by 2022 and cut targets to expand vehicle sales to 14 million, people with knowledge of those plans told the FT. 
Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi is a major carmaking powerhouse with the alliance selling more than 10.6 million cars in 2017, which would be the most of any single automaker.
Representatives for Renault and Nissan declined to comment to the Financial Times. "
330,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 10:32AM ET</span>",The Apple Card is Apple's biggest announcement of 2019 so far,"Forget Apple's new TV service coming this fall. The biggest announcement Apple made this week, full stop, is Apple Card, which is an extension of the Apple Pay service that's been around for almost 5 years now.
On September 9, 2014, at the same event where Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the iPhone 6, Apple introduced a new service called Apple Pay.
Apple Pay was created because plastic credit cards felt “outdated and vulnerable,” according to Apple. Credit cards could be stolen, and a card’s important numbers and security codes were exposed by default.
Apple Pay offered a more elegant, secure way to pay for goods. A couple of button presses could summon your favorite payment method (credit card, debit card, gift card, you name it) on your iPhone or Apple Watch, which you’d then touch to a merchant’s NFC panel to pay. That’s it — all of the identifying information on your card is kept private and secure, from merchants but also from Apple.
On Monday, Apple took its vision of Apple Pay one step further: by partnering with a pair of financial institutions (MasterCard and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)) to offer its own credit card, which is unlike any other credit card out there.
The Apple Card brings Apple’s trademark simplicity to the credit card system. Not only did it redesign the card itself, Apple also reimagined what it looks like to pay for goods, get rewards for those goods, and pay off the card itself.
Here are the tenets of the Apple Card, and why it is Apple's biggest announcement of 2019 so far:"
331,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>",Europe's share listings plumb 10-year low as companies seek alternatives,"By Clara Denina 
LONDON (Reuters) - European initial public offerings slumped to their lowest since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis in the first quarter of 2019, as uncertainty over Brexit and the U.S.- China trade dispute leaves companies not wanting to take their chances.
Proceeds from European listings dipped to $292 million in the first three months of 2019, compared to $13.9 billion made in the same period a year ago, Refinitiv data shows.
Those without the appetite to go public with their shares are instead looking to private stake sales and cash injections, previously favored among tech start-ups.
In London, Europe's biggest stock market, just two companies have listed on the LSE's main market so far this year - law firm DWF Group, which raised 75 million pounds ($100 million) and software company Dev Clever , raising just 678,000 pounds. In total, 11 companies went public in Europe.
Meanwhile, private equity  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) is in talks to buy a 30 percent stake in Spain's Cepsa for up to $3.4 billion, just months after its Abu Dhabi owner Mubadala shelved a listing of the energy company, sources have told Reuters. 
The lack of companies joining the stock market to raise capital is in stark contrast to just a few months earlier, when, with much fanfare carmaker Aston Martin made its debut.
""Given the Brexit-related uncertainty in the market is still ongoing, we have a couple of IPOs for which we have done most of the work that have now been pushed to the end of the year,"" one banking source said, expecting a pick-up later in 2019. 
Bankers say some companies are put off because they cannot achieve top valuations that were available up to a year ago.
Firms such as Aston Martin and financial technology firm Funding Circle, which also listed in London late last year, have performed poorly and are still trading down sharply from their debut prices.
The collapse in listings bodes ill for the prospects of the financial institutions that profit from them. 
Just $3.64 million has been collected by banks in fees from European IPOs so far this year, down from $114.31 million in the same period of 2018, according to Refinitiv data. 
The drought has pushed ECM bankers to find alternative ways to bring in fees.
Some said they are spending more time working on private placements of shares or scouting out companies in distressed situations that need fresh capital. 
Online wealth manager Nutmeg raised $58.2 million from investors in January, including  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) while mobile-only bank Monzo raised 20 million pounds from its existing customers in December after an 85 million pounds funding.
""Having the public investor community willing to offer good valuations and enable companies to raise primary capital without the burden of going public is becoming more common,"" said Daniel Simons, ECM partner at law firm Hogan Lovells. 
DELAYED DECISIONS
Firms still intent on going public are watching and waiting.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) on March 13 halted preparations for the IPO of its trucks unit Traton until market conditions improve.
Activity is expected to slowly improve throughout the year and is likely to be led by the buoyant payments sector. 
Italy's Nexi is expected to list next month in one of the biggest flotations of the year, while Dubai-based payment firm Network International is set to be the first international company to list in London this year.
Elsewhere, South Africa's media and internet giant Naspers is planning a bumper listing in Amsterdam with the spin-off of its international e-commerce ventures including its one third stake in China's Tencent.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) made a net profit of 276 million yuan in the fourth-quarter as it recovered from costly U.S. sanctions which dragged it to an overall 2018 loss of 7.0 billion yuan ($1 billion).
The world's fourth-largest telecommunications equipment maker by market share was forced to stop most business between April and July last year due to U.S. sanctions. It paid $1.4 billion to lift these and reported its worst half-year loss of 7.8 billion yuan in August. 
ZTE's 2018 loss announced on Wednesday was just within its earlier guidance range of 6.2 billion yuan to 7.2 billion yuan, but was deeper than the average estimate of a loss of 6.2 billion yuan by 10 analysts, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
The company had expected a first-quarter net profit of 800 million to 1.2 billion yuan, against a net loss of 5.4 billion yuan year earlier. It reported a profit of 4.57 billion yuan in 2017 before it became embroiled in a crippling row with the U.S. government over violations of export restrictions.
ZTE said its revenue for the quarter ending in December was 26.7 billion yuan, while its full-year revenue dropped 21.4 percent to 85.5 billion yuan, against an average estimate of 87 billion yuan by 12 analysts.

333,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 10:05AM ET</span>",Nissan committee says facts point to legal violations by former chairman Ghosn,"By Naomi Tajitsu
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - An external committee reviewing governance at Nissan Motor Co said on Wednesday there were enough facts to suspect violations of laws and the private use of company funds by ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn.
Following a three-month audit of Nissan's governance after a scandal that shook the global auto industry, the committee put the blame squarely on what it called Ghosn's concentration of power. It also acknowledged Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa's role in Ghosn's salary arrangement at the heart of the scandal.
Twenty years to the day since French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) agreed to rescue Nissan, the committee described a corporate culture at Nissan ""in which no one can make any objections to Mr. Ghosn"", who was ""in a way deified within Nissan as a savior who had redeemed Nissan from collapse.""
The group issued 38 recommendations to bolster Nissan's governance, including that top executive positions at the Japanese carmaker should not be held by people serving in executive positions at Renault or junior partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
It also proposed that the majority of directors, including the chairman of the board, be independent, outside directors and that the role of company chairman be abolished. 
The recommendations from the external, seven-member committee come weeks after Nissan and Renault said they would retool their alliance, one of the world's biggest automakers, to break up the all-powerful chairmanship previously held by Ghosn.
""There are facts sufficient to suspect violations of laws and regulations, violation of internal rules and private use of company funds and expenses... by Mr. Ghosn,"" the committee said in its report.
It also singled out Nissan director Greg Kelly, who too has been indicted, for his alleged role in helping Ghosn avoid oversight, and said that Saikawa had signed documents regarding compensation Ghosn would receive after retirement.
""It is clear that there are issues requiring improvement with respect to Nissan's governance as it could not prevent the misconduct.""
Ghosn, who this month was released on $9 million bail after spending more than 100 days in a Tokyo detention center, has called the charges against him ""meritless"". Kelly has also denied the charges.
""We expect Nissan will take these recommendations seriously and execute them in a swift manner to build the best possible governance structure,"" committee co-chair Seiichiro Nishioka told a briefing in Yokohama.
At the briefing, the committee declined to comment on whether other individual directors - including Saikawa - should be held for responsible for failing to prevent the alleged actions by Ghosn. 
MERGER TALKS?
Nishioka also told the briefing that the capital structure between Nissan and Renault was a matter for the companies, and it was not appropriate for the committee to get involved.
The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Renault intends to restart merger talks with Nissan within 12 months, after which it will set sight on a bid to buy Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.
The plans signal a return to the strategies supported by Ghosn, who held talks about merging Renault with Fiat Chrysler two to three years ago, the Financial Times, which cited sources familiar with the matter, adding the French government had opposed the move.
Nissan has said that too much power had been concentrated on Ghosn, one of the most feted executives in the global auto industry who orchestrated Nissan's financial recovery in the early 2000s and created the blueprint for the automaking alliance between Nissan and Renault.
At the time of his arrest in Tokyo in November on financial misconduct allegations, Ghosn held the chairmanship at Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp, which together form one of the world's biggest automakers selling roughly 10 million vehicles each year, while also serving as Renault CEO.
Nissan's board currently comprises nine directors including the chairman, three of whom are categorized as outside, independent directors. Two directors, including one outside director, formerly served senior vice president roles at Renault.
In a statement, Nissan said that its board of directors would review the committee's proposals ""with the greatest attention as soon as possible"". It has said it will put forward proposals to change the company's governance at its general shareholders meeting in June.

Before that, it will hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting next month to vote on the ouster of Ghosn and Kelly, who has been charged alongside Ghosn for understating Ghosn's salary, as company directors.

334,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 09:56AM ET</span>","Autonomy founder Lynch was scapegoat for HP's incompetence, court told","By Georgina Prodhan and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard botched its $11.1 billion acquisition of Autonomy and then tried to cover up its own mismanagement by accusing the British software company's founder Mike Lynch of fraud, a London court was told on Wednesday.
HP is suing Lynch, once hailed as Britain's answer to Bill Gates, along with his former finance chief Sushovan Hussain for more than $5 billion after the 2011 Autonomy deal went disastrously wrong for the Silicon Valley group.
Lynch denies any wrongdoing and says HP's mismanagement was responsible for the failure of the acquisition. Hussain also denies any wrongdoing.
HP wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8 billion, saying it had uncovered serious accounting improprieties. HP is suing Lynch and Hussain for $5 billion of that amount making the case Britain's biggest-ever fraud trial.
HP's lawyers told the court when the case opened this week that Autonomy had inflated its true value through a series of fraudulent transactions, such as selling hardware at a loss and so-called round-trip deals - a type of barter with no real commercial rationale - masterminded by Lynch.
In his opening argument for Lynch's defense, Robert Miles QC said HP had only discovered a small number of historical deals which were said to have some or other wrongful feature, despite spending several years and huge sums of money on its search.
""All the deals now attacked were real commercial deals with real counterparties. The suggestion that Dr Lynch was in the business of conning HP is unreal,"" he told London's High Court.
""HP, on the other hand, was a vast but floundering company."" 
Lynch also faces criminal fraud charges in the United States, which carry a maximum term of 20 years. Hussain has been convicted of fraud in a U.S. case related to the deal.
STRATEGY REVERSAL
A year after acquiring Autonomy, HP threw out Chief Executive Leo Apotheker, the architect of the deal which was supposed to transform the computer and printer maker, one of Silicon Valley's original companies, into a more profitable group centered on business software and services.
Apotheker was replaced by Meg Whitman, who planned to refocus the company on its core hardware strengths after an outcry from shareholders over the new strategy and a steep decline in HP's share price.
""Autonomy was left as HP's unwanted stepchild,"" said Miles.
Both Apotheker and Whitman are expected to appear as witnesses in the London trial.
As the case opened on Monday, HP's lawyer Laurence Rabinowitz QC said the U.S. company had been led to believe it was buying a fast-growing, pure software company.
He told the court that Lynch and Hussain had knowingly been involved in ""widespread and systematic false accounting"" to create a materially false picture of Autonomy's finances.
Autonomy had engaged in ""revenue-pumping"" by encouraging customers to buy its products in exchange for buying goods from them that it did not need, restructuring deals to produce upfront license fees, and covertly selling pure hardware not even programmed with its software at a loss, Rabinowitz said.
Lynch's lawyer told the court that it was absurd to think the 53-year-old was making detailed, day-to-day accounting decisions. Rather he relied on a finance department overseen by an audit committee and the company's auditors, Miles said.
Miles also said it was impossible to understand why Lynch would have taken an executive position at HP after the deal if he really had committed a huge fraud with the U.S. company as its victim.
""The case that we're now hearing being advanced entails that Dr Lynch must have been monumentally dim and, as you'll see, there's no chance that he is,"" Miles said.
Lynch attended the court session but is not expected to be questioned until around July.
Miles also told the court that the $5 billion figure for which Lynch and Hussain are being sued was not based on HP's own commissioned audits, which had not found a basis for writing down Autonomy in the months after the acquisition.
Hewlett Packard Company in 2015 split into two separate publicly traded companies - HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ). and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. 
The case is expected to last until the end of the year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's corporate bank has a revenue problem.
As its consumer bank begins to see signs of recovery from a sales practices scandal that erupted more than two years ago, the San Francisco-based lender has struggled to expand its customer base in the unit catering to businesses and institutional clients. Revenue in the corporate bank dropped 4 percent last year.
Before the scandal, it was rising 6 percent a year on average. Because it offers better margins, the health of the corporate bank is critical to Wells Fargo; it represents about a third of revenue but roughly half of $22 billion in annual profit.
The bank first told investors in September that while it retained most customers throughout its scandals, it was having a harder time recruiting new clients. 
This trend has been even more dramatic with the corporate bank where customers tend to stay put. “It’s been a little bit more challenging for us to bring in new customers,"" corporate bank head Perry Pelos told Reuters in a recent interview.
Corporate clients are harder to win in part because commercial banking relations are more complex. Business customers seek cash management services, assistance with importing and exporting transactions, and various forms of credit such as asset-backed loans or revolving lines of credit. These services are usually locked in with multi-year contracts; some clients can only switch providers every five years.
Wells Fargo executives say they are playing the long game, having their teams reach out to prospective clients to build relationships that they hope will pay off down the road.
""I've lived through an entire generation of ownership before we won the business,"" said Greg O'Brien, the division manager for commercial banking in New England.
REPUTATIONAL PROBLEMS
Last year, executives and analysts identified signs of life in Wells Fargo's consumer unit for the first time since the 2016 scandal that rocked the bank. Primary checking accounts grew 1.2 percent in 2018, and auto loan originations jumped 9 percent in the most recent quarter.
The corporate bank, however, continues to languish. When business clients consider switching banks, Wells Fargo's lingering reputational problems make it a harder sell, analysts say. Consumers don't have to justify their decision to open a new credit card to anyone but themselves, said Autonomos analyst Brian Foran. Decision-makers at companies, such as the treasurer, have to answer to the board and other executives.
""At the margin some of them are going to say, Wells Fargo is very good but so is JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),"" he said. ""Right now, no one gets fired for hiring JPMorgan.""
Wells Fargo officials acknowledge the scandals remain a concern with certain customers. ""I've certainly been in meetings where it comes up,"" said O'Brien. 
The scandal began with the disclosure the lender had opened unauthorized accounts for consumers. Later Wells Fargo disclosed that corporate bank employees had improperly altered customer information on certain documents. Wells Fargo has racked up billions in fines. Last year the Federal Reserve imposed a punitive asset cap on the bank, preventing it from growing its balance sheet until it improves risk management. 
Pelos, the corporate bank chief, has tried to compensate for the declining revenue by slashing costs. But the 3 percent reductions last year weren't enough to offset the revenue slide. Though 2018 profit increased, the unit became less efficient. A key metric that measures the cost of one dollar of revenue, increased to 56 percent from 55 percent a year earlier. 
Wells Fargo has not provided 2019 revenue projections for its corporate bank. ""There's a lot of confidence that they are going to hit their expense targets, but there's much less confidence that revenue is going to be able to grow as they do that,"" Foran, the Autonomous analyst, said.
Revenue declines are bad for any company, but for Wells Fargo it raises questions about whether the kind of growth it reported before its scandals is achievable with tighter oversight, analysts said. In the past, the corporate bank focused on growing its cross-selling metric, which measured how many products employees hawked to clients, according to filings. 
The bank still tracks referrals across different parts of the business today, but the company no longer reports them publicly. 
O'Brien, the northeast middle bank head, said the cross-selling system, which led to the creation of the fake accounts in the consumer bank, didn't cause similar problems in the corporate bank.
""We have never been in the business of creating false needs to sell,"" he said.
Corporate bank revenue has also been hurt by the Fed asset cap. The unit no longer carries deposits for central banks, and it has sold off some smaller businesses. In January, Wells Fargo pushed back the timeline for when it expects to get the asset cap lifted by six months.
Executives told Reuters they are being ""pleasantly persistent"" with prospective corporate clients by pitching them ideas and connecting them with existing clients. So far their efforts have failed to bear much fruit, but executives say they have seen signs that customer acquisition trends are beginning to shift.
As evidence that business was looking up, Wells Fargo pointed to recent transactions it helped advise like Berry Global's $4.39 billion takeover bid for RPC Group Plc, .
Earlier this month, Wells Fargo also advised its first ever USD global benchmark for the World Bank. 
""My expectation is that it's going to be better,"" Pelos said. ""Is it going to be back to where it was before? It's hard to call.""

337,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 09:15AM ET</span>",Swedbank head office searched as money laundering allegations grow,"By Esha Vaish, Simon Johnson and Johan Ahlander
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish authorities searched the head office of Swedbank on Wednesday as part of an investigation into the bank's handling of money laundering allegations at its Baltic branches. 
Adding to pressure on the lender, state broadcaster SVT said separately that Swedbank may have misled U.S. investigators over transactions by its customers linked to Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm at the center of a global tax avoidance and money laundering scandal.
The money laundering allegations have sparked fears that Swedbank, the largest lender in the Baltic region, will be swept up in a scandal that has already pummeled rival Danske Bank, with the threat of lawsuits, fines and other legal sanctions.
Swedbank said in an emailed response to Reuters following the broadcast that it ""cooperates fully and communicates clearly, correctly and with the best intentions with all relevant authorities"".
The Swedish lender has lost more than a fifth of its value since being linked with Danske Bank, whose Estonian branch was used for as much as 200 billion euros ($227 billion) of suspicious payments between 2007 and 2015.
Regulators in Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania began a joint investigation into Swedbank after SVT in February reported allegations that at least 40 billion Swedish crowns ($4.3 billion) in suspicious transactions took place between Swedbank and Danske Bank's Baltic accounts over the same period.
HQ SEARCHED
Sweden's Economic Crime Authority (EBM) said its search of Swedbank's head office was part of its independent probe into whether the bank breached insider trading regulations by informing major shareholders about SVT's initial report before the information was made public.
""At this point of time, no individual or legal entity has been served (with a notice of a) suspicion of (having committed) a crime,"" Swedbank said in a statement following the search. 
The bank's third largest shareholder Alecta welcomed the EBM's investigation. 
""In everything related to the money laundering issue at Swedbank, facts are needed on the table and as much transparency as possible,"" Alecta, said in an emailed comment. ""It is good that EBM is now doing everything they can to contribute to clarity in this matter.""
Swedbank's shares extended the session's losses to trade down 6.9 percent on the day by 1248 GMT.
The lender is defending itself on many fronts: Bill Browder, an investor who campaigns to expose money laundering, has filed a separate criminal complaint with Swedish authorities and SVT previously reported that internal documents show Swedbank's board knew it had missed suspicious transactions but failed to take corrective action.
Swedbank has in each instance said it cannot comment on specific transactions or details about clients due to banking confidentiality laws.
CEO Birgitte Bonnesen, who oversaw the bank's anti-money laundering policy between 2009 and 2011 before heading its Baltic operations until 2014, has repeatedly said she has confidence in the lender's anti-money laundering procedures and that the bank reported suspicious transactions to authorities. 
But in recent days investors have criticized Swedbank's handling of the issue, setting up for a showdown with management at the company's annual general meeting on Thursday.
PANAMA LINK
SVT said on Wednesday it had obtained confidential documents showing that Swedbank told the New York State Department of Financial Services it only had customers from Sweden and Norway, with ties to Mossack Fonseca.
That was despite the fact that a number of companies with ties to the law firm had done business through Swedbank in the Baltics, SVT said.
Neither the U.S. Embassy in Sweden, which in February asked the country's financial watchdog for a meeting to discuss the allegations about Swedbank, nor Sweden's financial watchdog had any immediate comment.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declined to comment, while the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the New York State Department of Financial Services were not immediately reachable for comment outside of regular U.S. business hours.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Swiss financial watchdog said on Wednesday the firm behind a $90 million initial coin offering (ICO) took money illegally from investors, highlighting a readiness by regulators to apply traditional market rules to cryptocurrency-related fundraising. 
Swiss firm Envion AG, which is now in liquidation, accepted more than 90 million Swiss francs ($91 million) from at least 37,000 investors in exchange for bond-like tokens issued without a license, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) said in a statement.
FINMA said the conditions under which the tokens were issued were not equal for all investors; that the prospectuses did not meet minimum requirements; and that Envion did not have an internal audit arm - a legal requirement. 
Envion's former chief executive Matthias Woestmann said in a statement that a FINMA report, which has not been made public, said investigators could not find any misappropriation of funds, and that it was evident there had been no intention to damage investors.
""There was no misappropriation of assets,"" he said.
Policymakers around the world have wrestled with how to craft legal frameworks for ICOs and so-called security token offerings (STOs) - where tokens with features akin to traditional securities are sold. 
The new forms of fundraising have allowed start-ups founded on cryptocurrency technologies such as blockchain to quickly raise capital by issuing virtual tokens or coins. But the risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies have made regulators wary. 
Some states, like Switzerland, have moved to treat ICOs as securities, applying rules used for traditional capital markets. That means a step up in regulation for many projects, subjecting them to trading laws and detailed disclosure requirements, and offering protection to investors.
Other countries, like China and India, have banned ICOs altogether. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last year deemed that some ICOs could count as securities.
Switzerland has become a global leader in ICOs and STOs. Six of the biggest 15 ICOs and STOs since 2016 have taken place in the country, according to PwC. 
Last year, the worldwide number of successful ICOs and STOs more than doubled to over 1,130 from a year earlier, PwC said. 
As FINMA investigated Envion, a court in the Zug canton - known as ""Crypto Valley"" for its concentration of virtual coin-related firms, opened bankruptcy proceedings against the firm over ""organizational shortcomings"". 
As a result, FINMA said, further measures against the firm were not necessary.

340,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>","Lennar, KB Home Earnings Boosted by Falling Mortgage Rates","(Bloomberg) -- Falling mortgage rates are giving a lift to U.S. homebuilders just in time for the key spring selling season.
 Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN). reported that orders jumped 24 percent to 10,463 in the quarter ended Feb. 28. The company said order growth exceeded the high end of its guidance by 5 percent. But deliveries fell short because of weather issues ""across the country."" KB Home (NYSE:KBH), which reported earnings after the market closed yesterday, had a slight drop in orders, which were still better than expected. Company executives said they plan to open 35 new communities in the second quarter.
Mortgage applications for home purchases jumped 4 percent from a year earlier, a sign that the spring season is off to a good start, according to data released today by the Mortgage Bankers Association.
“We continue to see choppiness,"" Lennar Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said in the earnings release. ""However, during the quarter, mortgage interest rates subsided and ultimately pulled back and home prices moderated, providing a catalyst for the new home market to correct itself.""
U.S. homebuilders have struggled since mortgage rates jumped last year, adding to an affordability crunch. Rates have since fallen, giving housing a boost. Both companies also cited slowing home price growth and a strong jobs market. KB Home also said it plans to offer more affordable options with smaller floor plans in some areas.
“Home prices have moderated recently and interest rates have come back down, improving affordability,” KB Home Chief Executive Officer Jeff Mezger said on a conference call after the first-quarter earnings report. “Last week’s announcement from the Federal Reserve signaling the likelihood of no further rate increases this year should also help to sustain the favorable macro environment.”"
341,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",The Car Giants Are Getting Pretty Desperate,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In view of the bad feeling unleashed by Japan’s detention of Carlos Ghosn in November, one might have expected  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) to keep things quiet for a while. Ghosn was head of the giant Renault-Nissan carmaking alliance and one theory for his downfall was that he was pushing too hard for a full combination of the French and Japanese companies.
But now, according to the Financial Times, Renault SA hopes to restart those merger talks with Nissan Motor Co within 12 months and then launch a bid for another big carmaker, possibly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. This is surprising, to put it mildly. Seeking fresh discussions about a tie-up risks opening barely healed wounds in Tokyo.
That Renault would even consider such a move suggests relations with Nissan have improved since Ghosn was ousted. But even more than that, it underscores the desperation of carmakers as they try to respond to the industry’s epochal challenge: The hugely expensive shift to electric and automated vehicles.
The history of automotive M&A hasn’t been a happy one; Daimler’s takeover of Chrysler is but one of many failed marriages. So it’s remarkable how lively the carmaker courtship rumor mill has been lately.  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) has reportedly approached Fiat; Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. are trying to deepen a nascent partnership; and fierce rivals  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG are teaming up in autonomous driving and car sharing. Elsewhere, Jaguar Land Rover’s heavy losses might put it in play, Daimler may sell a stake in its loss-making Smart unit and the FT says Ghosn courted Fiat when he was still Renault boss.
One word explains all this frantic positioning: Scale. The more electric cars a manufacturer can produce, the less burdensome the investments in new technology and plants. The same goes for software, which will become even more pivotal (and costly) once cars drive themselves.
It’s in the interest of both Nissan and Renault, then, to maintain their 20-year old cost-sharing alliance. Unpicking it would be hugely expensive, especially now that key markets like China and the U.S. are slowing down.
But a full-blown merger is something else entirely. Surely they have enough problems to manage without attempting that. The immediate priority is embedding a new governance system at Nissan and the alliance, to replace the dominance of Ghosn. His departure helps, but the French and Japanese sides still have a long way to go to restore trust.
In fairness, the alliance now has a new boss, the understated Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, who brings a more placatory approach. Nissan may be open to renegotiating the alliance’s capital structure if Senard proves reliable, the FT reported, citing people close to the Japanese group.
But this is almost certain to be a fraught endeavor, regardless of the personalities at the top. Unpicking a clearly unbalanced cross-shareholding structure (Renault holds 43 per cent of Nissan, whereas the more profitable Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault) is a delicate enough task in view of the French state’s stake in Renault. Trying to then agree merger terms that both parties consider fair would be harder still. If you take away its holding in Nissan, the stock market ascribes little value to Renault’s own carmaking operations.
Meanwhile, these deliberations would be taking place at the same time as Ghosn’s trial, which will no doubt be a huge distraction for both companies in the coming months.
And what of Fiat? Its U.S. trucks and SUV profits are attractive, but does the Renault-Nissan alliance (which includes Mitsubishi Motors Corp.) really need to get any bigger? It already sells more than 10 million cars a year. That’s on a par with industry giants Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp.
If you think the politics of Nissan and Renault are thorny, just try to add Fiat Chrysler’s Italian and American mix. Another French carmaker, the less geographically diverse Peugeot, is more in need of an international dance partner like Fiat. France also owns a stake in Peugeot.
There’s also the problem of job cuts at a time of rising populism. It only makes sense for automakers to consolidate if they’re willing to close excess capacity and share resources. Merge or not, the car industry will probably shed thousands of jobs over the next decade: Building an electric car is about 30 percent less labor intensive than a combustion engine model.
As such, you can see why companies will consider even the most impossible-looking deals. That doesn’t mean they can be done.

343,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Cathay Pacific halts union ban on pilot training,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd on Wednesday said it would no longer allow its unionized pilots to refuse training roles despite a near four-year union ban in a move that a pilot said could raise workplace tensions.
Relations between Cathay and its 3,000-plus pilots have become strained as the airline seeks to cut costs as part of a three-year transformation plan designed to make it more competitive against Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals and low-cost carriers.
The union ban on pilot training has made it more difficult for the airline to promote pilots quickly when it has been expanding capacity and also when a global pilot shortage prompted some expat pilots to take other jobs.
A Cathay spokesman said the ban had been in place since 2015.
""The selection and appointment of training captains will be solely at the company's discretion,"" the Cathay spokesman said of the new policy on Wednesday. ""This means, suitable pilots no longer have the right to refuse a training appointment.""
A Cathay pilot, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters these roles attracted extra pay and some captains had quit the union to take them up during the ban. But the pilot also said the company's action was not likely to be received well by the workforce. 
The Cathay spokesman said the airline's trainers had faced undeserved criticism during the ban for supporting the company's training programs which enable more junior pilots to progress. 
The Hong Kong Aircrew Officer Association (HKAOA) said on Wednesday evening that it could not comment immediately.
In January, the HKAOA members overhwelmingly voted down a contract proposal which offered at least a 1 percent pay rise and some housing guarantees even though it had been recommended by the union's leadership.

The announcement to pilots on the ban was made shortly after Cathay agreed to buy low-cost carrier Hong Kong Express Airways Ltd from cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate HNA Group for HK$4.93 billion ($628 million), giving it a foothold in the fast-growing budget travel market.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 07:35AM ET</span>","EU states back easier sale of bank bad loans, no deal on foreclosures","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU ambassadors backed on Wednesday new rules to facilitate banks' sales of bad loans on their books but failed to agree on a reform that would make it easier for lenders to recover assets from borrowers who default.
The proposed rules are part of a wider overhaul of EU banking rules and aim to accelerate banks' efforts to offload soured loans, which have reduced European banks' ability to lend to households and companies since the 2007-09 global financial crisis.
The agreement reached on Wednesday is expected to favor the purchase and servicing of so-called non-performing loans (NPLs) ""which will lead to the development of efficient secondary markets,"" said Romania's Finance Minister Eugen Teodorovici, who chaired the negotiations among the 28 EU countries.
Under the overhaul, which still needs to be finalised in agreement with the European Parliament, financial companies specialized in buying bad loans, such as private equity giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and asset manager Cerberus, are set to gain easier access to NPLs across EU states.
The new rules are expected to lower regulatory barriers to making cross-border purchases.
This should further stimulate a secondary market for bad loans, possibly driving prices up and making banks more willing to sell.
The low prices of bad loans have long discouraged banks from offloading them. Although the mass of NPLs has been steadily decreasing in recent years, there is still a backlog of more than 700 billion euros ($789 billion) hanging over EU banks' balance sheets, especially at lenders in Italy, Greece, Ireland and Cyprus.
In a less positive development for banks, EU states were not able to reach a deal on proposals put forward by the EU Commission on facilitating lenders' recovery of assets from borrowers who default.
The proposal introduced a mechanism to facilitate out-of-court procedures on foreclosures, to speed up banks' recovery of the collateral used by borrowers to obtain loans - when borrowers are too late on their repayment schedule.
This mechanism, envisaged only for business loans and not consumer loans, would increase the value of NPLs and reduce bank losses, but would increase the burden on firms.

EU states failed to agree on this part of the reform, an EU statement said. Talks will continue in coming weeks among EU countries and with EU lawmakers on this matter. The reform needs to be agreed before EU elections in May.

(Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday, handing back early gains as bond yields continued to flag recessionary fears and investors awaited indicative votes on a series of alternate Brexit options in parliament. 
German 10-year yields, already below zero percent since last Friday, fell further in negative territory, while the U.S. bond yield curve remained inverted - a key signal of recession - dampened appetite for risk.
The pan-region STOXX 600 index fell 0.4 percent as indexes slipped across the region, led by bourses in Paris and London. 
The moves were reminiscent of late last week, when investors ditched equities to run to the safety of bonds after weak European and U.S. data on Friday stoked global growth fears. 
Investors remain anxious with a part of the U.S. yield curve inverted, Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, wrote in a note. 
Acknowledging the growth worries, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Wednesday the European Central Bank could further delay a planned increase in interest rates if it needs to, and may look at measures to mitigate the effects of negative interest rates. 
Draghi's comments had propped up banking stocks in the region but a more than 7 percent fall in Swedbank limited gains. The Swedish Economic Crime Authority said it was searching the bank's head office as part of a probe into whether insider trading regulations were breached. 
Defensives such as utilities, real estate and healthcare stocks slipped the most on the STOXX. 
Merck KGaA was down 0.7 percent after the German pharma group launched a hostile $5.9 billion all-cash takeover offer for Versum Materials to boost its presence in the semiconductor materials market. 
The auto sector was the only major bright spot on the STOXX after five-straight sessions of losses, with Fiat Chrysler leading gains after a Financial Times report indicated that French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) was considering a bid for the company.
Daimler AG's rose 1 percent after it said it was nearing the sale of a 50 percent stake in its small-car brand Smart to China's Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd.
London's FTSE 100 fell 0.5 percent ahead of a closely watched vote by British lawmakers at 1900 GMT on a range of options on how to overcome the political impasse over Brexit.
""The Brexit vote taking place today is not legally binding so its just a political measure of fleshing out or mapping out of what British lawmakers or MPs would like to see in their version of the deal,"" said David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to indicate a date for quitting as the price for getting her twice-defeated Brexit deal ratified. 

As the United Kingdom's three-year Brexit crisis spins towards its finale, it is still uncertain how, when or even if it will leave the European Union.

The bold remarks on Wednesday by Dong Mingzhu, chairwoman of Gree Electric Appliances, came at a time when Chinese leaders have pledged to step up support for small and private firms vital for economic growth and job creation.
""People abroad don't completely understand China's economic structure. Once they talk about state firms, they think they are government-owned... and private firms are bullied. This is their misunderstanding,"" Dong said at the Boao Forum, which China is trying to promote as Asia's answer to Davos.
She said private companies had enjoyed a competitive advantage over state firms in the course of China's economic development, saying many resorted to ""unscrupulous tactics"" such as bribing government officials.
""There are indeed many private firms that have problems in collusion between businesses and government,"" she said.
Beijing's anti-graft drive has netted mostly government officials, not private businessmen, she said.  
""We may complain that it's difficult to run a state firm given their constraints... but private firms have better conditions. How dare state firms use cash to bribe? They dare not,"" she added.
Late last year, President Xi Jinping threw his backing behind private firms after an unprecedented convergence of economic stresses weighed on China's once vibrant private sector, as the world's second-largest economy slows amid a trade war with the United States.
But Xi also reiterated his defense of the state sector, saying reforms and tighter supervision of state firms will help protect state assets that belong to all Chinese people.
For much of the past three decades, private firms have flourished as China opened up its economy. Then in the last global financial crisis, SOEs staged a comeback thanks to Beijing's massive stimulus - a shift popularly known as ""the state sector advances, the private sector retreats"".
Gree Electric Appliances makes air conditioners, electric fans and other household appliances and its main local competitors include Midea Group and Qingdao Haier. It currently has a market capitalization of 274 billion yuan ($40.76 billion) and its largest shareholder is state-owned Gree Group with an 18 percent shareholding. 
Gree Group is the largest and most powerful state-owned enterprise in Zhuhai, in the southern province of Guangdong.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's nickel-related industries such as the production of stainless steel and battery materials are set to surpass the value of its second-biggest export earner, palm oil, in the next 10 to 15 years, its investment board chief said on Wednesday. 
Southeast Asia's biggest economy suffered a drop in foreign direct investment last year, but one area that attracted more overseas money was nickel processing, including a $4 billion Chinese-led project to produce battery-grade nickel chemicals to power electric vehicles (EVs). 
Indonesia is also set to overtake Japan and India to become the world's second-biggest producer of stainless steel behind China, when it reaches an industry ministry target of producing 4 million tonnes a year from its main production site at Morowali, on the island of Sulawesi. 
""Our palm oil industry is worth about $18 to $20 billion in exports. I could see nickel and its derivatives, stainless steel, carbon steel, lithium-ion battery cells, surpassing that in the next 10 to 15 years,"" Thomas Lembong, chief of the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board, said in an interview. 
Indonesia's large nickel laterite ore reserves - prized for nickel pig iron used in stainless steel production - are also a vital ingredient for lithium-ion batteries used to power EVs. 
Developers led by Chinese companies - including stainless steel-maker Tsingshan Holding Group, battery firm GEM Co Ltd and units of lithium battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) - started building a lithium battery project in Morowali in January. 
""Tsingshan is in the lead, but there are at least two other Chinese conglomerates who are catching up to them,"" said Lembong, who predicted three to four major manufacturers would eventually emerge in the battery sector.
The industrial park in Morowali and another $10 billion park being built on the island of Halmahera are part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, but Lembong noted that Tsingshan was also bringing in Japanese investors to take a 40 percent stake. 
""To me that's a great example of where Belt and Road is going. More open, more inclusive, professionalised,"" he said. 
Indonesia has a history of simmering resentment towards China and a minority ethnic Chinese community so investment from its giant neighbor can be sensitive. 
Reports have circulated on social media suggesting the Chinese-led project had brought in a huge influx of Chinese workers, although authorities say only around 3,000 workers are foreign out of nearly 30,000 in Morowali.

Indonesia, the second-largest car production hub in Southeast Asia after Thailand, has also been looking to position itself as a global hub for producing and exporting EVs to Asia and beyond. 
Indonesia has announced plans to introduce a fiscal scheme that will offer tax cuts to EV battery producers and automakers, as well as preferential tariff agreements with other countries that have a high EV demand. 
Industry Minister Airlangga Hartarto said on Feb. 13 that Indonesia aimed for 20 percent of vehicle production to be EVs by 2025, representing about 400,000 vehicles. 
The deputy minister for industry, Harjanto, also said last December that Hyundai Motor Co, the world's fifth-largest automaker, plans to start producing EVs in Indonesia as part of an $880 million auto investment. 
Lembong declined to name potential EV investors, saying that ""it's quite a leap"" from producing batteries to building EVs, at least until domestic usage grows. 

""If you don't have a large user base of EV, then why bother producing here. But electric cars are not going to take off for as long as diesel and gasoline are subsidized,"" he said.

Parmalat's main shareholder Sofil is seeking to take the Parma-based group private after raising its stake to 95.8 percent and buying out minority shareholders.
The move is opposed by Citibank, which is seeking 345 million euros ($389 million) from Parmalat as compensation in a lawsuit and could receive the sum in the form of shares.
The U.S. bank turned to the administrative court earlier this month asking for a suspension of decision by market regulator Consob and the Milan bourse, which had given a green light to the delisting.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong has issued online-only banking licenses to three groups, including joint ventures (JVs) of  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and BOC Hong Kong, in what could be the biggest shake up in years in the city's retail banking sector dominated by old-guard lenders.
Besides StanChart and BOC Hong Kong joint ventures, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also issued the so-called virtual banking license to a venture led by online insurer ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance.
The new license will give its holders access to a lucrative retail banking market in the Asian financial hub, one where many consumers are unhappy with the current options.
According to research from Accenture (NYSE:ACN), 43 percent of people living in Hong Kong have a positive experience when visiting their bank branch versus a global average of 57 percent.
""It is a major milestone in reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a premier international financial center,"" Norman Chan, chief executive of the HKMA, Hong Kong's de-facto central bank and banking regulator, said in a statement on Wednesday.
""I believe that virtual banks will not only help drive FinTech and innovation, but also bring about brand new customer experiences and further promote financial inclusion in Hong Kong,"" he said.
However, the entrenched position in Hong Kong of established banks, such as HSBC, StanChart and a slew of Chinese banks, is expected to be a major challenge for the holders of the online-only banking license, whose road to profitability could be long.
StanChart will own 65.1 percent in SC Digital Solutions Ltd JV, while the rest will be owned by Ctrip Financial as well as Hong Kong-based telecoms groups PCCW Ltd and HKT Trust and HKT Ltd, the HKMA said.
BOC Hong Kong, a unit of Bank of China, will own 44 percent in the Livi VB Ltd JV, while JD Digits will hold 36 percent and Jardines will have 20 percent stake, it said.
ZhongAn will have 51 percent ownership in the ZhongAn Virtual Finance joint venture, and the remaining will be owned by Sinolink Group.
StanChart, which makes bulk of its revenue in Asia, said in a statement the new online-only banking entity in Hong Kong would enable customers to open accounts and apply for financial services ""on-the-go"" in real time.
Under a new growth strategy, the Asia, Africa and Middle East-focused bank has chalked out plans to invest more in digital technology to accelerate its retail banking growth in key markets.
StanChart CEO Bill Winters said on Tuesday that the London-headquartered bank aimed to launch its Hong Kong virtual bank later this year, as part of its digital initiatives in other markets including Africa and India.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's financial watchdog will get more money, staff and powers under a deal agreed by lawmakers on Wednesday aimed at strengthening efforts to tackle finance crime in the wake of a money laundering scandal at the country's biggest bank. 
However, Danish business minister Rasmus Jarlov said it could take ""a good while"" before the financial prosecutor is ready to open a potential court case against Danske Bank.
Denmark's reputation as one of the least corrupt countries in the world has taken a big hit from Danske's admission that 200 billion euros ($226 billion) of suspicious transactions flowed through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
The bank is under investigation in the United States, Denmark, Estonia, France and Britain.
Under a deal agreed by a broad majority of parties in the Danish parliament, the country's financial supervisory authority (FSA) will get 48 million Danish crowns ($7.25 million) extra funding each year, Jarlov told reporters in Copenhagen.
That will allow the watchdog to double the number of people working to fight money laundering to 24, he added. 
The FSA will also get the right to fine banks that violate money laundering laws, and large Danish banks will get a comprehensive money laundering inspection from the FSA during 2019, Jarlov said.
""We need a stronger and more aggressive financial regulator,"" the minister said. 
""Procedures around the Danske Bank case have not been satisfactory.""
Since the scandal surfaced last year, the bank has replaced its CEO and chairman, pulled out of Russia and the Baltics, boosted its compliance efforts and promised to donate 1.5 billion Danish crowns ($230 million) to fight financial fraud.

355,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",Hot Emerging Markets May Be in for a Shock,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve’s pivot to easier monetary policy has had a positive impact on emerging markets. Both the MSCI EM Index of equities and the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Emerging Markets Local Currency Government Debt Index are poised for their best quarters since the start of 2017. Also, several key currencies have risen against the dollar.
Recent bond market developments in the U.S. and Europe, however, suggest that policy easing is no longer an unalloyed positive. Negative-yielding debt globally has just risen to $10 trillion, suggesting economic weakness. Lower interest rates in developed countries are likely to have different impacts on emerging markets in the short run relative to the fallout that may come in 2020 and 2021.
While lower rates for borrowers in hard currencies would reduce debt service expenses and alleviate pressure on their balance of payments, the economic slowdown that lower rates and yields portend would ultimately be negative. Emerging markets feasting on cheaper credit in the short-term may be in for a rude shock as importing nations cut purchases in response to their economic weakness.
To perform well over the short- and medium-term, investors should divide emerging-market investments into two components. The first would consist of countries such as Turkey dependent principally on speculative capital inflows that policy easing in the U.S. and Europe may benefit. This would be the “high-risk” portion of the portfolio.
The second component would include countries such as Brazil dependent on direct investment flows to finance the bulk of their development needs. Foreign direct investment flows tend to be “sticky” and provide more stability to the economies of recipient countries, reducing downside risk to foreign portfolio investors. This component would be a “low-risk” manner of investing.
Turkey has historically run large current-account deficits that have increased over time. The shortfalls have been financed largely by short-term capital inflows that could easily reverse direction and leave the country. That is what happened Friday when the lira fell by 5.8 percent after news that official international reserves had fallen following authorities’ failed attempt to support the currency.
Turkey’s prospects of attracting capital during coming months, however, should improve as foreign investors reach for higher yields. Turkish bonds yield about 5 percentage points more than U.S. Treasuries, significantly more than the 3.73 percentage-point spread of the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Global Emerging Market debt index.
Looking beyond the immediate future, Turkey’s external accounts suffer from a serious problem. Imports of goods and services significantly exceed exports, and foreign direct investment flows constitute a smaller and smaller portion of the funding. For investors, this structural weakness means that the lira will experience bouts of volatility as capital flows change direction. It also implies that government policies are not conducive to attract long-term investors.
At the other end of the emerging-market risk spectrum, Brazilian sovereign debt yields only 3.46 percentage points more than Treasuries, seeming to diminish its attractiveness to yield seekers in a dovish central bank environment.
On the other hand, Brazil’s fundamentals are on a sounder footing. Its external balance has steadily improved since 2015, and it has almost eliminated the deficit. Foreign direct investment flows have been more than enough to finance the deficit, contributing to an increase in international reserves held by the central bank. That should provide greater currency stability and reassure investors.
The widely held view that lower global interest rates are positive for emerging markets applies only in the short term. Beyond that, the impact of easier monetary conditions will be offset by a slower global economy. Countries making themselves attractive to long-term investors are likely to offer higher, as well as more stable, returns.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global equity markets were flat on Wednesday, hoping central bank action in the world's biggest economies could temper some of the slowdown in world growth, even though bond yields continued to flag recessionary fears.
European shares which broke four straight days of losses on Tuesday, held steady though bank shares got a one percent lift from comments by European Central Bank governor Mario Draghi who signaled more assistance for banks via a cheap loans program.
German 10-year yields, already below zero percent since Friday, fell further in negative territory, while the U.S. bond yield curve remained inverted - three-month bills are yielding more than 10-year bonds - the key signal of recession dampened appetite for risk.
The U.S. yield curve inversion, which has preceded every U.S. recession for the last 50 years, triggered a sharp stock selloff last week. The drop in yields picked up pace after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled a halt to its rate increases.
Markets got a reminder of global growth risks after Chinese data showed industrial profits shrank the most since late-2011 in the first two months of the year. That came after lackluster economic data on Tuesday from Germany and the United States.
However, MSCI's all-country world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down around 0.1 percent while Chinese mainland shares bounced almost one percent as expectations deepened of more central bank stimulus.
""Our view is that reflation story remains on track. We do expect the (Chinese) government to come to the rescue and provide some respite,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, portfolio manager at Legal and General Investment Management. 
""It feels to me that markets had priced in a lower-for-longer (interest rate) environment even before central banks. They had come a long way very quickly and now they are taking a bit of a breather. Global growth overall looks reasonably healthy, despite the slowdown,"" he added.
Most market players agree recession fears were real but saw no clear sign of a huge slowdown, especially with interest rate rises receding. Draghi too said the euro area's economic soft patch did not necessarily foreshadow a serious slump and the bank could further delay rate hikes if necessary.
""Most economic forecasts, including our own, are such that the second half of the year should see a cyclical pickup in activity - but the market is pricing something different,"" said Peter Schaffrik, head of European rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan nudged up 0.1 percent while Wall Street was set for a firmer open, futures signaled 
BRUISED KIWI
New Zealand's central bank joined its peers in the United States and Europe by turning dovish - it flagged a possible interest rates cut, sending the kiwi dollar 1.6 percent lower to its lowest in 2-1/2 weeks. 
The move also weighed on the Australian dollar.
""The market was taken by surprise by the dovish tone,"" Thu Lan Nguyen, an analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. ""Most central banks have turned dovish. Even those that hiked interest rates did it with a very cautious outlook on rates.""
The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was up 0.1 percent at 96.745, building on modest gains overnight.
Questions over Brexit also limited moves for sterling, with investors awaiting fresh signs of Britain's plan to leave the European Union. 
Prime Minister Theresa May will address Conservative Party lawmakers, possibly to indicate a timetable for her departure, as she tries to win support for her twice-rejected Brexit deal as parliament prepares to vote on a variety of possible options. 
Oil prices were mixed, with Brent futures up 0.2 percent extending the previous session's rise, but gains were kept in check amid growing fears over the impact of a global economic slowdown on demand.
In emerging markets, there were renewed concerns over Turkey and Argentina where currencies have fallen sharply in recent days. The lira liquidity squeeze has sent overnight swap rates on lira to almost 500 percent.

The country rolled out a generous 5-year subsidy program for the NEV sector in 2016 to support sales and encourage innovation. But it has been slowly rolling back the program and plans to phase out subsidies after 2020 amid criticism that some firms have become overly reliant on the funds.
The Chinese finance ministry late on Tuesday said in a document on its website that it would cut the subsidy for battery electric cars with a range of 400 kilometers and above to 25,000 yuan ($3,720.07) per vehicle from 50,000 yuan in the next three months. 
It also raised the standards for vehicles eligible for subsidies, saying that electric cars need to have a range of at least 250 kilometers, compared with 150 kilometers previously, according to the statement. 
The ministry also said local governments should improve policies and stop offering some subsidies, but to support infrastructure construction such as that of electricity charging machines.
Shares in NEV makers such as BYD, BAIC BluePark, and battery suppliers like Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd fell between 1 percent and 2.5 percent on Wednesday even as the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges gained. 
China's NEV market has continued to grow significantly even as overall auto sales declined last year for the first time since the 1990s.

Investing.com -- Mario Draghi made his reputation by promising “to do whatever it takes” to save the euro. It says a lot for the faulty design of the euro zone that his language has barely changed even though he’s now well into the last year of his mandate.
In a keynote speech on Wednesday, Draghi wrapped up by saying “the ECB will adopt all the monetary policy actions that are necessary and proportionate to achieve its objective.”
If you look closely enough, the only material difference is that the question is no longer the immediate existential one of the euro’s survival, but rather the ECB’s inability to meet its mandated task of keeping prices stable (inflation has undershot the medium-term target consistently over the last decade). What has not changed is the need to beg the markets for trust.
The appeal is starting to wear thin. When the ECB announced its latest attempts to prop up the economy with cheap long-term loans, markets slumped. This morning euro zone stock markets have turned lower, once again focusing on the implications of Draghi’s gloomy assessment of the economy rather than his promise to fix it.
“We are now seeing a more persistent deterioration of external demand,” Draghi said, and markets listened. They appeared not to bother with the next sentence: “But a “soft patch"" does not necessarily foreshadow a serious slump.”
By 05:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.12 points, less than 0.1%, while Germany’s Dax was down 0.1%, the French CAC 40 down 0.2% and the Spanish IBEX 35 down 0.1%.
It’s not hard to see why: housing and consumer confidence data out of the U.S. on Tuesday were miserable. China reported overnight that profits at its largest industrial companies fell 14% on the year in the first two months of 2019. Italian business and consumer confidence surveys, released this morning, have both fallen in March, and by more than expected.
Away from monetary policy, the biggest noise in the market this morning is from the auto sector, where  Renault  (PA:RENA) is up more than 3% after a Financial Times report saying that it wants to acquire Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) once it has completed a relaunched merger with Nissan (OTC:NSANY) that was put on ice by CEO Carlos Ghosn’s tax troubles.
The more important element of the story is arguably not so much Renault’s desire, but the tantalising suggestion that Fiat could be the subject of a takeover battle, given that  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) has also reportedly approached it. Merger optimism needs to be weighed against the likelihood of any Italian government approving such a deal, however."

Investors have brought multiple cases against Volkswagen and Porsche SE in the southern city of Stuttgart, arguing that the companies should have issued adhoc-statements earlier to inform the market about U.S. authorities starting to investigate the emissions cheating. 
Stuttgart's court of appeal said these cases could not be bundled in a group action against the companies as a similar lawsuit was already pending in the city of Braunschweig and according to German law, there could only be one such case at a time. 

Group actions aim at facilitating legal actions brought by investors against companies as they bundle a large number of individual cases, allowing investors to team up and save litigation costs.

The plans signal a return to the strategies supported by former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn who held talks about merging Renault with Fiat Chrysler two to three years ago, the report, which cited sources familiar with the matter, said, adding the French government had opposed the move.
Late last year, Ghosn was ousted as Nissan chair and arrested in Tokyo on financial misconduct charges of under-reporting his salary. Ghosn has said the charges were ""meritless"".
The recent formation of a new alliance board led by Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard has led to an increase in confidence that the two parties can now push ahead with the merger plans, according to the FT report.
Fiat Chrysler is also seeking a partnership or merger and the company is holding talks with rivals for a deal, the report said.
Nissan and Renault are also expected to revamp their boards, with Renault reducing its board's size and Nissan adding majority outside directors, the report added.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Korean Air Lines Co Ltd shareholders removed chief executive Cho Yang-ho from its board in a landmark vote on Wednesday, making him the first founding family member of any South Korean corporate giant to be forced off a board.
The vote, which ended his 27-year tenure on the board of the country's biggest carrier, adds fresh momentum to growing shareholder activism in Asia's fourth-biggest economy, long dominated by corporate giants accused of ignoring minority investors.
The surprise win for minority shareholders also comes after U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management failed last week to convince investors to support its demand for a massive special dividend and board seats at Hyundai Motor Group.
""Today's result is a wake up call that Korean Air family's scandals starting from 'nut rage' have not been forgotten,"" said Park Ju-gun, head of corporate analysis firm CEO Score.
""Although Cho doesn't seem to lose a lot of his power without a board membership, it hits his image, and his family will behave much more carefully now that he realizes there are people checking on him and his management.""
Korean Air has been plagued in recent years by a series of scandals involving its founding family members, which culminated in the indictment of the 70-year-old Cho last year over charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. Cho has denied the charges against him.
The troubles began after Cho's eldest daughter, Heather Cho, made headlines in 2014 when she lost her temper over the way she was served nuts in first class and ordered the Korean Air plane to return to its gate at a New York airport.
The incident, dubbed 'nut rage', severely tarnished the carrier's image and it was parodied on international TV and online for months. 
In April 2018, Cho's youngest daughter Emily Cho faced a storm of public criticism for allegedly throwing a drink at a business meeting attendee.
Both resigned from their senior positions at the airline in the wake of the scandals.
""The company's reputation hit rock bottom and the business performance has suffered,"" Chae Yi-bai, a shareholder activist-turned-lawmaker, said at the shareholders' meeting on Wednesday, criticizing the Cho family for ""the czar-like management style.""
A total of 64.1 percent of shareholders present at the meeting voted for the airline's proposal, narrowly falling short of the two-thirds required for approving a three-year extension for Cho on the board.
The ball on Cho's board removal was set rolling on Tuesday when South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS), the airline's second-biggest shareholder, said it will vote against the re-election of Cho.
Influential proxy adviser ISS had also recommended investors vote against the reappointment, citing ""sufficient evidence of egregious governance concerns and material failure of fiduciary duty.""
CEO Cho did not attend the shareholders' meeting as he is overseas, a Korean Air spokeswoman said.
CHANGE ""NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE"" 
South Korea has been trying to make its corporate giants - long dominated by powerful elites and run by family members - more accountable following a series of bribery and other scandals.
But some observers doubted much will change in the country's corporate governance record or at the airline.
Although his board membership is terminated, Cho can continue to keep his titles of chairman and CEO of Korean Air, company officials said. ""The vote will not deprive him of management rights,"" Korean Air said in a statement. 
Cho's only son Cho Won-tae, widely seen as the third generation successor of the conglomerate, is currently a board member of the company and the president of Korean Air. 
""It is pretty obvious that junior Cho's vote will reflect his father's say, ultimately giving father Cho a free pass to continue to participate in issues,"" Park Chang-jin, a Korean Air flight attendant who revealed the 'nut rage' incident in 2014, told Reuters after attending the shareholder meeting. 
Park was among a dozen protesters who gathered in front of the Korean Air headquarters building in Seoul, demanding Cho's removal from the board ahead of the meeting.
""It is nearly impossible to change South Korea's corporate culture when it comes to family members of chaebols,"" he said.
Korean Air shares rose as much as 5.6 percent after the vote but pared gains to close 2.5 percent higher, as investors lowered their expectations for a change for the foreseeable future, analysts said. Hanjin Kal Corp, the parent of Korean Air, ended up 0.4 percent after rising as much as 9.4 percent.
One of the country's main business lobby groups, where Cho serves as a vice chairman, expressed regret over the vote's results.

""The NPS made its decision based on social controversies,"" the Federation of Korean Industries said in a statement, adding that courts had yet to rule on Cho's case.

Germany is trying to boost electric car sales in response to a diesel emissions cheating scandal that has engulfed the auto industry in the last three years. 
Scholz told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily that German carmakers had invested billions of euros in electric mobility.
""We must accompany that with an expansion of the charging infrastructure and with tax measures,"" he told the newspaper in the article published on Wednesday. 
""I think it is important in terms of industrial policy that we extend our support program for electric battery vehicles and plug-in hybrids which are currently limited to 2021 for the whole of the next decade,"" he said.
Government subsidy schemes have helped lift sales but even so, electric cars made up only about 1 percent of new car registrations last year, the KBA motor vehicle authority has said. 

Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said earlier this month it would make an aggressive push to build electric cars and this would force it to cut jobs.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 01:46AM ET</span>","Great Wall, Ford hitch up to burgeoning Chinese demand for pickup trucks","By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Grey Liu bought his third vehicle four months ago - a Foton pickup truck, lured by its $7,000 price tag and its ability to transport his sports motorcycle to the grasslands of northern China where he likes to ride.
The Beijing-based businessman is among a growing number of drivers in China keen on pickups - either for leisure or just because they like them, expanding the market beyond traditional demand for farm, construction and maintenance work. 
While calling his pickup ""a big toy"", the 35-year-old notes some of his friends also have one. ""There are more and more people like us,"" Liu said.
Pickup demand - both work-related and the newer interest from mainstream consumers - has climbed on the back of an easing in government restrictions and last year China became the world's second-biggest pickup truck market.
Signs this year that rules may be relaxed further are prompting industry executives and analysts to talk of a potential doubling or even greater jump in demand. That in turn is spurring Great Wall Motor Co, China's largest pickup manufacturer, and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, the maker of the most popular U.S. pickup series, to bolster product lines.
Great Wall is developing its first leisure model, President Wang Fengying told Reuters, revealing a previously unreported plan. 
""We believe demand for multi-purpose pickup trucks will soon start taking off in a major way,"" she said in a written statement, declining to provide further details.
The new truck will be priced much higher than current models and will be one of five all-new pickups in the next three years, sources familiar with Great Wall's plan said, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to speak on the matter.
At least one of the five would be an electric model, they added.
RESTRICTIONS RELAXED 
Although overall demand in the world's biggest auto market fell last year for the first time since the 1990s, pickup truck sales rose 10 percent to around 452,000 vehicles for a fourth straight year of growth, according to consultancy LMC Automotive.
(GRAPHIC: China's pickup sales are climbing - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ogjm2A)
That helped China overtake Canada as a pickup truck market, although it is far behind U.S. figures of just under 3 million. Like much of the world, the segment remains niche in China, accounting for less than 2 percent of overall sales. That contrasts with 16 percent for the United States and over 40 percent for Thailand.
Chinese demand grew after the government in 2016 allowed pickups to enter some urban areas in four of 31 mainland provincial-level areas. Last year, requirements that pickups have large unsightly labels that clearly marked them as commercial vehicles were dropped, making the vehicles far more attractive to mainstream consumers. 
Then in January, China's state planning body said it would steadily relax restrictions on pickups in cities - part of measures aimed at lifting consumer spending. It did not, however, say when or where rules might be eased.
Depending on how extensive that easing is, annual pickup demand in China could double or triple even if limited parking options hobble demand in the country's biggest cities like Shanghai, executives and analysts say.
""If China allows pickup trucks to enter central areas in more cities, the market could grow to 1 to 2 million units a year,"" said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight.
PRODUCTS PLANNED
Great Wall's new leisure pickup would be similar to Ford's mid-sized Ranger and priced at more than 200,000 yuan ($29,800), a mark up of at least 70 percent over its current most expensive pickup, sources familiar with the plan said.
""We aim to make this higher-end pickup feel more like a passenger vehicle and it will have an interior design like our SUV models,"" said one source.
According to a separate source, the vehicle is part of the company's plan to eventually enter the United States, although the model would likely have to be modified. Great Wall had aimed to enter the U.S. market in 2021 but U.S.-Sino trade tensions have currently made exports from China uneconomical.
Ford plans to launch a new pickup in China this year, adding to the F150 Raptor which it introduced in early 2017 and the Ranger which was launched in 2018. Sales for the Raptor, priced from 466,800 yuan ($69,565), tripled to nearly 2,500 vehicles last year, the company said. It declined to disclose sales for the Ranger which sells from 305,800 yuan ($45,570).
""Ford continues to see growing opportunities in China's pickup truck market, because of a combination of regulatory conditions and growing consumer interest,"" a spokesman said in an e-mailed statement.
With China pushing the development of electric vehicles hard, some domestic makers have joined Great Wall in looking at electric pickups, including Ford partner Jiangling Motors and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) partner JAC Motors.
Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd is developing a new electric pickup, a company source told Reuters, adding it would be made by its Yuan Cheng Auto unit. The source, who declined to be named as the plans are not public, did not provide further details.
Some global automakers, however, have yet to jump into the market feet first and their models are primarily imported and sold by independent dealers. 
Li Jiyuan, who works at a dealership that sells Toyota Motor Corp and RAM pickup trucks, says business has been hit somewhat by trade war uncertainties. To drum up more traffic, the dealership will expand into sales of BMW sport utility vehicles and explore online sales, he added.

Jet is in talks with leasing companies to restart operating several of its grounded aircraft, Pradeep Singh Kharola, secretary at the civil aviation ministry, told a news conference on Tuesday.
The airline has had to ground more than two-thirds of its fleet as it struggles to pay lenders, suppliers, pilots and leasing companies. 
Saving Jet is crucial for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he looks to avoid thousands of job losses ahead of a general election. His government had urged state-run banks to rescue the airline, sources have told Reuters.
Earlier this week, Jet Chairman and founder Naresh Goyal stepped down from the company's board with lenders seizing control in a bid to save the airline from bankruptcy. Jet has a debt of over $1 billion.
Under the rescue plan, Jet's lenders, led by State Bank of India, will issue a loan of 15 billion rupees ($217.73 million) to meet the airline's obligations and will form an interim management committee to oversee operations.
Jet's shares have lost over 56 percent of their value in the past year as of Tuesday's close.

It did not have any passengers and the issue was not related to a computer system on the 737 MAX aircraft that has come under scrutiny following two fatal crashes, one on Lion Air and another on Ethiopian Airlines, since October, the airline said.
""The crew followed protocol and safely landed back at the airport,"" Southwest said in a statement.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.7% and 0.9% respectively by 10:25 PM ET (02:25 GMT).
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.5%.
High-level officials from the U.S., including top trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, are due to travel to Beijing later this week for a fresh round of trade discussions.
Lighthizer told National Public Radio in an interview this week that he wants to get a deal, but he’s “not necessarily hopeful” one will happen. “We’re working on it,” Lighthizer said. “If there’s a great deal to be getting, we’ll get it. If not, we’ll find another plan.”
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.5%. Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) fell about 1% in the morning, gave back some of its gains earlier in the week following the report of new console models.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.1%. Index heavyweight  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) traded near flat after issuing a rare profit warning the previous day.
Australia’s ASX 200 fell 0.2%. The New Zealand dollar declined more than 1% against the U.S. dollar after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept the official cash rate on hold at at 1.75% as expected earlier, but added that the next move in interest rates is likely to be down.
Fear of a global economic slowdown has put stock markets under pressure since late last week. The appearance of an inverted yield curve, which can be an early indicator of a recession, fueled worries.
On Wednesday, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that profits at China's industrial firms in the first two months of 2019 dropped 14% year-on-year to 708.01 billion yuan ($105.50 billion), the worst contraction since late 2011.
The fall in profits was mainly due to price contractions in key industrial sectors such as auto, oil processing, steel and chemical industries, Zhu Hong of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data.
He also noted that the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays this year also had a more significant negative impact on the business environment than in 2018."

TOKYO (Reuters) - A committee tasked with revamping corporate governance at Nissan Motor Co is expected to recommend on Wednesday a bigger role for external directors in overseeing the Japanese automaker following Carlos Ghosn's arrest and ouster as chairman. 
The independent panel will announce the results of its three-month audit of Nissan's governance-related procedures, as the company seeks to draw a line under a near two-decade-long period during which Ghosn wielded outsized influence in his dual roles as its chairman and CEO for much of that time.
To decentralize the power structure at Japan's second-largest automaker, the seven-member committee will likely also suggest that the company establish committees for board member nominations, auditing and for determining executive pay, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
It may also recommend splitting the positions of company chairman, a role held by veteran top executives, and chairman of the board, who presides over board meetings, and that the latter position should be held by an external director.
The committee was not immediately reachable for comment, but has previously declined to comment on the matter. It will hold a briefing on Wednesday evening to release the recommendations.
Like executives at many Japanese companies, Ghosn held both chairmanship positions at Nissan, adding to his influence at the automaker. 
Nissan has said that too much power had been concentrated on Ghosn, one of the most feted executives in the global auto industry who orchestrated Nissan's financial recovery in the early 2000s and created the blueprint for the automaking alliance between Nissan and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
At the time of his arrest in Tokyo in November on financial misconduct allegations, Ghosn held the chairmanship at Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp, which together form one of the world's biggest automakers, while also serving as Renault CEO.
Ghosn is facing charges related to under-reporting his Nissan salary by around $82 million over nearly a decade, and for temporarily shifting personal financial losses onto Nissan's books during the global financial crisis. 
He denies the charges and has argued that his arrest and ouster from Nissan were orchestrated by executives at the company who were opposed to his plans for closer ties with Renault. 
REBALANCED ALLIANCE
Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors are retooling their partnership to create a more equal footing between them. Bound by complex cross-shareholdings, the three companies aim to leverage their combined scale to reduce costs for development, procurement and production.
Earlier this month, the three automakers announced they would create an operating board headed by top executives from each of the companies which would oversee the partnership's operations and governance - a role largely held by Ghosn alone in the past.
The newly appointed chairman of Renault, Jean-Dominique Senard, will serve as head of the alliance but - in a critical sign of the rebalancing - not as company chairman of Nissan, a position which could be left vacant for now, according to people with knowledge of the issue.

Nissan is considering asking ex-Toray Industries chief and Japan Inc heavyweight Sadayuki Sakakibara, who served on the reform committee, to take on the role of chairman of the board at the automaker.

372,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>",Cathay Buys Hong Kong Express to Enter Budget Airline Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. agreed to buy Hong Kong’s only budget carrier to enter the no-frills market, after more than a decade resisting such a move to focus on premium services.
Cathay will pay HK$2.25 billion ($287 million) in cash for Hong Kong Express Airways Ltd., the flag carrier said in a filing Tuesday. The flag carrier will also be issued HK$2.68 billion in promissory loan notes for the transaction.
The deal is expected to be completed by Dec. 31, Cathay said. HNA Aviation Group Co. is the seller’s guarantor, according to the filing.
The acquisition will give Cathay a crucial piece of business that’s missing from its operations and will lift its market share to more than 50 percent in Hong Kong, home to Asia’s busiest international airport. It will also provide Cathay with a new revenue source as the region’s growing economies allow more people to fly and as Chinese rivals expand with direct flights to Europe and U.S., bypassing the need to transit in Hong Kong.
Asia Pacific’s burgeoning market will probably see the largest increase in air traffic worldwide, with almost 4 billion passenger journeys expected in the next two decades.
Cathay is more than a decade behind Asian arch rival Singapore Airlines Ltd. in entering the no-frills business, and has seen demand for some shorter routes eroded by low-cost airlines while Chinese and Middle Eastern carriers chip away at premium and long-haul demand.
As airlines from Australia to India acknowledged the travel aspirations of Asia’s rising middle class by setting up budget carriers including Jetstar, Peach Aviation and IndiGo, Cathay sat tight on its premium roots. Profits were further eroded as mainland carriers began offering cheaper, direct flights to the U.S. from Chinese cities including Shanghai and Guangzhou, reducing the need to fly via Cathay or Hong Kong.
In March 2017, Cathay reported the first annual net loss in eight years and said it was embarking on a three-year transformation program to improve its operational efficiency and returns.
In April that year, it named a new chief executive officer, Rupert Hogg, who said a few months later that Cathay “broadly” had no plan to begin a low-cost carrier. Less than a year later, Cathay’s parent, Swire Pacific Ltd., named Merlin Swire as chairman, marking the return of a Swire family member to lead the conglomerate.
The overhaul amid the management changes appears to be bearing fruit. After cutting at least 600 jobs, adding destinations, and improving services, the carrier ended a two-year run of losses and posted its first full-year profit in 2018.
Apart from Hong Kong Express, airlines looking to start frills-free operations in the city have been met with opposition. In 2015, Hong Kong rejected an application from Jetstar Hong Kong Airways Ltd., saying it didn’t comply with legal requirements to operate such a business. Cathay also voiced its objection to the budget airline -- a venture of Qantas Airways Ltd. and China Eastern Airlines Corp. that’s backed by billionaire Stanley Ho’s Shun Tak Holdings Ltd.
Hong Kong’s position as an aviation hub has been threatened in recent years as airports in the mainland have been expanding to handle more international passengers, while Chinese carriers are either adding direct routes to the U.S. and Europe or teaming up with U.S. peers to expand their networks. Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). took a minority stake in China Eastern in 2015 and American Airlines Group Inc. announced a similar deal with China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines Co. in 2017.
For Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, the disposal is part of its efforts to trim one of China’s biggest debt piles by selling dozens of assets from hotels to aircraft-leasing and inflight-catering businesses.
Hong Kong Express, which started services in October 2013, operates a fleet of Airbus SE A320 family aircraft. It flies to cities in countries including China, South Korea, Japan and Vietnam.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for Elon Musk and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will square off in a Manhattan courtroom next week over whether the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive should be held in contempt over one of his tweets.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan scheduled oral argument on an SEC contempt motion for April 4 at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), after both sides said they saw no need for an evidentiary hearing.
Musk was accused by the SEC of violating his October 2018 fraud settlement with the regulator by tweeting on Feb. 19 to his more than 24 million Twitter followers that Tesla could build around 500,000 vehicles in 2019. 
The SEC said that tweet was improper because Musk did not get advance approval from Tesla. 
Musk's lawyers have said the tweet was not material, and merely restated a target for his Palo Alto, California-based electric car company that he had discussed publicly in January.
John Hueston, a lawyer for Musk, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a similar request.
The settlement was intended to resolve a lawsuit over a Twitter post last Aug. 7 in which Musk said he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 a share.
It called for Musk and Tesla to each pay $20 million civil fines, and for Musk to step down as Tesla's chairman.
Legal experts have said a contempt finding could subject Musk to a higher fine, further restrictions, or even removal from Tesla's board or as chief executive. Tesla shares closed Tuesday up $7.35, or 2.8 percent, at $267.77 on the Nasdaq.

The case is SEC v Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 18-08865.

1. Draw in Crude Supplies to Help U.S. Oil Prices Cruise Past $60?
Oil prices will be in focus Wednesday as the Energy Information Administration (EIA) is expected to show U.S. crude stockpiles fell for a third-straight week for the seven days ended March. 22.
Ahead of the data, however, the American Petroleum Institute reported Tuesday weekly crude stockpiles rose by 1.972 million barrels last week, compared with a draw of 2.13 million barrels in the prior week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories rose by about 1.2 million barrels last week.
Crude production will also garner attention after the EIA reported output rose to a record 12.1 million barrels a day in its previous report.
U.S. production is on track to top a milestone of 13 million barrels a day in March 2020, with most of the growth coming from the Permian region of Texas and New Mexico, the EIA said in its latest monthly outlook.
Crude oil futures jumped 1.9% to settle at $59.94 today, adding to gains of more than 20% so far this year, thanks to expectations for a decline global supplies amid limited exports from Venezuela.
""The market is in a risk-on mode and the trade must get ready for another big potential drop in supply,"" said Phil Flynn at Price Futures in Chicago.
""The OPEC cuts, along with zero exports from Venezuela, will take its toll as U.S. exports may hit a record high.""

381,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 04:46PM ET</span>","Boeing 737 MAX software fix: easy to upload, harder to approve","By Eric M. Johnson, David Shepardson and Allison Lampert
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) engineers armed with laptops and thumb drives will be able to upload a crucial software fix for the 737 MAX anti-stall system in about an hour. That's the easy part.
Before Boeing's workhorse of the future can resume flying, the upgrade must first be approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and then by wary regulators around the globe who have grounded it in the wake of two deadly crashes. 
Regulators in China, Europe and Canada have signaled they will not rubber stamp an FAA decision to allow the planes back into the air but conduct their own reviews.
With the FAA under pressure for its role in certifying the newest 737, and other regulators challenging its leadership of the airline safety system, Boeing's money-spinning jet could remain parked for months.
""We are guessing this thing's not going to be put to bed until the July or August time frame,"" said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Smith Capital Group, which holds shares in Boeing.
The world's largest planemaker has been working on the upgrade for its MCAS stall-prevention system since October's Lion Air crash, when pilots are believed to have lost a tug of war with software that repeatedly pushed the nose down.
Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell told the U.S. Senate Tuesday in written testimony that the agency will agree to allow the 737 MAX to return to service ""only when the FAA’s analysis of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate.""
Boeing formally submitted a proposed MCAS software enhancement to the FAA for certification on Jan. 21, Elwell's testimony said.
Prior to certification, the FAA was ""directly involved"" in the review of the MCAS system but ""time yields more data to be applied for continued analysis and improvement.""
Boeing's flagship new single-aisle jet was grounded globally after a second crash in Ethiopia this month prompted concerns over possible similarities.
As a first step toward resuming flights and unfreezing deliveries, Boeing plans to provide more than 200 airlines and regulators with details on software and training on Wednesday.
Once the new software is approved, adding it will only take an hour per plane, according to an FAA official. But the overall task could stretch on far longer. 
The FAA and Boeing will have to redo some analyses - including a formal functional hazard assessment - because they are making changes to a system that was already certified.
After the installation, there will be ground testing and flight tests, though how long these take could vary widely. 
""Clearly there is pressure to get the airplanes ungrounded but there is tremendous pressure to make sure it was done right,"" the FAA official said. 
""The last thing in the world you want is to have the thing hurried and then find problems with it."" 
Boeing and the FAA declined to comment.
FAA CHALLENGED
For decades, nations large and small followed the FAA's lead, but this month many ignored its initial declaration after the second crash that there was “no basis to order grounding the aircraft.”
The agency stood alone among top regulators. First China, then Singapore, Britain and Canada banned flights, before U.S. President Donald Trump announced the MAX would be grounded.
Now, the FAA and Boeing must run the gauntlet of increased overseas scrutiny as they try to unground the jet - with China once again in a position to undo the regulatory pecking order. 
Toughening its public stance, China said on Tuesday it had stopped accepting applications to certify individual MAX jets.
Canada, Europe and Turkey have all suggested they will take whatever time is needed to check the software even after the FAA approves it - a move that would normally set a global lead.
The shift in regulatory power poses a challenge to Boeing’s efforts to quickly resolve the crisis, experts said.
Increased precautions by global regulators could also have a broad impact on an aviation system that relies on ""reciprocity"" between the United States, Canada and Europe in recognizing each other's expertise in certifying a plane. 
Having a regulator such as the FAA do the heavy lifting to certify a plane reduces costs and time, since agencies abroad can validate the results and not have to duplicate them.
That global system of trust, which helps limit costs and keep flying safe, could be at risk from any perception that the United States failed to act, said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia. 
""It just makes the system, innovation and the development of new products all the more expensive."" 
Mike Daniel, a former FAA accident investigator, said the crash revealed weaknesses in Boeing's relations with regulators and airlines abroad.
777X CERTIFICATION CONCERN
The FAA's acting head will tell a Senate panel on Wednesday the agency’s oversight approach must ""evolve"" too.
But in Canada, Transport Minister Marc Garneau told Reuters Ottawa had already gone further than the FAA following the first crash in October and was ready to move the bar higher again.
""So we don’t always do things exactly the same. It has to pass the sort of safety threshold from our point of view.  And there’s nothing wrong with that,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the fallout may spread beyond the 737 family.
Certification could be delayed for the larger Boeing 777X, for which Lufthansa is a launch customer, as European regulators give it more a stringent review, the German airline's CEO said.

""Overall, foreign authorities will be more thorough in accepting American certifications. I think that for me is one of the outputs of these terrible events in Indonesia and Ethiopia already,"" Chief Executive Carsten Spohr told reporters.

382,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 04:29PM ET</span>",Wall Street climbs as financials snap five days of losses,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks gained on Tuesday, with financials snapping a five-day losing streak as Treasury yields stabilized above 15-month lows.
The S&P 500 financial index gained 1.1 percent and registered its biggest daily percentage gain since Feb. 15.
Benchmark 10-year note yields were steady on the day but above the level reached Monday, which was the lowest since December 2017.
The S&P 500's gains came after two sessions of declines, triggered by concern about slowing global economic growth and the inversion of a closely watched part of the Treasury yield curve.
""There was a stabilization in the bond market. What you don't want to see is the continuing inversion. The market is on yield watch, there's no doubt about it,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
If it persists, the yield curve inversion is seen as an indicator that a recession is likely in one to two years.
Also helping stocks, the S&P energy index jumped 1.5 percent, leading percentage gains among sectors, as oil prices rose on OPEC supply cuts and expectations of lower U.S. inventories.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 140.9 points, or 0.55 percent, to 25,657.73, the S&P 500 gained 20.1 points, or 0.72 percent, to 2,818.46 and the Nasdaq Composite added 53.98 points, or 0.71 percent, to 7,691.52.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares ended down 1 percent, reversing early gains, after a U.S. trade judge recommended Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc win a sales ban on some Apple iPhone models containing chips made by  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) in one of two patent disputes.
Investors also digested weak consumer confidence numbers for March, as well as housing data that showed U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in February.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp tumbled 8.7 percent after the world's largest cruise operator cut its annual profit forecast.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 38 new lows.

383,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 04:29PM ET</span>",U.S. to overhaul air safety oversight in response to two Boeing 737 MAX crashes,"By David Shepardson and Kumerra Gumechu
WASHINGTON/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The U.S. aviation regulator will significantly change its oversight approach to air safety by July following two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co MAX 737 passenger plane crashes, according to written congressional testimony seen by Reuters.
At a U.S. Senate panel hearing on Wednesday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) acting head Dan Elwell will say the agency’s oversight approach must ""evolve"" after the deadly crashes, according to the testimony. 
The aviation industry has been thrown into flux by a Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October that killed 189 people and an Ethiopian Airlines disaster on March 10 that killed 157, both involving Boeing's 737 MAX single-aisle plane.
A spokesman for Ethiopia's transport ministry, which is leading an investigation in Addis Ababa, told Reuters the preliminary crash report would very likely be released this week. The initial report will begin to paint a more detailed picture of what went wrong during flight ET 302's six minutes in the air, likely with huge consequences for the plane's manufacturer and the airline.
Boeing's best-selling jet, with orders worth more than $500 billion at list prices, has been grounded globally.
Elwell will also say that the 737 MAX will return to service ""only when the FAA’s analysis of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate.""
The MAX software is among the leading areas of focus for investigations into the two crashes. 
Elwell’s testimony discloses that Boeing first submitted a proposed upgrade to its anti-stall software - which aviation experts have identified as a potential factor in both crashes - to the FAA for certification on Jan. 21.
Boeing is expected as early as Wednesday to unveil more details of the software upgrade to the MAX's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, known as MCAS. The company did not comment on Tuesday on the upgrade, but said it would closely monitor the congressional hearing.
Elwell will tell the panel that the FAA was ""directly involved"" in the review of MCAS, and that its certification was ""detailed and thorough."" 
U.S. Transportation Department Inspector General Calvin Scovel will also testify to the panel on oversight changes.
""While revamping FAA’s oversight process will be an important step, continued management attention will be key to ensure the agency identifies and monitors the highest-risk areas of aircraft certification,"" said Scovel's written testimony, which was seen by Reuters.
According to Scovel, new FAA rules that took effect on March 12 require air carriers to train pilots for ""specific abnormal flight conditions"" including stall recovery.
But Scovel's testimony says ""despite requiring these training maneuvers to be practiced in flight simulators, simulators remain unavailable for some new aircraft, including the Boeing MAX series."" 
Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said he was sending a letter from lawmakers on Tuesday urging the FAA to engage an independent, third-party review of Boeing's proposed changes to the 737 MAX before it is returned to service.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is also examining the FAA's certification process, chairman Robert Sumwalt will tell the Senate, according to his testimony seen by Reuters.
BOEING BRIEFING PILOTS 
Boeing is this week briefing airlines on software and training updates for the MAX, with more than 200 global airline pilots, technical experts and regulators due in Renton, Washington, where the plane is built. 
As well as FAA approval, any MAX software fixes will need a green light from governments around the world, a process that could take months.
Boeing's software fix for the 737 MAX will prevent repeated operation of the anti-stall system and deactivate it altogether if two sensors disagree widely, two people familiar with pilot briefings told Reuters on Monday.
Upgrading an individual 737 MAX with Boeing's new software only takes about an hour per plane, though the overall process could stretch on far longer as it is rolled out across the global fleet because of stringent testing and documentation requirements by engineers and regulators, according to a senior FAA official with knowledge of the process. 
Ethiopian and French investigators have pointed to ""clear similarities"" between the two crashes, putting pressure on Boeing and U.S. regulators to come up with an adequate fix. 
Boeing shares closed down slightly on Tuesday. They have lost about 12 percent and $29 billion in market value since the crash in Ethiopia.
China's civil aviation regulator has stopped taking applications for MAX 8 airworthiness certification, a regulatory official said on Tuesday.
Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) AG plans to buy a triple-digit number of either Boeing 737 MAX or Airbus A320neo jetliners to expand its fleet, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said on Tuesday.
""We have not lost our trust in Boeing,"" Spohr told reporters. ""They've built wonderful aircraft over the decades, and I am sure they will fix the current issue.""
Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lufthansa.
Ethiopian Airlines' success over the past decade as it has expanded its Boeing-dominated fleet is emblematic of Ethiopia's ambitions: to be a regional powerhouse with an Asia-style economic development model. 
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office a year ago and announced sweeping economic and political reforms, has said he wants to open the airline up to foreign investment as part of a partial privatization of state-owned enterprises. 

All of that could hinge on what the investigation reveals. Most crash investigations end up pinpointing a combination of factors.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) AG plans to buy a triple-digit number of either Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX or Airbus A320neo jetliners to replace jets in its fleet, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said on Tuesday.
""We have not lost our trust in Boeing"" following two fatal 737 MAX crashes and the grounding earlier this month of the worldwide fleet of that aircraft, Spohr said in a meeting with reporters.
""They've built wonderful aircraft over the decades, and I am sure they will fix the current issue,"" Spohr said of Boeing.
Lufthansa expects to make a decision on its narrow-body 737 or A320 purchases next year, Spohr said. The airline does not currently have 737 MAX planes in its fleet or on order. It is replacing Airbus A319 and Bombardier CRJ planes.
Spohr said regulators in Europe and elsewhere may apply greater scrutiny in certifying aircraft, such as Boeing's 777X.
He declined to say how long it might take or what regulators might require to restore flying permission for the 737 MAX, after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that claimed 346 lives.

387,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>",China Cancels Glencore Canada Canola Permit Amid Trade Spat,"(Bloomberg) -- Pest infestation is the reason China cited for revoking the license of a  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc’s unit to ship Canadian canola to the Asian nation, the world’s biggest oilseed buyer.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his country’s canola is “top quality,” and plans to use “diplomatic channels” to resolve the ruckus amid increasing political tensions following the arrest of a Huawei Technologies Co. executive in Vancouver.
China on Tuesday canceled Glencore’s Viterra’s registration to ship canola. On March 1, the same fate befell Richardson International, Canada’s largest exporter of the oilseed, and a company official said the move may be linked to the escalating row over the arrest. Earlier in March, canola futures touched a 31-month low.
The Canola Council of Canada said it isn’t sure whether the licenses were scrapped because of the political tensions. Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested in December at the request of the U.S.
“What we know is that it’s very important that trade with China is based on science,” Brian Innes, a vice president of public affairs at the council, said in a telephone interview. China is the biggest buyer of Canada’s canola, and trade equals the amount of the next three markets combined, “so we must find a solution,” he said.
China’s Canola Imports From Canada Slump by a Third in February
China represents a C$3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) market for Canadian producers of canola. The seeds are crushed for oil used in everything from salad dressing to deep-frying. Canola is also used as livestock feed.
China probably is trying to apply political pressure to the Canadian government over the Huawei arrest, Neil Townsend, a senior analyst at FarmLink in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said in a phone interview.
“If you look hard enough in any cargo of any grain from any country on the face of the Earth, you’re going to find something that probably shouldn’t be there,” he said. China has balked at meeting with Canadian officials to examine the pest evidence, he said.
Trudeau said on Tuesday in Winnipeg that he is considering sending a delegation to China to discuss the issue.
“We’re continuing to work very hard to try and resolve this issue,” he said at a press conference. “We are taking this very seriously.”
The Canadian council said on March 21 that China had stopped buying canola from all of the nation’s exporters.

389,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",The Yield Curve's Recession Signal Leaves Some Investors Unswayed,"(Bloomberg) -- The inversion of the U.S. yield curve has unleashed exasperation among some investors who say the recession indicator is shot.
The three-month to 10-year curve has reliably inverted before a downturn. That’s because weakening expectations for growth and inflation raise demand for long-term securities, driving their yields below those on shorter maturities.
While the flattening curve has stirred talk of recession for the past couple of years, skeptics warn that its signal is jammed. Their view is that central-bank policy has kept yields artificially low since the crisis, while negative rates in Europe and Japan stoke demand for U.S. assets.
For the doubters, the case for an impending recession lacks context, and their supporting evidence falls into three categories. Jim Caron at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management needs more-ominous signs from U.S. economic data.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists are among those looking for more deterioration in risk assets. Seema Shah, senior global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors, is focused on the depth and breadth of inversion.
“For us, there’s nothing which is suggesting there’s a recession on the horizon,” said Shah. “We look at yield-curve inversion as a recession indicator, but given the central-bank purchases over the past decade, you almost need to have a much deeper inversion before it starts to signal recession.”
The 10-year yield is about 3 basis points below the three-month rate. It inverted Friday for the first time since 2007 after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly revised its projections to reflect no rate hikes this year.
Data Mining
Some are dubious about the focus on this particular inversion. Greg Staples, co-head of Americas fixed income at asset manager DWS, said the three-month to 10-year signal “seems to be data-mined because that is the one pair that is inverted, but if you look at the rest of the curve, to a large degree it’s steep.”
The five- to 30-year, at 67 basis points, is close to its steepest since 2017. Goldman researchers Alessio Rizzi and Christian Mueller-Glissmann point out that the extent of inversion is still “quite weak compared to the last four recessions where more than 70 percent of the curve was inverted.”
The 2- to 10-year spread is also still positive, at about 15 basis points. For Caron at MSIM, a gap of negative 20-25 basis points on this segment would be a plausible recession signal, not just a simple inversion.
Goldman also would look for more deterioration in risk markets. Their research note this week pointed out that credit spreads, “which usually react to recession risk early,” haven’t widened materially.
Credit Check
Spreads on lower-tier investment grade bonds are around 154 basis points over the risk-free rate, down from almost 200 basis points at the start of the year, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index data. The gap exceeded 300 basis points in the first few months of the last recession, eventually peaking above 700.
That broader weakening could show up a little more clearly soon, according to Caron at MSIM, if next month’s earnings season disappoints equities and credit investors. But he’s focused on the U.S. economic backdrop, which he doesn’t see as consistent with a slide toward recession.
Growth is still tracking at about 2 percent annual expansion as of last quarter, with inflation around target. He’s also watching jobs data, which show unemployment hovering around a 50-year low.
Mistaken Narrative
And while the curve’s recession signal is in doubt for some, others see it as an actual distraction. Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, put it plainly in a note this week entitled “The knee-jerk yield curve narrative is wrong.”
Alongside the argument that low rates overseas have anchored U.S. 10-year yields, he noted that another key ingredient is missing to put this current inversion on a par with prior, accurate recession signals. That is, the Fed needs to have plausibly overtightened. As it stands, the Fed has paused this cycle before even reaching a neutral policy rate.
“The inversions that did lead to downturns lined up with a fed funds well north of neutral,” Porcelli wrote.
That’s significant for Porcelli, as he sees the U.S. expansion benefiting from artificially low rates, which have also in the past spurred asset-price inflation.
“So, no, we are not on recession watch because of this dynamic,” he wrote. “We are, more than any other point this cycle, on bubble watch.”

390,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 03:07PM ET</span>",General Electric in $49 million settlement over Petters fraud,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Tuesday reached a $49 million settlement to end a long-running lawsuit over its relationship with Thomas Petters, the Minnesota businessman serving a 50-year prison term for running a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme.
The settlement between GE and a trustee for two bankrupt Florida investment funds known as Palm Beach Finance, who was seeking $651 million, was filed with the federal bankruptcy court in West Palm Beach, Florida. Court approval is required.
GE denied liability in agreeing to settle claims related to its General Electric Capital unit, one of Petters' lenders. A spokeswoman, Jennifer Erickson, declined to comment.
The accord removes a financial overhang for Boston-based GE, which is trying to cut costs while projecting lower 2019 cash flow and profitability from its core industrial operations.
Petters, 61, was convicted in December 2009 on 20 counts including fraud and money laundering, over what prosecutors called a $3.65 billion fraud.
Prosecutors said Petters bilked investors who thought he was using their money to buy consumer electronics from wholesalers and resell them to big-box retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Sam's Club.
Federal authorities raided Petters' offices in September 2008 and criminally charged him that December, the same month Bernard Madoff was charged over his own Ponzi scheme.
Barry Mukamal, the trustee for the Palm Beach Finance funds, said GE Capital knew as early as 2000 about Petters' fraud, but kept quiet to ensure Petters would keep paying its fees.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul Hyman in June 2017 refused to dismiss the lawsuit, which accused GE Capital of conspiring to commit fraud.
GE had argued that only the trustee overseeing Petters' bankrupt companies could bring the conspiracy claim.
Hyman had previously dismissed eight other claims in the September 2012 lawsuit. The Palm Beach Finance funds filed for bankruptcy in November 2009.
Michael Budwick, a lawyer for Mukamal, said the failure of three of Petters' other lenders to recover anything from GE on similar ""copycat"" claims was a factor in deciding to settle, along with the death of a key witness.
""Victims of Ponzi schemes should realize they can be successful pursuing recoveries against companies they consider financially responsible,"" Budwick, a partner at Meland Russin & Budwick, said in an interview.
Mukamal in 2015 reached a separate $16 million settlement with Bank of Montreal, whose Milwaukee-based unit Marshall & Ilsley also worked with Petters.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 03:00PM ET</span>","Mexico president flags Slim 'retirement,' tycoon sees hard work ahead","By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday Carlos Slim had told him the billionaire planned to retire during his administration, in a step at odds with the tycoon's usually discreet approach to public life.
Slim, who for a time was listed by Forbes as the world's richest man, did not confirm the president's unexpected announcement, but said through a spokesman that hard work lay ahead for the two of them over the next six years.
Long a dominant figure in the Mexican economy, the 79-year-old Slim typically keeps a low profile, doing only occasional interviews and giving away little about his plans.
Slim was the first question of the day during Lopez Obrador's regular morning news conference, as a reporter asked if he had met the tycoon and what he thought about his plans.
""He wants to end his business life helping economic growth and public welfare during this government,"" Lopez Obrador said, without specifying when he met Slim. ""That's what he offered me. He wants to retire and he wants to do it in this government.""
Arturo Elias, a spokesman and son-in-law of the 79-year-old Slim, posted a brief statement on Twitter after being asked whether the president's remarks were accurate.
""Slim remarked to the president that the two have almost six years of intense work (ahead) for the country, the president due to his electoral mandate, and (Slim) due to his age,"" Elias said.
Vowing to tackle chronic poverty and inequality in Mexico, Lopez Obrador has put government welfare spending at the heart of his plans to redistribute wealth.
While some economists have questioned how effective handouts will be, business leaders have publicly backed the promotion of ""bienestar"" or ""welfare"" as an instrument of policy, and pledged to support the president economically.
Day-to-day management of Slim's business empire, which ranges from telecommunications and construction to retail and banking, is in the hands of his sons and sons-in-law, though he is widely believed to hold a powerful influence over decisions.
The Slim family's wealth is currently estimated by Forbes at $64 billion. The billionaire has previously suggested he would never retire, saying he would work until he is ""put in a coffin"" or until ""my body gives in.""
Slim's companies include telecoms giant America Movil and bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa.
Shares in America Movil were up 0.22 percent in afternoon trading, slightly ahead of the main S&P/BMV IPC stock index, which was up 0.15 percent. Inbursa shares were up 0.43 percent.
Slim has made few public statements since Lopez Obrador took office in December, beyond offering some perfunctory words of support for the new government.
Relations between the administration and Slim got off to an inauspicious start. Before he was even in office, Lopez Obrador said he was canceling a partly built $13 billion new Mexico City airport, in which Slim and his family had major interests.
Lopez Obrador, who worked with Slim to redevelop parts of Mexico City when he was mayor of the capital between 2000 and 2005, argued that the airport was tainted by corruption and being built in an area that was geologically unsuitable.
The cancellation angered business leaders and the government spent its first few weeks compensating investors in the project.
Lopez Obrador has used his presidency to rail constantly at the ""neo-liberal"" economic policies of the last six governments which he blames for fomenting corruption and violence in Mexico.
Those 3 1/2 decades cover most of the period during which Slim vaulted from a position of relative obscurity to becoming Mexico's pre-eminent business magnate with the acquisition of former state telephone monopoly Telmex in 1990-91.
The president said he planned to meet Slim soon to discuss plans for investment in Mexico. He did not go into detail.

By law, Mexican presidents can serve only a single six-year term. Lopez Obrador's term is due to end in 2024.

The shares were down 1.8% Tuesday afternoon and hit a 52-week low of $160.37. The shares are off 29% since peaking on Dec. 3 and down more than 15% this year.
The administration's position came in a letter sent to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court is hearing an appeal of a Texas court decision that declared the entire ACA unconstitutional.
The administration told the appeals court that “it is not urging that any portion of the district court’s judgment be reversed,” the New York Times reported.
Health-insurance stocks generally were lower on Tuesday.
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), off 1.6%, was the worst performer among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH) was off 9.5%.
Critics of the Administration's current position, who include the health-insurance industry, say gutting the ACA entirely will take away insurance coverage from as many as 100 million Americans and cause chaos for consumers, healthcare providers and health-insurance companies.
The case will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court no matter who wins on the appeal. It will also likely be a political issue for the 2020 election.
Cigna earned $2.46 a share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $14.3 billion. Both beat estimates from analysts polled by Investing.com. The stock has been weak since December in part because of the uncertainty created by the Texas ACA decision.
Cigna will be spending much of this year digesting its $67-billion acquisition pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX).
Its 2019 results won't be comparable to 2018 because the Express Scripts deal. The current Investing.com consensus is earnings of $3.76 a share on revenue of $34.1 billion.
The Express Scripts deal is part of an industry trend for health insurers and pharmacy management operations to combine in hopes of cutting prices. But the deals will also intensify competition. United Health, which owns Optum Rx and drugstore chain CVS Health (NYSE:CVS)) bought Aetna (NYSE:AET) in a $70 billion deal in late 2018."

396,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 02:32PM ET</span>",OxyContin maker Purdue reaches $270 million settlement in Oklahoma opioid case,"By Nate Raymond and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and members of the wealthy Sackler family that own the company reached a $270 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit brought by the state of Oklahoma accusing the drugmaker of fueling an opioid abuse epidemic.
The settlement with Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, unveiled on Tuesday, was the first to result from a wave of recent lawsuits accusing Purdue of deceptively marketing painkillers that eventually helped create a deadly crisis sweeping the United States.
Hunter's 2017 lawsuit was set to go to a jury in May in what would have been the first trial to result from roughly 2,000 lawsuits filed in federal and state courts nationwide against Purdue and other drugmakers.Hunter accused Purdue, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd of deceptive marketing that played down the risks of addiction associated with opioid pain drugs while overstating their benefits, contributing to an epidemic.
Opioids, including prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017 in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The companies deny wrongdoing. Purdue has argued that U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved labels for its opioids carried warnings about the risk of abuse and misuse associated with them. 
Purdue's chief executive this month said the company was weighing filing for bankruptcy protection as an option to address potential liabilities from the lawsuits, a move that Reuters had reported earlier.
Companies facing mounting litigation often consider a bankruptcy filing to halt lawsuits and negotiate with plaintiffs in one federal court proceeding.
'START OF THE DOMINOES FALLING' 
Avoiding the trial with a settlement relieves immediate pressure on Purdue to seek bankruptcy protection, said Alexandra Lahav, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law.
While the company has not ruled out a bankruptcy filing, it now plans to focus attention on attempting a far-reaching settlement with other plaintiffs pursuing similar cases, including state and local governments, a person familiar with Purdue’s deliberations said.
""This may be the start of the dominoes falling for Purdue,"" Lahav said.
Members of the Sackler family in a statement called allegations that they contributed to the opioid crisis ""not accurate"" and argued that Tuesday's agreement did not represent ""a financial model for future settlement discussions.""
Purdue Chief Executive Craig Landau and members of the Sackler family expressed compassion for opioid victims and portrayed the settlement as furthering their commitment to combat the addiction crisis. 
Around 1,600 lawsuits are consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has pushed for a settlement ahead of the first trial scheduled before him in October.
Purdue will likely attempt to finalize any decisions related to a settlement and a bankruptcy filing before that court date, the source familiar with the company’s deliberations said.
Tuesday’s settlement covers only Purdue, leaving claims pending against J&J and Israel-based Teva. The deal was announced a day after the Oklahoma Supreme Court rejected an effort by Purdue and its co-defendants to delay the May 28 trial. 
Purdue's marketing efforts helped fuel the opioid epidemic and turn OxyContin into a top-selling painkiller that by 2017 had generated an estimated $35 billion in sales since the product's release in 1996, according to the lawsuit.
The state had been seeking more than $20 billion in damages, according to court papers. Under the terms of Tuesday's settlement, Purdue said it will contribute $102.5 million to help fund an addiction treatment center at Oklahoma State University, and donate $20 million worth of medications to support its treatment mission. The Sacklers, who were not named as defendants in Oklahoma's lawsuit, agreed to contribute $75 million toward the university center as well, Purdue said. Another $12.5 million will be made available to Oklahoma localities to help address the opioid epidemic in their communities, and another $60 million will go toward costs and legal fees stemming from the lawsuit, Purdue said. Lawyers for plaintiffs pursuing similar cases nationally against Purdue and other opioid manufacturers welcomed Tuesday's settlement as a breakthrough that could help secure other deals.

They have often compared the cases against Purdue to widespread lawsuits against the tobacco industry that resulted in a $246 billion settlement in 1998. Paul Hanly, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in the federal opioid litigation, said they are ""hopeful that the Oklahoma settlement is the beginning of a good-faith program on the part of Purdue to settle all of the nationwide litigation.""

An investor group comprising Legion Partners Asset Management LLC, Macellum Advisors GP LLC and Ancora Advisors LLC disclosed a combined stake of about 5 percent in the company and also said it was seeking a review of options, including a sale, for all of the home furnishing retailer's non-core brands.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that a possible sale could include brands such as Buy Buy Baby and Cost Plus World Market.
Bed Bath & Beyond has struggled to keep pace with changing consumer tastes and shopping habits over the years, with sales growth spiraling down to just 1.1 percent last year compared to over 22 percent in 2003, when Temares took over as CEO.
The company's shares have fallen for the last five years, losing over 85 percent of their value. In contrast, peers Lowe's Cos Inc and  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) have gained 46 percent and 52 percent, respectively, over the same period.
""Irrespective of the elevated capital investment of the past several years (mostly in digital technology and fulfillment), management has been slow to invest in its stores ... This will likely add credibility to any activist style campaign,"" Raymond James analyst Bobby Griffin said.
The trio of investors also said excessive pay packages and a failure to hold management accountable necessitate a change in a majority of the board.
The group nominated 16 board candidates including former Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) executive Jeffrey Kirwan and former Pier 1 Imports Inc CEO Alexander Smith.
Bed Bath & Beyond in response said it asked on several occasions over the past few weeks for Legion's and Macellum's suggestions for improving its business but the investors did not provide any and instead chose to publicly attack the company.
""Unfortunately, while our directors and management were seeking to engage in good faith, it appears that the Legion and Macellum representatives were merely seeking information to support their attack,"" the company said.
Bed Bath & Beyond also said it is ""undertaking a comprehensive transformation to evolve the foundational structure of the business, drive shareholder value and best position the company for long-term success."" 

The company's shares were last trading up 25 percent at $17.39 after touching a high of $18.09.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration will significantly change its oversight approach to air safety by July 2019, U.S. Transportation Department Inspector General Calvin Scovel said in written testimony reviewed by Reuters ahead of a U.S. Senate panel hearing.
At the same hearing, the FAA's acting administrator, Dan Elwell, will tell a Senate Commerce Committee panel the agency’s oversight approach must ""evolve"" after two fatal crashes involving Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX passenger jets since October. 
The accidents, which killed nearly 350 people, triggered the worldwide grounding of Boeing's flagship aircraft and ignited a debate over the proper balance between man and machine in piloting the latest version of the 50-year-old 737.
Scovel's testimony for the hearing, set for Wednesday, says that in response to a 2015 inspector general report, the FAA agreed to improve its oversight of organizations performing certifications on its behalf.
By July the ""FAA plans to introduce a new process that represents a significant change in its oversight approach,"" Scovel says in his prepared remarks.
""While revamping FAA’s oversight process will be an important step, continued management attention will be key to ensure the agency identifies and monitors the highest-risk areas of aircraft certification,"" he wrote, adding that some issues including how pilots get training to respond when automated flight systems require the FAA's ""urgent attention.""
Elwell will also say the 737 MAX will return to service ""only when the FAA’s analysis of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate.""
Elwell’s testimony discloses that Boeing first submitted its proposed anti-stall software upgrade to the FAA for certification on Jan. 21 of this year and that the FAA has tested ""this enhancement to the 737 MAX flight control system in both the simulator and the aircraft.""
Boeing is expected as early as Wednesday to unveil more details of the software upgrade. The company said Tuesday it would carefully monitor the hearing.
Separately, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt will tell the panel in written testimony that the board is ""examining the U.S. design certification process to ensure any deficiencies are captured and addressed, potentially up to and including NTSB safety recommendations.""
Elwell will tell the panel that the FAA ""will go
wherever the facts lead us, in the interest of safety."" He defended the FAA's aircraft certification system, but acknowledged it faces challenges. 
The 737 MAX is Boeing’s best-selling plane, with orders worth more than $500 billion at list prices.
The software fix will prevent repeated operation of the anti-stall system and will deactivate it if it receives widely conflicting sensor information, Reuters reported. Boeing will also make standard a previously optional warning light.
""The testing, which was conducted by FAA flight test engineers and flight test pilots, included aerodynamic stall
situations and recovery procedures,"" Elwell's testimony says.
In addition to Scovel's office, federal prosecutors are also investigating the 737 MAX certification.
""As the aerospace system and its components become increasingly more complex, we know that our oversight approach needs to evolve to ensure that the FAA remains the global leader in achieving aviation safety,"" Elwell's testimony will say.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Monday she was naming a blue-ribbon panel to review the FAA's aircraft certification program.
Elwell's testimony defends the certification process that allows Boeing or other companies to act as a representative for FAA.

But Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said Friday the program ""effectively left the fox guarding the hen house."" Elwell's testimony says the program ""is not self-certification; the FAA retains strict oversight authority.""

405,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 01:13PM ET</span>",Merck KGaA goes hostile in $5.9 billion Versum takeover battle,"By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German pharma group Merck KGaA launched a hostile $5.9 billion all-cash takeover offer for Versum Materials on Tuesday to boost its presence in the semiconductor materials market and sideline a rival bidder. 
Versum, the former specialty chemicals division of industrial gases group Air Products (NYSE:APD), has been opposed to Merck's unsolicited cash offer since it was first proposed last month, saying it was committed to an all-share merger with U.S. rival Entegris agreed in January.
Merck kept its offer price unchanged at $48 per share on Tuesday. That compares with an offer of $39.20 worth of Entegris stock for each Versum share under their deal. Entegris was trading at $35 on Tuesday.
""The Versum board’s hasty rejection of our proposal and unwillingness to engage in discussions with us has forced us to take this proposal directly to shareholders,"" family-controlled Merck said in a letter to Versum shareholders.
For diversified Merck, controlled by descendants of the group's 17th century founder, this marks the first hostile takeover attempt since its 2006 swoop on domestic drugs rival Schering, which Bayer (DE:BAYGN) eventually acquired for 17 billion euros.
The move is also the first major hostile takeover bid by a German company for a U.S. target since BASF's 2006 approach for catalytic converter maker Engelhard, which ended up becoming an agreed deal. 
Merck's offer will run until June 7, the letter said. A Merck spokesman said the offer would be conditional on Merck winning over investors with combined holdings of more than 50 percent of Versum shares.
Merck said that Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Fortis and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) had committed financing for a Versum acquisition.
""Now the burden shifts to the Versum board to explain with much greater clarity any objections they may have about this offer,"" said one Versum shareholder, who was previously leaning towards the Entegris deal.
Versum's shares gained 0.8 percent to $50.07 by 1518 GMT, reflecting hopes of a higher bid. 
'YOUR MOVE, ENTEGRIS'
""This tells me the ball is now in the Entegris court to either increase its offer or to go away,"" the investor added, asking not to be named.
Versum did not have an immediate comment.
A statement from Entegris emphasized the merged group's development potential from cost and revenue benefits.
""Merck’s low premium, change-in-control offer would prevent the stockholders of both companies from participating in potential upside of the combined company,"" it said. 
Merck, shares in which were up 0.7 percent, is building a high-tech chemicals division called Performance Materials to cater to the electronics industry. 
A major part of that is its liquid crystals business, which has previously achieved operating income margins of 40-50 percent but is now suffering shrinking sales under pressure from Chinese rivals.
The moves by Merck and Entegris are viewed by some as an effort to seize on beaten down stock prices in the volatile semiconductor industry after demand for mobile devices slowed and prices for memory chips sank. 
Versum, which makes chemicals for the semiconductor industry, suffered a 27 percent drop in its share price last year.
The main rivals in the fragmented market for chemicals used in electronics include DuPont (NYSE:DWDP), Honeywell (NYSE:HON) , Hitachi Chemical and Shin-Etsu, according to UBS analysts.
Merck is diversified across three separate businesses, including a pharmaceuticals operation that struck a 3.7 billion euro ($4.17 billion) collaboration deal with GlaxoSmithKline last month, and a life sciences division that makes supplies and gear for biotech laboratories.

Lloyd's will add two women, Fiona Luck and Vicky Carter, to its nominations committee, succeeding David Manning and Charles Franks, it said in a statement.
It also said it had made a commitment to hear the accounts of the women in the Bloomberg article in a safe and confidential space.
Lloyd's said it had introduced a number of policies, including sanctions and potential life bans on entering its City tower, to ""create better understanding and awareness of the issues"".

The automaker, which operates a joint venture in Russia with local automaker Sollers, plans to make an announcement about the future of its operations there on Wednesday, the person said. Ford is likely to close one passenger-car factory near St. Petersburg and another in the Tatarstan region, but continue producing commercial vehicles at a third plant, said the person.
Moscow-based Sollers said in a statement that the two companies have reached a new agreement on the future of their venture and are finalizing details. Ford announced it was putting the business under review in January as part of a broader restructuring in a region that’s dragged on earnings for years. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company is also ceasing production at a French transmission factory, reducing its German staff by more than 5,000 people and cutting an unspecified number of jobs in the U.K.
Ford’s 50-50 joint venture with Sollers dates to 2011 and currently manufactures seven models, according to FordSollers’ website. The plant near St. Petersburg builds the Focus and Mondeo models, and the Tatarstan facility in Naberezhnye Chelny makes the Fiesta and Ecosport crossover.

410,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 12:16PM ET</span>","Adobe, Microsoft to take on Salesforce's marketing software, with LinkedIn as a weapon","By Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) are partnering to bolster each other's sales and marketing software capabilities, taking aim at common rival Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM), they said on Tuesday.
Adobe and Microsoft hope to make it easier for users of Adobe's marketing software to find and target teams of potential customers for business goods on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), the social network owned by Microsoft, they said at a conference in Las Vegas. 
If an Adobe customer is selling medical equipment to a hospital, for example, the new partnership would make it easier to target tailored LinkedIn ads to all of the people involved in the purchasing decision, such as doctors, technicians and finance managers. If the marketing campaign works, sales people could then use Microsoft's sales software to help close the deal.
""The LinkedIn network is one of those clear holy grails"" for business marketers, Steve Lucas, senior vice president of digital experience at Adobe and former chief executive officer of Marketo, a business-to-business marketing software firm that Adobe acquired last year for $4.75 billion, told Reuters. ""It has just become such a huge lever for B-to-B marketers that it would be impossible for us to ignore it.""
Long known as the maker of content creation tools such as Photoshop, Adobe has in recent years turned to making the software used for marketing campaigns, which rely heavily on the content created with its software.
Most of Adobe's tools were for marketers trying to reach consumers, but the Marketo acquisition last year bolstered its software for business marketers.
While Microsoft is best known for its Window operating system and Office program, it is also working to grow a business called Dynamics 365, software used by sales people to track deals. Its $26 billion acquisition in 2016 of LinkedIn, perhaps the most common tool used by sales people trying to drum up business, was a key piece of the effort https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-linkedin-idUSKBN17Q1FW.
In doing so, both are taking on Salesforce, the cloud software company that offers sales and marketing software, where Adobe and Microsoft lack one or the other.
But by integrating their systems, Adobe and Microsoft can offer something arguably ""a lot broader"" because Adobe software is how most marketing content gets made, said Melissa Webster, program vice president for content and digital media technologies at research firm IDC.
""There's no question that Microsoft and Adobe both have a lot to gain from teaming up against Salesforce,"" Webster said.
Salesforce could not be reached immediately for comment.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 11:10AM ET</span>","Innoviz, Ouster raise millions for self-driving lidar sensors","By Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - Self-driving technology continues to attract robust investment, as two tech startups, one in San Francisco and one near Tel Aviv, said this week they have raised nearly $200 million to support development and production of lidar sensors for automated vehicles.
Israeli startup Innoviz Technologies said on Tuesday it raised $132 million, taking its total funding to $214 million, surpassing the money raised by sector leaders Velodyne and Quanergy, each of which is valued at around $2 billion. Innoviz did not provide a valuation figure.
San Francisco-based Ouster, whose founders include a former Quanergy executive, said on Monday it raised $60 million, boosting its total funding to $90 million.
Innoviz and Ouster are competing in a crowded field of more than 50 lidar startups vying to supply vehicle manufacturers and their key suppliers with the sensors.
A critical component of self-driving systems, lidar sensors use laser light pulses to measure distances and render precise images of the environment around the car.
More than $1 billion in corporate and private investment has been plowed into the sector over the past three years, including a record $420 million in 2018, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available investment data.
Automakers and large suppliers have begun to place bets on different lidar startups and competing technologies. Eventually, analysts expect the lidar sector could be squeezed down to five or six major players, but likely not until after 2025. 
In the meantime, Innoviz continues to muscle its way into the forefront of lidar providers. Founded in 2016, the company already has a contract with BMW to supply its first self-driving vehicles in 2021. 
Innoviz has financial backing from Japan's SoftBank Group Corp as well as auto suppliers Aptiv Plc, Magna International Inc and Samsung (KS:005930) Group. Its most recent funding comes from several large investors in China and Israel.
Founded in mid-2015, Ouster raised more money from several of its initial investors, including Cox Automotive and Fontinalis Partners, which is co-owned by Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co Chairman Bill Ford. New investors include Silicon Valley Bank.
Ouster declined to name specific self-driving partners, and said it is not focusing its sensor business exclusively on vehicles, but instead is selling to customers in a variety of industries, including drones, mapping and defense.
Ouster said it plans to begin producing ""several thousand"" sensors a month later this year at its San Francisco facility.

(The story corrects paragraph 3 to say Ouster has raised a total of $90 million, not $87 million, and paragraph 10 to say Ouster was founded in mid-2015, not 2016)

415,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 10:55AM ET</span>","China widens ban on Canadian canola imports to second firm, Viterra","BEIJING (Reuters) - China expanded its ban on Canadian canola imports on Tuesday to include shipments from Viterra Inc, the latest development in a wider trade dispute between the two countries.
Viterra is the second canola exporter to have its registration canceled, after Beijing halted shipments from top exporter Richardson International earlier this month.
The ban on Viterra, and related companies, was announced by China's General Administration of Customs on its website and was effective immediately. It comes just days after an industry group said that Chinese importers had stopped buying the oilseed from Canada.
Canada and China are locked in a dispute over trade and telecoms technology that has ensnared the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, who faces U.S. criminal charges.
China's customs authority said earlier this month it had found hazardous pests in canola imports from Canada, and revoked the export registration of Richardson International.
Richardson has said its canola meets regulatory requirements.
In its statement on Tuesday, customs said the ports of Dalian and Nanning had once again detected several pests in samples taken from cargoes shipped by Viterra Inc.
In order to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms, it had canceled the firm's export registration, it said, adding that it will continue to strengthen inspections on all canola imports.
China accounts for about 40 percent of Canada's canola seed, oil and meal exports, according to industry body the Canola Council of Canada.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday that his government was optimistic it can make progress this year in talks to persuade China to resume imports of Canadian canola seed.

The retailer has struggled to keep pace with online competitors and the investor group has contended that it has failed to adapt to the new retail environment while allowing costs to increase and margins to shrink,  Fox Business says, citing people familiar with the matter.
In a research note published Thursday, Raymond James said a private equity take-out makes sense for a number of reasons including governance issues, low inside ownership, and out of the money stock options. Analysts Bobby Griffin and Budd Bugatch also showcased a financial model which indicated a leveraged buyout of the company was feasible. Raymond James updated its rating to ""strong buy"" and price target to $20 given the activist investor interest. Shares were trading near $17.50 apiece on Tuesday morning. 
However,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Simeon Gutman advised investors to remain cautious. Gutman cited margin pressure from the industry's e-commerce shift and commensurate store traffic declines which will make it difficult to change Bed Bath & Beyond's trajectory of weakening margins. Gutman maintained an ""underweight"" rating and $13 price target.

Cronos reported revenue of 5.6 million Canadian dollars, well below the consensus estimate of 10.8 million Canadian dollars and below all analyst estimates. Expectations for the quarter were high, with analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecasting revenue growth of more than 500%. The company posted a loss of 0.11 Canadian dollars a share for fiscal year 2018.

424,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>",Treasury Swings Jump Like It's 2016,"(Bloomberg) -- The calm in Treasury markets has snapped.
A measure of U.S. rates volatility just staged its biggest two-day surge since 2016 as the vanishing spread between short- and long-term borrowing costs -- typically seen as a harbinger of a recession -- intrudes upon the calmest rates market in a generation.
“The stability in U.S. rates over the previous three months has gone the way of the dodo,’’ BMO Capital Markets strategists Jon Hill, Ian Lyngen and Ben Jeffery wrote in a note.
A recently as last week, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s MOVE Index, which tracks implied volatility in the $15.8 trillion Treasury market, had tumbled to a record low. Central banks have pressed the snooze button on cross-asset volatility lately by backing off borrowing cost increases while projecting a stable, low-rate environment.
But the Federal Reserve’s increased dovishness of late might have confirmed market fears of an economic slowdown.
Weak European economic data helped produce an inversion in the three-month, 10-year Treasury yield curve Friday for the first time since 2007. A race for government bonds sent the 10-year yield as low as 2.3754 percent on Monday -- the lowest since December 2017.
“The deeper market pricing of inversion becomes, the stronger the rate-cut signal the market is projecting, and the higher the chances are this could turn into a contraction,” the strategists wrote.
Swings in other asset classes for the two sessions through Monday weren’t nearly as dramatic. The CBOE volatility measure of equities was fairly stable, as was the move by a JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) currency gauge. The Fed’s policy announcement was on March 20.
“That the majority of the price action has been confined thus far to U.S. rates suggests that this is the market which is operating as the release valve for emerging macro pressure,’’ according to the BMO strategists.

425,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",China Scales Back Subsidies for Electric Cars to Spur Innovation,"(Bloomberg) -- China will scale back subsidies on electric vehicles as the industry develops and costs go down, trying to encourage local manufacturers to rely on innovation rather than government assistance to spur sales.
The subsidy for pure battery electric cars with a driving range of 400 kilometers (250 miles) and above will be cut by half, to 25,000 yuan ($3,700) per vehicle from 50,000 yuan, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website Tuesday. To qualify for any subsidy, electric cars need to have a range of at least 250 kilometers, compared with 150 kilometers previously, it said.
The government had previously said it will scale back the subsidies and phase them out completely after 2020, though it hadn’t given details. While financial support for purchases has fueled the rapid growth of China’s electric-car industry, there are also concerns that automakers have become overly reliant on them at the expense of developing new technologies and better vehicles.
The move aims to support “high-quality development of a new-energy automobile industry,” the ministry said.
The finance ministry also urged local governments to remove subsidies on purchases of electric vehicles, including buses and trucks, after a three-month grace period starting Tuesday.
Subsidies have been key to making plug-in hybrids and EVs of companies such as BYD Co., backed by Warren Buffett, more affordable to Chinese consumers and helping the country surpass the U.S. as the world’s biggest market for such vehicles in 2015. On top of what the federal government spends, Chinese cities and provinces separately offer incentives to make electric cars more appealing in a country where automakers from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG to Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. are planning to increase EV offerings.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus shares rose on Tuesday after the European planemaker won a deal worth tens of billions of dollars to sell 300 aircraft to China.
Airbus was up 2.7 percent by 1208 GMT, with the stock having risen nearly 40 percent so far in 2019.
French officials said the deal was worth some 30 billion euros ($34 billion) at catalog prices. Planemakers usually grant significant discounts.
The Chinese order was announced late on Monday, coinciding with a visit to Europe by Chinese President Xi Jinping and matching a China record held by U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA). 
Investment bank  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) kept its ""buy"" rating on Airbus.
""We do not have details of the delivery schedule of this order, but China has been taking about 20-25 percent of Airbus production per year and given the A320 family is sold out at announced production rates out to 2024/25, we believe this increases the probability of Airbus moving to a production rate of 70 per month,"" wrote Citigroup.
That positive view was echoed by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which kept an ""overweight"" rating on Airbus shares.
""Clearly finalization of this order is a positive for Airbus, and continues to underpin strong order book coverage and rising production rates in narrowbody,"" Morgan Stanley said.
The larger-than-expected order, which matches an order for 300 Boeing planes when U.S. Donald Trump visited Beijing in 2017, follows a year-long vacuum of purchases in which China failed to place significant orders amid global trade tensions.
It also comes as the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX has left uncertainty over Boeing's immediate hopes for a major jet order as the result of any warming of U.S.-China trade ties.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Rajat Gupta, one of the most prominent members of the global financial elite until he was convicted of insider trading in 2012, has revealed he was kept in solitary confinement for weeks during his incarceration in an American federal prison.
Gupta, who ran the global management consultants McKinsey for nine years and was on the board of investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), said he was twice placed in a ""special housing unit"" – a euphemism for solitary confinement - at the Devens Correctional Facility in Ayer, Massachusetts. 
The first time was only for a week but the second time he had to spend seven weeks there. And after that, Gupta said, he was transferred to a higher security federal prison on an adjoining site because prison officers decided he wasn't suitable for a camp-type lockup because of his ""poor living skills"". 
There he joined more violent offenders for the final eight months of his time in jail. Altogether, he was locked up for 19 months before being released in January 2016.
India-born Gupta, now 70, disclosed his ordeal in his autobiography, Mind Without Fear, which was published this week, and in an interview with Reuters in New Delhi. 
A representative of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on Gupta's claims.
Gupta said when he was taken to the special housing unit the first time, he was handcuffed, strip-searched, given a special orange uniform to wear, called ""the bad guy"" by prison officers, lost access to almost all his possessions (such as a music player), and denied almost all access to visitors.
On the second occasion, his visitation rights were taken away for 60 days – more than the whole length of the solitary confinement.
Gupta said the first episode of solitary occurred because he bent down to tie his shoe lace just as the prison officer did one of the daily stand-up counts of prisoners. The second because he had created a pillow for his sore back by sewing together two towels and thus created an unauthorized object regarded as contraband.
HINDU HOLY BOOK 
Exercise during those weeks in solitary consisted of walking around a cage thirty feet by 10 feet once a day. There was also the chance of a few muttered greetings to other inmates walking the cage.
""I followed the rules as best I could, but I didn't walk around like a repentant criminal. I felt more like a political prisoner,"" Gupta says in the book of his relatively harsh treatment.
He says it was only by persuading guards not to take away his copy of the ancient Hindu holy book, the Bhagavad Gita, with its teachings on ethical dilemmas and the path to salvation, that helped keep him sane.
Gupta, who was found guilty by a New York jury of providing boardroom secrets he learned at Goldman to hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, still insists he is innocent of the charges under which he was convicted. Rajaratnam was locked up in the same higher security prison as Gupta after being convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy and the two met and even played cards and chess together there.
Gupta said his father was a political prisoner during India's fight for independence from colonial ruler Britain. Ashwini Gupta was locked up repeatedly, beaten in jail until his flesh split open and lost one of his lungs to tuberculosis after being put in the same cell as an infected prisoner, according to Rajat Gupta.
""In many ways our situations could not have been more different – he was jailed for a noble cause and a high-minded ideal; I was jailed for alleged personal gain, for a fabricated white collar-crime and, at most, a careless mistake.""
He said he thinks his father ""would have been proud of the way I behaved in prison"".
But was Gupta himself too proud? And did this make his sentence tougher than it might have been? ""Perhaps,"" he acknowledges.
He said that he never heard his father ""express a hint of bitterness or resentment towards the British"" and Gupta said he was determined to be free of anger towards those whose actions had led to his imprisonment.
In his book, though, Gupta very much divides the world into individuals and organizations who supported him through his roughest days, and those who acted against his interests or simply stopped taking his phone calls.

There were plenty on both sides of the ledger.

A survey showed German consumer morale deteriorated unexpectedly heading into April, suggesting that household spending could weaken in the second quarter of this year.
Airbus rose 1.2 percent, providing the biggest boost to the main European index after the planemaker signed a deal worth tens of billions of dollars to sell 300 aircraft to China.
Leading gains on STOXX was ConvaTec Group Plc, up 6.3 percent after Swedish business daily Dagens Industri said private equity firm EQT could be one of the parties interested in buying the company.
Meanwhile, Ferguson Plc was among the biggest weights, falling 8.7 percent after the world's largest heating and plumbing equipment supplier's half-year ongoing trading profit missed analyst expectations.
Europe's retail sector and personal and household goods sector were the biggest boosts to the market but their gains were offset by losses in banks and tech stocks.
British online supermarket Ocado (LON:OCDO) rose 3.5 percent on partnering with Australia's Coles Group, its fifth major overseas deal in less than 18 months.

British lawmakers on Tuesday wrested control of the parliamentary agenda from the government for a day in a highly unusual bid to find a way through the Brexit impasse after Prime Minister Theresa May's EU divorce deal was rejected again.
Lawmakers will now vote on a range of Brexit options on Wednesday, giving parliament a chance to indicate whether it can agree on a deal with closer ties to Brussels - and then try to push the government in that direction.

Nearly three years after the 2016 EU membership referendum, and four days before Britain was supposed to leave the bloc, it remains still unclear how, when or even if Brexit will take place, with parliament and the nation still bitterly divided.

432,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 05:03AM ET</span>",StockBeat: China Sends an Unsubtle Message Via Airbus,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- There’s nothing subtle about Chinese diplomacy.
President Xi Jinping has inked a mind-boggling $29 billion deal for Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft during a state visit to Paris, France, a show of economic power aimed as much at Washington as at Europe.
The order, for 290 single-aisle planes and 10 A350 wide-bodied aircraft, is much larger than the $18 billion order that was floated by French President Emmanuel Macron when he visited China last year.
Airbus’s shares are up 1.7% on the news and only 2% off the all-time high that they hit earlier in March.
The order appears to disturb the balance that China has traditionally kept in buying from the two duopolists of the aviation industry.
The ostensible reason for that is the problem with Boeing’s 737 MAX, in the wake of two fatal crashes in recent months. China was among the first countries to ground the U.S.-made airplane earlier this month, and China’s demand for new aircraft is so huge and so pressing – Airbus estimates it will need an average of a new airliner or freighter every day for the next 20 years – that it can’t afford to wait on Boeing (NYSE:BA).
But there is a clearly visible subtext. China is also at a difficult point of trade talks with the U.S., its largest trading partner, trying hard to push back against what it sees as aggressive U.S. tactics to rebalance relations between the two. China is trying to conciliate the U.S. by committing to increase its imports of American goods, but Bloomberg reported earlier this month that it’s now considering dropping the 737 MAX from its shopping list. In Beijing’s eyes, doling out largesse to Airbus is a useful reminder to Washington of what U.S. business stands to lose by pushing Beijing too hard.
Elsewhere, European markets have opened mixed. At 05:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.36 points, or 0.1% at 374.68. Germany’s Dax index was down 0.4% (with investors continuing to pile out of Bayer (DE:BAYGN) in the wake of last week’s court verdict against it), while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.1%, supported by news from Westminster on Monday evening that makes a ‘no-deal Brexit’ a touch less likely."

The incident marks the latest crackdown by Japanese authorities over alleged attempts to manipulate prices in the JGB futures market.
The SESC said an employee of UK-based Citigroup Global Markets Limited made buy and sell orders for 10-year JGB futures without the intention to execute. The SESC recommended a penalty of 133 million yen. 
Citigroup said it takes the recommendation seriously. 
""Citi will place the utmost priority on further enhancing governance and internal control to comply with the financial regulations and directives,"" it said in a statement.
The SESC does not itself issue fines, which are ultimately handed down by the Financial Services Agency regulator.

In July the regulator slapped a fine of 218 million yen on a joint venture of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) for trying to manipulate bond future prices.

437,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 02:27AM ET</span>",Citi aims to grow Asia wealth management client base by 10 pct in 2019,"HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) said on Tuesday it planned to grow its Asia Pacific wealth management client base by 10 percent this year, stronger than the 8 percent growth it posted in 2018, as it hires more client advisers and boosts digital offerings.
Citi's regional wealth management business, which is a part of its Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) consumer banking unit, targets clients in Asia Pacific and EMEA with investible assets of between $100,000 and $10 million in 17 markets.
Asia has become the main battleground for global wealth managers, including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), HSBC and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), looking to benefit from surging incomes in countries such as China and India.
Asia Pacific saw total household wealth grow by 3 percent in 2018 from a year ago to $114.6 trillion, making it the largest wealth region globally and putting it ahead of the United States and Europe, according to a Credit Suisse global wealth report.
With $256 billion worth of assets under management in 2017, Citi ranks second in the Asia wealth management league table after Swiss bank UBS, according to data compiled by Asian Private Banker.
""We are confident the investments we have made and continue to make will support double-digit client growth rates in 2019,"" Gonzalo Luchetti, Citi's head of consumer banking for Asia Pacific and EMEA, said in a statement.
Growth will be driven by increased investments the bank plans to make to bolster the headcount for client relationship managers as well as the usage of digital technology to offer wealth advice, it said.
Citi also expects its China wealth management client base to grow faster in 2019 than last year, at more than 30 percent, the bank's country chief said in January, despite a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares drifted higher on Tuesday after two days of losses as U.S. 10-year Treasury yields edged up, but the outlook remained murky as investors weighed the odds of whether the U.S. economy is in danger of slipping into recession.
European and U.S. equity markets were expected to follow Asia's lead, spreadbetters showed, with London's FTSE futures up 0.3 percent and E-minis for the S&P 500 tacking on one-third of a percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rebounded 0.2 percent after losing 1.4 percent in the previous session.
Australian shares were flat, while Japan's Nikkei jumped 2.1 percent after recording its biggest drop since late December on Monday.
China's blue-chip CSI300 bucked the trend, giving up early gains to fall 0.7 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was slightly lower.
Wall Street shares were little changed on Monday with the S&P 500 ending with a small loss of 0.08 percent. (N)
Investors have been spooked by sharp falls in U.S. bond yields and an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which is widely seen as an indicator of an economic recession.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edged up to 2.442 percent, having shed 5 basis points on Monday.
It has fallen about 17.5 basis points since the Federal Reserve last week ditched projections for raising rates this year and announced the end of its balance sheet reduction, citing signs of an economic slowdown. 
""The U.S. yield curve continues to invert,"" said Michael Every, Hong Kong-based senior Asia-Pacific strategist at Rabobank.
""This is not a healthy sign, as bond-market watchers should know and equity-market obsessives should rapidly learn,"" he said in a note. ""How much further will this run before we see markets starting to do the same?""
The 10-year yield fell below the yield for three-month bills on Friday for the first time since 2007, inverting the yield curve.
San Francisco Fed researchers have said that the difference in those two maturities was the most useful for forecasting a recession.
""I think the market has overreacted to the yield curve inversion because the San Francisco Fed has said it is the most reliable indicator,"" said Hiroshi Nakamura, senior manager of investment planning at Mitsui Life.
""I expect some correction to the latest rally in bonds. For now we have to see this week's auctions,"" he said.
FACTORING IN A RATE CUT
The Treasury Department will sell $113 billion in coupon-bearing supply this week, including $40 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday, $41 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday and $32 billion in seven-year notes on Thursday.
Investors will also be watching Fed policymakers scheduled to speak on Tuesday.
U.S. economic growth could be ""pretty weak"" in the first quarter but will likely much closer to 2-2.5 percent for the rest of the year, but a central bank pause is the responsible thing to do, Fed Bank of Boston president and CEO Eric Rosengren said at a conference in Hong Kong.
Fed funds rate futures are now fully factoring in a rate cut later this year, with about an 80 percent chance of a move priced in by September.
In the currency market, the fall in U.S. yields undermined the dollar's yield attraction.
The euro stood at $1.1305, having gained a tad on Monday after Germany's IFO Institute said its business climate index rose to 99.6, beating a consensus forecast of 98.5 and ending six consecutive months of decline.
The dollar was a shade higher at 110.14 yen, having hit a 1 1/2-month low of 109.70 on Monday.
""While dollar/yen hasn't fallen greatly and things aren't in panic mode, a sense of caution about where things are going has taken hold,"" said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan currency and equity strategist at Bank Of America Merrill Lynch.
The British pound stood at $1.3180, erasing small gains made after lawmakers voted to wrest control of the Brexit process from Prime Minister Theresa May's government for a day.
May said on Monday there was not yet enough support to put her Brexit deal to a third vote in parliament.
Oil prices hovered below their recent four-month peaks, as the prospect of tighter U.S. crude supply was offset by concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth.
U.S. crude futures traded at $59.26 per barrel, up three-quarters of a percent on the day, a tad below Thursday's high of $60.39, its highest since mid-November.
Brent futures were up 0.2 percent at $67.37.

Gold was down a third of a percent at $1,317.60, but not far off a near one-month peak of $1,324.60 scaled during the previous session.

440,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 01:34AM ET</span>",Stalled Aramco IPO sets back deal-making at U.S. subsidiary Motiva,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Erwin Seba
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's delayed initial public offering is sidelining grand North American expansion plans at its U.S. refining subsidiary Motiva Enterprises LLC, people familiar with the matter said, at a time when its rivals grew their market share. 
After dissolving a partnership with Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC two years ago, Motiva set out to rebuild and boost market share in the Americas. It evaluated deals for  LyondellBasell Industries  (NYSE:LYB) NV's Houston refinery, with the Caribbean government of Curacao, and considered expanding its sole U.S. oil refinery.
But none of those came to pass as the company feared it might pay too much for acquisitions or become too exposed to disruptions by expanding its sole U.S. refinery, the people said. As a result, Motiva has slipped to 11th place from ninth among the top U.S. refiners by capacity since striking out on its own, according to U.S. government data, as other refiners inked deals to take advantage of the shale boom. 
(For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2HxT1wn)
""They were very handicapped by the fact that the kingdom was contemplating the IPO,"" a refining consultant to Motiva said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the talks were private. ""What they told us was 'until this gets done or resolved, we cannot do anything.'"" 
Saudi Aramco did not want Motiva to enter deals that could hamstring its IPO or raise questions about its strategy, leaving Motiva unable to expand, the people said. 
Plans for the Aramco IPO were shelved last year for the foreseeable future, sources told Reuters in 2018. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in January the kingdom would still go ahead, and list the company by 2021.
A Motiva executive said the company has not given up on increasing its U.S. processing might. 
""We don't comment on anything specifically, but we do want to increase our refining capacity,"" said Todd Fredin, the company's head of supply, trading and logistics.
A spokeswoman for Motiva declined to comment on past or potential acquisitions and expansion plans. Saudi Aramco declined to comment.
Vision 2030, the Saudi Crown Prince's signature economic program designed to lessen the kingdom's reliance on oil, also undercuts the need for U.S. expansion, said Andrew Lipow, president of refining consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates. 
""They are in the process of trying to look toward 2030, and adding assets outside of Saudi Arabia"" is not as critical anymore, he said. ""A refinery in the United States doesn't create jobs in Saudi Arabia."" 
Rivals have used acquisitions and expansion to boost their share of the U.S. market. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) last year acquired the fifth largest U.S. refiner Andeavor for $23 billion. 
This year,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) embarked on a multi-billion dollar refinery expansion and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) added a second Gulf Coast refinery as the two largest U.S. oil companies take advantage of record production out of Texas shale fields. The United States is now the world's top oil producer, pumping more than 12 million barrels a day. 
(For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2VIJTbg) 
""Economy of scale is very important for refiners,"" said Joseph Israel, chief executive of Houston-based refiner Par Petroleum, whose parent last year acquired a Tacoma, Washington, plant and new refining capacity in Hawaii. ""The right kind of growth typically supports efficiency, commercial flexibility, and visibility in the market."" 
Motiva emerged from a Texaco-Saudi venture formed in 1988 as a U.S. outlet for Saudi crude. Last year, Saudi exports to the U.S. fell to 949,000 barrels per day (bpd), only the second time that figure has been less than 1 million bpd since that year, according to U.S. Energy Department data, as the United States gets more barrels from Canada than OPEC producers. 
Motiva can process up to 603,000 barrels of oil a day at its Port Arthur, Texas refinery, the largest in the United States. The plant, which processes U.S. and other crudes, does not disclose revenue. 
Last April, during a reception for the Crown Prince, the company said it was considering expanding the Texas refinery by up to 900,000 bpd capacity, which would have made it the largest plant in the world, surpassing a Reliance Industries plant in India. 
The project was abandoned two months later to avoid concentrating at one U.S. Gulf Coast site, Motiva said. It has pledged to explore adding between 1 million and 1.5 million bpd capacity, but has not said when or where that would happen. 
In February, Motiva ended talks with Curacao over a request to operate its 335,000 barrel-per-day Isla refinery and storage terminal. Those discussions ended after the Isla refinery's supervisory board in January disclosed a corruption probe into selection process for a new operator. 
""They didn't want to be dragged into a corruption scandal – it was fraught,"" said another refining consultant familiar with the Curacao talks. 
Before its split from Shell in 2017, Motiva weighed buying LyondellBasell's 264,000 bpd Houston refinery to replace plants it was turning over to Shell. Motiva pulled out of the sale process fearing it could be seen as overpaying for the plant after outbidding other refiners, said a person familiar with the talks. The plant was taken off the market after no bid reached Lyondell's desired minimum price, the person said. 
The company has shifted at Saudi Aramco's direction toward petrochemicals. The U.S. operation recently gained its parent's approval to build a $5 billion steam cracker to produce ethylene, a plastics building block, that would start operations by late 2022, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.
Recently, it requested proposals from investment banks to evaluate its options should CITGO Petroleum Corp, the U.S. arm of Venezuela's state oil company, go on the market, according to two people familiar with the matter. 

""Motiva has been allowed its freedom and is heading in all directions at once,"" said the person familiar with Motiva's Curacao talks, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""There's initiative fatigue.""

441,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 01:05AM ET</span>",Samsung Elec flags earnings miss as chip prices slide,"By Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd said on Tuesday first-quarter profit would likely miss market expectations due to falls in chip prices and slowing demand for display panels, in an unprecedented statement ahead of its earnings guidance.
The announcement came after the Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier and rival told shareholders last week that slack global economic growth and softer demand for memory chips, its core business, would weigh on operations in 2019.
""The company expects the scope of price declines in main memory chip products to be larger than expected,"" Samsung said in a regulatory filing pre-empting its earnings guidance due next week.
Samsung did not elaborate on the purpose of its filing. A company official confirmed the global leader in smartphones, televisions and computer chips had not previously provided comment before its official earnings estimate.
The firm was forecast to post a 7.2 trillion won ($6.4 billion) operating profit for the January-March period, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, more than 50 percent below the 15.6 trillion won recorded in the same period a year ago.
Its sales were expected to fall to 53.7 trillion won from 60.6 trillion won a year ago, Refinitiv shows.
""Inventories piling up on its memory chip side and the weak performance of its display panels business due to bad sales of Apple's iPhones are hurting profitability for Samsung,"" said Lee Won-sik, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities.
DRAM chip prices fell more than 20 percent on average in the first quarter, according to DRAMeXchange, a unit of Trendforce that traces memory chip prices.
Daiwa Securities forecast Samsung's display panel division to swing to an operating loss of 620 billion won in the first quarter, while the semiconductor business's operating profit would shrink. 
RECOVERY TIPPED
Uncertainties over U.S.-China trade tensions and China's sluggish economy are clouding the outlook for global electronics makers, analysts say.
Chipmakers in particular have been hit hard by a glut in the global semiconductor industry triggered by weakening smartphone sales and falling investment from data center companies.
Samsung told shareholders at its annual general meeting last week that sales of memory products would likely revive in the second half of the year after a tough first half. Investors also took heart when U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) forecast a recovery in the memory chip market around the middle of the year.
Daiwa Securities on Tuesday reaffirmed a buy rating on Samsung, saying it expected demand for memory chips and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels to improve from the second half of 2019.
Samsung Electronics shares were down 0.2 percent as of 0237 GMT while the broader market was 0.3 percent higher. 
""Samsung is giving a signal to the market so that investors can be prepared and there will be no surprise when Samsung posts its first-quarter earning guidance next week,"" said Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management that owns Samsung Elec shares.
""Its shares are not reacting a lot, though, as concerns over its first quarter have been reflected.""

442,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 12:22AM ET</span>","China stocks rally on investor optimism, but corporate earnings lag","By Luoyan Liu and Patturaja Murugaboopathy 
SHANGHAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - A sharp rally in Chinese stocks this year has been driven more by investor optimism than fundamentals, based on an analysis of corporate earnings estimates in an economy expanding at its slowest pace in 28 years.
As the 2018 earnings reporting season begins for mainland firms, analysts are issuing more downgrades than upgrades for corporate earnings, even as they hope that China's stimulus plans for the economy kick in. 
That implies that investors who have pushed the market up 22 percent this year are hoping for a turnaround in earnings, which often lags share prices.

(Graphic: Asia's estimated earnings for 2019 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2USI63y)
China has promised billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending to help businesses and protect jobs. Hopes of a deal with the United States to end a year-long trade war have also boosted stock prices.
Beijing has vowed to use more policy tools to ensure the economy grows within a targeted range of 6.0 to 6.5 percent.
""The impact from Beijing's tax cuts and expenses reductions in 2019 will be between 150-400 billion yuan ($22.37-59.64 billion) on the A-share market, accounting for 4-9 percent of their net profits,"" investment bank China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC) said in report.
Those supportive measures will systematically improve the profitability of Chinese companies, CICC said. 
(Graphic: China's industrial profits shrank in Dec - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HETCMK)
As companies this month release their annual results for 2018, investors need to see prospects for improved profitability to push the market any higher.
""It's a misperception that solid fundamentals are not needed for a bull run, which is now in its first stage, and the signal for the second stage will be earnings growth recovery after bottoming out,"" Haitong Securities wrote in report. 
(Graphic: Shanghai firms revenue and profit growth - https://tmsnrt.rs/2CyoQRF)
The rebound has been led by the financial sector, which President Xi Jinping has labeled a key part of China's core competitiveness and Beijing has vowed to liberalize further.
Some financial firms have posted hefty earnings. Ping An Insurance Group said it would return up to 10 billion yuan to shareholders through its first share buyback after a forecast-beating jump in annual profit. 
Yet estimates for the sector have not been marked higher. 
(Graphic: China MSCI financials - https://tmsnrt.rs/2USUMr3)
Consumer firms are also expected to gain from measures to boost consumption. Liquor makers have been pushed to record highs by investors, including foreigners who have long favored firms with strong brand names and solid profits. 
Shares of Fuling Zhacai, dubbed one of China's ""super brands"", hit a new high after it reported strong profit growth in 2018 and expected a 26 percent revenue gain in 2019. 
(Graphic: China MSCI consumer discretionary - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UXX0FS)
Investors are also tracking mainland-listed tech firms as Beijing seeks to reduce dependence on foreign technology to counter U.S. curbs on China's tech advancement. 
Xiaomi-backed TCL Corp reported strong 2018 earnings, sending its stock up nearly 70 percent this year. 
(Graphic: MSCI China tech - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HFL6xp)
Market participants believe a new technology board in Shanghai will help improve the valuations for tech firms already listed on the A-share market. 
Shenzhen's Nasdaq-style start-up board index Chinext has soared 32 percent this year. That compares with a 15 percent rise for Nasdaq in the same period.

Still, given how far some companies have missed their earnings' estimates in 2018, analysts are reluctant to upgrade their forecasts until they see a decisive turn in profitability.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) PLC Chief Executive Bill Winters said fears over a slowdown in China's economic growth and the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade tensions are ""receding a bit"".
""China has taken modest actions to re-stimulate the economy,"" Winters said at the  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
""We feel quite good about China,"" he said.
Since July 2018, the United States has imposed duties on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, including $50 billion in technology and industrial goods at 25 percent and $200 billion in other products at 10 percent.
China has hit back with tariffs on about $110 billion worth of U.S. goods, including soybeans and other commodities.
The eight-month trade war between the world's two largest economies has raised costs, roiled financial markets, shrunk U.S. farm exports and disrupted manufacturing supply chains.
StanChart, which makes most of its revenue in Asia, has seen its fortunes slump as restructuring under Winters repaired a balance sheet hit by excessive lending in the previous decade, but left the bank struggling to lift profit.
Last month, the bank unveiled plans to double returns and dividends in three years by cutting $700 million in costs and boosting income, even though it missed its previous targets in tough market conditions.

The 150-year-old group's latest plans coincide with a risk of a slowdown in its core emerging markets due to the trade war as well as economic uncertainties in China and Britain, two of its main markets.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A federal judge in San Francisco dismissed for the second time a securities fraud lawsuit brought by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shareholders alleging that the company made misleading comments about the production status of its Model 3. 
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer sided with Tesla, granting the electric vehicle company dismissal of the lawsuit brought in October 2017. Breyer dismissed the original lawsuit in August but allowed plaintiffs to file an amended one.
The lawsuit sought class action status for shareholders who bought Tesla stock between May 3, 2016 through Nov. 1, 2017.
It said shareholders bought ""artificially inflated"" shares because Musk and other executives misled them with bullish statements about the production ramp of the Model 3, failing to disclose that the company was ""woefully unprepared"" for the vehicle's production.
Tesla argued in its defense that it had been forthcoming about challenges with Model 3 production, including repeated statements by Musk that Tesla was undergoing ""production hell.""

Breyer wrote that the allegations of fraud ignored Tesla's ""repeated warnings about Model 3 production risks.""

447,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 10:01PM ET</span>",Ackman's fund zooms ahead as he casts himself as corporate helpmate,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - For months, activist investor William Ackman promised to rebuild his record. Now he has some numbers to prove it.
Since Jan. 1, Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Holdings has gained 31.9 percent, making it the best start to a year in the firm's 15-year history, Ackman wrote in a letter released on Monday.
More importantly, Ackman laid out how his hedge fund is essentially transforming itself into a holding company that owns stakes in public companies and offers a helping hand to struggling management teams to resurrect once-strong returns.
""We attribute our improved performance to initiatives that we have implemented over the last 18 months,"" he wrote.
With his own transformation on firmer ground, Ackman said he can again help others. ""Pershing Square, as a large influential investor with a track record for successful turnarounds, can provide management with the required runway and necessary long-term backing to succeed.""
For years Ackman earned billions for himself and clients while growing Pershing Square Capital Management into a roughly $20 billion firm. But in 2015 a soured bet on drug company Valeant paved the way for three years of losses, when investors ran for the exits, shrinking assets to $8 billion.
Now Ackman's publicly traded fund, Pershing Square Holdings, makes up roughly three-quarters of the firm's $8 billion in assets and the capital is stable because investors have to sell to another investor before exiting.
Permanent capital will help improve his own returns over time and let him become a helpmate to struggling companies, Ackman wrote.
To get here, Ackman went back to his roots and last year laid off staff, told his investor relations executives to stop raising new capital and re-dedicated himself to researching investment ideas instead of jetting around the world to visit with clients.
Ackman and his colleagues now own more than 20 percent of Pershing Square Holdings' outstanding shares, he wrote.
His business, he explained to anyone who does not know about investments in companies like Chipotle and Canadian Pacific , is buying companies at a discount and helping them flourish again.
Over the last months, Ackman, once a fixture at conferences and on television, adopted a more low-key style, which he is translating to portfolio companies as well.
He said he has a lot of influence but prefers to use it ""sparingly."" ""Occasionally, we will ask a question, share an idea, or raise an issue. Most of the time, our CEOs rarely hear from us,"" Ackman wrote, saying they call him. ""We view our job as oversight, not day-to-day management.""

An announcement on the acquisition of Hong Kong Express Airways Ltd. is expected to be made as early as today, the report said, adding that the sources didn’t elaborate on details including financial terms. Cathay shares rose as much as 3.3 percent to HK$13.76 in early trading in Hong Kong.
A Cathay representative declined to comment. Cathay said March 5 that it’s in “active discussions” with HNA Group Co. about an acquisition involving Hong Kong Express. HNA declined to comment.
Cathay is embracing a market segment it previously rejected, partly because demand on some of its routes has switched to budget carriers. The Asia Pacific region’s burgeoning market will probably see the largest increase in air traffic worldwide, with almost 4 billion passenger journeys expected in the next two decades.
Cathay is on the last leg of a three-year transformation program to turn its fortunes around amid increasing competition from China and budget carriers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Attorney Michael Avenatti, who represented adult film star Stormy Daniels in her legal battles with U.S. President Donald Trump, was charged on Monday with what prosecutors said was an attempt to ""shake down""  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) for over $20 million.
Avenatti, who was also hit with separate embezzlement and fraud charges in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, was arrested in New York.
A federal magistrate judge ordered Avenatti released on $300,000 bond during a hearing in U.S. District Court in New York. A subdued Avenatti, appeared in the courtroom wearing a dark gray suit, sitting with federal public defenders. 
""When due process occurs I will be fully exonerated and justice will prevail,"" Avenatti said outside the court following the hearing. 
Prosecutors said Avenatti and another lawyer, who was not named in court papers, met with Nike's attorneys on March 19 and told them they had a client, a former amateur coach, who had evidence Nike employees had bribed top high school players to play for Nike-sponsored college teams.
The other lawyer, an unnamed co-conspirator, was identified by The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing sources, as high-profile Los Angeles attorney and CNN contributor Mark Geragos.
Geragos did not respond to a request by Reuters for comment. A spokeswoman for CNN said Geragos was no longer with the network. 
According to the criminal complaint, Avenatti told Nike he would go public unless it paid his client $1.5 million and hired him and the other lawyer to conduct an internal investigation for between $15 million and $25 million. 
Avenatti also offered to accept a $22.5 million payment for his silence, prosecutors said.
A former executive at Nike rival athletic shoe maker Adidas (DE:ADSGN) was recently convicted in federal court in Manhattan of participating in a similar scheme, part of a sweeping probe by prosecutors of corruption surrounding the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The case has ensnared several prominent basketball coaches.
In one call, Avenatti threatened, ""I'll go take ten billion dollars off your client's market cap ... I'm not fucking around,"" according to the complaint.
Geragos, who has represented celebrities such as Michael Jackson and Winona Ryder, is defending the actor Jussie Smollett, who is charged with falsely reporting he was the victim of a racially motivated attack in Chicago.
It was not clear why Geragos has not been charged in the Nike case.
""OLD-FASHIONED SHAKE-DOWN""
The charges came shortly after Avenatti said on Twitter he would hold a news conference on Tuesday to reveal ""a major high school/college basketball scandal"" reaching ""the highest levels of Nike.""
""A suit and tie does not mask the fact that, at its core, this was an old-fashioned shakedown,"" Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, told a news conference.
Nike said in a statement it ""will not be extorted"" and alerted investigators to Avenatti's demands immediately.
Federal prosecutors in California unveiled separate charges against Avenatti on Monday, accusing him of misusing a client's $1.6 million settlement to pay for his own expenses as well as those for his coffee business.
He was also charged with defrauding a Mississippi bank of $4.1 million in loans by submitting false tax returns for 2011-2013 that inflated his income.
Avenatti faces up to 30 years in prison on the most serious charge in California and up to 20 years for the top charge in New York.
He gained international notoriety for representing Daniels, the porn star whom Trump is accused of paying off during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about an alleged affair. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. 

Daniels, 48, who is no longer represented by Avenatti, said she was ""saddened but not shocked"" by his arrest, adding she fired him after learning he had acted ""dishonestly"" with her.

451,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 07:17PM ET</span>",Airbus wins China order for 300 jets as Xi visits France,"By Marine Pennetier
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus signed a deal worth tens of billions of dollars on Monday to sell 300 aircraft to China, coinciding with a visit to Europe by Chinese President Xi Jinping and matching a China record held by U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).
The deal between Airbus and China's state buying agency, China Aviation Supplies Holding Company, which regularly coordinates headline-grabbing deals during diplomatic visits, will include 290 A320-family jets and 10 A350 wide-body jets.
French officials said the deal was worth some 30 billion euros at catalog prices. Planemakers usually grant significant discounts.
The larger-than-expected order, which matches an order for 300 Boeing planes when U.S. Donald Trump visited Beijing in 2017, follows a year-long vacuum of purchases in which China failed to place significant orders amid global trade tensions.
It also comes as the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX has left uncertainty over Boeing's immediate hopes for a major jet order as the result of any warming of U.S.-China trade ties.
There was no evidence of any direct connection between the Airbus deal and Sino-U.S. tensions or Boeing fleet problems, but China watchers say Beijing has a history of sending diplomatic signals or playing off suppliers through state aircraft deals.
""The conclusion of a big (aviation) contract ... is an important step forward and an excellent signal in the current context,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a joint address with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. 
The United States and China are edging towards a possible deal to ease a months-long tariff row and a deal involving as many as 200 to 300 Boeing jets had until recently been expected as part of the possible rapprochement.
LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP
China was also the first to ground the newest version of Boeing's workhorse 737 model earlier this month following a deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash, touching off a series of regulatory actions worldwide.
Asked if negotiations had accelerated as a result of the Boeing grounding or other issues, Airbus planemaking chief and designated chief executive Guillaume Faury told reporters, ""This is a long-term relationship with our Chinese partners that evolves over time; it is a strong sign of confidence.""
China has become a key hunting ground for Airbus and its leading rival Boeing, thanks to surging travel demand.
But whether Airbus or Boeing is involved, analysts say diplomatic deals frequently contain a mixture of new demand, repeats of older orders and credits against future deals, meaning the immediate impact is not always clear.
One industry source said the latest Airbus order included Chinese government confirmation of an unspecified number of orders already counted on Airbus' books but with the names of customers undisclosed. Airbus could not be reached for comment.
The outlook has also been complicated by Beijing’s desire to grow its own industrial champions and, more recently for Boeing, the U.S.-China trade war.
French President Macron unexpectedly failed to clinch an Airbus order for 184 planes during a trip to China in early 2018 and the two sides have been working to salvage it.

Industry sources have said the year's delay in Airbus negotiations, as well as a buying freeze during the U.S. tariff row, created latent demand for jets to feed China’s growth.

After the bell, KB Home (NYSE:KBH) will issue results.
Analysts forecast a profit of 25 cents per share on revenue of about $832 million.
Homebuilding shares were strong today, thanks to falling U.S. bond yields that could lower borrowing costs and boost homebuying demand.
3. API Inventories to Fall Again?
A fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday will give traders a window into U.S. crude stockpile levels after data last week showed inventories fell for the second-straight week.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles fell by 2.133 million barrels for the week ended March 22.
Crude oil futures fell 0.4% to settle at $58.82 a barrel today, but gains were limited by concerns that slowing global growth would weigh on oil demand.

TORONTO (Reuters) -  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM) won the support of at least two key investors for its $10 billion takeover of Goldcorp Inc on Monday, after offering to sweeten the deal with an 88-cent-per-share special dividend if shareholders approve the transaction.
The immediate cash payment would represent a portion of the savings from a separate agreement with Barrick Gold Corp, Newmont said in a regulatory statement.
Newmont investors who had earlier protested the terms of the deal, saying Goldcorp shareholders benefited too much from it, commended the dividend payment and withdrew their opposition. 
""Although the dividend is small, it is a step in the right direction,"" Paulson & Co, which last week said it would vote against the deal, wrote in an emailed statement. ""Since the Newmont board and other significant shareholders are supportive of the revised terms, we will no longer oppose the transaction.” 
Newmont's friendly bid to buy Goldcorp to create the world's biggest gold producer preceded the agreement with rival Barrick to establish a joint venture combining their operations in Nevada. Newmont offered 0.328 of its shares and 2 cents for each Goldcorp share.
Van Eck International Investors, which said last week that Newmont's takeover offer transferred to Goldcorp shareholders too much of $4.7 billion in synergies from the Barrick venture, also expressed its support for the deal on Monday. 
""We're very pleased with Newmont's decision,"" said Joe Foster, portfolio manager at Van Eck, Newmont's third-biggest shareholder. ""Companies always claim they're going to create synergies. It's great to see Newmont putting their money where their mouth is and giving us a payout up front.""
In an investor presentation earlier this month, Newmont said Goldcorp shareholders would get $600 million of the pre-tax synergies from the joint venture with Barrick.
""If one assumes this dividend payment of $469 million reflects the after-tax value of the JV that would have been previously shared with Goldcorp shareholders, it would appear to be fair,"" Josh Wolfson, managing director of metals and mining at Desjardins Securities, said by email. 
Goldcorp shares jumped as much as 3.7 percent and closed up 2.7 percent at C$14.9 on Monday in Toronto, erasing most of Friday's 2.9 percent loss. Newmont climbed 1.2 percent to $34.90, its highest close in a month in New York trading.
""In the discussions I've had with a number of our large, long-term shareholders this morning, they're quite pleased with this outcome and are supportive of it,"" Newmont Chief Executive Gary Goldberg told Reuters on Monday. 
Goldcorp said in a separate statement it supported the special dividend. 

Also, Goldcorp said proxy advisory firm ISS recommended on Monday that its shareholders support Newmont's takeover offer when they vote on April 4. Newmont shareholders will vote on April 11.

455,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 05:06PM ET</span>","S&P 500 slips with Apple, lingering fears on global growth","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 Index ended a choppy session slightly lower on Monday as worries about a slowdown in global economic growth lingered and as Apple Inc shares fell after the company unveiled its video streaming service.
Indexes moved between negative and positive territory throughout the session, with investors keeping their eyes on the U.S. Treasury market.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell to their lowest levels since December 2017, while the yield curve between three-month bills and 10-year notes inverted further as investors continued to assess last week's dovish pivot by the Federal Reserve.
The Fed flagged an expected slowdown in the economy last week and decided against raising interest rates this year.
The yield curve inversion, if it holds, is seen by some as an indicator that a recession is likely in one to two years. Ten-year notes were last yielding about 2.4 percent. 
The S&P 500 financial index ended down 0.4 percent, falling for a fifth straight day, its longest losing streak this year. 
""We went from people worried about a 4 percent (yield on the) 10-year and inflation, and now everyone is worried about a recession and rates going lower. So that's affecting the tone,"" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer, North Star Investment Management Corp, Chicago. 
The Dow ended higher, helped by a 2.3 percent gain in Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co after the planemaker said it would brief pilots and regulators this week on software and training updates for its 737 MAX aircraft, with Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar Airways expressing confidence in the company despite a recent fatal crash.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.2 percent and were the biggest drag on indexes. The iPhone maker unveiled its long-awaited Apple TV+ original content streaming service and Apple TV Channels subscription service, joining a crowded market for streaming options.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.51 points, or 0.06 percent, to 25,516.83, the S&P 500 lost 2.35 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,798.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.13 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,637.54.
Investors largely shrugged off Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report that President Donald Trump's campaign did not collude with Russia.
The report left unresolved the issue of whether Trump obstructed justice by undermining the investigations that have dogged his presidency.

456,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 04:56PM ET</span>","Oklahoma top court clears way for Purdue, J&J, Teva to face opioid trial","By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Oklahoma's top court on Monday declined to delay a landmark trial set for May in a multibillion-dollar lawsuit accusing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and two other drugmakers of helping fuel an opioid abuse and overdose epidemic in the state.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision was a win for the state's attorney general, whose case is set to be the first to face trial of roughly 2,000 lawsuits nationally seeking to hold opioid manufacturers responsible for contributing to the epidemic.
Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter's 2017 lawsuit accuses Purdue, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) & Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd of engaging in deceptive marketing that downplayed the risks of addiction associated with opioid pain drugs while overstating their benefits.
The companies deny wrongdoing. They had sought to delay the May 28 trial to Sept. 16, citing the need to review records the state belatedly turned over that could be critical to their defense. The state is seeking over $20 billion in damages.
The trial delay bid came as Purdue, owned by members of the wealthy Sackler family, was exploring filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to address potential liabilities stemming from the lawsuits, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.
Purdue did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. After the trial judge declined on March 8 to delay the trial, Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue denied that his ruling would have any affect on whether it files for bankruptcy.
""We appreciate the quick action taken by the court and for not rewarding the defendants with more time for a problem of their own making,"" Hunter said in a statement.
J&J and Teva did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Opioids, including prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The epidemic has prompted lawsuits by state and local governments accusing Purdue and other drugmakers of contributing to the crisis. 

More than 1,600 lawsuits have been consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has pushed for a settlement ahead of the trial before him in October. Other cases, including Oklahoma's, are pending in state courts.

The S&P 500 lost 0.08%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.06% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.07%.
U.S. government yields extended the rout from last week as risk sentiment continued to be a challenge even as analysts suggested recent moves lower in risk assets were overblown.
The outlook for risk assets remained “quite bright in an environment of gradually stronger global growth,” Goldman Sachs said.
The 3-Month and 10-Year Treasury yields spread turned negative last week, raising fears a recession may be on the horizon.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.2%, adding to the malaise in the broader market despite the tech giant unveiling a host of subscription services across multiple sectors, including gaming, news, payments and original content.
Apple unveiled details about its widely anticipated streaming TV service, Apple TV+, which will be ad-free and include the tech giant's original content as it seeks to complete with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AMZN). Apple TV+ will bundled with content from other providers including HBO, Showtime and CBS All Access and allow DirectTV and Hulu users to access channels through Apple TV app.
But the company did not release pricing for its streaming services, with an update expected in the fall.

460,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 04:20PM ET</span>",Treasuries Rally Gains Steam as Full Fed Cut Priced In for 2019,"(Bloomberg) -- A global rush to buy sovereign debt kept on going in Treasuries Monday, with bond traders increasing wagers that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates later this year.
Treasury 10-year yields fell as low as 2.3754 percent on Monday, touching the lowest level since December 2017 and moving toward the biggest two-day slide since January. The push lower came amid a continued repricing of the Fed’s policy outlook, with overnight index swaps showing that 25 basis points worth of easing are expected by the central bank’s October meeting.
Investors scrambling to cover bets against Treasuries may be behind Monday’s move, according to BMO Capital Markets strategist Jon Hill.
“The price action itself is the story,” Hill said. “It’s a combination of stops and capitulation of the remaining short base in the front end.”
The 10-year yield has also fallen below the effective fed funds rate -- the overnight benchmark targeted by the U.S. central bank, which currently stands around 2.41 percent. The market is now indicating around 8 basis points of cuts priced into the Fed’s June meeting, and a full quarter-point cut by the end of this year, based on overnight index swaps.
The yield spread between 3-month and 10-year securities, often used as an indicator of recession risk, last week flipped for the first time in more than a decade and Monday’s price moves drove it even further below zero.
Positioning was one of the driving forces behind Friday’s rally, which saw Treasuries grind higher across the curve after weak German manufacturing data reignited global growth concerns.
“There is nothing driving the markets today news-wise other than inertia,” said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research. “The market is reacting to itself.”

BOSTON (Reuters) - Texas Pacific Land Trust, one of the biggest private landowners in Texas, on Monday took a first step in fighting back against a large investor which is seeking to install its own trustee and begin selling off the firm's portfolio.
Texas Pacific plans to postpone by two weeks the date of a special meeting where shareholders will vote to fill a vacant trustee spot, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The meeting to replace Maurice Meyer III, one of three trustees who resigned his office earlier this year and died on March 24, will be on May 22.
The record date remains unchanged at March 28.
The proxy contest illustrates how even strongly performing companies can run afoul of activist investors at a time both experienced corporate agitators and newcomers are pushing corporations to perform better to help boost their own returns.
There are currently around a dozen activist campaigns focused on U.S. energy stocks, as shareholders - buffeted by years of sub-standard returns versus other areas of the economy - seek remedies from changes to management pay and cost-cutting, to the sale of parts or all of the company.
In this case, the activists hope to cash in on excitement around the Permian basin, which covers Western Texas and parts of Eastern New Mexico and which has been the center of the U.S. shale revolution.
Texas Pacific wants shareholders elect an independent trustee. Horizon Kinetics and its partners will urge shareholders to back Eric Oliver, president of hedge fund SoftVest, L.P., according to a regulatory filing.
""The postponement is intended to provide the Trustees with sufficient time to consider the nomination notice,"" a lawyer for Texas Pacific said.
Horizon Kinetics, a New York-based money manager, is working as a group with SoftVest and others, according to one filing and said in another filing that it is looking into ways to ""maximize the value"" of its shares. 
The group wants to convert Texas Pacific, which has been operating since 1888, into a Delaware corporation subject to modern governance principles, to establish an experienced team around its water business and be more transparent.
Texas Pacific has a market capitalization of $5.6 billion and its stock price has climbed 482 percent over five years, gaining 36 percent since Jan. 1, 2019. It controls roughly 900,000 acres of land.
Roughly 23 percent is owned by Horizon Kinetics and roughly 60 percent is owned by retail investors.

462,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 04:10PM ET</span>","Apple spotlights services with TV, gaming and credit card offerings","By Stephen Nellis and Lisa Richwine
CUPERTINO, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc attempted to reintroduce itself on Monday as an entertainment and financial services company that also makes iPhones as it launched a streaming television service, a credit card and an online gaming arcade.
The world's second-most valuable technology company lifted the curtain on a television and movie service called Apple TV+ that will stream original television shows and movies to a television-watching app for users of its 1.4 billion gadgets worldwide, as well as owners of smart TVs and other devices.
But Apple, known in the tech industry for keeping its products secret until they are finished, left out key pricing details for several of its new services, unnerving investors and sending its shares down slightly.
The move could be seen as a first step to challenging streaming video leaders Netflix and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), although Apple is taking a different approach by offering paid ""channels"" from HBO, Starz and Showtime alongside its own content. 
Its revamped app for subscribing to channels from others will come out in May, but Apple's own original shows will not arrive until autumn, with pricing not yet announced. Apple said both its TV+ shows and the new version of the TV app will be available in more than 100 countries.
Apple also introduced a credit card, a video game arcade, and added hundreds of magazines to its news app at an event at its Cupertino, California, headquarters. 
As Apple struggles with saturated markets and sales of its iPhone fall, the company is turning more of its attention to services that provide regular subscription revenue. 
Hollywood celebrities helped debut the revamped television offering. Apple has commissioned programming from Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg. 
Throughout the presentation, Apple executives stressed privacy protections for consumers as they shop and consume content across a range of Apple phones, iPads or other hardware. 
They also emphasized content that would appeal to young audiences, potentially setting the stage for a rivalry with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. Winfrey announced a global book club.
The company, second only to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) in market value among tech giants, led off the event with an announcement that its free news app will now come in a paid-subscription version, called Apple News+, which curates a range of news articles and will include 300 magazines including National Geographic, People, Popular Science, Billboard and the New Yorker. Apple said it would cost $9.99 a month. 
Apple also introduced a titanium, laser-etched Apple Card backed by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) that can track spending across devices and pay daily cash back on purchases. 
Cook also said Apple Pay, its digital wallet, will soon be usable on public transit systems in Portland, Oregon, Chicago and New York City. Apple Pay will be available in more than 40 countries by the end of the year. 
CROWDED FIELD 
With its new media push, Apple joins a crowded field where rivals such as Amazon.com's Prime Video and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) have spent heavily to capture viewer attention and dollars with award-winning series and films. 
The big tech war for viewers ignited a consolidation wave among traditional media companies preparing to join the fray. Walt Disney Co, which bought 21st Century Fox, and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), which purchased  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX), plan to launch or test new streaming video services this year.
Revenue from its ""services"" segment - which includes the App Store, iCloud and content businesses such as Apple Music - grew 24 percent to $37.1 billion in fiscal 2018. The segment accounted for only about 14 percent of Apple's overall $265.6 billion in revenue, but investors have pinned their hopes for growth on the segment.
The company also introduced Apple Arcade, a game subscription service that will work on phones, tablets and desktop computers and include games from a range of developers. Apple said the gaming service will feature more than 100 exclusive titles from gaming partners such as Annapurna Interactive and that the service will arrive this autumn.

But as with its original content service, Apple did not say how much its gaming service will cost consumers. With details about the new services missing, Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.7 percent on Monday.

Sports Direct, Debenhams' largest shareholder with a near 30 percent stake, has been trying push for control of the group, but an attempt to appoint Ashley to the board and replace nearly all of the existing directors failed because Sport Direct at the time owned its stake through a third-party nominee.
Debenhams, which has issued a string of profit warnings and has lost 90 percent of its market value in the last year, is pursuing its own refinancing plan, but it warned on Friday that existing shareholders could be wiped out.
""In Sports Direct's opinion, Debenhams restructuring and refinancing process is likely to result in an adverse outcome for Debenhams existing shareholders,"" the sports retailer said on Monday.
""Accordingly, Sports Direct confirms that, alongside other options, it is considering a possible offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Debenhams not already held by Sports Direct.""
Billionaire Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United soccer club, made his fortune from building his sportswear chain. 
More recently he has invested in other retailers hit by the rapid shift online and subdued consumer spending in Britain, including Debenhams' department store rival House of Fraser.
Under British takeover rules Sports Direct has until April 22 April to either make a firm offer or walk away.
Sports Direct said any offer would likely be in cash.

465,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 03:05PM ET</span>",Tesla Faces the Risks of a Dominant CEO,"By Charley Blaine
Investing.com - Elon Musk, seemingly, has it all. There’s the money, the colorful personal life and the Bel Air mansion in California. Then there’s Space X and, above all, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Tesla, the maker of all-electric cars, has made him fantastically rich and controversial. Tesla turned its first profit in the third quarter of 2018 and posted one again in the fourth quarter. If you had been lucky to buy 1,000 shares of Tesla when it went public at $17 in 2010, it would be worth around $265,000 now, a compound annual return of more than 120% a year.
But the stock is off more than 20% this year after rising about 7% in 2018. It's the in-betweens that are startling and obscure the sheer audacity of helping to found and then build an automobile manufacturing company from scratch.
That 7% stock-price gain in 2018 came after the stock fell 33% in two months after a now-infamous tweet. On Aug. 7, Musk tweeted, ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding Secured."" The stock jumped 11% that day, except that Musk didn't appear to have the funding secured. He later said he thought he did. But the Securities & Exchange Commission took notice and sued.
The result was that Musk had to give up being chairman of Tesla, though he has remained CEO. He also agreed to get any communications approved by a board committee before sending them out. The SEC reads that to include tweets. Musk disagrees and it now appears that Musk has been tweeting about Tesla regularly before showing anyone anything. So, the SEC asked the judge overseeing their case to hold Musk in contempt.
One of the tweets, on Feb. 19, said Tesla's output would be 500,000 units, 25% higher than the company's guidance in January. Within hours, he corrected the number to an annualized rate of 500,000 units with production hitting 10,000 cars a week. Output is one thing. But output also means millions of dollars in revenue.
The issue is bigger than simply following or not following the rules. A very big and real issue for many stockholders is if the SEC will force Musk out of the company - because Tesla is Musk.
If there's no Musk, who runs the show? And what happens to his stock, around 25% of the outstanding shares. That helps explain this reality.The 29 analysts polled on Tesla by Investing.com have a consensus 12-month price target of $329.28, up 24.5% from Friday's close of $264.53. But 11 analysts say the stock is a buy, with one seeing the stock hitting $500. Another 11 rate the stock a sell, with one seeing the stock falling to $180. And seven are neutral.
To be sure, Musk is a very bright man. Read the transcripts of Tesla's earnings calls and you can see his command of details and trends and see all the stuff he gets into besides Tesla.
But he has an entrepreneur's impatience of process, especially the process around what one says or doesn't say that can affect a stock price. The late Steve Jobs used to get impatient with SEC rules, too, which generated rounds of regulatory battles.
Musk's impatience and excitement generate volatility, not so good for long-term investors but great for short sellers who jump at the opportunities Musk seems to create.
Take the August 2018 tweet. After Tesla's shares absorbed at 33% haircut, the stock took off, rising 26% in the fourth quarter. And it moved higher in early January because Tesla's fourth-quarter production numbers looked strong.
And then the selling pressure erupted again.
Elon Musk notwithstanding, Tesla is an amazing story. It generated $17 billion in revenue in 2018, up 82% from a year earlier. In the fourth quarter, revenue reached $7.23 billion, up about 120% from a year earlier. Its fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $1.93 a share in earnings were lower than the third quarter's $2.90 a share, but way better than the $3.04 loss in the fourth quarter of 2017.
It generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and free cash flow was positive.
It faces considerable risks. The U.S. economy looks like it may be slowing. The global economy looks worse and Tesla hopes to open a factory in Shanghai this year.
The stock was hit with a 4% loss on Friday when Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne cut his estimate of the number of its new Model 3 cars that will be delivered from 55,000 to 47,500 this quarter. The Model 3 is Tesla's key to future growth, with a moderate price.
The $35,000 car that Osborne says is critical to make the numbers work won't be available until later this year. And he's worried about China, where delivery expectations and custom clearance are less transparent.
Osborne, one of the analysts who rate the stock a sell, cut his 12-month target price from $200 to $180."

477,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>","Autonomy boss Lynch ramped sales ahead of HP deal, court told","By Georgina Prodhan
LONDON (Reuters) - British entrepreneur Mike Lynch artificially inflated revenue at his Autonomy software company before selling it to Hewlett Packard for $11 billion, the U.S. firm's lawyer told a London court on Monday.
HP is suing Autonomy founder Lynch, once hailed as Britain's answer to Bill Gates, along with his former finance chief Sushovan Hussain for $5 billion after the 2011 deal went disastrously wrong for the Silicon Valley group.
Lynch denies any wrongdoing and says HP's mismanagement was responsible for the failure of the acquisition.
HP had bought big data firm Autonomy with the aim of making it the centerpiece of a plan to transform HP from a computer and printer maker into a software-focused enterprise services firm, a shift that rival  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) had already pulled off.
But a year later HP wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8 billion, saying it had uncovered serious accounting improprieties. These have led it to pursue Britain's biggest-ever fraud trial against Lynch and Hussain.
Lawyer Laurence Rabinowicz QC, representing HP, told London's High Court that Lynch and Hussain had knowingly been involved in ""widespread and systematic false accounting"" to create a materially false picture of Autonomy's finances.
Autonomy had engaged in ""revenue-pumping"" by encouraging customers to buy its products in exchange for buying goods from them that it did not need, restructuring deals to produce upfront license fees, and covertly selling pure hardware not even programmed with its software at a loss, he said.
In 2009, when Autonomy's profitability was clearly seen to be damaged, the company blamed launch costs for a new database search product called SPE, rather than these activities, in a call with financial analysts, Rabinowicz said.
A spokeswoman for Lynch said in an emailed statement: ""Mike Lynch is pleased to finally have the opportunity to respond in court to HP's accusations. There was no fraud at Autonomy.""
""The real story is that HP, after a history of failed acquisitions, botched the purchase of Autonomy and destroyed the company, seeking to blame others. Mike will not be a scapegoat for their failures."" 
Lynch's spokeswoman said the case ""distilled down to a dispute over differences between UK and US accounting systems"".
Rabinowicz, however, said in court the issues were not a matter of complex financial niceties but rather of clear intention. ""This is not a business dispute about how to apply accounting procedures,"" he said. ""This is a fraud case.""
Lynch observed proceedings from a back corner of the courtroom, occasionally scribbling notes or sending messages on his phone. 
The 53-year-old, who also faces criminal wire- and securities-fraud charges in the United States, which carry a maximum 25-year prison term, is likely to appear before the London court around July.
Lynch received about $800 million for his stake in Autonomy, which started to turn sour before it was completed.
Many shareholders baulked at the 79 percent premium, and the architect of the strategy, then-chief executive Leo Apotheker was sacked. 
Lynch was subsequently fired by Meg Whitman, who took over as HP CEO in 2012.

Both former CEOs are likely to appear as witnesses in the trial, which is expected to continue until the end of the year.

(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, has hired Tanya Levy-Odom and Shannon Nelson for its investment stewardship team that engages with companies on corporate governance, according to their LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles and sources with knowledge of the moves.
The team has emerged as one of the most influential forces in corporate America, given BlackRock's standing as a top shareholder in most big companies. It has been driving change behind the scenes on how companies run themselves and how they handle environmental, social and governance issues.
Levy-Odom has joined BlackRock as a director from strategic advisory and communications firm Rose & Company, according to her LinkedIn profile. She also worked in investor relations at Meredith Corp and in equity research at asset manager AllianceBernstein Holding LP, according to her profile.
Nelson joined the asset manager as a vice president, according to her LinkedIn profile. She formerly worked at BlackRock as an associate in institutional sales, maintaining relationships with investors such as public and private pension plans, according to her LinkedIn profile. She also worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to her profile.
Sources familiar with the hirings who requested anonymity to discuss personnel issues confirmed the hires. BlackRock declined to comment.
Several executives have departed BlackRock recently, with James Hamilton moving to shareholder advisory firm PJT Camberview to work on governance matters, and Peter da Silva Vint joining investment bank Moelis & Co in its shareholder defense practice.
Zach Oleksiuk, the former leader of BlackRock's investment stewardship team in the Americas, now works for investment bank Evercore Inc. Ray Cameron replaced him last year, reporting to global stewardship head Michelle Edkins.

Corporate boards are increasingly in the spotlight as activist hedge funds targeting governance issues grow in influence and social matters such as the #MeToo movement and Black Lives Matter put directors in the hot seat.

This is part of JPMorgan's plans to shift hundreds of staff if Britain leaves the EU without an exit deal so that it can continue to offer clients in the bloc trading, advisory and banking services. The U.S. investment bank is currently building up its offices in Frankfurt, Paris and Luxembourg as part of its Brexit planning. 
A source said that JPMorgan staff in London asked to sign new contracts had already been consulted on the matter, and those who did not wish to move would not be made redundant. 
The news was first reported by Bloomberg. 
Britain was due to leave the EU on March 29 but that was delayed last week. Now, the country will leave the EU on May 22 if Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed withdrawal agreement is approved by parliament this week. 

If not, Britain will have until April 12 to offer a new exit plan or decide to leave without a treaty.

""In total, as many as 90,222 jobs would be at risk solely as a result of the MYPD4 tariff increases granted by Eskom,"" the Minerals Council South Africa said in a presentation.
Job cuts are politically sensitive in Africa's most industrialized economy where a quarter of the labor force is unemployed, while power outages and steep price increases by Eskom are set to hurt an already fragile growth outlook.
In February, miner Sibanye-Stillwater said it planned to cut nearly 6,000 jobs in a restructuring of its gold mining operations, while Gold Fields said last year it could slash 1,100 jobs, and Impala Platinum plans to cut its workforce by a third.
Labor unions have threatened strikes over the job cuts at mining firms as well planned reductions at a numerous state-owned companies. 
Energy regulator Nersa said in early March Eskom could hike tariffs by 9.41 percent in the 2019, 8.10 percent in 2020 and 5.2 percent in 2021, far less than Eskom's request for increases above 15 percent in each of the three years.
The industry body said in its presentation that 71 percent of all gold mines and 65 percent of platinum mines were ""loss-making or marginal"" by the end of 2018, adding the power price hike would make the situation even worse.
Once the largest contributor to South Africa's gross domestic product, mining has shrunk steadily over the last decade with hard-to-reach deposits, high wage settlements and uncertainty over ownership laws deterring investors against a backdrop of slack global demand.
Last week, Statistics South Africa data showed gold production contracted for the 15th month in a row, shrinking by 22.5 percent in January, while platinum output was up 8.8 percent in the same period.
""We see the Eskom crisis as not just a crisis but a potential disaster,"" said Minerals Council chief executive Roger Baxter (NYSE:BAX).

The new agreement is with the holders of more than 55 percent of the company's term loan and 60 percent of its unsecured notes, representing more than $2.5 billion of the company's debt.
The maturity of the term loan now extends to 2023, while the maturity for the unsecured notes was pushed out until 2024. 
The company said the deal ""provides substantial value"" to its lenders and ""creates ample runway to execute on and complete"" Neiman Marcus' transformation plan into a luxury customer platform.
Neiman Marcus has been struggling with a nearly $5 billion debt load, due mainly to its 2013 leveraged buyout by Ares and Canadian public pension fund CPPIB from other private equity firms.

(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have agreed to settle more than 25,000 U.S. lawsuits over their blockbuster blood thinner Xarelto for a total of $775 million, court documents on Monday showed.
The amount will be shared equally between the two companies that jointly developed the drug. Bayer and J&J do not admit liability under the agreement.
The settlement will resolve all pending U.S. lawsuits over Xarelto, which plaintiffs claimed causes uncontrollable and irreversible bleeding leading to severe injuries and even death among thousands of plaintiffs. 
Plaintiffs accused the drugmakers of having failed to warn about the bleeding risks, claiming their injuries could have been prevented had doctors and patients been provided adequate information.
Bayer in a statement on Monday said it continues to believe the claims are without merit.
""However, this favorable settlement allows the company to avoid the distraction and significant cost of continued litigation,"" the company said.
J&J in a statement said it continued to believe in the safety of Xarelto, but that the settlement was the right thing to do for patients and their doctors.
Xarelto is Bayer's best-selling drug. It contributed 3.6 billion euros ($4.07 billion) in revenue to the German group's pharmaceutical business last year.
Bayer on Monday said its share of the settlement amount will be partially offset by product liability insurance.
Bayer jointly developed Xarelto with J&J's Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit, which sells the blood clot preventer under a licensing agreement in the United States. 
J&J reported 2018 Xarelto sales of $2.47 billion.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc is set to offer over $3 billion to buy Dubai-based rival Careem Networks FZ, two sources familiar with the deal told Reuters, in a deal that will strengthen its operations in the Middle East.
The deal, which a third source said could be unveiled during the early part of this week, comes ahead of Uber's planned initial public offering that may value the firm at $120 billion.
Careem, founded in 2012, has a larger presence in the Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan, and Turkey operating in 98 cities there compared to Uber's roughly 23 locations.
""An Uber-Careem merger underscores the huge potential of car-hailing in the Middle East, but also the centrality of winning policy battles,"" said Sam Blatteis, CEO at The MENA Catalysts.
Uber will pay $1.4 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in convertible notes, which will be convertible into Uber shares at a price equal to $55 per share, Bloomberg https://bloom.bg/2OqVtpm had earlier reported, citing a term-sheet. 
Careem declined comment while Uber did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters to comment. 
Careem was estimated to be valued at $2 billion as of October.
Uber has been seeking to expand as it faces global competition in its core ride-hailing business that operates across 70 countries. Rivlas include Lyft Inc. 
Careem, which says it has 33 million registered users, was founded by Mudassir Sheikha and Magnus Olsson before being joined by Abdulla Elyas.
Sheikha and Olsson worked together at McKinsey. Careem acquired delivery services company Enwani, co-founded by Elyas, in 2014. 
Careem's investors include German car maker Daimler and China's largest ride-hailing company DiDi Chuxing.
It would be the second major acquisition of a Middle East technology company after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) bought Souq in 2017.
Like Uber, Careem has expanded beyond its core ride-hailing business and last year launched a delivery service. It also offers digital payment services.
Uber's business also includes bike and scooter rentals, freight hauling and food delivery.
Uber's revenue last year was $11.3 billion, while its gross bookings from rides were $50 billion. But the company lost $3.3 billion, excluding gains from the sale of its overseas business units in Russia and Southeast Asia.
Careem does not disclose it financials.

The IPOs of Lyft and Uber represent a watershed for Silicon Valley's technology unicorns, which for years have snubbed the stock market in favor of raising capital privately, with investors happy to back their frothy valuations.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 10:32AM ET</span>",Inmarsat convinced by $3.4 billion cash buyout deal,"By Justin George Varghese
(Reuters) - A private equity-led consortium agreed to buy Inmarsat Plc for about $3.4 billion in cash after the British satellite operator rebuffed a slightly lower bid from U.S. rival EchoStar last year.
The consortium, which includes UK-based Apax Partners, U.S.-based Warburg Pincus and two Canadian pension funds, is betting in part on Inmarsat's reputation for selling faster and more reliable in-flight Wi-Fi to commercial airlines worldwide.
Inmarsat shareholders will get $7.21 cash, or 546 pence per share. Inmarsat's shares were up 8.9 percent at 551 pence by 1422 GMT, higher than the offer price. 
The company was the first international satellite operator to be privatized, and Apax was part of the group that invested in 2003, before taking it public two years later.
Inmarsat does not expect regulators to pose major hurdles to the takeover, given its experience with regulators in the United States and Britain, a company spokesman said. 
The offer comprises cash of $7.09 for each share plus a previously agreed final dividend of $0.12 per share. That represents a nearly 45 percent premium to Inmarsat's close on Feb. 27, the day before media reports said EchoStar was expected to renew its interest in the company.
TOP SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT
The consortium said it received support from Inmarsat's top shareholder Lansdowne Partners, which holds about an 11.4 percent stake in the company. 
The consortium's approach, which was made on Jan. 31 but disclosed only last week, comes after Inmarsat rebuffed a $3.25 billion cash and stock bid from EchoStar last summer.
""While (the consortium) could add further debt leverage in private hands it is much more likely that they will look to find cost synergies in their many investments that they already have in the sector, such as Intelsat, Bharti Telemedia and Arqiva,"" said James Congdon, Head of Quest, a division of Canaccord Genuity. 
""This should help to remove the problem of increased capital intensity that has afflicted Inmarsat over the last few years and allow it generate free cash flow again for its new owners,"" Congdon added. 
Colorado-based EchoStar, chaired by billionaire entrepreneur Charlie Ergen, proposed a cash and stock offer which valued Inmarsat at about 532 pence-a-share at the time, which Inmarsat argued it ""very significantly undervalued"" the company. EchoStar dropped the bid last July.
Inmarsat said its directors consider the terms of the latest deal to be ""fair and reasonable"" and intends to unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the deal.
COUNTERBID SEEN AS UNLIKELY
The consortium said that it intended to maintain Inmarsat's headquarters in the United Kingdom.
According to UK takeover rules, Echostar or another group could still make a rival offer. 
France's Eutelsat Communications had said it was considering an offer for Inmarsat last June but ruled itself out of a bid battle with EchoStar less than a day later.
""I think an all cash counter bid above the agreed $7.21 a share is unlikely,"" Congdon said. 
""The consortium has the likely advantage of costs synergies and paying in cash.. Most listed satellite operators today are heavily leveraged and would likely need to issue equity and pay Inmarsat shareholders mostly in shares rather than cash,"" Congdon added.

Record floods have devastated a wide swath of the Farm Belt across Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and several other states. The waters have idled ethanol plants, slowed rail shipments of agricultural products and swamped storage bins holding grain from previous harvests.
The disruptions come as the U.S. agriculture industry is grappling with the trade war between Washington and Beijing, which slashed shipments of American farm products to China.
For ADM, the floods are affecting two crucial business units; Origination, which buys, stores and transports grains, and Carbohydrate Solutions, which mills corn and wheat, the company said. The $50 million to $60 million impact on pre-tax operating profit will be roughly equal between the segments, with minor impacts to other units, ADM said.
""Extreme winter weather has affected our first quarter North American operations beyond what we would experience in a typical winter,"" ADM said.
With rail lines washed out, and corn in storage flooded, production of ethanol has declined.
ADM's corn processing complex in Columbus, Nebraska, was idled due to flooding and is running at reduced rates, the company said. 
Unfavorable conditions on U.S. rivers since December are also severely limiting barge transportation movements and port activities, according to ADM. 

Key rivers were swollen from flooding and ice buildup.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider reviving a copyright case in which  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) was accused of unauthorized use of photographer Jacobus Rentmeester's famous 1984 photograph of basketball superstar Michael Jordan soaring through the air.
The justices turned away an appeal by Rentmeester, a former Life Magazine photographer, of a lower court's ruling throwing out his copyright infringement lawsuit against the sportswear company. Rentmeester had said the decision against him by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could stifle creativity and reward piracy.
Rentmeester, a former Olympic rower, photographed Jordan on a grassy knoll at the University of North Carolina for a Life edition on American athletes bound to compete in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
Jordan appears in a sort of gravity-defying leap, inspired by the grand-jeté pose in ballet, his left hand holding a basketball aloft. Rentmeester thought to capture Jordan that way after photographing Mikhail Baryshnikov at the American Ballet Theatre a year earlier, according to court papers. 
Rentmeester accused Nike of commissioning a version of his photo for its commercial benefit, infringing his copyright.
Nike's version shows Jordan in a similar pose against the backdrop of Chicago's skyline after he joined the NBA's Chicago Bulls. Nike used the photo on posters and billboards promoting its lucrative Air Jordan brand. 
Rentmeester's 2015 lawsuit also accused Nike of infringing his copyright by creating its silhouetted ""Jumpman"" logo, which has become one of its most recognizable trademarks, accounting for billions of dollars in sales. 
The 9th Circuit, in dismissing the case last year, ruled that the pose, as well as other elements of the photograph, could not be copyrighted and that Rentmeester did not show that the photo's details were ""substantially similar.""
Urging the Supreme Court to review that decision, Rentmeester's attorneys said the image is not a cliche shot of a basketball player. Its ""expressive elements were meticulously created by Rentmeester, and then meticulously pirated by Nike,"" they said in a written brief. 
Nike has said that ideas, such as capturing Jordan in a leaping pose, cannot be copyrighted. 

Jordan, 56, one of the greatest basketball players of all time, is principal owner of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and is worth $1.9 billion, according to Forbes magazine.

The fact that the spread on U.S. bond yields relaxed their inversion on Monday, after inverting for the first time since prior to the financial crisis, positive economic data out of Germany and relief over political developments stateside were unable to prevent an extension of the panic that triggered the S&P 500’s worst day since January at the end of last week.
At 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), the Dow Jones fell 98 points, or 0.4% to 25,404.49 points, the S&P 500 lost 11 points, or 0.4%, to 2,789.72 while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 41 points, or 0.5%, to 7,601.81 points.
Investors were still jittery after the U.S. yield curve inverted on Friday for the first time since 2007. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell below the 3-month T-bill rate, an event that some analysts consider to foreshadow a recession, though that is not always the case. In normal conditions, a longer-term bond should carry a higher yield than a short-term one as there is a higher risk for a longer time period.
However, Rob Carnell, economist at ING, warned against reaching too quick a conclusion.
“We suspect that drawing a recession conclusion from such data is not warranted until the 3M-10Y yield curve is inverted by a substantial amount,” Carnell said. “Just inverted ... doesn't do it for me.”
Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans also downplayed the yield curve inversion, given his confidence in the U.S. economic outlook.
“Some of this is structural, having to do with lower trend growth, lower real interest rates,” he said Monday at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong. “I think, in that environment, it's probably more natural that yield curves are somewhat flatter than they have been historically.”
Former Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen also said on Monday that the yield curve may signal the need to cut interest rates at some point, but it does not signal a recession.
But risk-averse investors found little consolation in the fact that the yield curve returned to its normal shape on Monday, with the rate on the 3-month Treasury bill moving back below that of the benchmark 10-year note.
In a day with no major U.S. economic reports, German data had provided positive signs as business confidence in the euro zone’s largest economy rebounded more than expected, posting its first improvement after six months of declines.
Also reducing tensions, Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of collusion between U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign team and Russia, and did not present enough evidence to warrant charging the president with obstruction of justice, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Sunday.
The end to the investigation that Trump always referred to as a “witch hunt” not only could serve as a potential tool for his reelection campaign, but removes what some see as a distraction from pressing economic questions such as infrastructure spending or trade relations with China.
“Now is the time to get back on the offense on the economy and growth,” said Republican strategist Scott Reed.

494,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 09:48AM ET</span>",Pinterest’s IPO structure could give CEO Ben Silbermann the right to control the company from beyond the grave,"Silicon Valley's power players are already preparing for the grim spectre of mortality. 
Pinterest's S-1 paperwork, filed publicly Friday, disclosed an unusual stipulation that retains full voting rights for CEO Ben Silbermann's shares in the company from 90 days to 540 days after his ""death or permanent incapacity."" 
That phrase is part of Pinterest's description of its planned dual-class stock structure, which gives 20 votes per share to select Class B shareholders — which will likely include the founding team and some of the company's earliest investors. When investors buy Pinterest's stock after the IPO, they will buy Class A shares, which have just one vote per share.
The clause means that after Silbermann dies, whoever inherits his shares will retain his super-voting powers for a period of time.
Tom Holden, a securities lawyer with the firm Ropes & Gray, said it's uncommon to see language like this in an S-1, and added that expanded rights such as super-voting shares are often requested by the founders directly.
""It's typically driven by the founder's desire to have meaningful influence on the vote post-IPO,"" he said.
In the case of the death clause, Holden suspects Silbermann was motivated by the nuances of estate planning, rather than a posthumous power grab. It's unlikely that Silbermann's future beneficiaries could have a real impact on the company's operations within 90 days, he says. 
""It doesn't strike me that he's trying to gain something substantive,"" Holden said.
While it's rare, Silbermann is not the first CEO to seek such controls. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's famously extra-powerful voting shares, which give him total sway over corporate decisions despite owning a minority stake in the company, are slated to persist for  three years after his death, at which point they would convert to normal shares.
Similarly, super-voting shares owned by Snapchat's founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy would keep their extra powers up to nine months after their deaths. 
Dual-class structures aren't often found in newly-public companies, but are becoming increasingly common at companies with prominent founders at the head, both inside and out of tech.
The clothing company Canada Goose, for example, which went public in 2017, also had a dual class structure. Zoom,  which also filed its S-1 on Friday, also has a dual-class structure — to the benefit of founding CEO Eric S. Yuan, who owns 22% of the company. 
Read more:  Hot video meeting startup Zoom filed to go public, and it's profitable
Typically in companies with dual-class structures, founders and early investors own Class B stock, which can have anywhere from 10 to 100 times the number of votes-per-share as the Class A stock, the type issued to retail investors after the IPO.
In the case of Pinterest, the Class B stock has 20 votes to every one vote held by the Class A stock. Pinterest didn't disclose what percent of the voting power will be held by Class B shareholders.
The way Pinterest is set up, Class B shareholders will lose their super-voting powers in 2026 if they have sold off more than half of their stake in the company. Those high-vote Class B shares will automatically convert into low-vote Class A shares seven years after the IPO, under those conditions.
Notably, if Silbermann were to sell more than 50% of his shares in Pinterest, he would be subject to the same provision — meaning that he, and his heirs, would lose the super-voting powers that come with his current stock.
Pinterest hasn't disclosed what percentage of the company is owned by who, though those details will likely come out in an amended version of its S-1."

496,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>","Apple, Qualcomm Stoke China 5G Fear as Fight Hurtles Toward End","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. finally agree on something: the importance of 5G mobile phone technology for the U.S.
The protagonists in a wide-ranging and bitter legal battle before the U.S. International Trade Commission argue that the other’s actions are damaging the nation’s lead in fifth-generation wireless technology. The agency is scheduled to release key decisions on Tuesday in the long-running fight over patent royalties -- including one that could lead to an import ban on one of the U.S. economy’s most iconic products.
A ruling from the trade commission favoring Apple could undermine Qualcomm’s attempts to defend its business model and keep on charging billions of dollars in technology licensing fees. If Qualcomm prevails, Apple may face restrictions on its ability to import and sell some versions of the iPhone, the main source of its revenue.
The promise of 5G -- which is not yet on the market -- is not just faster speeds, but the ability to do things with connected devices not currently possible, from remote surgery via robots to self-driving cars that talk to each other. But the fear in Washington that China will get a global lead in 5G is being stoked by both Apple and Qualcomm to try to win the epic legal battle over technology that currently underpins all smartphones.
“The whole telecom and wireless industry has been made to sing the 5G song,” said Will Stofega, a mobile industry analyst at IDC, when asked about the dispute between two of the world’s largest technology companies. “There’s a sort of alarmist trend that China may get ahead of us in actual deployment.”
Their choice of 5G as a focus their arguments is on point. President Donald Trump’s administration has already intervened in Qualcomm’s affairs by banning a hostile takeover by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc. in a move which cited the San Diego chipmaker’s importance to the new phone technology.
At the same time, U.S. politicians and regulatory agencies also are focused on curtailing the influence of China’s Huawei Technologies Co. Apple and Qualcomm have each argued that a loss at the ITC for them would help Huawei gain an edge in 5G.
“Diminished American research and development in the baseband chipset market impacts competitive conditions in a sector that has national security implications,” Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley of Oregon and other lawmakers said in a letter to the agency, in support of Apple’s position. A dozen other politicians, both Republican and Democratic, also weighed in against an import ban.
The trade agency has the power to block imports of products that violate U.S. patent rights. In the first of two cases filed by Qualcomm, a trade judge said Apple infringed a patent for a power-saving feature, but cited the 5G race in recommending against banning iPhones. The commission is scheduled to release its final decision on Tuesday. The same day, a judge in a second case is expected to issue notice of her findings involving other Qualcomm patents lodged against Apple.
It’s rare for the agency to decline to impose an import ban if a violation is found, though in special cases it’s agreed to delay implementation of such orders. The last time it decided against any ban was in 1984, when it found that barring hospital beds designed for burn victims would harm patients who might not be able to get the equipment.
Any import ban would next go to the Trump administration for consideration, and could be overturned on public policy grounds. In 2013, the Obama administration vetoed an import ban on older iPhones won by Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., citing concerns about blocking the use of fundamental technology in mobile devices.
At the center of the overall argument between Apple and Qualcomm is a tiny chip called a modem. The smartphone component helps convert radio signals into voice and data. Qualcomm’s chips have led the way in previous transitions to 3G services and its successors in the phones and services we use today.
Apple argues that giving in to Qualcomm’s demands to have the iPhone banned would hurt competition. Apple’s current supplier,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., would face difficulties continuing to innovate in that area if revenue from sales in the U.S. was proscribed, Apple contends.
“Without current 4G sales to Apple, Intel lacks a viable path forward to compete for coming 5G baseband chipset sales,” Apple told the agency. “Intel is now the only U.S. baseband chipset manufacturer still standing in the face of Qualcomm’s anticompetitive practices.”
Qualcomm says that’s nonsense. There’s plenty of competition, it says, mostly from overseas companies, and allowing Apple to use the patented inventions without paying up would hurt its, and the U.S.’s, leadership in 5G.
“Qualcomm is the global leader in 5G development and standard-setting, with Huawei being a close second,” Qualcomm said. “Although Apple purports to urge the Commission to keep a second runner in a two-man race, Apple is really urging the Commission to hobble the American leader in a field crowded with foreign entrants.”
All phones that will debut on nascent 5G systems this year will be based on Qualcomm chips, the company has said. Samsung, the world’s biggest phone maker, is launching a version of its flagship Galaxy line using Qualcomm components.
Intel, Samsung, Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc., Huawei and others have all announced their own plans to bring 5G-capable modems to market, but most will come no earlier than 2020, by which time Qualcomm says it’ll be on its second version.
Analysts have expressed concern that the fight with Qualcomm could delay Apple’s entry into the 5G market. The company is holding off until at least 2020 before offering an iPhone that can connect to 5G services, according to people familiar with its plans.
Royalty Rivalry
While both sides are invoking 5G before the trade agency, the case is really a royalty debate that’s become fairly common among companies in the mobile-device sector. The ITC cases are an effort by Qualcomm to put pressure on Apple to renew an expired licensing agreement.
Qualcomm not only makes the chips, but has patents on the fundamental technology that underlies all mobile devices. That means it gets paid whether a device contains a Qualcomm chip or not. The dispute with Apple is over how much Qualcomm should get in royalties from the iPhone.
The patents in the two ITC cases don’t relate to industry standards. Qualcomm says that’s to show how its research makes its phones not merely function, but work better. It also avoids the kind of legal dispute that tripped up Samsung in 2013.
Apple says the power-saving feature is for “15 extra minutes of battery life,” and it’s been able to design around the patent. Apple asked that, if an import ban is imposed, it be given time to finish the roll out of the software change and to have the redesign reviewed by U.S. Customs officials.
The animosity between the two behemoth companies spans the globe. Apple filed an antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm and directed its component suppliers to stop paying the chipmaker, which has cost it billions of dollars in revenue. Qualcomm has won court orders in China and Germany that limit iPhone sales in those countries.
In the U.S., the trade agency is only one of the venues deciding disputes between the two companies. A trial was held in January in the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm over its licensing practices, based in large part on the royalty fight with Apple. The two sides are awaiting a federal judge’s decision in that case.
A federal jury in San Diego on March 15 told Apple to pay Qualcomm $31 million for just three of the thousands of patents the chipmaker owns -- including the one in the first ITC cases -- while a Qualcomm lawsuit against the contractors is scheduled to begin in the same courthouse next month.

497,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",The $10 Trillion Pool of Negative Debt Is a Late-Cycle Reckoning,"(Bloomberg) -- The stockpile of global bonds with below-zero yields just hit $10 trillion -- intensifying the conundrum for investors hungry for returns while fretting the brewing economic slowdown.
A Bloomberg index tracking negative-yielding debt has reached the highest level since September 2017 as 10-year bunds trade in negative territory and the U.S. yield curve flashes recession warnings.
With central banks in dovish mode, money managers face increasing pressure to reprise the yield-chasing mentality synonymous with quantitative easing, according to Gary Kirk, a founding partner at London-based TwentyFour Asset Management with $19 billion overall.
“This obviously tempts those investors holding cash to move along the maturity curve -- or down the rating curve -- to seek yield, which is once again becoming a scarce commodity,” he said. “It’s a classic late-cycle conundrum.”
Kirk is “resisting the temptation” to snap up longer-dated credit obligations that could succumb to defaults in a downturn and prefers duration bets in interest-rate markets.
Fight for Yield
Fund flows underscore the lust for yield in the low-rate, lowflation climate. Investors in the week through March 20 parked $6.6 billion into investment-grade funds, $3.2 billion into high-yield bonds and $1.2 billion into emerging-market debt, according to a Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). note citing EPFR data.
“The extraordinary abrupt end to central bank hiking cycle + Fed paranoia of credit event is uber-bullish credit & uber-bearish volatility,” strategists including Michael Hartnett wrote.
While negative yields on paper suggest that investors lose money just by holding the obligations, bond buyers could also be looking at price gains if growth stalls and inflation stays low. But along the way, risk assets may be entering the danger zone.
“We’ve never seen monetary easing so long, so broad, so big,” said Brian Singer, head of dynamic allocation strategies at William Blair, a Chicago-based fund manager that oversees $70 billion overall. “What’s happened after every significant period of accommodation is a reckoning. This time the bubble is lower-rated credit and illiquid private assets.”

MUSCAT (Reuters) - Qatar Airways threw its support behind Boeing (NYSE:BA) on Monday as the U.S. planemaker faces its biggest crisis in years after two deadly crashes of its flagship 737 MAX jet. 
Regulators grounded the worldwide MAX fleet after an Ethiopian Airlines MAX crash killed all 157 people on board this month, wiping 14 percent off shares in the world's biggest planemaker. 
""As far as I am concerned, I have full confidence in Boeing and their ability to resolve any technical issue,"" Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told reporters in Muscat.
Qatar Airways, one of the largest Middle East carriers, is a major Boeing customer. It has ordered 20 MAX jets and committed to buying a further 40. It has taken delivery of five of the aircraft, according to Boeing's website.
Baker has a reputation for heavily criticizing aircraft manufacturers. It ordered the MAX jets after a dispute with Airbus over an order for their similar sized A320neo aircraft.
The airline will delay the April delivery of a single MAX jet until the cause of the crash is known, Baker said. 
""I am sure that the aircraft will get back into the skies soon and that Boeing will get to the bottom of what happened and if there is something technical wrong that they will find a fix for it,"" he said.
Attention has focused on the anti-stall system, known as MCAS, and the sensors that activate it. MCAS pushes the plane’s nose down if it believes it is ascending at too steep an angle.
Qatar Airways will attend a Boeing briefing this week on software and training updates for the MAX, Baker said.
The MAX is an upgrade to Boeing's best-selling 737 narrowbody jet and only entered service in 2017. Boeing has booked MAX orders worth more than $500 billion at list prices.
The Ethiopian crash is the second fatal crash involving the MAX jet. In October, a MAX operated by Indonesia's Lion Air fatally crashed killing all 189 on board.
Baker said he believed the worldwide grounding was driven by public perception. Passengers around the world asked airlines to change flights or refunds to avoid flying on the MAX after the Ethiopian crash.

""The regulator had to act to give confidence to the people, that the regulators were looking after their interests,"" he said.

(Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday on concerns over sluggish global growth but an unexpected rise in German business sentiment eased fears of a recession in the bloc's largest economy. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index pared early losses to dip 0.12 percent while Frankfurt's DAX, Milan's, Madrid's and Paris's briefly turned positive after data showed German business morale improved unexpectedly in March, suggesting the country's economy is likely to pick up in the coming months. London's FTSE was marginally lower.
European stocks on Friday witnessed their biggest weekly decline this year following weak manufacturing data from Europe and the United States that inverted a part of the U.S. yield curve. In the past, that has signaled an upcoming recession.
""It's the uncertainty around the outlook of the manufacturing sector which is causing the selloff which should be put into context of still a very healthy service sector,"" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
""There seem to be conflicting signals from the data with one survey telling things that things are deteriorating a bit in the manufacturing side but on the other hand the IFO survey is showing a pick up.""
Among the biggest weights on the pan-region index was Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGN), down 2.1 percent. Its chief executive said over the weekend that management retained the backing of its supervisory board despite a second U.S. ruling that its glyphosate-based Roundup weed killer caused cancer.
While losses in health and technology sectors weighed on the index, a rise in auto stocks and banks limited losses.
Fiat Chrysler jumped 3.2 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Italian carmaker had rebuffed merger approaches by Peugeot earlier this year.
British satellite operator Inmarsat jumped 8.6 percent to lead gains on STOXX after a private equity-led consortium agreed to buy the company for about $3.4 billion in cash.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. sportswear maker  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) was hit with a 12.5 million euro ($14.14 million) fine on Monday for blocking cross-border sales of soccer merchandise of some of Europe's best-known clubs, the latest EU sanction against such restrictions.
The European Commission said Nike's illegal practices occurred between 2004 to 2017 and related to licensed merchandise for FC Barcelona, Manchester United, Juventus, Inter Milan, AS Roma and the French Football Federation.
The European Union case focused on Nike's role as a licensor for making and distributing licensed merchandise featuring a soccer club's brands and not its own trademarks.
The sanction came after a two-year investigation triggered by a sector inquiry into e-commerce in the 28-country bloc. The EU wants to boost online trade and economic growth.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Nike's actions deprived soccer fans in other countries of the opportunity to buy their clubs' merchandise such as mugs, bags, bed sheets, stationery and toys.
""Nike prevented many of its licensees from selling these branded products in a different country leading to less choice and higher prices for consumers,"" she said in a statement.
Nike's practices included clauses in contracts prohibiting out-of-territory sales by licensees and threats to end agreements if licensees ignored the clauses. Its fine was cut by 40 percent after it cooperated with the EU enforcer.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks hit a 12-day trough on Monday as fears for economic growth sent investors dashing for safe-haven assets, but the selloff lost some momentum after better-than-expected data from Germany.
The Ifo Institute's March business climate index unexpectedly rose, soothing nerves after Friday's dismal German manufacturing data, which helped spark a global selloff that hammered stock markets and pushed key benchmark bond yields below zero.
Crucially, an inversion in the U.S. bond yield curve on Friday had stoked fears that the world's largest economy was headed for recession.
But the Ifo report lent some cheer. It helped European shares rise off early lows. Paris traded flat, London's FTSE was down 0.2 percent, and Frankfurt inched up 0.14 percent after the numbers. Europe's banking as well as industrial goods & services sectors which were down 1 percent at one point, recouped losses to trade flat by 950 GMT.
But the jitters were far from over. 
""We had a dire end to 2018 which was then recouped so you have a very good reason to lighten up on portfolios,"" said Marie Owens Thomsen, chief economist at CA Indosuez in Geneva, adding that confusion over the state of play in Britain's impending departure from the European Union clouded the picture more. 
""Many people may have realized a major part of their expected returns for the year, so in light of recent gains it makes sense for investors to should lighten up on risk.""
The falls in Europe follow hefty tumbles in Asia. Japan's Nikkei hit a five-week low after diving 3.1 percent for its largest one-day percentage fall since late December. South Korea's Kospi index declined 1.7 percent, while China shares was also in the red with the blue-chip CSI 300 index down 1.4 percent.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe slipped 0.5 percent. The gloomy mood was expected to spread to U.S. markets with S&P 500 futures skidding 0.2 percent. However, they were down as much as 0.5 percent earlier in the day.
The German data also helped Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield move back into positive territory.
Spreads between U.S. three-month and 10-year Treasury yields turned positive. U.S. 10-year treasury yields stood at 2.7240 percent after yields inverted for the first time since 2007 on Friday. Historically, an inverted yield curve - where long-term rates fall below short-term - has signaled an upcoming recession.
""The bond market price action is an enormous blaring siren to anyone trying to be optimistic on stocks,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said in a note to clients.
""Growth, and bonds/yield curves, will be the only thing stocks should be focused on going forward, and it's very hard to envision any type of rally until economic confidence stabilizes and bonds reverse,"" it added.
Politics was also in focus in the United States and Britain.
U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded after a long investigation that nobody associated with President Donald Trump's campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 presidential election, according to a summary issued by Attorney General William Barr on Sunday. 
Political turmoil in Britain over the country's exit from the European Union also remains a drag on risk assets.
Prime Minister Theresa May held crisis talks with senior colleagues and hardline Brexiteers on Sunday trying to breathe life into her twice-defeated European divorce deal after reports her cabinet was plotting to topple her.
Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper said in a front page editorial May must announce on Monday she will stand down as soon as her Brexit deal is approved. 
The British pound was 0.2 percent lower after three straight days of wild gyrations. The currency had slipped 0.7 percent last week.
The Japanese yen - a perceived safe haven - traded 0.25 percent softer at 110.18 per dollar, knocked off earlier six-week highs.

In commodities, U.S. crude fell 13 cents to $58.91 per barrel. Brent crude futures eased 22 cents to $66.81.

But positive economic data out of Germany and relief over political developments stateside helped to calm the nerves that triggered the S&P 500’s worst day since January at the end of last week.
The blue-chip Dow futures fell 12 points, or 0.1%, to 25,558.5 points by 6:46 AM ET (11:46 GMT), the S&P 500 futures lost 2 points, or 0.1%, to 2,808.88 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 24 points, or 0.3%, to 7,345.25 points.
Investors were still jittery after the U.S. yield curve inverted on Friday for the first time since 2007. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell below the 3-month T-bill rate, an event that some analysts consider to foreshadow a recession, though that is not always the case. In normal conditions, a longer-term bond should carry a higher yield than a short-term one as there is a higher risk for a longer time period.
However, Rob Carnell, economist at ING, warned against reaching too quick a conclusion. “We suspect that drawing a recession conclusion from such data is not warranted until the 3M-10Y yield curve is inverted by a substantial amount,” Carnell said. “Just inverted, as today's markets indicate, doesn't do it for me.”
Chicago Federal Reserve Bank president Charles Evans also downplayed the yield curve inversion, given his confidence in the U.S. economic outlook.
“Some of this is structural, having to do with lower trend growth, lower real interest rates,” he said Monday at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong. “I think, in that environment, it's probably more natural that yield curves are somewhat flatter than they have been historically.”
Former Fed chair Janet Yellen also said on Monday that the yield curve may signal the need to cut interest rates at some point, but it does not signal a recession.
In a day with no major U.S. economic reports, German data helped traders breathe a sigh of relief as business confidence rebounded more than expected, posting its first improvement after six months of declines.
The yield curve also returned to its normal shape with the rate on the 3-month Treasury bill at 2.45% by 6:47 AM ET (11:47 GMT) while the benchmark 10-year note moved higher to 2.47%.
Also providing relief, Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign team and Russia, and did not present enough evidence to warrant charging the president with obstruction of justice, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Sunday.
The end to the investigation removes what some see as a distraction from pressing economic questions such as infrastructure spending or trade relations with China.
In company news, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to lift the curtain on Monday on a secretive, years-long effort to build a television and movie offering, while Boeing (NYSE:BA) will brief more than 200 global airline pilots, technical leaders and regulators this week on software and training updates for its 737 MAX aircraft.

First Utility Ltd., which the Anglo-Dutch major bought last year, has been rebranded as Shell Energy and the power provided to its 700,000 customers in the U.K. will now come from renewable sources of energy such as wind, solar and biomass, it said in a statement.
“Shell recognizes the world needs more energy with lower emissions and this will give customers more flexibility, greater control and cleaner energy,” said Mark Gainsborough, executive vice president of Shell New Energies US LLC.
Shell Energy will also offer a range of smart home devices, such as thermostats, and discounts on home electric vehicle chargers for its customers.
“We are building on the disruptive nature of First Utility to give customers something better,” said Colin Crooks, chief executive officer of Shell Energy Retail Ltd. “We know that renewable electricity is important to them and we are delivering that, while ensuring good value and rewarding loyalty.”
Shell plans to become the world’s biggest power company within 15 years and is spending as much as $2 billion a year on its new-energies division, a move that suggests it sees climate change as a significant threat to the fossil fuel business.
Alongside First Utility, Shell has made other acquisitions in power including car-charging operator NewMotion and a stake in U.S. solar company Silicon Ranch Corp. It has also announced it’s bidding for Dutch utility Eneco Group NV, which provides low-carbon power to industrial users and offers apps and other technology to manage electricity consumption. Shell also entered a bid to expand an offshore wind farm in the Netherlands.

512,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>",‘Don't Panic’ the Mantra as Low Yields Don't Mean Stock Collapse,"(Bloomberg) -- A drubbing in world shares bled into a second day Monday, sparked by worrying signs for the global economy and reinforced by dramatic moves in the bond market. Yet some investors may have pushed the panic button too early.
At first glance, there are harbingers of recessionary doom everywhere. The U.S. curve has inverted, yields in Australia and New Zealand are at record lows, and the global pile of negative-yielding debt is rapidly growing again. So it’s small wonder traders are pulling back from stocks.
But there’s an alternative prognosis: that we’re witnessing a reinstatement of the friendly low-rate environment that sent equities to records in the first place.
“As long as central banks have our back, there’s no serious problem,” said Bryan Goh, executive director and chief investment officer for Singapore at Bordier & Cie.
Those cross currents were seen last week, when the Federal Reserve said it planned to hold off on interest-rate hikes for the rest of the year. The S&P 500 Index closed lower that Wednesday, before jumping the next day on newfound optimism about the dovish turn.
And then came the inversion. U.S. equities plunged on Friday as three-month bills yielded more than 10-year Treasuries for the first time since 2007, with manufacturing data from Europe adding to the gloom. That tone continued in Asia on Monday, with share gauges from Tokyo to Hong Kong and Shanghai sinking at least 2 percent.
“We have to continue to remind ourselves that an inverted yield curve doesn’t cause a recession -- it’s just a good indicator that one is coming,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd., in a note. “And let’s not forget there’s often a long lag time between inversion and recession. Investors should not be panicking.”
In the past 35 years, such a signal has preceded the three U.S. recessions by an average lead time of more than 15 months, while producing one false positive, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Renewed worry about how long the global economy can stay in the current Goldilocks state -- when growth is neither fast enough to spur monetary tightening nor weak enough to risk a slowdown -- is consuming equity investors at the end of a profitable quarter. Even after the two-day drop, the MSCI All-Country World Index is up more than 10 percent since the start of the year.
A closer look at the competing factors surrounding the inversion shows the difficulty of making that determination. The long-running U.S. bull market has in the past year weathered a partial government shutdown, some mixed messages from the Fed, as well as ongoing headwinds from trade tensions with China and growing political fragmentation.
And underpinning the U.S. economy’s resiliency, meanwhile, is a solid labor market that continues to drive consumption. More workers are coming back to the jobs force, and while the effects of last year’s tax cut are fading they are being offset by higher government spending.
And valuations remain relatively subdued. The price-earnings ratio for the index stands at 16.6, still well below the most recent high of 21.3 in 2016.
“A lot of people are looking to call a top in equities, as is normal on days like this,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities’ Australian unit. “However, it could just be a healthy clear out and we resume topside moves later in the week.”

513,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 06:05AM ET</span>",Seller's market seen aiding Illinois and Chicago bond issues,"By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Financial uncertainties swirling around Illinois and Chicago may not deter bond buyers when the two fiscally shaky governments sell more than $1.1 billion of debt this week. 
Slim supply in the $3.8 trillion U.S. municipal market, yield-hungry investors, and the shelving of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve for the remainder of 2019 have tipped the scale in favor of sellers, investment managers said.
""We believe that if (Chicago and Illinois are) going to pick a time to come to market, now is a pretty good time to be coming,"" said Dan Heckman, national investment consultant at U.S. Bank.
Illinois, the lowest-rated U.S. state at a notch or two above junk due to its huge unfunded pension liability and chronic structural budget deficit, will offer $452 million of taxable and tax-exempt general obligation (GO) bonds in competitive bidding on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, underwriters led by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) are scheduled to price $700 million of GO bonds for Chicago, which is also struggling with pension funding and deficits, just days before the city elects a mayor to replace the retiring Rahm Emanuel, who served two terms.
""My gut tells me these deals are going to get done and done at a level that is pretty attractive for Illinois and the city of Chicago and over a longer period of time will likely prove unattractive for investors,"" said Nicholos Venditti, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.
Illinois' deal comes just weeks after the new Democratic governor, J.B. Pritzker, unveiled a fiscal 2020 budget and a plan to rescue the state's sagging finances by switching to graduated income tax rates via a constitutional amendment process.
Budget measures, including the use of one-time revenue and a more than $800 million reduction in contributions to the state's woefully underfunded pensions, could push Illinois closer to a junk credit rating.
""That is a significant risk,"" Venditti said, adding that the situation is even ""scarier"" in Chicago, which already has a junk rating with Moody's Investors Service, along with ratings of BBB-plus with S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and BBB-minus with Fitch Ratings. 
The city's two mayoral candidates - Toni Preckwinkle, who currently heads the Cook County Board of Commissioners, and attorney Lori Lightfoot - have not disclosed detailed plans for addressing a projected $252 million fiscal 2020 budget deficit and escalating pension payments that will top $2 billion in 2023.
""At the city level, I think investors are flying blind,"" Venditti said. 
Meanwhile, demand is strong with municipal bond funds, including high yield, reporting big weekly inflows of investor dollars since early January, according to Lipper.
Muni bond supply totaling $63.8 billion so far in 2019 is 12 percent below the average year-to-date volume in the previous five years, according to Refinitiv data.
Given the ""very, very attractive"" muni bond environment for issuers, Heckman said there will be appetite for debt from Illinois and Chicago if their deals are ""priced appropriately.""
Investors have been demanding hefty yields for the governments' GO debt, with Illinois paying the biggest penalty among states.

ADDIS ABABA/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co will brief more than 200 global airline pilots, technical leaders and regulators this week on software and training updates for its 737 MAX aircraft, as Ethiopian Airlines expressed confidence in the planemaker despite a recent crash.
The carrier will work with Boeing and other airlines to make air travel safer, its chief executive, Tewolde Gebremariam, said, after regulators this month grounded the worldwide fleet of the aircraft following a crash that killed 157 people.
""Despite the tragedy, Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines will continue to be linked well into the future,"" he said in a statement on Monday. ""Ethiopian Airlines believes in Boeing. They have been a partner of ours for many years.""
However, many questions on the 737 MAX ""remain without answers"", Tewolde added, and a spokesman for the carrier said it had no ""immediate plans"" to attend the Boeing session, without giving further details.
Wednesday's meeting is a sign that Boeing is nearing completion on a planned software patch required to return the grounded fleet to commercial service, though it will still need approval from regulators.
The session in Renton, Washington is part of an effort to reach all current, and many future, 737 MAX operators and their home regulators to discuss software and training updates to the jet, Boeing said in a statement.
The 737 MAX is Boeing's best-selling plane, with orders worth more than $500 billion at list prices.
Garuda Indonesia was invited to the briefing, Chief Executive Ari Askhara told Reuters on Monday. Last week, Indonesia's national carrier said it planned to cancel its order for 49 737 MAX jets, citing a loss of passenger trust.
""We were informed on Friday, but because it is short notice we can't send a pilot,"" Askhara said, adding that the airline had requested a webinar with Boeing, only to be rejected.
A Boeing spokeswoman said the meeting formed part of a series of in-person information sessions.
""We have been scheduling, and will continue to arrange, additional meetings to communicate with all current, and many future, MAX customers and operators,"" she said.
Garuda, which has only one 737 MAX, had been reconsidering its order before the Ethiopian crash, as had fellow Indonesian carrier Lion Air, which suffered a crash in October that killed all 189 aboard.
Boeing had informed the airline of the meeting but it might not attend, said Lion Air Managing Director Daniel Putut, who declined further comment. 
Singapore Airlines Ltd said its offshoot, SilkAir, which operates the 737 MAX, had received an invitation to the meeting and would send representatives.
Representatives of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will also attend, a spokeswoman for the regulator said.
Korean Air Lines Co Ltd, which, before the grounding, had been due to receive its first 737 MAX in April, said it planned to send pilots to Renton. South Korean low-cost carrier Eastar Jet will send two pilots, a spokesman said.
On Saturday, teams from the three U.S. airlines that own 737 MAX jets joined a session in Renton reviewing a planned software upgrade. 
Flydubai representatives attended that session and some will also attend this week's meeting, a spokeswoman for the Dubai-based airline said.
A U.S. official briefed on the matter on Saturday said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had not yet signed off on the software upgrade and training but aimed to review and approve them by April.
It remained unclear whether the software upgrade, called ""design changes"" by the FAA, will resolve concerns stemming from the investigation into the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash.
Tewolde, the airline's chief executive, said until there were more answers about the 737 MAX, the planes should remain grounded, adding, ""Putting one more life at risk is too much.""

The U.S. official said planned changes included 15 minutes of training to help pilots deactivate the anti-stall system known as MCAS in the event of faulty sensor data or other issues. It also included some self-guided instruction, the official added.

516,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 04:54AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Stronger Ifo Report Can't Stop Markets Sliding,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Confidence is a relative concept.
Weak business surveys out of Europe triggered the global rout in stock markets on Friday, and the wave of negativity was still going strong after completing its circuit around the world on Monday morning until German research institute Ifo announced its business climate report for March.
The closely-watched index rose by more than expected to 99.6 from last month's four-year low, with both the current conditions and expectations sub-indexes beating expectations. That caused a sharp, but apparently only brief, reversal across the region's markets.
By 05:15 AM ET (09:15 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 2.28 points, or 0.6% at 373.74, while Germany's Dax was down 0.1% and France's CAC 40 was down 0.5%.
Concerns about a U.S. recession are starting to build after short-term dollar interest rates rose above 10-year bond yields during Friday’s sell-off. While that is often cited as a reliable indicator of a coming recession, plenty of financial professionals take it with a large pinch of salt.


.
Among the few stocks bucking the negative trend before the Ifo release was Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU), which was reported by The Wall Street Journal as being the subject of a takeover approach from France's  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP). The Italian company reportedly rejected the approach. Peugeot, which has rapidly turned around General Motors (NYSE:GM)' struggling European brands, indicated earlier this year it wants to break into the U.S. market.
The one domestic story capable of generating positive news to stop the trend – Brexit – signally failed to generate anything of the kind over the weekend.
A mass demonstration in London on Saturday appears unlikely to achieve its goal of a second referendum, given that the current government is resolutely opposed to one. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is meeting with her cabinet Monday morning in London, against a backdrop of reports that they will pressure her to step down. May wrote to lawmakers at the weekend that she would only bring her twice-defeated Withdrawal Agreement back for a third vote if it commanded enough support, which senior Conservative party figures said isn't the case.
The FTSE 100 was down 0.3%.

519,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2019 03:11AM ET</span>",Here's How the Shake-Out Is Reverberating Around Global Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Markets from Sao Paulo to Tokyo are getting swept up in a downdraft spurred by questions about whether global growth is deteriorating faster than previously thought.
As bond yields in Australia and New Zealand plumbed all-time lows in Monday trading, Asian stocks are heading for the biggest slide of 2019 and measures of market volatility are surging, albeit off low levels. At the heart of the moves is an acknowledgment that central banks and governments are struggling in their bids to prop up the expansion in the global economy.
The tumble in equity markets began in earnest on Friday, as the S&P 500 Index sank 1.9 percent. MSCI’s gauge of Asia-Pacific shares was down about 2 percent as of 1:20 p.m. Monday in Hong Kong, set for the largest drop since October. The benchmark has erased its gains for the month.
Expectations for further swings in stock prices are soaring. The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index jumped as much as 31 percent, the most since October, and the equivalent gauge for Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 11 percent, though the low starting point highlights how placid things had become prior to Friday. Volatility also surged the most this year in South Korea.
Fixed-income markets, which for weeks have highlighted investor concerns on the growth outlook, are showing there is little sign of worry abating. Australia’s 10-year bond yield sank below 1.8 percent for the first time, the latest example of a global move lower in long-term rates.
There’s also been a notable change in trader expectations that a U.S. interest rate cut is on the not-too-distant horizon. Money markets show an 80 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates this year. Just last week that was less than 50 percent.
Jitters over the health of the U.S. economy are putting pressure on crude prices as well. Crude futures extended losses Monday, joining the sell-off in other assets, after reaching a four-month high on Thursday.
Global growth concerns are also having an impact on foreign-exchange markets. Among major currencies, the traditional haven Japanese yen is leading gains, while emerging markets including South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico are among the biggest losers.
Another haven in gold, meanwhile, is also catching a bid. The spot price for the yellow metal is up in six of the past seven sessions, headed for the highest close in a month after rebounding from a January low earlier in March.

The central bank must ensure there is “no bigger turbulence” even if the U.K. does leave the European Union without a deal, Rehn told the German newspaper, adding he hopes the no-deal Brexit scenario will not take place.
The ECB has protectively entered into so-called swap line agreements with the Bank of England to safeguard sufficient supply of euros and British pounds to financial institutions, he said.
Rehn said economic growth in the euro zone “has weakened significantly” and offers reasons for concerns. The main cause is uncertainty within and outside the euro zone, particularly the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, he said.
A review of the ECB’s strategy Rehn has suggested would be “definitely no revolution, but rather an evolution” to reflect broader changes like an aging population and the effects of digitalization, he said. Price stability would remain the top priority and the ECB’s mandate shouldn’t be questioned, Rehn said.

The Palang Pracharath party is now poised to bring junta leader Prayuth Chan-Ocha back as prime minister even as anti-junta parties led by Pheu Thai are also set for substantial lower-house seats. The outcome will prompt a review of exposure to Thai assets as foreign investors have withdrawn in excess of a net $700 million from its stock and bond markets this year.
Thailand’s SET Index lost 0.8 percent as of 10:30 a.m. in Bangkok, less than declines in the broader Asian benchmark amid a global sell-off triggered by economic growth concerns. The baht, Asia’s best performing currency this year, strengthened 0.6 percent to 31.584 against the U.S. dollar, while the 10-year sovereign bond was little changed.
“We believe local investors will likely take cheer at prospects of continuity and deliver a bounce lasting possibly several weeks,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG analysts including Dan Fineman wrote in a note. “We note, however, that the next government will be a weak and possibly unstable coalition and that the market is fairly expensive.”
Thailand’s benchmark SET Index has gained an average 6.6 percent in the month after four major polls dating back to 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has climbed about 4.5 percent this year, trailing a 7.8 percent advance in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.
“Some investors are probably concerned about the stability of the new government,” said Win Phromphaet, the Bangkok-based chief investment officer of CIMB-Principal Asset Management Co. “PM Prayuth will extend his reign, but will face very strong opposition parties.”
“We will watch how alliances settle over the next 72 hours to get a better gauge of political control in the lower house,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts including Sean Gardiner wrote in a note dated March 24. “We think this will be key for foreigners to return after their net sales of ~$7 billion of Thai equities over the last 12 months.”
So far this year, international investors have withdrawn a net $349 million from equities after a record selloff of $8.9 billion in 2018.
“Investors will probably buy back the baht as the major event risk is over for Thailand and also as the results are not far from what was expected,” said Hironori Sannami, an emerging-market currency trader at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. “Thailand is considered to be one of those countries where the politics don’t have much impact on its economic state.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's National Australia Bank said on Monday it would end a profitable system of bonuses for referrals that was criticized by an independent inquiry.
NAB interim Chief Executive Officer and Chairman-elect Philip Chronican said scrapping the referral payments to businesses such as sport clubs and accountants would help to regain customer trust after the inquiry found widespread wrongdoing across the financial sector.
""We want customers to have the confidence to come to NAB because of the products and services we provide – not because a third party received a payment to recommend us,"" Chronican said in a statement. 
The government-backed inquiry heard that dozen of NAB bankers had falsified loan documents and signatures, and provided unsuitable loans to benefit from the scheme.
NAB's introducer program brought in over A$24 billion ($17 billion) in home loans during the period when the misconduct occurred from 2013 to 2016, lawyers for the inquiry said.
Consumer group Choice said NAB's move came too late given the inquiry had revealed Australia's fourth-largest bank knew there were problems with the program in 2015. 
""The Royal Commission revealed that many Australians were duped by introducers into unaffordable loans and defaulted as a result,"" Patrick Veyret, CHOICE Policy and Campaigns Adviser said.
""It's shameful it's taken this long for them to act.""

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were both down 0.9% by 10:15 PM ET (03:15 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.6%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 3.1%, while South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.5%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 declined 1.2%.
An inverted yield curve, a closely-watched signal of potential recession, appeared on Friday and was cited as the catalyst for the selling in stocks.
The yield curve is often interpreted as a powerful forecasting tool for recession. It inverted in each of the last seven recessions, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.
The latest collapse came after the release of weak economic reports in France and Germany, while data showed growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector slowed to a 21-month low in March.
The last time the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year note went negative was in 2006, right before the economic downturn that began in the next year.
In other news, high-level officials from the U.S. and China will meet in Beijing later this week for a fresh round of trade talks.
Earlier reports suggested that the two sides might sign a trade deal sometime in April.
Brexit Developments are also expected to be in focus this week as U.K. Parliament is set to vote on Tuesday on Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal deal, which has been rejected twice this year.
In the U.S., a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report submitted to Congress on Sunday concluded that President Donald Trump and his campaign did not collude with Russia in the 2016 election.
William Barr, who summarised the report for Congress, said that the evidence was not enough ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence.”
Barr cautioned that “while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him” on the obstruction of justice issue.
Trump has in the past repeatedly described the inquiry as a witch hunt.
""It was a shame that the country had to go through this"", said Trump on Sunday, adding that the inquiry was an ""illegal takedown that failed"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Optimism about the business outlook among Britain's financial services firms has fallen at its fastest rate since the 2008 financial crisis amid concerns about Britain's exit from the European Union, a survey showed on Monday. 
Business volumes among the 84 top financial firms polled have also fallen at their fastest rate since September 2012, the survey by the Confederation of British Industry and accounting firm PwC showed.
The mounting gloom from banks, insurers, fund managers and other financial firms comes as Prime Minister Theresa May battles to get her twice-rejected withdrawal agreement with the EU through a bitterly divided parliament.
The investment management industry saw the sharpest fall in growth, the CBI/PwC survey said, as investors hold on to their cash in turbulent markets, while insurance brokers were the lone bright spot.
""The alarm bells ringing at the state of optimism in the financial services sector have now reached a deafening level,"" Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist said.

Employment across financial services fell at the quickest pace in four years, the poll showed, driven mainly by job cuts in the banking sector as lenders slash branch networks and shift jobs overseas to trim costs.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2019 02:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Telecom equipment provider Avaya considers leveraged buyout - sources,"By Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - Telecommunications equipment and software vendor Avaya Holdings Corp is considering a leveraged buyout offer from a private equity firm that values it at more than $5 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The acquisition offer comes 15 months after Avaya emerged from bankruptcy protection, the legacy of a previous leveraged buyout, its $8.3 billion sale to private equity firms TPG Capital and Silver Lake in 2007.
Avaya's board of directors is evaluating an offer from a private equity firm that values it at more than $20 per share, the sources said. Avaya shares ended trading on Friday at $13.21, giving it a market capitalization of $1.5 billion. The company also had $3.2 billion in debt as of the end of December.
The identity of the private equity firm making the offer could not immediately be learned. Avaya has attracted acquisition interest from private equity firms over the last few months, and there is no certainty the latest offer will result in a deal, the sources said.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Avaya did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Based in Santa Clara, California, Avaya is one of the world's largest providers of telephony systems. It was spun off from Lucent Technologies Inc in 2000, which used to be part of AT&T Inc (NYSE:T).
Avaya, which competes with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), has been trying to boost its business of providing communications software to companies, as its hardware business became more commoditized and dated. It has also been seeking to broaden its offerings of cloud-based communications solutions.
Software and services accounted for 83 percent of Avaya's revenue of $738 million in the three months to the end of December. That was down from $752 million in the year-ago period. The company blamed currency exchange rates and the U.S. federal government partial shutdown for the weaker earnings.
Operating income was $50 million, up from $38 million a year ago. 

Avaya's contact center business, which powers the customer care and sales operations of some of the world’s biggest companies, has also attracted acquisition interest in the past from private equity firms, including Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC, Hellman & Friedman LLC and Permira Advisers LLP. Hellman & Friedman and Permira own Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories Inc, a U.S. provider of call center software.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - An Ethiopian Airlines executive questioned whether Boeing (NYSE:BA) had told pilots enough about ""aggressive"" software that pushes a plane's nose down, a focus of investigation into a deadly crash in Ethiopia this month.
Comments by the CEO and vice president of the airline this weekend will fuel a debate over the safety of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft, two of which have crashed in similar circumstances in the last five months.
Ethiopian Airlines, Africa's most profitable airline, has robustly defended its own safety record, training and procedures after the crash on March 10 that killed 157 people.
Attention has focused on software called Maneuver Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, and the sensors that activate it. MCAS pushes the plane's nose down if it believes it is ascending at too steep an angle. 
""After the crash it came to our attention that the system is aggressive,"" Yohannes Hailemariam, vice president for flight operations at Ethiopian, told local reporters speaking in the Amharic language.
""It gives a message of stalling and it takes immediate action which is faster than the action which pilots were briefed to take by Boeing,"" said Yohannes, himself a pilot with over 30 years of experience, including flying Boeing's 777 and 787.
Boeing has repeatedly refused to comment on the crash citing rules set out by the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which limit what those involved, other than the airline, say during a crash investigation. 
LOW ALTITUDE
The Ethiopian Airlines crash and an October crash by Indonesia's Lion Air killed 346 people in total and sparked the biggest crisis in decades for Boeing. 
The company has lost about $28 billion from its market share and the MAX -- its best selling plane ever -- is now grounded with questions over orders worth more than $500 billion.
If MCAS activates at low altitude, it gives pilots little time to react, Yohannes said. Both crashes involving the 737 MAX 8 happened minutes after take-off. 
Yohannes noted that the manufacturer had issued a bulletin to the industry after the Lion Air crash.
""All pilots and operators knew about MCAS after Boeing disclosed that,"" he said.
""The bulletin shows procedures for how to stop it when this happens, but it doesn't have training.""
The airline followed up with computer-based training which took cockpit crew one to two hours, Yohannes said.
ORDERS IN DOUBT
Teams from the three U.S. airlines that own 737 MAX jets were also heading to Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington over the weekend to review a software upgrade.
In a sign of the effect on Boeing's business, Indonesia's Garuda wants to dump a $6 billion order for 49 of the grounded planes. 
Garuda rival Lion Air is also weighing what to do its order - 190 Boeing jets worth $22 billion at list prices.
At the same news conference, Ethiopia Airline's chief executive rejected media reports that optional equipment for Boeing 737 MAX planes could have prevented this month's crash. 
Boeing offered airlines an optional indicator to show if two sensors showing the steepness of the ascent - the so-called ""angle of attack"" sensors - disagreed with each other, which would indicate a faulty sensor. 
Some media reports have questioned whether having this installed may have helped the Ethiopian Airlines cockpit crew regain control of flight ET 302.
CEO Tewolde Gebremariam said it was important not to confuse safety-critical equipment with optional items.
""When Boeing supplies aircraft there are items which are mandatory for safety and then there are optional items,"" he said. ""The angle of attack indicator was on the optional list along with the inflight entertainment system.""

He echoed the words of Norwegian Air which said it had not selected the cockpit light warning of discrepancies between angle of attack sensors for its fleet of 18 MAX 8 aircraft.

American, the largest U.S. carrier, said it is cancelling about 90 flights a day. American is the second-largest U.S. operator of the MAX in the United States with 24 jets, behind Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) with 34.
American said earlier this month it was flying about 85 flights a day out of its 6,700 daily departures on 737 MAX planes when the grounded was announced.
The airline said it was making the announcement ""to provide more certainty to our customers and team members and better protect our customers on other flights to their final destination.""
 Boeing Co  is expected as early as Monday to formally disclose a planned upgrade to its anti-stall system to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that has been in the works since October's Lion Air crash but still needs approval from U.S. regulators. 
The FAA has said it plans to mandate the upgrade by April, but it is still not clear if the upgrade will address any issues after the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash. 
American, Southwest and United Airlines were all meeting with Boeing this weekend to review the software upgrade, Reuters reported Saturday. 
The FAA said earlier the ""design changes"" would result in flight control system enhancements that will provide ""reduced reliance on procedures associated with required pilot memory items.""

Reuters reported Thursday the upgrade will include a previously optional warning light. Many airlines, including American, already had the optional light.

Bayer (DE:BAYGN), which denies allegations that glyphosate or Roundup cause cancer, acquired  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), the maker of Roundup, for $63 billion last year.
Its shares have fallen a third over the last 12 months burdened by thousands of lawsuits over a suspected cancer link to Roundup.
""The share price is significantly impacted by the legal cases related to glyphosate in America, the discounts are greatly exaggerated,"" Chief Executive Werner Baumann told Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS).
""The management board enjoys the full backing of the supervisory board,"" added Baumann, who has been Bayer CEO for almost three years.
A U.S. jury last week found that Roundup caused cancer, a blow to the company eight months after another jury issued a $289 million verdict over similar claims in a different case. That award was later reduced to $78 million and is on appeal.
Baumann defended Bayer's move to acquire Monsanto, saying it ""was and is a good idea"", according to the FAS interview.
Asked about a potential breakup of Bayer, Baumann said the group had a clear strategy based on three divisions -- pharmaceuticals, crop science and consumer health. 
""We want to strategically develop these three pillars, all three markets are attractive.""

Talk of a break-up has been fueled since it emerged in December that activist fund Elliott had taken a stake.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Teams from the three U.S. airlines that own 737 MAX jets headed to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's factory in Renton, Washington, to review a software upgrade on Saturday, as U.S. regulators prepared to receive and review the fixes in coming weeks. 
The factory visits indicated Boeing may be near completing a software patch for its newest 737 following a Lion Air crash that killed 189 people in Indonesia last October. This month, a second deadly crash involving an Ethiopian Airlines MAX in Addis Ababa triggered the fleet's worldwide grounding. 
Timing for when passenger flights will resume remained uncertain. Boeing has come under global scrutiny along with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the agency that must approve the software fix and new training.
Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, the world's largest operator of the MAX, began parking its fleet at a facility in Victorville, California, at the southwestern edge of the Mojave Desert, to wait out the global grounding. Southwest has 34 of the jets; United Airlines has 14 and American Airlines has 24.
Acting administrator Dan Elwell told lawmakers last week that the FAA expected Boeing would complete its upgrade as early as March 25, kicking off the approval process.
An FAA spokesman said Saturday that the agency expects to receive the software fix early next week.
A U.S. official briefed on the matter Saturday said the FAA has not yet signed off on the upgrade and training but the goal is to review them in coming weeks and approve them by April.
It remained unclear whether the software upgrade, called ""design changes"" by the FAA, will resolve concerns stemming from the ongoing investigation into the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash, which killed all 157 on board. 
The U.S. official said planned changes included 15 minutes of training to help pilots deactivate the anti-stall system known as MCAS in the event of faulty sensor data or other issues. It also included some self-guided instruction, the official added.
The Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents American Airlines pilots, said it has been in talks with Boeing, the FAA and airlines to get the airplanes flying again as soon as possible with an acceptable level of safety.
""Right now we're in wait-and-see mode to see what Boeing comes up with,"" said Captain Jason Goldberg, spokesman for the APA, part of a delegation of airline safety experts and pilots set to test the upgrade. ""We're hopeful, but at the same time the process can't be rushed.""
Boeing said on Saturday it was continuing to schedule meetings with all 737 MAX operators.

Southwest and United said they would also review documentation and training associated with Boeing's updates on Saturday.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The southern Indian state of Karnataka kept the door open on Saturday to talks with local ride-hailing service Ola to avoid a ban that could help rival Uber build market share.
Karnataka earlier this week issued a notice to suspend Ola's license for six months for violating government rules by running motorcycle taxis which are not allowed for safety reasons.
State capital and technology hub Bengaluru is among Ola's top three markets in India.
V. P. Ikkeri, state commissioner for transport and road safety, told reporters the department had seized and issued fines for about 258 bikes during a probe after complaints.
Ola's permit, obtained in 2017 and valid to 2021, allows it to run three and four-wheeler taxis in Karnataka. The company, backed by SoftBank Group Corp and Tencent Holdings Ltd, has until Monday to respond to the suspension notice.
""It's a temporary suspension and if they give us a satisfactory response, then we won't need to implement the ban,"" Ikkeri said, adding that Ola would face financial penalties.
Ola did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
It could lose out badly to Uber if pushed out of the market for an extended period.
""If Uber comes up with a strategy to lock in some of the drivers or customers with more incentives, it will be difficult for Ola to make a comeback,"" said Neil Shah, partner and research director at Counterpoint Research. 
""Assuming the top three (Indian) markets contribute to roughly 35-40 percent of Ola's revenues, if the ban is upheld, we could be looking at a 5-10 percent revenue hit to the company.""
On Friday, the company said it was evaluating all options to find an ""amicable solution"" and was working closely with the authorities.

Ikkeri also said the department had sent a notice about penalties to the last known address of Rapido, another motorcycle taxi operator in Bengaluru. Rapido could not be reached for comment despite multiple attempts by Reuters.

538,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2019 08:39AM ET</span>",Venezuela's Guaido says Maduro is in his final phase,"By Diego Oré
LECHERIA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's administration has reached its final stage and there will soon be a change in government, opposition leader Juan Guaido said, adding that his allies have spoken with high-ranking military members about changing sides.
In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Guaido said Maduro had lost the ability to ""finance political blackmail"" to retain power thanks to pressure brought by foreign governments who have recognized him as the South American country's rightful leader in the midst of a hyperinflationary economic collapse. 
""They are isolated, alone, they are falling apart day by day,"" Guaido, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, said in Lecheria, a city in northeastern Anzoategui state, where he held several rallies with supporters over the weekend. 
""The citizens do not like them, they reject them, they hate them, because that is what they have received from them: hate."" 
Venezuela plunged into a deep political crisis in January, when Guaido invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing Maduro's May 2018 re-election was illegitimate. He has been recognized by most Western countries, including the United States, as Venezuela's rightful leader.
Maduro, a socialist, says Guaido is a puppet of the United States and is attempting to lead a coup against him to wrest control of the OPEC nation's oil reserves, the largest in the world. He retains control of state functions and the loyalty of the military top brass. 
But Guaido said that hold was slipping thanks in part to pressure from abroad. The United States slapped sanctions on state oil company PDVSA in January, and on Friday sanctioned several state-run banks in Venezuela. Guaido has also taken control of U.S. refiner Citgo, a PDVSA subsidiary and the country's most important overseas asset.
""The diplomatic pressure has worked, the economic pressure and the pressure on assets have worked,"" Guaido said. 
'WHAT'S MISSING?' 
Shortly after assuming the interim presidency, Guaido offered amnesty to members of the military who took his side. While hundreds have deserted, with many fleeing to neighboring Colombia, the top brass has stood by Maduro's side.
Guaido estimated that between 80-85 percent of military members were ""convinced of the need for a change in Venezuela,"" and that his team has been meeting with higher-ranking members.
""What's missing? That the leadership, the high command of the armed forces, take the side of the constitution,"" he said. 
The 35-year-old engineer, who had a low profile before assuming the presidency of the National Assembly this year, said he was prepared for more members of his team to be detained after his chief of staff, Roberto Marrero, was arrested on Thursday under accusations of terrorism.
Venezuela's Supreme Court has initiated an investigation of Guaido on the grounds that he had helped foreign countries interfere in internal matters. During a prolonged blackout this month, the chief prosecutor has asked that he be probed for alleged involvement in ""sabotage"" of the country's electrical system.
Guaido said Maduro's aim was ""to generate fear.""
""The risk of participating in politics in Venezuela is your life, your freedom, and the persecution of those closest to you,"" Guaido said. 
He added that his team is evaluating ""all the options"" to possibly make a payment of some $72 million on PDVSA bonds that come due in April. The bonds have shares in Citgo as collateral, and a failure to make payment could allow creditors to seize part of the company.

Guaido said his team has also been in touch with companies whose Venezuelan assets were expropriated by the late former President Hugo Chavez, Maduro's mentor and predecessor, about returning to the country should Maduro leave power.

The names of the traders against whom actions were taken were not immediately known. 
Citi said it was fully compliant with relevant local regulations, and ""enhanced regional procedures and controls for facilitation trading"" had been introduced to ensure complete transparency. 
The bank, which has a large presence in markets, corporate and investment banking businesses in Asia, said its clients had been notified about the development and a team was in place to ensure minimal disruption at the start of trading on Monday. 
Bloomberg first reported the development on Friday. 
Global banks have been beefing up compliance procedures in Hong Kong, as the securities regulator in the Asian financial hub has stepped up its crackdown against failures to comply with guidelines for equities trading and underwriting functions.

Last week, the regulator banned UBS from leading IPOs in the city for a year, while fining it and rivals, including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), a combined $100 million for due diligence failures on a series of stock listings.

540,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 23, 2019 04:41AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Dow Makes a Golden Cross
If you weren’t watching technical indicators this week, you may have missed strong signal for blue-chip stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average triggered a signal called the golden cross, which is bullish near term.
A golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The Dow’s 50-day moving average moved above its 200-day moving average on Tuesday.
This hasn’t happened since April 2016.
Technical analysts note that this isn’t just a license to go out and buy like crazy, as other market forces must be taken into consideration. But historically, the expected pattern has pretty much played out in the short term following the signal.
While ""the Dow's returns after golden crosses since 1950 aren't much to write home about, they exceed the index's returns after the ominous-sounding death cross” when the shorter-term moving averages cross below the longer-term ones, Andrea Kramer of Schaeffer’s Investment Research wrote.
By “isolating the data to look at post-golden-cross signals since 2003, the Dow was higher six months and one year later 100% of the time, with stronger-than-usual returns,” Kramer added.
2. Is Shale Making Records Highs or Shrinking?
The headline came Monday and had disappeared by the next day. U.S. oil output from seven major shale formations was expected to reach a record 8.6 million barrels per day in April, according to the Energy Information Administration.
But the oil market’s attention that day was occupied by news that OPEC had canceled an upcoming meeting in April to turn its entire focus to cutting production until another meeting scheduled in June.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak told reporters that their 24-nation alliance, OPEC+, won’t rest until it achieves what it calls market rebalancing, or, more accurately, the Saudi quest for $80 oil.
Falih said the emphasis on cuts was important, with U.S. shale oil turning out to be more prolific than thought, despite the Saudis consistently exceeding their share of the OPEC+ target to reduce at least 1.2 million bpd in supply this year.
Given Falih’s fear of shale, you would think the EIA forecast for another record high for shale would have garnered as much notice as the OPEC announcements, taking some of the wind out of oil bulls’ sails. But it barely made a ripple, and WTI and Brent crude added another chunk to bring their year-to-date gains to around 30%.
With the EIA flip-flop on production, one also wonders if hydraulically-fracked oil, or for that matter, supply of all U.S. crude, was expanding or shrinking.
In Monday’s update, the EIA said despite the peak shale production likely in April, output would only expand by 85,000 bpd, the smallest monthly increase since May 2018. And just last week, the agency revised down all of U.S. production, saying it had overestimated shale output for December through February.
With Big Oil muscling smaller drillers from U.S. shale patches for a share of the action there, it remains to be seen if the equation will change.
3. Yield Curve Inversion to Trigger Bond Proxy Purchases?
The spread between the 3-Month and 10-Year Treasury yields, the most important part of the yield curve, turned negative on Friday. It’s the first time that’s happened since the financial crisis and it raised fears a recession may be on the horizon.
While this may only be a partial inversion of the curve, other parts of the curve are flirting with an inversion or have also inverted. The 2Y/10Y spread ended day just 11 basis points from the flatline, while the 2Y through 5Y yields are inverted.
The yield curve serves as a kind of doomsday screen for the economy and when it inverts, bad things tend to happen. A yield curve inversion has preceded every recession over the past 60 years.
An inversion of the 2Y/10Y yield curve in 2000 preceded the 2001 U.S. recession and crash of the dot-com bubble. The 2008 recession was preceded by an inversion of the yield curve in 2006.
For most stocks, signs of impending economic doom can smother even the most buoyant rally, evident in the selling in high-flying tech stocks Friday. But defensive sectors like utilities, real estate and consumer staples stood firm relative to the overall selloff.
Bond-proxy stocks are often relied upon for their stable dividends in times of economic malaise, which is often characterized by paltry returns on offer from government bonds.
The SPDR S&P Dividend (NYSE:SDY) ETF, which houses many of these bond proxies, currently yields 2.49%. That is not much higher than the current 10-year yield of 2.45%.
But bond yields look vulnerable. The U.S. economy is certainly stumbling, while international growth has slowed, stagnated or, in some corners, reversed. And the Federal Reserve's dovish monetary policy message earlier this week has all but killed any hopes of a rate hike this year, further denting any hopes of firming in bond yields.

The development follows criticism from activists and John McDonnell, finance spokesman of Britain's opposition Labour Party, that high payments have led to diversion of cash from council services. 
RBS is aiming to wind down the loan portfolio by the end of the year, the newspaper report said, adding that the main method of executing the winding down is through loan redemptions. 
Such redemptions will allow clients including local authorities to pay back the loans earlier than their original contracts allowed. 
RBS did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment early on Saturday.

""We encourage China to continue to open up, we see that as essential, not only for China to reach its full potential, but for the global economy to thrive,"" Cook said at a China Development Forum in Beijing.
Despite official pledges and repeated assurances that China would continue to open its markets, some analysts worry that its reform project has slowed or even stalled under President Xi Jinping, who has sought greater control over the economy and a bigger role for state-owned firms at the expense of the private sector. 
Cook's comments come as Apple weathers sinking sales in China because of a contracting smartphone market, increasing pressure from Chinese rivals, and slowing upgrade cycles. The company reported a revenue drop of 26 percent in the greater China region during the quarter ending in December.
Before those results came out, in a January letter to investors, Cook blamed the company's poor China performance on trade tension between the United States and China, suggesting that pressure on the economy was hurting sales in China.

543,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2019 02:55AM ET</span>",Australia to boost funding for banking and corporate regulators,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's new budget will include an additional A$550 million ($390 million) to boost funding for policing the country's financial sector, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Saturday.
The funds are to boost implementation of recommendations issued earlier this year by a high-powered inquiry into financial sector greed and malpractice. 
The government-appointed inquiry, known as a Royal Commission, recommended among other things for Australia's corporate regulators to be subjected to a new oversight body and that remuneration structures across the industry be overhauled.
As part of the response to the recommendations, the government will allocate A$400 million in additional funding to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and A$150 million for the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority over the next four years. 
""A strong economy requires a strong, accountable financial sector that Australians can trust,"" Frydenberg said in a statement. The financial sector employs 450,000 people and represents nearly 10 per cent of the nation's GDP, he said. 
Australian media reported the money would come from banks and other financial institutions on top of what they already contribute to the government. 
Australia's center-right government will deliver the federal 2019/2020 budget on April 2, making it a launching pad for the general elections, due in May. 

It is also expected to announce personal income tax cuts and infrastructure spending ahead of the elections.

It was not immediately clear if a deal could be reached, sources briefed on the matter said. AT&T and Viacom declined to comment. 
The previous contract, in which AT&T paid Viacom about $1 billion in fees annually, expired at midnight Friday. Failing to reach a deal means Viacom channels would not be available to AT&T's 24.5 million customers. 
These types of conflicts have become increasingly common amid waves of media consolidation and the migration of viewers from traditional pay television services to streaming TV services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
The current discussions have weighed on any potential tie-up of CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom, both of which are controlled by the Redstone family's National Amusements Inc. 
Viacom had begun warning AT&T subscribers on Tuesday that its channels could stop being shown on the DirecTV service if it failed to reach a new contract by midnight on March 22. 
Viacom, owner of MTV, Nickelodeon, BET and Comedy Central, accused AT&T of abusing its powers after buying  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX), which owns the Warner Bros Hollywood studios and HBO premium cable network. 

AT&T has said Viacom channels are no longer as popular as they once were and accused them of being a ""serial bad actor"" in contract renewal negotiations.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 11:50PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines sending teams to review Boeing 737 MAX upgrade this weekend,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The three U.S. airlines that own Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX are meeting the U.S. manufacturer this weekend to review a software upgrade for the jet that has suffered two fatal crashes in five months, officials from the airlines told Reuters.
The meetings are a sign that Boeing's planned software patch is nearing completion, though it will still need regulatory approval.
Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) operate 34, 24 and 14 MAX jets respectively. 
Southwest's delegation includes experts from its technical pilot and training teams who will review documentation and training associated with Boeing's updated speed trim system, spokeswoman Brandy King said on Friday.
Boeing's signature jet was grounded across the world last week following a deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash near Addis Ababa on March 10, just five months after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia. 
Ethiopian and French investigators have pointed to ""clear similarities"" between the two crashes, which killed 346 people, putting pressure on Boeing and U.S. regulators to come up with an adequate fix. The causes of the crashes are still unknown.
American pilots told Reuters on Thursday that they also plan to test Boeing's software upgrade this weekend in Renton, Washington, where Boeing makes the jets and has two simulators.
United will also meet with Boeing in Renton on Saturday, spokesman Frank Benenati said.
Meanwhile, Southwest is preparing to begin moving on Saturday its entire MAX fleet to a facility in Victorville, California, at the southwestern edge of the Mojave Desert. 
""The planes being in one place will be more efficient for performing the repetitive maintenance necessary for stationary aircraft, as well as any future software enhancements that need to take place,"" King said.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration must approve Boeing's software changes as well as new pilot training, a process that could take weeks or longer. Regulators in Europe and Canada have said they will conduct their own reviews of any new systems.

Boeing shares have fallen 14 percent since the Ethiopian crash, and every day that its jets are grounded comes at a cost both to the manufacturer and the airlines that purchased them for their more fuel-efficient engines and longer range.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 11:21PM ET</span>",Philip Morris says Canadian unit RBH granted creditor protection,"(Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) on Friday said its Canadian unit, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc (RBH), was granted creditor protection, following a tobacco class action ruling in Quebec this month.
The company said it would deconsolidate RBH from its financial statements, and it cut its full-year 2019 diluted earnings per share forecast to at least $4.90 at prevailing exchange rates, from at least $5.28 in the forecast it made on March 4, shortly after the ruling in Quebec. 
The Court of Appeal of Quebec upheld the bulk of a 2015 decision that awarded about C$15 billion ($11.19 billion) to smokers in the Canadian province, a blow to several big tobacco companies, including RBH.
Some observers criticized the creditor protection calling it an attempt to avoid making payments. 
""The company's strategy is to obtain a sweetheart settlement of all tobacco lawsuits in Canada, and then to carry on business as normal"", said Rob Cunningham, senior policy analyst from the Canadian Cancer Society. 
""The company is highly profitable and is not anywhere close to bankruptcy."" 
On an adjusted basis, the current forecast for full-year 2019 represents earnings per share growth of at least 8 percent over last year, the Marlboro cigarette maker said.
The deconsolidation, which will not have an impact on the company's current annualized dividend rate, will result in an estimated one-time non-cash charge of about $0.10 per share, it said.
The operating cash flow for full-year 2019 is now estimated to be about $9.5 billion, down from ""at least $10 billion"" in the forecast it made on Feb. 7. 
The creditor protection process, granted by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, will allow RBH to carry on its business in the ordinary course, Philip Morris added.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 08:34PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Doubts increase that first quarter will be earnings low point,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Wall Street braces for what may be the first U.S. profit decline since 2016, investors say the first quarter may not mark the low point for 2019 earnings.
In the immediate term, markets could be roiled depending on what or if any information is released from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on his investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election, which was submitted to Attorney General William Barr late on Friday. 
Concerns about economic weakness in the United States and abroad and the lack of a U.S.-China trade deal are hanging over the longer-term outlook, even as the Federal Reserve's dovish stance on interest rates is expected to relieve some of the pressure on companies and the economy.
In a troubling sign for the U.S. outlook, a report on Friday showed U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly cooled in March, and the spread between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year note yields inverted for the first time since 2007. An inverted Treasury yield curve is seen as a warning of a coming recession. 
As stocks sold off in December, some investors worried 2019 would bring a profit recession for S&P 500 companies, defined as at least two quarters of year-over-year declines. The last U.S. profit recession ran from July 2015 through June of 2016.
Analysts, after cutting earnings forecasts for 2019, now expect a 1.7 percent year-over-year earnings decline in the first quarter, and some profit growth for the rest of the year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
With the Fed on pause and stocks rebounding, optimism seemed to be increasing that the profit outlook would stabilize after hitting a low point in the current quarter. Many investors say that is now less certain.
""It would be great if Q1 represented a low point, but I'm not betting on it,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago.
""I worry that the comparisons are going to be much more difficult as we navigate the rest of the year.""
This year's earnings growth already was expected to shrink dramatically compared with 2018, when steep corporate tax cuts fueled earnings gains of about 24 percent. 
Since the start of the year, the forecast for second-quarter profit growth has fallen to 3.0 percent from 6.4 percent, while estimated growth for the third quarter has dropped to 2.7 percent from 4.9 percent, based on Refinitiv's data. The fourth-quarter growth estimate has come down as well, though it is still relatively strong, at 9.1 percent.
Those numbers could keep falling, while the first-quarter forecast is likely to improve from here. Since 1994, earnings have surprised to the upside on average by 3.2 percent, according to Refinitiv data, which suggests S&P 500 companies will post an earnings gain for the first quarter.
Still, with investors largely discounting weaker profit trends, the first-quarter reporting period could bring market volatility, Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) strategists said. 
On Tuesday, FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) cut its 2019 profit forecast for the second time in three months, causing its stock to drop and raising fresh worries about the impact of the trade conflict on earnings. The company cited slowing global economic conditions and weaker trade growth.
Also, Nike's shares fell 6.61 percent on Friday after it reported North American sales that fell short of expectations.
The United States initially had a deadline to reach a deal on trade with China by March 1, but the White house has said it needs more time.
""There are real concerns. FedEx's numbers are a perfect example. There's been a global growth slowdown, and companies are communicating that in terms of their guidance for the first quarter and throughout the year,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan.
To be sure, a lot of those fears could be reversed if there is a resolution in the U.S.-China trade conflict, and if companies' first-quarter reports are not as weak as expected, he said.
Strategists said they expect to hear more from companies on the trade conflict when first-quarter reporting kicks into high gear around mid-April.

""So much is dependent on what we do with the trade situation with China. The real issue will be the global economy, and in particular, trade with China,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.

548,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 07:59PM ET</span>","Viacom, AT&T negotiations weigh on possible CBS tie-up: sources","By Helen Coster, Liana B. Baker and Kenneth Li
(Reuters) - Viacom Inc's bitter contract renewal talks with AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's DirecTV that could see the blackout of MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central by midnight Friday are weighing on a possible tie-up of CBS and Viacom, sources familiar with the discussions said.
Although the boards of CBS and Viacom have not discussed or decided on pursuing a merger, these sources say they are studying AT&T's impact on Viacom and how it affects the company's motivation to pursue a CBS merger. Viacom needs to resolve the AT&T contract before considering any other strategic moves including mergers and acquisitions, sources said.
Both companies are controlled by the Redstone family’s National Amusements Inc, which pushed for a merger last year but backed off as CBS explores other options before deciding on another run at Viacom.
Viacom would take a substantial financial hit without an AT&T deal. AT&T is Viacom’s largest distributor, representing 24.5 million total video subscribers, and was responsible for about 15 percent of Viacom’s 2018 revenue. At stake are about $2 billion annually in fees and advertising, which are seen declining in any new deal, according to Wall Street estimates.
The 2017 Viacom and  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR) renewal resulted in a 15 percent rate decrease. A similar outcome with AT&T could lead to a $156 million drop in annual affiliate fees paid by AT&T to Viacom, although some analysts have estimated an approximate 10 percent decrease this time.
Viacom and AT&T declined to comment. Negotiations continued as of Friday afternoon, sources said.
Failure to reach a deal is seen emboldening CBS and Viacom's controlling shareholder's position to put the companies together to give them better leverage in future distribution contract talks.
""Viacom’s clear need for greater negotiating leverage after being dropped by AT&T might be the final factor necessary to drive the long-speculated CBS-Viacom merger given the common control of both companies by the Redstone-controlled National Amusements,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Doug Mitchelson said in a research note this week.
If AT&T and Viacom walk away from the table, the No. 2 U.S. telecoms company's position could also be weakened, especially if it faces a combined CBS and Viacom by the end of June, when CBS's contract with AT&T expires. 
Dropping the CBS broadcast network and NFL games would be disastrous to AT&T, and they may end up paying more for Viacom channels through CBS, analysts have said.
Losing Viacom will also weaken AT&T's leverage as it faces Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co later this year, according to Mitchelson.

Shares of Viacom closed down 2.46 percent at $25.34 on Friday while AT&T shares closed flat at $31.07.

(Reuters) - Pinterest Inc, the owner of the image search website known for the food and fashion photos that its users post, filed for an initial public offering with U.S. regulators on Friday, looking to tap into a red-hot market for new stock offerings. 
The filing comes a day after jeans maker Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) & Co's blockbuster debut, and ride-hailing service providers Lyft Inc and Uber are set to pursue much-anticipated listings. Investors are anticipating 2019 may be one of the most active years ever for tech IPOs. 
Pinterest, which plans to list under the symbol ""PINS"" on the New York Stock Exchange, set a placeholder amount of $100 million to indicate the size of the IPO. The final size will change. 
Reuters reported in January Pinterest could raise around $1.5 billion and that the IPO was likely to come in the first six months of 2019.
The company was valued at $12 billion in its last fundraising round in 2017. 
The San Francisco-based company has grown rapidly since its founding in 2008, boasting in the regulatory filing that it reaches more than 250 million monthly active users, two thirds of whom are female.
Pinterest said its annual revenue in 2018 was $755.9 million, up 60 percent compared to 2017. Nevertheless, it remains unprofitable with a net loss of $62.97 million, narrowing from a net loss of $130 million a year earlier.
Like Lyft, Pinterest plans to go public with a dual-class share structure to concentrate voting power with Class B shareholders, which include co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Silbermann.
However, Pinterest said Class B shares will automatically convert into common shares seven years after the IPO. This conversion will not take effect if these Class B stockholders continue to own at least 50 percent of their shares held at the time of the IPO.
This follows a trade group representing top U.S. pension funds and asset managers asking exchanges to require companies seeking to go public with share classes with unequal voting rights to have plans to equalize them within seven years.
Investors focused on corporate governance have criticized dual-class share structures after the likes of Snapchat parent  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and meal-kit maker Blue Apron Holdings Inc went public since with little or no voting representation for certain investors.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JP Morgan are the lead underwriters on the Pinterest IPO.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 07:00PM ET</span>",Musk's lawyers call tweet in SEC's contempt bid 'not material',"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Elon Musk's lawyers said that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission failed to satisfy its heavy burden of showing that the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive should be held in contempt, and the tweet prompting its contempt motion was both proper and ""not material.""
In a Friday filing in Manhattan federal court, Musk's lawyers also said their client ""respects his obligations"" to the electric car company, its shareholders and the court.
Musk is trying to avoid being held in contempt for violating his October 2018 fraud settlement with the SEC, for having tweeted at 7:15 p.m. EST on Feb. 19 to his over 24 million Twitter followers that Tesla could build around 500,000 vehicles in 2019.
SEC spokesman Ryan White declined to comment.
Musk's settlement, including $20 million civil fines for both him and Tesla, resolved an SEC lawsuit over an Aug. 7, 2018 Twitter post in which Musk said he had ""funding secured"" to take his Palo Alto, California-based company private at $420 a share.
The SEC said Musk committed a ""blatant"" violation of that settlement by tweeting about Tesla's production outlook without first seeking approval from the company's lawyers.
In a Monday filing, the SEC went farther, complaining that Musk had never after the settlement sought pre-approval for any Tesla-related tweets.
But in Friday's filing, Musk's lawyers said the SEC had conceded during settlement talks that Tesla-related tweets were not subject to a broad pre-approval requirement.
They also said the tweet was not material because it simply restated old news, used generalities, was ""aspirational and optimistic,"" and did not move Tesla's share price.
""The key question is whether Musk complied with Tesla's policy, not whether the SEC is satisfied with Tesla's policy,"" Musk's lawyers wrote. ""Musk's belief that the 7:15 tweet did not require pre-approval was correct.""
Musk has until March 26 to tell U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan whether he wants an evidentiary hearing on the contempt motion. The SEC has said no hearing is necessary.
The October settlement required Musk to step down as Tesla's chairman. Legal experts said a contempt finding could subject him to a higher fine, further restrictions on his activities, or even removal from Tesla's board or as chief executive.
Tesla shares closed Friday down $9.49, or 3.5 percent, at $264.53. They are 32 percent below their peak set on Aug. 7, after the ""funding secured"" tweet.

The case is SEC v Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 18-08865.

551,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 06:30PM ET</span>",Canada's SNC Lavalin eyes ways to protect business amid political crisis,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - SNC Lavalin Group's chief executive said on Friday the company is looking at ways to protect its business in the event it loses a corruption trial that has created a political crisis for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
An SNC-Lavalin board subcommittee is weighing the construction and engineering company's options as it takes ""steps to minimize the effect of any potential sort of bad outcome in a few years' time,"" chief executive Neil Bruce told Reuters in an interview.
Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that the construction company avoided a corruption trial. Trudeau has denied the allegations.
At the affair's center is a request by SNC-Lavalin for a remediation agreement that would have enabled it to avoid a court case which, if lost, would block it from federal government contracts for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is facing fraud and corruption charges related to allegations that former executives paid bribes to win contracts in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, which fell in 2011.
Bruce said SNC is now focused on defending itself in court, with little expectation that a remediation would become available. Any court decision which would likely be years away.
""We don’t want to be reacting too late or not early enough if the worst came to the worst,"" he said. ""We’ve got to be prudent and make sure that we position the company.""
Being blocked from federal contracts would raise the threat of job cuts among the company's Canadian workforce of 9,000. 
""If we were in a position where for whatever reason we couldn't do work with a certain customer or in a certain country then we would plan all of that and make sure that our business development efforts and the work we were chasing and hopefully winning didn't fall into that category. That's part of the mitigation plan.""
Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, but Bruce told the CBC earlier this week that he never gave a specific number.
SNC wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted. 
Bruce said the political issue engulfing the Liberals has ""very little to do"" with the Montreal-based company whose backlog of about C$15 billion ($11.17 billion) is expected to rise during the first quarter.
But politics impacted SNC's ability to win new work in Saudi Arabia in December and January, amid tense relations between Riyadh and Ottawa. Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Ottawa in August after Canada demanded the release of jailed rights activists.
""Generally we would expect to win sometimes one in two, sometimes one in three,"" he said. ""And that actually went down to zero in a couple of areas.""
While the dispute has not impacted current contracts underway in Saudi Arabia, Bruce said SNC's backlog in the country would taper off toward the end of the year if it didn't win any new contracts in 2019.

The CEO also said an accelerated arbitration process around a delayed Chile project, which hit results from its mining unit in the fourth quarter, would likely not be resolved in 2019.

WASHINGTON/JAKARTA (Reuters) - A U.S. lawmaker on Friday urged current or former Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees to come forward with any information about the certification program for the 737 MAX, which has suffered two fatal crashes in five months.
Boeing and the FAA are under global regulatory scrutiny over software and training on the signature aircraft. Boeing risked losing a $6 billion order for the jet on Friday, its first since the world's entire fleet was grounded last week. 
Indonesian airline Garuda said it plans to scrap its order because some passengers are afraid to board the plane, although industry analysts said the deal was already in doubt.
In the United States, the chairman of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Peter DeFazio urged people to use the committee's whistleblower web page. 
""It is imperative we continue to ensure we have the highest level of safety for the traveling public,"" DeFazio said.
American Airlines pilots were preparing to test Boeing's planned software upgrade for an anti-stall system on MAX simulators this weekend, saying they want their own safety guarantees on the software fix.
The 737 MAX was Boeing's fastest selling jet before an Ethiopian Airlines crash near Addis Ababa on March 10, which followed a Lion Air crash in Indonesia on Oct. 29.
Ethiopian and French investigators have pointed to ""clear similarities"" between the two crashes, which killed 346 people, putting pressure on Boeing and U.S. regulators to come up with an adequate fix. No direct link has been proven between the crashes but attention has focused on whether pilots had the correct information about the ""angle of attack"" at which the wing slices through the air.
    Ethiopia has shared limited information with foreign investigators, Reuters reported on Thursday, and an industry source said Boeing had not yet received any black box and voice recorder data.
Meanwhile, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, on Friday raised concerns in a letter to the FAA about regulations that allow aircraft manufacturers to effectively self-certify the safety of their planes and ""left the fox guarding the henhouse.""
The FAA declined to comment.
The U.S. Justice Department opened a separate investigation this week. The FBI has declined comment.
Garuda CEO Ari Askhara told Reuters on Friday: ""Many passengers told us they were afraid to get on a MAX 8."" 
However, the airline had been reconsidering its order for 49 of the narrowbody jets before the Ethiopian crash, including potentially swapping some for widebody Boeing models. 
Southeast Asia faces a glut of narrowbody aircraft like the 737 MAX and rival Airbus A320neo at a time of slowing global economic growth and high fuel costs. 
""They have been re-looking at their fleet plan anyway so this is an opportunity to make some changes that otherwise may be difficult to do,"" CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said.
Indonesia's Lion Air has also said it might cancel 737 MAX aircraft, though industry sources say it is also struggling to absorb the number of planes on order.
RETROFITS
Boeing now plans to make compulsory a light to alert pilots when sensor readings of the angle of attack do not match - meaning at least one must be wrong -, according to two officials briefed on the matter. 
Investigators suspect a faulty angle-of-attack reading led the doomed Lion Air jet's computer to believe it had stalled, prompting its anti-stall system, called MCAS, repeatedly to push the plane's nose down.
Norwegian Air played down the significance of the compulsory light, saying that, according to Boeing, it would not have been able to prevent erroneous signals that Lion Air pilots received before their new 737 MAX plane crashed in October.
Boeing must be cautious with how it characterizes the safety alert, risking legal claims by saying it could have made a difference in the crash while not wanting to suggest that the retrofit is meaningless, legal experts said.
The Lion Air plane did not have the warning light installed, and Ethiopian Airlines did not immediately comment on whether its crashed plane had the alert.
But the Ethiopian carrier, whose reputation along with Boeing's is at stake, issued a statement on Friday emphasizing the modernity of its safety and training systems, with more than $500 million invested in infrastructure in the past five years.
The Ethiopian crash has set off one of the widest inquiries in aviation history and cast a shadow over the Boeing 737 MAX model intended to be a standard for decades.
Boeing did not comment on the plan to make the safety feature standard, but separately said it was moving quickly to make software changes and expected the upgrade to be approved by the FAA in coming weeks.
Experts said the change needs regulatory approval and could take weeks or months. Regulators in Europe and Canada have said they will conduct their own reviews of any new systems.
Boeing shares have fallen 14 percent since the Ethiopian crash.

Appaloosa, led by billionaire David Tepper, has been pressing Allergan since last year to separate the roles, but the company has said it would do so only when the person who now holds the positions is replaced.
Brent Saunders currently holds the roles, and Allergan has said implementing Appaloosa's recommendations would be ""highly disruptive"" to the company's operations and impact his ability to continue to execute its current strategy.
Allergan also said https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1578845/000119312519083731/d633114d8k.htm in a regulatory filing on Friday that it had formed a committee to oversee mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions.
The company also named Thomas Freyman as the chair of the compensation committee, replacing Catherine Klema, who will not be standing for re-election.
A spokesman for Tepper did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company in February had named former CEO of drugmaker Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), Robert Hugin, as a director, saying the appointment reflected its commitment to ""active board refreshment"".

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.77%, the S&P 500 lost 1.90%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 2.50%.
The spread between the 3-Month and 10-Year Treasury yields turned negative for the first time since 2007, sparking widespread selling across markets.
The yield curve serves as screener for the economy. In good economic times, the yields on long-term bonds run higher than short-term bonds as investors expect a booming economy will translate into higher interest rates over the long term.
But for months analysts' have been debating whether the U.S. economy can sustain its growth in the midst of slowing growth elsewhere, particularly in China and Europe.
U.S. government bond yields were also dragged lower by a plunge in the Bund as weaker-than-expected German PMIs renewed fears the euro zone may be heading for a recession.
Financials, mostly banks, were hit the hardest by the swoon in government bond yields, which stifles banks' ability to generate net interest.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) ended the day deep in the red.
The renewed focus on slowing global growth comes just days after the Federal Reverse cut its growth outlook and signaled it would likley stand pat on interest rates through 2019.
Among corporate earnings,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) tumbled more than 6% after it posted fiscal third-quarter sales that fell just short of expectations. But Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) ended up 3.2% after its guidance for modest growth helped it claw back an earlier loss of as much as 2.8%.
Materials stocks also added fuel to selloff pressured thanks to a fall in copper futures on fears that a slowing global economic would hurt demand for industrial commodities.
In a sign of risk aversion, defensive corners of the market proved somewhat resilient as utilities rose 0.69% and consumer staples fell just 0.23%.
On the economic front, existing home sales rebounded and topped economists' estimates, pushing homebuilder stocks higher.
PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) and  Lennar  Corporation (NYSE:LEN) ended the day sharply higher.
The rebound in home sales comes as mortgage rates have slumped thanks to the Fed's ongoing pause on monetary policy tightening.
The weekly Freddie Mac survey on mortgage rates, released Thursday, showed a 4.28% rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan, down from 4.31% a week ago and 4.94% in mid-November.

It said it found that Modelo Continente, owned by Portugal's retailer Sonae, Pingo Doce, run by Jeronimo Martins, and France's Auchan and Intermarche aligned prices for beer and beverages distributed by Heineken-owned Central de Cervejas e Bebidas and by the local Super Bock Group. 
The four supermarket chains, as well as the local units of Germany's Lidl and France's E.Leclerc, also used the same scheme with the Portuguese wine and liquor distributor Prime Drinks, the authority said.
""If confirmed, that conduct is very serious,"" the competition authority said in a statement late on Friday, adding that the case was one of the first ""hub-and-spoke"" schemes to be investigated in Portugal. 
""This practice is equivalent to a cartel where distributors, without communicating between themselves, resort to bilateral contracts with suppliers to promote and guarantee that all practice the same public price in the retail market.""
Central de Cervejas e Bebidas denied any wrongdoing and said in a statement that it would cooperate with the authority to prove that it had acted in line with anti-trust rules. 
Pingo Doce also denied wrongdoing and said it was surprised by the accusations because half of its revenues come from promotional campaigns, in which prices are often discounted. 
Nobody was available for comment at the other companies.

The competition authority said it would not pre-judge the final outcome of the investigation, and that the companies will have an opportunity to defend themselves. It did not say what sanctions they could face.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will next week urge EU countries to share more data to tackle cybersecurity risks related to 5G networks but will ignore U.S. calls to ban Huawei Technologies, four people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
European digital chief Andrus Ansip will present the recommendation on Tuesday. While the guidance does not have legal force, it will carry political weight which can eventually lead to national legislation in European Union countries.
The United States has lobbied Europe to shut out Huawei, saying its equipment could be used by the Chinese government for espionage. Huawei has strongly rejected the allegations and earlier this month sued the U.S. government over the issue.
Ansip will tell EU countries to use tools set out under the EU directive on security of network and information systems, or NIS directive, adopted in 2016 and the recently approved Cybersecurity Act, the people said.
For example, member states should exchange information and coordinate on impact assessment studies on security risks and on certification for internet-connected devices and 5G equipment.
The Commission will not call for a European ban on global market leader Huawei, leaving it to EU countries to decide on national security grounds.
""It is a recommendation to enhance exchanges on the security assessment of digital critical infrastructure,"" one of the sources said.
The Commission said the recommendation would stress a common EU approach to security risks to 5G networks.
The EU executive's guidance marks a tougher stance on Chinese investment after years of almost unfettered European openness to China, which controls 70 percent of the global supply of the critical raw materials needed to make high-tech goods.
The measures, if taken on board, will be part of what French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday was a ""European awakening"" about potential Chinese dominance, after EU leaders held a first-ever discussion about China policy at a summit. 
Germany this month set tougher criteria for all telecoms equipment vendors, without singling out Huawei and ignoring U.S. pressure. 
Big telecoms operators oppose a Huawei ban, saying such a move could set back 5G deployment in the bloc by years. In contrast, Australia and New Zealand have stopped operators using Huawei equipment in their networks.
The industry sees 5G as the next money spinner, with its promise to link up everything from vehicles to household devices.

Alongside from the Huawei issue, the bloc also plans to discuss Chinese subsidies, state involvement in the Chinese economy and more access to the Chinese market at an EU-China summit on April 9.

“I think Paulson has a valid point,” said Joe Foster, a portfolio manager at VanEck -- one of the biggest Newmont shareholders. When the deal was inked, investors were unaware of the “outrageous payouts” that would be given to Goldcorp executives after the merger, he said.
On top of that, it’s unfair that Goldcorp shareholders should benefit from a joint venture between Newmont and Barrick Gold Corp. in Nevada, given that was negotiated after the Goldcorp-Newmont terms were set, he said.
Mounting investor concerns sent Goldcorp shares tumbling as much as percent in New York, while Newmont pared losses and rose as much as 1.4 percent.
On Thursday, Paulson said it won’t support Newmont’s proposed merger with Goldcorp unless the terms are changed. Paulson said a 23 percent reduction in the value of the transaction would help ease his concerns because under the current deal, Goldcorp shareholders are effectively receiving the benefits of the recently announced joint venture for free.
‘Aggressive’ Analysis
“I think Paulson’s analysis might be aggressive, but I think directionally they have the right idea,” Foster said in a telephone interview Friday. “I don’t think shareholders should support the lavish lifestyles of the Goldcorp executives for one thing. And secondly, Goldcorp shareholders are not entitled to the JV synergies because it was not part of the deal.”
Shareholders including VanEck had previously blasted the increase in Goldcorp Chairman Ian Telfer’s retirement allowance to roughly $12 million from $4.5 million if the company completes its merger with Newmont. Initially, the plan was for Telfer to join Newmont’s board as deputy chairman. But earlier this month, Goldcorp announced he wouldn’t accept the new job.
British Columbia Investment Management Corp., which holds 3.85 million shares in Goldcorp and a small stake in Newmont, said Friday it would vote against the merger partly because of the payment that would go to Telfer. “This is inconsistent with the governance principle of pay-for-performance and sets a troubling precedent in the capital markets,” BCI said in a statement.
“We just received the letter and are evaluating it,” Omar Jabara, a Newmont spokesman, said Thursday by email, referring to Paulson’s concerns. Newmont didn’t respond to requests for comment Friday. The miner has previously said a merger with Goldcorp would create more than $4.4 billion in value. The combined company would be the world’s largest gold miner, with sustainable production of 6 million to 7 million ounces a year.
Foster said he has not yet decided whether he will vote for the deal. VanEck held 5.9 percent of Newmont shares and about 6.2 percent of Goldcorp shares outstanding at the end of 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At Thursday’s closing prices, that Newmont stake would is valued at $1.08 billion versus $596.4 million for the Goldcorp stake.
Newmont investors who held shares as of the Feb. 20 record date will be allowed to vote on the merger on April 11, according to Newmont’s proxy materials. A spokesman for Paulson said the hedge fund acquired 14.2 million shares this year but declined to comment on whether they were purchased before or after the record date.
April 4 Vote
Goldcorp shareholders are scheduled to vote on the deal April 4. Paulson sold its entire position in Goldcorp in 2019 for the reasons explained in the statement, the spokesman said. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, Paulson held about 800,000 shares of Goldcorp at the end of 2018.
Greenwood Village, Colorado-based Newmont’s offer was made just months after Goldcorp shares hit their lowest level since 2002.
The tie-up was also harshly criticized by Barrick during a hostile bid for Newmont in the past month, which has since been withdrawn in favor of the joint venture between the two companies. Barrick CEO Mark Bristow said he didn’t believe the Newmont-Goldcorp combination created any value and called Goldcorp’s assets “less than attractive.”
Under the current terms, Newmont would create more value by not merging, once the joint venture with Barrick is created, Paulson said. It also flagged “remarkably” divergent fourth-quarter results for both Newmont and Goldcorp, announced after the merger. The premium is “unjustified” given Vancouver-based Goldcorp’s poor performance, the hedge fund said.
“I’m not going to prescribe what the company should or shouldn’t do,” Foster said. “I’m sure Newmont is looking at all the options and I’m sure Newmont wants to do what’s fair for shareholders.”

561,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 02:53PM ET</span>",Brazil markets lashed as storm clouds gather over Bolsonaro,"By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Standing beside U.S. President Donald Trump on a crisp afternoon outside the White House in Washington this week, a smiling Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro enjoyed a moment in the sun. 
Less than three months since taking office and with the Brazilian stock market at a record above 100,000 points, the former army captain was cementing his place on the world stage. He is following his U.S. trip with visits to Chile and Israel.
Back home, however, a political, economic and market storm was brewing that would turn the week into one of the most foreboding for his young administration, which has been slow to confront the mounting challenges to his ambitious reform agenda.
Brazilian financial markets reeled at the arrest of former president Michel Temer on corruption charges on Thursday and the unveiling on Wednesday of cuts in the military budget that were much more modest than expected. An opinion poll also showed plunging support for Bolsonaro's government.
Even before the latest developments, investors were uneasy about a global slowdown and a string of Brazilian economic indicators showing the tepid recovery from a 2015-16 recession is losing steam. The central bank took a dovish turn this week and the government cut its 2019 growth forecasts.
The Bovespa stock index shed 5 percent this week, its biggest weekly loss since August. On Friday, the 10-year bond yield jumped more than 25 basis points and the real slumped 2.5 percent, both their biggest moves since November.

(GRAPHIC: Brazil's 10-year bond yield - daily change - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UOvw5p) 
(GRAPHIC: Brazilian real - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UR8sTk) 
Investors are more focused than ever on Bolsonaro's signature proposal to overhaul the pension system in hopes of shoring up public finances, boosting growth and generating over 1 trillion reais ($257 billion) of savings over the next decade.
""The next three to four months are crucial for the country,"" XP Investimentos credit analysts wrote in a note to clients on Friday, adding they remained optimistic that ""transformational"" reform will be passed. 
""However, we anticipate volatility, with tough negotiations ahead for pension reform and a series of risks that may increase tensions, like we saw this week,"" they said.
ALL EYES ON PENSIONS
Economists, traders, analysts, politicians and central bankers agree Brazil's economic fate lies largely with pension reform, and progress on that front appears to be slowing.
The Temer scandal has the potential to damage the pension reform drive. A close Temer confidant, who was also arrested, is married to the mother-in-law of Rodrigo Maia, speaker of the lower house of Congress and chief architect of the coalition to pass pension reform.
Investors were also underwhelmed by a government proposal on military pensions that would save around a tenth of what was promised last month due to salary hikes. That raised the prospect of other groups hardening demands in negotiations.
""This could create challenges for the administration in Congress as they were arguing this is a reform that fights privileges from public servants,"" wrote  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists.
Bolsonaro's eroding support will also make it harder for him to close the deal on pension reform. An Ibope poll this week showed his government's popularity plummeted to the worst approval rating at this early stage of any administration since Brazil returned to democracy three decades ago.
All of that has investors and policymakers putting off hopes for a more robust economic recovery.
In keeping interest rates at a record low of 6.50 percent this week, the central bank highlighted the economy's weak performance and downgraded the inflation threat level. 
On Friday, the Economy Ministry also cut their 2019 forecasts for growth, inflation, average interest rates and the real's average exchange rate.

562,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>",Brazilian Assets Tumble With Deja Vu of Crumbling Pension Reform,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazilian assets extended losses Friday on concern that plans to overhaul the pension system, seen as key in fixing the country’s fiscal accounts, will be bogged down in a political quagmire for months.
The arrest of former President Michel Temer and one of his cabinet members sent shock-waves through the nation’s capital Thursday and cast a shadow over negotiations on the pension bill. Local media reported Friday that Lower House Speaker Rodrigo Maia, a key ally in getting the controversial bill passed, was threatening to walk out on negotiations.
“Investors that were already feeling jittery about the bill’s passage are now starting to wonder if we’ll see yet another failure on this front,” said Ilya Gofshteyn, a strategist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN). “This likely makes the eventual passage of the reform both more tenuous and less substantive.”
The real fell as much as 2.8 percent, erasing gains for the year, while the Ibovespa dropped 2.7 percent, one of the biggest drops among major benchmarks. Bond risk measured by five year credit-default swaps rose for a third day, on track for the worst week since August. The selloff also comes amid a broad slide in emerging markets after disappointing data in Germany sparked concern over weak global growth.
“The reaction in prices is clearly a reflection that the market is super long Brazil,” said Sean Newman, a portfolio manager at Invesco Advisers in Atlanta. “It’s a typical rush through the needle-hole-sized exit.”
Maia’s apparent discontent with the government isn’t the first hiccup the reform suffered this week. The proposal presented by President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration to overhaul military pensions was seen as too lenient, which could complicate approval for the broader reform. Moreover, procedures in the first committee in the Lower House to analyze the pension bill were delayed as newspapers reported no lawmaker wants to be in charge.
Still, investors and political analysts say it’s too early to say the reform is dead.
Investors have seen this before. In May 2017, the government was close to getting enough support for its pension bill after months of negotiations, when tapes of then-President Temer allegedly endorsing the payment of hush-money to the imprisoned former speaker of the lower house of Congress emerged. The scandal sent markets tumbling, triggering circuit breakers as investors fled on the prospect of another government change. Temer survived, but spent the rest of his term fighting off corruption charges.
“We are turning a bit more cautious,"" said Delphine Arrighi, a money manager at Old Mutual in London. “We always knew negotiations would be difficult and it looks like the negotiations are now starting in earnest. We believe the future of the reform does not depend so much on Maia, but on the government’s ability to adjust its proposal.”

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes tumbled about 2 percent on Friday after a raft of weak manufacturing data from the United States and Europe led to an inverted yield curve, stoking fears of an economic slowdown.
Manufacturers in Europe, Japan and the United States suffered in March as surveys showed trade tensions had impacted factory output, a setback for hopes the global economy might be turning the corner on its slowdown.
This led to the spread between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year note yields inverting for the first time since 2007. An inverted yield curve is widely understood to be a leading indicator of recession. 
""Right now there are clearly enough signs to be cautious about a number of factors that can potentially cause an economic recession,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas. 
""It doesn't guarantee it,"" Frederick said, ""but if multiple other pieces of data show the same thing then it just increases the chances.""
Financial stocks took the biggest hit, tumbling 2.94 percent, the most among the 11 main S&P sectors. The banking sector plunged 4 percent.
The Federal Reserve earlier this week abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year, as policymakers see U.S. economy rapidly losing momentum.
Trade worries too added to the uncertainty. While U.S. trade delegates head to Beijing next week, President Donald Trump said a final agreement with China ""will probably happen."" 
Chipmakers, which get a huge chunk of their revenue from China, fell. The Philadelphia chip index was down 2.29 percent, while the broader technology sector declined 1.64 percent.
At 12:44 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 449.97 points, or 1.73 percent, at 25,512.54. The S&P 500 was down 52.68 points, or 1.85 percent, at 2,802.20 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 175.96 points, or 2.24 percent, at 7,663.00.
The three main indexes were on track to wipe out gains for the week. This follows a strong run in the prior week, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq recording their biggest weekly rise of the year.
Only the defensive utilities, real estate and consumer staples sectors were trading higher.
 Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) dropped 5.5 percent after the sportswear maker's quarterly revenue failed to beat Wall Street estimates. Its partner  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) Inc fell 4.4 percent
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 3.71-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 5.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 54 new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and 63 new lows.

570,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 01:18PM ET</span>",Former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal joins Papa John's board,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Pizza chain Papa John's International Inc, trying to recover from a string of high-profile public relations blunders, on Friday named former basketball star Shaquille O'Neal as its newest board member, brand ambassador and investor.
The move highlights the restaurant chain's attempts to fix its image after its founder, John Schnatter, reportedly used a racial slur on a media training conference call last year. Schnatter stepped down as chairman of the Papa John's board last summer but still holds approximately 30 percent of the company's shares and has been feuding with the chain over control.
O'Neal, a popular product pitchman who was one of the National Basketball Association's best players in his prime, will invest in nine of the company's restaurants in the Atlanta area, where he lives. The star, who also owns a Krispy Kreme doughnut franchise in Atlanta and chicken restaurant Big Chicken in Las Vegas, will be paid $8.25 million for his endorsement. 
""This is a triple threat opportunity for me,"" said O'Neal, who played on four championship teams during his 19-year career, in a statement. ""I am excited to join the board and to help lead from the top.""
A representative for Schnatter said the founder declined to comment on O'Neal's appointment to the board.
Papa John's shares were up nearly 4 percent in mid-day trade.
""This is one more step in the evolution of the company, the brand and our people,"" said Papa John's Chief Executive Steve Ritchie in an interview with Reuters. ""With Shaq on the board, it's a big final step for turning the page for the company."" 
Papa John's first linked up with O'Neal shortly before the Super Bowl in February, when the restaurant chain sponsored an event he hosted in Atlanta, Ritchie said. O'Neal said he was interested in becoming a franchisee, and as Papa John's was looking to add racial diversity to its corporate board, he became a candidate as a new director, Ritchie said. 
""With expertise in restaurants and marketing, Shaq checks all these boxes,"" Ritchie said.
O'Neal's directorship on the Papa John's board is his first on a publicly traded company. He is also the pizza chain's first African-American director.
Papa John's competitor Pizza Hut, owned by Yum Brands Inc, replaced it as sponsor for the National Football League last year. Schnatter resigned as CEO in late 2017 after drawing criticism for comments he made about NFL leadership.
O'Neal is among the several new directors added to the 12-member Papa John's board this year, including Chairman Jeff Smith, the chief executive officer of Starboard Value LP. Starboard earlier this year unveiled an investment of up to $250 million in Papa John's.
To counter bad publicity, Papa John's removed Schnatter as the brand's spokesperson and from its marketing materials and pizza boxes. 
In March, the company said Schnatter was leaving the board as part of a settlement resolving the bitter dispute and would find a mutually acceptable independent director who would not be affiliated with the founder or hedge fund investor Starboard. That director has not yet been named.

O'Neal is known for his affable nature and appearing in ads for everything from Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Icy Hot balm to Radio Shack and Burger King during his playing days. After retiring from the sport, he continues to appear regularly promoting Gold Bond powder and the Carnival (NYSE:CCL) cruise line.

572,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 12:49PM ET</span>",German Bund yield crashes below zero for first time since 2016 on bleak data,"By Virginia Furness and Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Germany's 10-year bond yield dived below zero percent on Friday for the first time since October 2016, as a survey showing German manufacturing contracted for a third straight month fueled fears about a widespread European slowdown.
Those concerns were exacerbated when the U.S. manufacturing sector flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in below estimates, triggering an inversion of the U.S. bond yield curve for the first time since 2007.
In a session of eye-popping moves across major bond markets, Germany's 10-year bond yield slid over 6 basis points to minus 0.033 percent, its lowest since October 2016.
French and Dutch long-dated bond yields hit their lowest since 2016, British gilt yields fell to their lowest since September 2017 and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yields slid 10 bps to 14-month lows.
""We had tentative signs of a stabilization in the economic numbers and then the data came out today and it suggested there is no stabilization,"" said Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London.
IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index measuring activity in German services and manufacturing, which together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 51.5 in March, its lowest reading since June 2013.
The broader euro zone PMI meanwhile showed that businesses across the 19-country currency bloc have performed much worse than expected this month.
""The narrative behind it isn't a big surprise ... But the size of the surprise is fairly material. These things happen very rarely, and the surprise is what matters the most for market activity,"" said Antoine Bouvet, rates strategist at Mizuho.
The bleak data comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve this week abandoned its projections for a rate hike this year and Brexit uncertainty has grown, bolstering demand for safe-haven assets.
The ripple effects were felt across markets.
The euro fell 0.8 percent to below $1.13, while Europe's STOXX 600 index tumbled 1.3 percent. Italian bond yields rose as a ""risk-off"" mood gripped investors. On Wall Street, U.S. stocks sank 1.5 to 2 percent.
In a worrying sign for the European Central Bank, its favored market gauge of long-term inflation expectations fell to 1.4105 -- down almost 7 bps from Thursday's closing levels to its lowest since 2016.
(Graphic: German yields, euro fall after PMI link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2HzqHK5).
HOW LOW?
Concern about growing recession risks was highlighted by the move in the U.S. bond yield curve. The gap between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year note yields inverted on Friday for the first time since 2007.
In France and Germany, 30-year bond yields slid almost 10 bps each as investors moved up the government bond curve in the hope of getting some yield. They were set for their biggest daily falls since 2016.
Germany's 10-year yield last hit zero percent in October, 2016, when ECB chief Mario Draghi dispelled market concerns about tapering and said the ECB remained committed to its now-ended asset purchase program. Bund yields below zero percent show investors are willing to pay the German government to hold its long-term debt, seen among the safest of assets.
""We think Bund yields can now certainly revisit the minus 0.15 percent area which refocuses investor concerns about the growth trajectory,"" said Rabbani Wahhab, senior fixed income fund manager at London and Capital.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 12:48PM ET</span>","GM confirms plans to build new EV, invest $300 million in Michigan plant","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) confirmed on Friday it will invest $300 million in a suburban Detroit assembly plant, adding 400 jobs to build a new Chevrolet electric vehicle.
The largest U.S. automaker has come under heavy criticism from President Donald Trump in recent days over its decision to end production at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant earlier this month.
GM officials said the announcement was planned well before Trump's series of angry GM tweets that started on Saturday. Trump called GM CEO Mary Barra on Sunday to urge her to reverse the decision to end production at the Ohio plant, which is in a crucial state for the 2020 presidential election. He again ripped the company in a speech in Ohio on Wednesday.
Barra, speaking to reporters after an event at the plant in Orion Township, outside Detroit, with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing the investment, said GM is focused on ensuring that all of the hourly workers at Lordstown find new jobs at other plants. But she has shown no indication it will reverse course and reopen the Lordstown plant.
She declined to say if she thought there was more tension between GM and Trump.
""We want to create jobs, good paying jobs,"" Barra said, saying her talks with Trump had a ""business focus."" She said GM needs to remain ""strong"" in order to continue to add jobs. 
Reuters reported on Thursday on GM's investment plans for the plant. 
Last year, GM said it would end production at five North American assembly plants and eliminate about 15,000 jobs, prompting outrage and a two-day visit by Barra to Capitol Hill to answer questions about the job cuts.
GM did not disclose the name or timing of the new GM EV but said it would be built on the same platform as the existing Chevrolet Bolt EV. GM did not disclose the name of the new EV or the timing of production.
The automaker said in total it is investing $1.8 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations this year, creating 700 new jobs and supporting 28,000 jobs across six states.
Additional product information and timing for the new Chevrolet EV will be released closer to production.
Barra said after event that GM ""supports"" the proposed United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement ""and we are making adjustments because we will comply"" with new rules requiring additional North American content.
Reuters reported Thursday that GM was initially considering building the new EV in China.

On Tuesday the EU general court overturned Brussels' decision to block a 2014 rescue plan of small Italian lender Tercas, prompting compensation calls from Italian banks which argued that subsequent banking rescues in Italy were more costly because of the Commission's strict position.
""We have to draw political and juridical conclusions, including about a compensation plan,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters after a summit of EU leaders in Brussels. 
Earlier this week Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi had also flagged the possibility of a legal action against Brussels.
Conte backed Moavero's comments but called for a cautious approach as the EU Commission could also appeal the ruling, he told reporters.
Conte, whose eurosceptic government has used public funds to help Italy's ailing Carige bank and has not ruled out further support, said the Tercas ruling ""set a precedent"" which could enable a less strict application of EU banking rules.
The European Commission has said it is assessing the judgment and its consequences on future interventions.
Seven banks have been rescued in Italy since the Tercas case, including Banca Monte dei Paschi, the world's oldest lender still in operation, and a smaller bank in Tuscany whose collapse and the subsequent wipeout of its creditors triggered the suicide of one of them. 
The Tercas rescue was orchestrated by Italy's deposit guarantee fund, which Brussels said could not be used for measures other than its core function of paying back savers hit by a bank failure.

The EU court ruling, labeled ""historic"" by EU lawmakers, effectively dismissed the Commission's argument.

578,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 12:31PM ET</span>","Tiffany sticks to 2019 targets, helped by e-commerce; shares rebound","By Aishwarya Venugopal and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - Luxury retailer Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) said Friday it expected earnings growth to resume in the second half of the year, helped by a healthy e-commerce business, a forecast that allowed investors to look past slightly disappointing quarterly sales. 
The New York-based company also stuck to its fiscal 2019 revenue and profit targets, and its shares were up 3.6 percent in afternoon trade. They earlier fell as much as 5 percent when investors initially reacted to quarterly sales that narrowly missed Wall Street estimates. 
Weakening economic growth in China, especially against the backdrop of the trade spat between Beijing and Washington, has been a worry for luxury goods companies that rely on the country's burgeoning middle class to boost sales. Two months ago, Tiffany had warned of soft demand in the holiday season because of low spending by Chinese tourists and weakness in Europe and at home.
""We have done a lot, a lot of new things, also things where we had made some mistakes, we are learning, and we are addressing it,"" Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo said on a post-earnings call, adding he would have ""started a holiday campaign three weeks earlier.""
The jeweler has refreshed its collections with more affordable items such as pendants and earrings to appeal to millennials who gravitate to lower-priced competitors such as Denmark's Pandora A/S and Signet Jewelers.
The retailer said its e-commerce business grew roughly twice the rate of its overall business. Later this year, Tiffany plans to launch an e-commerce enabled website in China to cater to the fast-growing market.
Bogliolo told Reuters on Friday he expects the company's percentage of total sales that are online, currently at 7 percent, to grow.
""I'm really confident that we will reach 10 percent, maybe even 15 percent one day,"" he said. ""But I don't see that as a cannibalization of brick-and-mortar.""
Earlier in the year, the company blamed a stronger dollar for weak tourist spending globally during the crucial November-December period. 
The company also said it is taking steps to control the volatility surrounding tourist spending by investing in its domestic customers. 
For instance, strong marketing campaigns surrounding new and improved product assortments and increasingly digital in-store experiences will help earnings growth resume in the second half of the year, the company said.
The company still expects a decline in per-share profit in the first half of the year due to the external factors Tiffany flagged in the quarter.
In the reported quarter, comparable-store sales dropped 1 percent as demand for engagement and designer jewelry fell.
Net sales from the Americas region, which accounts for nearly half of the company's total sales, were flat while those from the Asia-Pacific region fell 3 percent.
Tiffany's net sales fell to $1.32 billion, while analysts on average were expecting sales of $1.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net earnings rose to $204.5 million, or $1.67 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, from $61.9 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company had higher provisions for income taxes. 

""Despite some softer top-line performance and better-than-expected cost control, we would categorize the release as generally clearing low expectations,"" William Blair analyst Dylan Carden wrote in a note.

At the end of January, banks informally canvassed by Reuters saw no-deal probabilities as low but rising. But that risk appeared to have receded after parliament voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit.
But their views have shifted slightly this week after the European Union told May to get lawmakers' approval for a Brexit deal by April 12, failing which Britain must present a new Brexit plan. In any case it has to leave the EU by May 22 -- with or without a plan.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Deutsche, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), ING and some other banks have upped probabilities of a no-deal Brexit though they still see a relatively low 10 to 25 percent risk of this outcome. Some such as Goldman also assign a high probability to Britain ultimately opting to staying in the EU.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 12:22PM ET</span>","Change to 737 MAX controls may have imperiled planes, experts say","By Alwyn Scott and Eric M. Johnson
NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Much like tapping the brake pedal in a car to disengage cruise control, a sharp tug on the controls of older models of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 used to shut off an automatic trim system that keeps the plane flying level, giving the pilot control.
But Boeing disabled the ""yoke jerk"" function when it brought out the 737 MAX, the latest version of its top-selling jet - and many pilots were unaware of the change, aviation experts told Reuters.
(Understanding controls on the Boeing 737 MAX: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OjLSAt)
(Boeing 737 MAX deliveries in question interactive: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hv2btC)
(Ethiopian Airlines crash and black boxes: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ChBW5M) 
The difference may help explain why pilots struggled to keep their aircraft climbing after takeoff on two fatal 737 MAX flights less than five months apart that killed 346 people.
Pilots of a Lion Air flight that crashed in October scoured a handbook for answers as the plane repeatedly lurched downward in the first minutes of flight, Reuters reported. 
An Ethiopian Airlines flight that went down on March 10 showed ""clear similarities"" to the Lion Air accident, aviation authorities said after seeing black-box data.
A pair of switches on the center console between the pilots will turn off the automatic trim and a mechanism, new on the 737 MAX, known as the Maneuver Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, that is suspected of playing a role in both disasters.
TRAINING MATERIAL 'NOT CLEAR'
But pilots would have needed to know that MCAS existed, that it had unusual power to force the plane down and that ""a hard pull on the yoke"" would no longer turn off the automatic trim that uses MCAS, John Hansman, an aeronautics professor at MIT, said in an interview.
""That wasn't clear to the pilots flying the airplane,"" Hansman said. ""The training material was not clear on that.""
Boeing declined to comment. In the aftermath of the Lion Air crash, Boeing pointed to long-established procedures that pilots could have used to handle a malfunction of the anti-stall system, regardless of whether the pilots knew MCAS existed. 
That checklist tells pilots to switch off the two stabilizer trim cutout switches on the central console, and then to adjust the aircraft's stabilizers manually using trim wheels.
An American Airlines flight manual mentions MCAS only in a table of acronyms, according to an October 2018 edition of the 1,400-page book seen by Reuters. Pilots have raised questions about why more detail on MCAS was not included. 
The American Airlines manual's two-page description of trim controls describes a ""trim circuit,"" but not how MCAS could be triggered by a faulty sensor reading, which is also suspected in the two crashes. 
PREVENTING A DANGEROUS STALL
The MCAS system was designed to counteract the effect on the plane's handling caused by new larger 737 MAX engines, which had to be placed farther forward and higher on the wings because the 50-year-old 737 design sits relatively low to the ground. That move gave the MAX a tendency to nose up into a stall, a dangerous position in which a plane loses lift as too little air flows across its wings. 
MCAS, essentially a few lines of computer code in the flight control system, relies on data from two small, blade-shaped sensors near the nose of the aircraft that measure the angle of air flow. Faults in the sensors are not uncommon, and MCAS relies on only one sensor at a time during flight. In the Lion Air crash, investigators found a faulty reading led the plane's computer to believe it was stalled and to push the nose down. 
Boeing later issued a bulletin reminding pilots how to respond to such a faulty reading. An optional warning light could have alerted pilots to the faulty sensor.
MAINTENANCE, TRAINING UNDER SCRUTINY
Investigators unraveling the Lion Air crash are looking at maintenance records and whether the pilots had enough training to handle the emergency, among other factors.
The 737 MAX can fly without MCAS, so the feature was not considered ""flight-critical"" even though it has extraordinary power to steer the plane, said an industry expert with knowledge of the system who spoke on condition of anonymity. MCAS controls the large horizontal wing on the plane's tail known as the stabilizer, while the pilot controls smaller flaps or ""elevators"" on the stabilizer.
Over several minutes, the stabilizer can shift position enough that the elevator controls can no longer counteract the downward direction of the plane, the source said.
""They gave more control power to the automation than to the pilot,"" the source said of the MCAS design. 
The Lion Air pilots flew for about five minutes by using the elevator to counteract the stabilizer every 15 or 20 seconds, said Hansman, based on readings from the flight data recorder. After that, the pilot tried pulling back hard on the controls. 

""That's what suggests that the crew didn't understand the system. They thought they were shutting MCAS off and didn't,"" Hansman said. ""Whereas any time during the entire sequence, they could have reached to the middle console and just shut it off.""

BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Watches of Switzerland expects to make further acquisitions in the United States, which it first entered in 2017 with the purchase of jeweler Mayors, its chief executive told Reuters.
Owned by U.S.-based private equity firm Apollo Global Management, Watches of Switzerland has since opened several stores, including in Las Vegas and New York.
""Could we add other businesses? Very easily,"" Brian Duffy said in an interview at this week's Baselworld watch fair.
The Watches of Switzerland Group, which sells brands such as Rolex, Richemont's Cartier and Swatch Group's Omega and has more than 130 showrooms, is the biggest watch retailer in Britain and a candidate for a stock market listing.
Luxury watch distribution is undergoing major changes, with many small, family-owned businesses unable to keep up with the challenges of e-commerce, while watch brands are shutting down shops which do not meet their standards.
""If it's a quality business, the right location of stores and support from the brands, it would be obvious that we'd be open to it. Probably over the couple of years ahead, we'll do some deals in the area,"" Duffy said of his U.S. plans.
Watches of Switzerland, which spans its eponymous stores as well as Mappin & Webb, Goldsmiths, Mayors, Watchshop and Watch Lab competes with rivals such as Lucerne-based Bucherer, which last year bought U.S. jeweler Tourneau.
Last year the company, which has been under Apollo's control for more than six years, flagged that its owners were working with advisers on strategic options, including a potential initial public offering (IPO). 
Duffy said that an IPO, if it happened, would most likely be on the London Stock Exchange. 
""It would be good for our group with its size and scale to have public ownership, reduced leverage and great governance and accountability, sources of capital if that's ever necessary,"" he said, without giving further detail.
Apollo declined to comment.
The group's revenue grew 21 percent to 685 million pounds ($902 million) in 2017/2018, and its operating profit rose by more than a third to 37 million pounds, about twice the levels when Apollo bought it in 2013.

CORDEMAIS, France (Reuters) - French utility EDF (PA:EDF) aims to convert its 1,200-megawatt (MW) Cordemais coal-fired power plant by spring 2022 into one that burns pellet fuel made from discarded wood, giving the unit a new lease of life.
If successful, the process - known as Ecocombust - could be exported and adapted to other coal plants, saving jobs, while Cordemais would boost France's security of supply in winter.
But EDF must convince the government by autumn that the project is financially and environmentally viable. French grid operator RTE is also expected to determine by April whether the plant is surplus to requirements. 
In its long-term energy plan, France has laid out moves to phase out electricity generation from coal by 2022, with the goal of decarbonizing energy production by 2050. 
The decision sounded the death knell for the five remaining coal-fired generators in France, with an installed capacity of around 3,000 MW. Three of the generators - Cordemais 4 and 5, and Havre 4 - are operated by state-controlled EDF.
Cordemais in western France was overhauled two years ago to meet new emissions and safety standards at a cost of several million euros, and could keep operating until 2035, EDF says.
France's two other coal generators, Emile Huchet 6 and Provence 5, with a combined installed capacity of 1,200 MW, are operated by German utility Uniper.
EDF executives said the Ecocombust project, already in an advanced test phase, would burn pellets made from discarded ""class B"" wood and garden waste, for large-scale power generation. The project is the first of its kind, they say.
Although pellets from wood chips and sawdust are widely used for heating, Eric Bret, EDF's head of thermal power generation, said the process was different because the company would not cut down any trees.
""The pellets are made from ... everyday objects such as beams, doors, window frames and furniture, which until now are mostly recycled or buried in landfill,"" he said.
SOURCED LOCALLY
Lionel Olivier, director of the Cordemais and Havre power plants, said the pellets would be 70 percent ""class B"" wood and 30 percent residue from grass, tree branches and garden waste, all sourced within a radius of 150 km (93 miles).
He said EDF was setting up a supply chain that included municipal waste authorities and companies, but would need state aid. 
EDF declined to say what the conversion would cost and how much it had invested in the process. 
At capacity, it aims to replace around 1.3 million to 2 million tonnes of coal imported annually from Poland, Australia and the United States, with about 700,000 tonnes of biomass.
Tests carried out in August with 80 percent pellet fuel and 20 percent coal to generate electricity for over four hours were successful, Olivier said. 
The pellets have 20 percent less energy or caloric value than coal, which could reduce each generator's output capacity to 530 MW from 600 MW currently, he added.
Cordemais' production would focus on periods of peak power demand in winter. After the conversion, output would be reduced to 800 hours annually from 4,000 hours, he said.
""Runtime would be five times less than the current production using coal but it will focus on a period when power prices are higher and more profitable,"" Olivier said.

He added that the plant would also use five times less coal and emit five times less carbon dioxide.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) fell 4 percent on Friday after the sportswear maker's North America sales fell short of estimates for the first time in a year, but Wall Street analysts seemed more enthused about its new products and online growth.
The company faced intense pressure from European rivals Adidas (DE:ADSGN) and Puma a year ago, but has managed to win back market share with new launches of its popular Air Max and Jordan sneakers, increased focus on women's wear and higher investment in online business.
""The athletic footwear cycle and brand power are solid. Nike's business is strengthening in North America, and we expect the company to continue to recapture the share it has lost to Adidas,"" said Jefferies analyst, adding that the stock might be slightly down given ""high expectations"".
The company on Thursday blamed delay in new launches for a slowdown in apparel sales in North America during the quarter, which was marked by an outcry on social media after a Nike sneaker worn by Duke University basketball star Zion Williamson ripped open during a high-profile game.
Still, the stock continues to be one of Wall Street's favorites. Out of 34 brokerages covering the stock, 25 analysts rate it 'buy' or higher and only one analyst has a sell rating on the stock.
Nike's shares trade at 28.6 times the company's 12-month forward earnings, compared with rival Adidas' 21.5 times and Under Armour's 59.5 times, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Just two brokerages -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and UBS - lowered their target on the stock. Credit Suisse cut its price by $3 to $97, still well above the median price target of $92.5.
Nike's online business, which includes sales from the SNKRS and Nike apps, was the main profit driver in the reported quarter. Revenue from that business rose 36 percent in the quarter.
While most analysts were enthusiastic about the results, some said higher expenses as the only dark spot in an otherwise strong report.
Jefferies analyst Randal Konik flagged a rise in selling, general and administrative expenses due to wage-related expenses.

Draghi's comments came the day after EU leaders agreed at a summit in Brussels to give Britain a final chance to leave the bloc with a deal, extending the Brexit deadline by two weeks to April 12 from March 29.
""Authorities and central banks are prepared but the private sector has to step up preparations,"" Draghi told the European summit, the source said. 
In the case of a no-deal Brexit, trade between Britain and the EU would face immediate trade barriers and restrictions on business.
Draghi said the negative consequences for the 19-country euro zone would be limited, but he acknowledged that some countries were more exposed than others, the source said. 
France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are among EU countries with large trade flows with Britain and they are likely to feel more the pain of a non-negotiated Brexit.
Draghi also told EU leaders that the euro zone economy was still facing ""protracted weakness and pervasive uncertainty"" but risks of a recession remain ""quite low"", the source said.

599,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",The U.S. Bond Market Fools Traders Once Again,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasuries are, once again, proving to be a buy at almost any price.
After the Federal Reserve’s surprise dovish turn this week, investors piled into the $15.8 trillion market and left the 10-year note yielding a mere 2.5 percent. Just a few months ago, it had surged past 3.2 percent, sparking all sorts of talk -- yet again -- that this was the dawn of a new era of rising rates.
Of course, one might be forgiven for wondering who would put money in 10-year Treasuries now, particularly when you can earn nearly as much in interest on a run-of-the-mill savings account from any number of banks.
Yet for investors like JPMorgan Asset Management’s Alex Dryden, it’s perfectly sensible. The Fed’s darkening outlook about the U.S. economy is compounding worries over global growth, and few see inflation running hot enough to eat significantly into returns. If anything, the concern is that with inflation so low and growth so weak, yields will keep falling, which would make locking in today’s rates for years a smart move.
“Inflation has been persistently and stubbornly low,” said Dryden, the firm’s global rates strategist.
It’s not just in the U.S. where investors see weaker growth. In Canada, 10-year yields dropped below the overnight lending rate this week for the first time since 2008. The European Central Bank’s negative interest-rate policy means investors are still prepared to pay premiums to hold German debt due any time up to nine years from now. This month, the ECB slashed its 2019 growth forecast to 1.1 percent, the weakest in six years.
Least Bad
So investors around the world aren’t exactly spoiled for choice, despite the fact returns on Treasuries have actually been lousy for years. By JPMorgan Asset’s calculations, 10-year Treasuries yield more than roughly 80 percent of government debt in the developed world -- even at 2.5 percent. (That’s setting aside interest rate differentials and exchange rates, of course.)
Appetite for longer-dated debt has also been particularly strong among institutions such as pension funds and insurers, which are casting around for a way to match their long-term liabilities.
“In many respects, the U.S. 10-year Treasury is still, in an low-yielding world, a high-yielding asset,” Dryden said.
Perfectly Rational?
That’s enough for many investors, particularly after a string of poor manufacturing data and inflation reports added to worries about the U.S. economy. Stephen Bartolini, a fixed-income manager at T. Rowe Price, says the real surprise was just how little growth the Fed sees next year. Officials now forecast the economy will expand just 1.9 percent in 2020.
And if the economy ultimately does end up rolling over, price gains on holding longer-term Treasuries would be a better bet. Falling yields would force holders of short-term securities to reinvest at even less attractive rates than they would if they just held long-dated maturities.
“Rallying rates in response to what the Fed delivered,” Bartolini said, “is perfectly rational.”

600,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 09:18AM ET</span>","China's Xi looks to strengthen Italian ties, evokes ancient trade routes","By Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - Italy and China want to revive the spirit of the ancient Silk Road by deepening their trade and investment ties, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Friday during a trip to Rome that has raised eyebrows in Washington.
Xi is set to sign a deal on Saturday that will see Italy become the first member of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations to join China's ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure project (BRI), which is inspired by historic, centuries-old trade routes.
""We want to revitalize the ancient Silk Road in order to better share the fruits of humanity's progress,"" Xi said following talks with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.
Speaking through a translator, Xi said the two countries should enhance cooperation in infrastructure, ports, logistics and maritime transport.
Besides the BRI accord, various deals worth up to 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion) are expected to be agreed, including agreements opening up the northern ports of Trieste and Genoa to Chinese containers.
Italy's populist government is eager for such initiatives to get underway swiftly as it battles to revitalize a sickly economy, which has slipped into its third recession in a decade.
Underscoring the warming bilateral ties, Italy offered Xi an extravagant welcome, with a cavalry phalanx escorting his limousine into the courtyard of the presidential palace -- the sort of entry normally reserved for royalty.
He will later attend a state dinner in his honor, where Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli will sing for the 170 guests.
Italy's decision to get closer to Beijing has caused concern amongst its Western allies -- notably in Washington, where the White House National Security Council urged Rome not to give ""legitimacy to China's infrastructure vanity project"".
Critics of the BRI say it is designed to bolster China's political and military influence, bringing little reward to other nations, and warn that it could be used to spread technologies capable of spying on Western interests.
HUMAN RIGHTS
In an effort to allay such fears, Rome moved hastily this week to protect its telecoms sector from foreign predators, and the Italian president stressed on Friday that any deals had to be to advantageous to both countries.
""The Silk Road must be a two-way street and not only trade must travel along it, but also talent, ideas and knowledge,"" Mattarella said, with Xi standing alongside him.
The two men promised to bolster cultural connections, saying they would twin Italian and Chinese UNESCO heritage sites.
Mattarella also stressed the importance of safeguarding human rights but did not go into specific details. The U.S. State Department earlier this month slammed rights violations in China, saying the sort of abuses it had inflicted on its Muslim minorities had not been seen ""since the 1930s.""
China denied the accusation as groundless and prejudiced.
Italy's rapprochement with Beijing has come as U.S. President Donald Trump wages a trade war with China, accusing the world's second-largest economy of unfair trade practices.
Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon is in Rome and called on the Italian government to rethink its position. 
""I beseech the people of Italy to look at China's predatory economic model before signing any deals,"" he told reporters. ""The Chinese have a rapacious appetite for global domination.""

After leaving Italy on Sunday, Xi will travel to Monte Carlo and then on to Paris, where he will hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Union Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global equity funds saw massive outflows this week, a sharp reversal from last week's inflows as pessimism over economic growth gripped investors once again, driving them instead to search for yield in credit and buy safer assets like bonds.
Some $20.7 billion was pulled from equity funds in the week to March 20, while $12.1 billion was ploughed into bond funds, the biggest inflows since January 2018, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML) strategists said on Friday citing data from EPFR.
Despite big gains for stocks globally this year, positioning is decidedly negative with $66.8 billion outflows from equity funds year-to-date.
This week's heavy outflows showed investors remain skittish, having re-entered equities with $14 billion inflows last week.
Investors are hunting for yield, the strategists said, noting the ninth straight week of inflows to investment-grade bond funds - $6.6 billion this week - while high-yield bond funds drew in $3.2 billion and $1.2 billion went into EM debt.
The market is struggling to digest a rapid about-turn from the U.S. Federal Reserve on interest rates as economic growth disappoints globally and fears of a deflationary environment return.
""Extraordinary abrupt end to central bank hiking cycle & Fed paranoia of credit event are uber-bullish credit & uber-bearish volatility,"" the strategists wrote. 
""Inflows to 'deflation assets'... continue to trounce inflows to 'inflation winners',"" they added. 
Overall the bank's ""Bull & Bear"" indicator of investor positioning and sentiment held at a neutral level of 4.7 out of 10, signalling investors' uncertainty over where the market might go next.
By region, the U.S. saw the biggest outflows with $13.2 billion, while $4 billion was pulled from European equities.
""Short European equities"" was named by investors as the ""most crowded"" trade in a BAML survey on Tuesday, prompting some contrarian buying of European stocks, but not enough to move the needle in terms of flows.
Japanese equities also suffered outflows of $700 million, the sixth straight week of outflows. Emerging market equities have had outflows four of the past five weeks, and lost $400 million this week.
Investors turned on technology stocks, pulling $700 million from the sector. Defensive real estate stocks were the most favoured, attracting $400 million.

Cumulative flows into tech stocks, long-standing investor darlings, have stalled, BAML strategists noted, as doubts over their status as market leaders grew and sluggish economic growth weighed on performance.

602,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 09:12AM ET</span>",Trump: China trade deal likely; automakers can avoid tariffs with U.S. plants,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said trade negotiations with China were progressing and a final agreement ""will probably happen,"" adding that his call for tariffs to remain on Chinese imported goods for some time did not mean talks were in trouble.
Trump, in a television interview aired on Friday, also said he expected to keep a 25 percent tariff on European light trucks amid separate ongoing trade talks with the European Union, but that companies could avoid it by building factories in the United States.
The Trump administration is engaged in ongoing trade talks with both the European Union and China as part of the Republican president's ""America First"" agenda. Top U.S. officials are headed to Beijing in coming days, with a summit possible between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to seal any final deal.
""The European Union ... frankly, treats us as badly as China,"" Trump told Fox Business Network. 
""Our deal is coming along very well. We'll see what happens,"" Trump said regarding China. ""I think the deal will probably happen. I think they need it very badly."" 
Asked about his remarks earlier this week about U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods staying in place for a period of time and whether that meant there was a snag in the negotiations, Trump said, ""No, not at all.""
Trump then segued to the European auto sector, including trucks. ""We get a 25 percent tariff on that segment - that's our best segment by far. And yes, we will absolutely be able to keep it - not only keep it going, I really think we have tremendous potential,"" he told the network in the interview, which was taped on Thursday.
""I’ll tell you what the end game is. They’ll build their plants in the United States and they have no tariffs,"" Trump added. Then, asked if he would agree to zero tariffs, he said: ""I would do it for certain products, but I wouldn’t do it for cars.""
Shares of German automaker Daimler jumped briefly after the interview.
The United States in July agreed not to hit EU car imports with extra tariffs while the Washington and Brussels sought to improve economic ties, but the U.S. ambassador to the EU on Thursday said Europe was falling short in trade talks. 
Additionally, the U.S. Commerce Department has given the White House a report regarding the legal basis to impose steep tariffs on cars on national security grounds.
Asked if autos and auto parts posed a security risk, Trump said: ""well, no.""
""What poses a national security risk is our balance sheet. We have to have -- we need a strong balance sheet. Otherwise you don’t have national security,"" Trump added. ""We’re straightening it out.""
Separately, Trump also told Fox that if U.S. lawmakers do not pass his new deal to supersede the North American Free Trade Agreement trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, he might ""go pre-NAFTA"" but gave no other details. 

The leaders of the three countries last year reached a deal to replace NAFTA with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. But it must be approved by the U.S. Congress, which is split between Trump's fellow Republicans, who control the Senate, and Democrats, who hold the majority in the House of Representatives and have been cool to the new pact.

London (Reuters) - German 10-year bond yields dived below zero while European shares and the euro fell on Friday after grim data from the continent fuelled fears of a global economic slowdown following this week's dovish turn by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Yields on Germany's 10-year government bond turned negative for the first time since October 2016 after data showed manufacturing contracted for a third straight month in March, compounding worries that trade disputes are exacerbating a slowdown in Europe's biggest economy.
Factory activity across the euro zone as a whole looked equally dismal, contracting at the fastest pace in nearly six years on the back of a big drop in demand.
European stocks suffered with German shares falling 0.3 percent after plumbing to their lowest in two weeks earlier. Equities in Paris tumbled 0.8 percent while London's FTSE dropped 1 percent. Europe's banking as well as industrial goods & services sectors led the falls.
""Numbers like the ones we have seen this morning from the European manufacturing sector in Europe would suggest there is more weak data to come,"" said Tim Graf, EMEA Head of Macro Strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
""Everybody is looking for that inflection point, I guess, for when it is finally going to get better - and it's not quite arrived yet.""
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe slipped 0.2 percent, pulling away from the 5-1/2 months high hit earlier in the week. U.S. stock futures indicated the souring mood would spill over to Wall Street, with e-mini futures for the Down Jones, S&P and Nasdaq all down 0.4 percent. 
The German data compounded worries about the U.S. economic outlook after the Fed on Wednesday surprised investors by adopting a sharply dovish stance, anticipating no further interest rate hikes this year and ending its balance sheet rolloffs.
The decline in German bund yields comes after the U.S. yield curve flattened further overnight, indicating increased market expectations of a recession. 
The spread between the three-month Treasury bill yield and the 10-year note yield shrank to its narrowest level since August 2007 in the wake of the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cease tightening monetary policy as the American economy shows signs of contraction.
""The main market reaction to the Fed's announcement was that it has become a consensus that the Fed's next move is a rate cut,"" said Naoya Oshikubo, senior manager at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset.
""As economic data from China and elsewhere has not bottomed out yet, investors will be looking at economic fundamentals for now. If there are improvements, then markets could roll back expectations of a Fed rate cut,"" he said.
Adding to the uncertainty are worries over how much progress the world's two largest economies will be able to make when they meet for another round of trade talks next week. 
Bloomberg reported on Friday that U.S. officials downplayed the prospect of an imminent trade deal with Beijing, just as a U.S. trade delegation headed by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is set to visit China on March 28-29.
In currency markets, the dollar gained 0.3 percent against a basket of six rival currencies in a second straight day of gains. 
The euro tumbled 0.6 percent to $1.1301, pulling further away from Wednesday's 1-1/2-month high of $1.14485.
Britain's pound stood at $1.3147 after recovering overnight when European Union leaders gave Prime Minister Theresa May a two-week reprieve, until April 12, to decide how to leave the European Union.
Sterling had plunged towards $1.30 on Thursday in its biggest one-day fall this year as fears mounted that Britain would crash out of the bloc on March 29.
The EU has said Britain can have a short delay to Brexit, as requested by May, but she must first win parliamentary approval for her withdrawal deal that sets out the future relationship between London and its biggest trading partner.
In commodity markets, oil prices pulled away from 2019 peaks as economic growth concerns hurt sentiment, pausing a three-month rally that was driven by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela. 

Brent crude oil futures and U.S. crude futures slipped both around 1 percent to $67.06 and $59.43 per barrel respectively.

607,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>",UPS eyes in-home health services with U.S. vaccine project,"By Lisa Baertlein and Michael Erman
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) wants to get beyond U.S. doorsteps with a new push into healthcare. 
The world's largest package delivery firm is preparing to test a U.S. service that dispatches nurses to vaccinate adults in their homes, Reuters has learned, as the company and its healthcare clients work to fend off cost pressures and competitive threats from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
UPS did not disclose which vaccines it would be using in the project, but drug and vaccine maker Merck & Co told Reuters it is looking at partnering with the company for the initiative.
The project, previously unreported, shows how UPS is targeting a larger slice of the $85 billion outsourced healthcare logistics market. Deutsche Post's DHL Group dominates the market, which is expected to grow to $105 billion by 2021.
""Over-the-threshold services is where the world is headed,"" Chris Cassidy, who joined UPS last year from GlaxoSmithKline PLC to oversee global healthcare logistics strategy, told Reuters in an interview at UPS' Worldport facility in Louisville.
Here is how the test, slated to launch later this year, will operate: Workers in UPS' 1.7 million-square-foot healthcare complex at Worldport will package and ship the vaccine to one of the more 4,700 franchised U.S. UPS stores. A home health nurse contracted by UPS' clinical trial logistics unit known as Marken will collect the insulated package, transport it the ""last mile"" to the patient's home and administer the vaccine, which will target a viral illness in adults.
The aim of the test is to ""see if we can connect all these dots,"" said Wes Wheeler, chief executive at Marken, which was purchased by UPS in 2016 and is overseeing the vaccine project.
It comes as the parcel delivery industry braces for the impact of a cooling economy and competition from customer-turned-rival Amazon, which is building its own logistics network to contain the swelling cost of dropping millions of packages at shoppers' homes. 
UPS healthcare customers, facing political scrutiny over high drug prices and systemic waste, are also under pressure from Amazon.
The world's biggest online retailer is teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to lower prescription drug costs for their employees. And, it rocked the sector last year with its roughly $1 billion purchase of specialty online pharmacy PillPack.
Experts say raising low U.S. adult vaccination rates would reduce healthcare spending by curbing preventable illnesses that result in doctor visits and hospitalizations.
Merck, a major UPS healthcare customer, has a portfolio of vaccines for viral illnesses ranging from shingles and hepatitis B to the flu. Spokeswoman Pamela Eisele said the company is considering the project as it looks for new ways to increase access to its medicines and vaccines and boost adult vaccine rates.
Experts said the UPS project could also save money by having contract home nurses, rather than higher paid doctors, administer the vaccine. But the test, a first for a large U.S. shipper, is not a guaranteed slam dunk for UPS: Marken's CEO said it must figure out how to get medical insurers to pay for the new service. 
NEW FRONTIERS
UPS, DHL and specialty shippers have a smattering of home health projects around the world - mostly in countries with single-payer health systems.
DHL, the healthcare logistics leader with annual medical-related revenue of more than 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion), transports U.K. patients from home to non-emergency hospital appointments.
Polar Speed, a U.K. specialty logistics company UPS bought in 2014, has trained and background-checked drivers who enter homes to drop off prescriptions, deliver and install medical refrigerators and infusion pumps, and remove waste such as used syringes and wound dressings.
Pharmaceutical companies already pay Marken to give vaccines to patients testing their experimental drugs.
Cathy Morrow Roberson, who founded consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights after working for more than a decade as an analyst at Atlanta-based UPS, said the vaccine project taps the assets and expertise the company has acquired since getting into healthcare in the early 2000s.
""They're reaping the benefits of all the acquisitions and investments they've made,"" she said.
The effort is designed to put even more distance between UPS and Amazon, which lacks the specialized warehouse, temperature-controlled shipping and regulatory infrastructure that healthcare companies require. Amazon currently uses UPS and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) for PillPack home deliveries.
Major insurers contacted by Reuters declined to say what they pay to have vaccines administered. But an analysis of 2010 MarketScan health claims data sheds some light on the subject - finding that the average cost of a shingles shot was $208.72 at a doctor's office and $168.50 at a pharmacy. Flu shots cost less than $30 at both locations. The provider of that data declined to update it.
Delivering home vaccines at a competitive price may not be the only hurdle to the UPS project's success, said Stephen Buck, chief executive of Courage Health and a former vice president at McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK).

""Pharmacies and physicians may not be happy about a new player competing against them,"" Buck said.

However, a swathe of car makers, from BMW, Geely to SAIC as well as other tech firms such as Meituan Dianping have also launched their own mobility services in a bid to grab a share of the fast growing market.
Didi, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp and Uber Technologies, also has joint ventures with BAIC and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
Wijaya Ng, who tracks China's automotive industry at Ipsos Business Consulting, said the new venture dovetails with a larger, global trend wherein traditional automakers are entering the ride-hailing sector.
""They see that moving forward, if car-hailing is going to be the future, they want to tap into this market sooner rather than later,"" said Ng.
Changan said that itself, Dongfeng and FAW will each have a 15 percent stake in the joint venture, which will set up a ride-sharing company with a focus on new energy vehicles.
Suning will be the biggest shareholder with a 19 percent stake while Alibaba and Tencent's investment units will together hold the remainder shares with some other funds, it added. 
The new ride-hailing company and its investors, which come from a range of fields, will help form ""business synergies which will help enrich the companies' ecosystems"", Suning said in a statement.
FAW and Dongfeng confirmed the venture while Alibaba and Tencent declined to comment beyond the Changan statement. Didi declined to comment. 
Shares of Changan and Dongfeng Automobile Co Ltd jumped by the maximum daily allowed 10 percent after the news. FAW Car Co Ltd shares climbed 6.6 percent.
The growing popularity of ride-hailing services for commuting and running errands in congested cities such as Beijing and Shanghai is showing early signs of reducing private car ownership.
However, the industry and Didi came under tighter government scrutiny and regulation last year after a Didi passenger was raped and murdered by her driver.

609,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 06:47AM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank CEO paid $8 million, top managers get first bonuses in four years","By Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) paid its management board members their first bonuses in four years in 2018, with Christian Sewing's 7 million euro ($8 million) total pay package making him one of the best paid chief executives in European banking.
Deutsche Bank's politically sensitive pay disclosures, which were revealed in its annual report on Friday, come as it contemplates a merger with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), which unions fear could lead to up to 30,000 job cuts.
Sewing, who became CEO in April last year, led Deutsche Bank to its first profit in four years and is heading the talks with Commerzbank. He earned 2.9 million euros for 2017.
Sewing's 2018 pay was higher than the CEOs of several other major European investment banks, including HSBC's CEO John Flint and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) boss Jes Staley. 
However, the Deutsche Bank CEO received less than his counterpart at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Tidjane Thiam, who got 12.65 million Swiss francs ($12.7 million).
Deutsche Bank's annual report also revealed that its management board received total pay, including bonuses, of 55.7 million euros ($63.4 million) in 2018, up from 29.8 million euros a year earlier.
The overall bonus pool for 2018 was 1.9 billion euros, down 14 percent from 2.3 billion euros a year earlier, partly as a result of a reduction in headcount, Deutsche Bank said.
Bonuses are a sensitive issue in Germany where many politicians and public opinion are critical of high pay and Anglo-Saxon style capitalism.
Gerhard Schick, finance activist at Finanzwende and ex-member of the German parliament, questioned Deutsche Bank's bonuses if they were meant as incentives for good performance.
""It adds to the negative overall picture of the bank, which is reeling from scandals and now apparently wants to plunge into a bad merger,"" Schick said.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
Deutsche Bank has paid large fines for past misdeeds, including a $7.2 billion U.S. penalty in 2017, spooking clients. 
And last year it was ensnared in a money laundering scandal involving Danske Bank, while its offices were raided over two days in November in relation to a separate inquiry. 
Litigation costs are expected to be ""significantly higher"" in 2019 than in 2018, Deutsche Bank said in the report.
John Cryan, Sewing's predecessor, received 8.7 million euros in severance pay and a 2.2 million euro payment to compensate him for what he could earn with a competitor.

Last year's management reshuffle, which involved Cryan and three other board members, was costly for Deutsche Bank, which paid a combined 25.8 million euros in severance and restraint on competition fees for the four executives, figures in the annual report and provided by the bank revealed.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 06:29AM ET</span>",Thomas Cook to shut 21 stores and cut jobs in shift to online,"LONDON (Reuters) - British travel company Thomas Cook plans to axe 320 jobs and close 21 stores in its UK retail network to cut costs as consumers increasingly shop online, it said on Friday.
Thomas Cook endured a tough 2018 when a heatwave in northern Europe deterred holidaymakers from booking last-minute deals, leading to two profit warnings and talk of a need to raise funds.
The company has also said it would consider a sale of its airline business to raise cash.
""Today's announcement reflects the wider challenges seen on the high street, with more and more customers choosing to book online,"" said Will Waggott, who runs the company's tour operator business. 
""We will be working to ensure that Thomas Cook is fit for the future, putting a rigorous focus on costs in a competitive environment.""
The store closures reduce Thomas Cook's retail network to 566 shops, half the total it had in 2012.
In addition to 102 job losses at those 21 stores, a further 218 roles will be cut across its other shops, for which staff and union consultations have begun.
Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel company, has long had a visible presence on Britain's shopping streets but it said that 64 percent of its bookings in the UK last year were made online and that this was its fastest-growing sales channel.
Weak demand and rising costs have put intense pressure on prominent British brands for some time, with the likes of department store BHS and Toys R Us going bust in recent years and Marks & Spencer and Debenhams announcing store closures.

The euro zone's blue-chip STOXX50 volatility index was up 5.1 percent at 16.49 at 1009 GMT, after hitting its highest since Feb. 8 earlier in the session.
The rise came as stocks fell sharply into negative territory after data which revealed euro zone businesses performed much worse than expected in March as factory activity contracted at the fastest pace in nearly six years.

The index is set for an almost 27 percent gain for the week, its biggest weekly rise in a year, data shows, a marked increase in volatility after a subdued start to the year.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's largest department store operator Myer will stop selling ""unprofitable"" Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) products as part of its drive to focus on higher-margin items, Myer Holdings said on Friday. 
Apple Inc is facing weak demand for its iPhone, which has come under fire for being too expensive. Demand has notably fallen in the world's biggest smartphone market China, partly as a result of the trade dispute with the United States.
The decision, which will apply to the 16 department stores that stocked Apple products as well as online sales, comes as the department store operator restructures to better compete with online retailers. 
Myer, which was founded on the back of the country's gold rush more than a century ago, is cutting costs and boosting its online presence which allowed it to swing into a modest first half profit in January.
""Myer has made it clear that it will not chase unprofitable sales and has made this decision as we could not reach acceptable commercial terms that were in the best interests of the company and shareholders,"" a spokesman said in an emailed comment to Reuters.
""This decision is also about ensuring space in our stores is utilized in the most productive and effective way for the company. We thank Apple for the positive partnership we have had over many years.""
Myer's net profit came in at A$38.4 million ($27.20 million) for the six months to Jan. 26, compared to a loss of A$476.2 million for the same period a year earlier.

Myer has 61 stores, mostly across the eastern part of the country. Stores are usually in areas of high foot traffic in major metropolitan shopping centers as well as in city centers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shake-ups come infrequently for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but some degree of change may be in the works for the stock index as two of its 30 constituents prepare to transform from large conglomerates into smaller companies.
The latest occasion to re-examine the Dow stems from chemical company DowDuPont Inc, which is breaking up into three publicly listed stocks. The first step, the separation of the company's Dow materials science division, is due to take effect on April 1.
Another index component, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX), is also in the process of separating into three companies, possibly in about a year.
While many professional investors prefer other stock gauges to the Dow, membership in the blue-chip index - often thought of as Main Street's market barometer - still carries allure because of its relatively few constituents. Funds with billions of dollars under management are also linked to the index, so constituent changes affect flows into and out of stocks.
While pieces of the original components could stay in the Dow, those corporate actions could spur the overseers of the index to add fresh blood, some market watchers say.
""All of the options are certainty on the table,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. ""This could be a catalyst for a new addition to the broader index.""
S&P Dow Jones Indices, which publishes the Dow index, will make an announcement before April 1, according to spokesman Ray McConville.
Any time there is a corporate action in an index, McConville said, ""S&P DJI will review the index and make any necessary changes and issue a public announcement before the transaction takes place.""
Known for its inclusion of large U.S. companies as well as its relatively few members compared to other barometers, the Dow has changed components roughly every two years over the past 20 years. The most recent such move came last June, when longtime member  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc. 
Prior to that, DowDupont took over for DuPont (NYSE:DWDP) in September 2017, after the latter company merged with  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) replaced AT&T (NYSE:T) in March 2015.
The index is a measure of 30 companies designed to provide suitable sector representation, except for transportation and utilities stocks, which are covered by other Dow Jones indexes, according to published methodology for the index.
The overall level of the Dow does not change when its components do, because the divisor used to calculate the index is adjusted.
Stock selection is ""not governed by"" quantitative rules, according to the published methodology, which also says ""a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors."" 
The subjectivity of the criteria regularly prompts speculation about which companies may qualify.
Some companies that seem like obvious candidates at first blush may have strikes against them. For example, two of the largest U.S. companies - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, the parent of Google - have share prices that are both well over $1,000 each. 
That's a problem because such high prices would warp the Dow, whose constituents carry more weight the higher their share price. At about $375 a share, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is the highest priced stock in the Dow by more than $100.
Many indexes, such as the S&P 500, are weighted by companies' market capitalization, rather than by their share price.
One remaining piece of DowDuPont - the only materials sector stock in the Dow - could stay in the Dow Jones index. 
""If you take DowDuPont off, then there is nothing really with that materials"" exposure, said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. ""I am not sure this is an opportunity to make a big change here.""
The DowDuPont breakup will leave Dow, specialty products company DuPont and Corteva, which focuses on agriculture.
Dow and DuPont would be the biggest of the three, with market values estimated at about $50 billion and $60 billion, respectively, according to Nomura Instinet analyst Aleksey Yefremov. ""If they want to have a materials company they have to pick one of these two, just because they are so broad,” Yefremov said.
 United Tech  is separating into an aerospace supplier, an elevator manufacturer, and a provider of building products including air-conditioning systems. 
Aerospace is by far the biggest division of the three by sales, but with one aerospace stock already in the Dow - planemaker Boeing - that new company may be redundant.
In many investors' eyes, the Dow pales in importance as a market barometer to the S&P 500, with its 500 constituents weighted by market value. Just over $23 billion is invested in mutual and exchange-traded funds tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared to nearly $4.3 trillion tied to the S&P 500, according to Lipper research.
But the more than 120-year-old index remains a popular market gauge.
""The Dow’s price-weighted construct and the fact that it’s only 30 names makes it reasonably distinct from measures that folks will more likely look at to be representing the market as a whole,"" said Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, which has five ETFs with $1.5 billion linked to the Dow.

But, adds Hyman: ""The fact that it’s distinct means that some folks will find utility in it.""

618,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 05:03AM ET</span>","StockBeat - Weak PMIs, Brexit Risk Send Markets Tumbling","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are tumbling Friday morning after a shockingly weak survey from the German manufacturing sector increased suspicions that the euro zone’s slowdown could be deeper and longer than first thought.
IHS Markit’s flash purchasing managers index for Germany fell to 44.7 in March, its lowest in six and a half years and dashing hopes for a modest bounce after February’s reading of 47.6. The comparable figure for France, released earlier, had also fallen more sharply than expected to 49.8, below the 50 level that signals no change in activity. The flash reading for the euro zone fell to 47.6, well below expectations of 49.8.
As such, the euro zone’s manufacturing sector appears to have contracted in the first quarter, eking out only a small gain in January and shrinking in both of the following months.
At 05:00 AM ET (09:00 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 1.80 points or 0.5% at 378.90, while Germany’s Dax was down 0.6%, the French CAC 40 and the FTSE 100 were both down 0.8%.
The numbers come at a bad time for sentiment, after Thursday’s EU summit greatly increased the risk of a disorderly Brexit  despite pushing back the March 29 deadline by two weeks. The brief extension still allows little time for the U.K. parliament to formulate an alternative course of action if – as is still likely – Prime Minister Theresa May fails to win approval for her Withdrawal Agreement.
Among individual stocks,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) had stood out before the PMIs with a trading update that forecast its first rise in revenue in years. However, it reversed after the data to be up only 0.7%.
The only other outperformers of note were again chipmakers, supported by the rally in U.S. tech stocks on Friday. Infineon (DE:IFXGn) was up 0.3%, while STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) was up 0.1% and U.K.-based software company  Micro Focus  (LON:MCRO) was up 1.4%"

The communique from Thursday's meeting of EU leaders also kept the door open to a longer extension if Prime Minister Theresa May, as expected, fails at the third attempt to gain parliament's approval for her negotiated exit deal. 
After two days of losses, the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.3 percent, led by 0.6 percent gains for Germany's DAX and a 0.2 percent rise in French stocks. 
As has often been the case on Brexit, London's blue chip FTSE 100, packed with companies dependent on international revenues which tend to lose when sterling rises, dipped 0.2 percent. 
The pound, fluctuating heavily in the past week on Brexit twists and turns, was up 0.3 percent in early trade. 
Shares in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), up earlier this week on the prospect of a merger with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), rose more than 2 percent after disclosures showed its board members received their first bonuses in four years.
The retail sector led gains with a roughly 1 percent rise, while tech stocks, on a tear after surprisingly upbeat results from chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) earlier this week, gained another 0.6 percent, tracking gains on Wall Street and in Asia.
German chipmaker Siltronic AG was the Stoxx 600's top gainer with a 3.6 percent rise. 
Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) and Puma SE both gained after a disappointing quarterly report from rival  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) which hinted at a slowing of the U.S. firm's momentum in its home market. 
Despite the relief, there were more signs of firms making preparations for a no-deal Brexit that is likely to send a depressive shock coursing through Europe's major economies. 
British low-cost airline EasyJet said on Friday it was ready to suspend the voting rights of a small number of shares to comply with rules that require 50 percent plus one share of the company to be owned by EU shareholders following Brexit.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts reduced the likelihood of May's deal passing to just 50 percent, while raising the chances of ""no-deal"" to 15 percent. The bank continues to put the chances of no Brexit at all at 35 percent.

620,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>",Low prices to eat into EU sugar beet area as planting starts,"PARIS (Reuters) - Farmers in western Europe have begun sugar beet planting, with first indications pointing to a drop in area for the next harvest after a price slump fueled by the end of European Union production quotas.
The market downturn has prompted Europe's biggest sugar refiner Suedzucker to announce the closure of several factories by 2020, which could lead farmers in affected zones to make further cuts to beet planting next year.
This year's expected decline in planting should curb EU production and help to turn a global sugar surplus that has been pressuring prices into a net deficit, analysts say.
""The depressed markets after the end of the quotas has forced farmers to adapt,"" said Timothe Masson, economist at the French sugar beet growers group CGB, pegging a fall in plantings at EU level at about 5 percent. 
Assuming an average sugar yield, EU sugar production in 2019/20 would fall to about 18 million tonnes, Masson said. 
That would be down 3 million tonnes from output in 2017/18, the first season after the end of quotas, and stable versus the current 2018/19 season, when harvests were hit by drought.
EU sugar output could be reduced by a further 700,000 tonnes by aphid attacks, with many farmers in the bloc no longer allowed to use neonicotinoid pesticides because of concerns they are harmful to bees, Masson added.
In France, the EU's largest beet grower which has forbidden these crop chemicals, the area drop could reach 8 percent compared to last year, he said.
As of last week, French farmers had sown about 1 percent of 445,000 hectares expected in 2019, Masson said.
Frequent showers this month have slowed early sugar beet planting, contrasting with rapid spring barley sowing in February during a warm, dry spell.
In Germany, chilly conditions were holding up planting.
Most farmers are waiting for an improvement in the current cool and cold weather before starting sowing, said Guenter Tissen, CEO of German sugar industry association WVZ. 
Beet cultivation in Germany was under pressure from unequal competition within the EU, with some countries paying premiums and some still permitting use of neonicotinoids, unlike Germany, he said, adding that it was too early to give area forecasts.

In the UK, the crop area for the 2019/20 season is expected to be between 5 percent and 10 percent lower than this year, Associated British Foods (LON:ABF) said in its latest update last month.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Daimler has asked Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to help it explore increasing its stake in Chinese carmaker BAIC Motor Corp, its main China joint venture partner, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
A deal would be only the second since the world's biggest auto market relaxed foreign ownership rules last year.
Daimler's rival BMW became the first to take advantage of the changes when it agreed in October to buy control of its venture with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd for 3.6 billion euros ($4.08 billion). 
Caps on foreign ownership previously prevented overseas carmakers from controlling any Chinese maker or joint venture with foreign peers. Last year those limits were removed for firms making fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which will be followed in 2020 by the removal of limits on makers of commercial vehicles such as trucks and buses. 
In 2022, the limits will be lifted on the wider car market. BMW's deal with Brilliance China will only take effect then.
Daimler's discussions with BAIC are at an early stage and its plan to increase the stake in BAIC's Hong Kong-listed entity has not been finalised and could change later, cautioned the people, who declined to be identified as the information is confidential.
Daimler holds 30.4 percent of BAIC's Hong Kong-listed shares, representing a 9.55 percent overall stake in its Chinese partner, according to BAIC's June 2018 interim report.
State-owned BAIC Group and steel giant Beijing Shougang owns 42.6 percent and 12.8 percent of BAIC through its non-tradable domestic shares, respectively. 
It is not clear whether Daimler would seek a majority stake in BAIC, which has a current market capitalisation of $4.9 billion.
Daimler declined to comment on speculation about its partnerships. Beijing-based BAIC did not respond to a request for comments. Goldman declined to comment. 
Daimler owns 49 percent in Beijing Benz Automotive Co, its main JV with BAIC, as well as a 3.93 percent stake in Beijing Electric Vehicle Co., a subsidiary of BAIC. It also has a smaller JV with new energy vehicle maker BYD.
It is also setting up a ride-hailing JV in China with Geely Group, Reuters reported in October. Geely bought a 9.69 percent stake in Daimler in early 2018 and demanded an alliance.
Daimler sold 653,000 cars in China last year, its biggest sales market in the world.
Two separate people with knowledge of the matter said Daimler would still like to raise its 49 percent stake in Beijing Benz Automotive. It held talks with BAIC last year but those petered out earlier this year, said one of them. 
BAIC denied a Bloomberg report in early December that Daimler had raised the prospect of increasing its stake in Beijing Benz to at least 65 percent.

The benchmark Treasury note’s yield fell back to a one-year low.
The Stoxx Europe 600 climbed, with retail and technology shares leading gainers. In Asia, a late-day turnaround put most benchmark stock indexes back into the green, from Japan to Korea and Australia. U.S. futures dipped after an S&P 500 Index rally hours earlier produced a broad-based advance. Japan’s 10-year bond yield fell to the lowest since 2016, New Zealand’s dropped below 2 percent for the first time and Australia’s approached a record low -- all underscoring the return to globally low long-term rates after central banks showed no moves to tighten policies. Sovereign bonds in Europe bucked the trend to trade lower. The dollar steadied.
Mild optimism that the Federal Reserve’s dovish tilt can prolong the bull market for equities helped push the MSCI index of global equities up to its highest level since early October this week. Bonds, however, are signaling worries that momentum in growth and inflation remains subdued. Lower Consumer-price growth highlighted the struggles facing the Bank of Japan as some questioned its commitment to a 2 percent target. Trade talks between the the U.S. and China are scheduled to continue next week.
“With the start of a global-easing cycle, the prospect of the resolution of the trade war, maybe some positive development on the Brexit front, we have the foundations and the catalysts for a revival of growth,” Sandip Bhagat, chief investment officer at Whittier Trust Co., told Bloomberg TV in New York. “I wouldn’t be surprised if growth, both of the earnings and economic variety, bottoms out in the first quarter. The market is now focused on the second half of 2019, where we see this revival.”
Elsewhere, sterling bounced off its recent lows as European leaders moved to stop a chaotic no-deal Brexit from happening next week, handing the U.K. an extra two weeks. The U.K. now needs to decide by April 12 what it will do next.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 03:30AM ET</span>",Shadow margin loans make a sly return as China stocks sizzle,"By Shu Zhang and Samuel Shen
SINGAPORE/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - On a cloudy March morning in Shanghai's glitzy financial district of Lujiazui, Ye Lixia was knocking on the doors of potential clients, offering loans to bet on a surging stock market.
""We provide money to investors who need quick funding to capitalize on the market rally,"" Ye told Reuters. 
Ye, in her 30s and a general director at Bo Ying Asset Management, is one of the thousands of gray market lenders operating in the shadows of China's colossal capital markets.
A stock market that shot up 25 percent in the last three months has revived the undercover margin lending business that was notoriously responsible for China's 2015 boom-bust market volatility.
In defiance of warnings from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), shadow lenders pitch their business via cold telephone calls and social media advertisements, dangling the prospects of a reversal of fortune.
""In China, speculators adopt very aggressive trading strategies, gaming the rules... and pushing policy-makers' tolerance to the limit,"" said Stephen Huang, vice president of Shanghai See Truth Investment Management Co.
The Shanghai index's swift recovery from last year's heavy losses has been primarily driven by signs of an end to the long-running Sino-U.S. trade war.
Beijing's efforts to lower the cost of lending in a slowing economy, and foreign investment inflows after the inclusion of Chinese A-shares in global equity benchmarks encouraged the rally.
Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext, traditionally a hotbed for speculation, has surged more than 30 percent this year. 
In the official margin financing market, in which stock investors borrow money from brokerages, outstanding loans have jumped nearly 30 percent since the end of January to 911.6 billion yuan ($136.08 billion). That is just a third of the 2.27 trillion yuan record hit in June 2015.
But unofficial margin financing, in which small investors borrow from grey market lenders, is thriving. 
Hui Ju Ying, a margin lending platform, lures clients with suggestions of ""returns of 100 percent."" Another platform, www.zfpz.com, says: ""young people shouldn't resign to mediocrity; margin financing can change your fate.""
The CSRC said in late February that it was closely monitoring the situation. But regulators have so far taken a soft approach towards such lending. 
""Last year, the government was talking about reducing leverage. Now, the government is talking about steadying leverage, which is good for us,"" said Ye, whose company borrows money from banks and lends it to investors.
NO DEJA VU?
Managers at five margin lenders said they began aggressively marketing loans over the past few weeks to investors eager to make outsized stock market bets.
Such lending helped the Shanghai stock index double between 2014 and mid-2015, forcing the authorities to crack down on shadow lending and causing a 40 percent decline in stocks over six months. 
Some of the lenders this time around are newcomers. Others are survivors of the last crackdown, emboldened by the belief that regulators, focused on enabling funding for struggling private firms, will look the other way.
""The loans we make are deals between us and investors and are none of brokerages' business,"" said Xiao Xiao, a saleswoman at shadow financing platform xianniuwang.com.
The financing has been a boon to risk takers like Zhang, who more than doubled his investment capital via shadow margin loans through leveraged bets on 5G-related China tech stocks. 
With 50,000 yuan in hand, Zhang, who was willing to disclose only his family name, borrowed 500,000 yuan from a gray-market lender named Gu Zhang Gui six months ago. He has earned 56,000 yuan in net returns so far, he told Reuters.
Zhang pays a daily interest rate of 0.06 percent, which translates to an annualized cost of funding of 22 to 24 percent.
""Stocks are rallying so we investors are making money. And then we want to make even more money, so we are turning to those lenders who can leverage our funding,"" he said.
Individual investors account for about 80 percent of total stock market turnover. Many are day-traders, frequently churning their holdings for quick returns.
Regular broker financing is regulated and limited at 1:1 leverage - the maximum amount they can borrow is equal to their principal. Shadow margin loans allow for a leverage of up to 10 times the capital the investor provides, and lenders do not dictate what stocks investors can buy.
""No qualification is needed,"" said an executive who used to work for Beijing-based Yueda Investment, a gray-market lender. ""Investors just come to our office to take a look and then we sign loan contracts.""
Operating in the shadows carries risks, he said, notably that they cannot use the courts to recover losses.
A director at another Shanghai-based margin lender said his company charges interest of 11.5 to 15.5 percent on money that cost them about 9.5 percent. 
(For a graphic on 'China margin lending rises sharply as market jumps' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2HD8Jqa)
BANK INVOLVEMENTTwo of the gray-market margin financiers interviewed by Reuters said their initial funding came from banks. Banks are prohibited from directly financing stock market investment but use complex product structures to bypass regulations.
Both declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. The names of banks lending to trust companies are never revealed on shadow margin loan contracts. 
On March 15, the Taizhou branch of China's banking watchdog fined two lenders for allowing bank money to flow illegally into the stock market. The Guangdong branch of the CSRC has banned brokerages from cooperating with shadow lenders. 
That caused a 4 percent drop in China stocks, their worst day in five months.
Domestic brokerage Shenwan Hongyuan Securities estimated there were about 10,000 grey market lenders running 1-1.5 trillion yuan in margin financing in 2015. Volumes are much lower this time, which is why analysts expect regulators look away for a while longer.
""I think regulators want to see more active trading... Investors or speculators are all welcome,"" said a senior manager at domestic brokerage Industrial Securities.

""After reviewing the FRA Update, the board confirms its continued confidence in the CEO and her ability to lead and manage the bank's work in the fight against money laundering,"" Swedbank chairman Lars Idermark said in the statement.
Still, the board said it would also conduct a deeper review in cooperation with the ""relevant authorities"", without specifying which ones.
Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) was hired by Swedbank last month to investigate allegations in the media that at least 40 billion Swedish crowns ($4.3 bln) of suspicious payments moved between accounts held at its Baltic branches and suspect accounts at Danske Bank between 2007-2015.
Swedbank is one of several banks pulled into a widening scandal engulfing Danske Bank, whose Estonian branch was used for some 200 billion euros ($227 billion) of suspicious payments between 2007 and 2015.
The FRA report, published by Swedbank but redacted in parts, focused on the 50 clients identified in a media report by Swedish Television. 
It did not include findings of a previous internal and undisclosed report or cover allegations made by activist fund manager Bill Browder.
Swedbank said it would continue to strengthen its anti money-laundering capabilities. 

""I have also decided to establish a specialized Financial Crime Intelligence Unit to secure a continued focused approach as criminal behavior develops over time,"" Swedbank CEO Birgitte Bonnesen said in the statement.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 02:06AM ET</span>",Hyundai shareholders inflict big defeat on U.S. fund Elliott in proxy vote,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group companies' shareholders rejected on Friday Elliott Management's demands for a massive special dividend and board seats, dealing a blow to the U.S. hedge fund's campaign to shake up South Korea's second-biggest family-run conglomerate.
Although Hyundai fended off the threat from Elliott at the closely watched vote, it still faces a daunting challenge of winning shareholder support for a planned restructuring that should aid the handover of the group's reins to heir apparent Euisun Chung. 
Elliott thwarted Hyundai's restructuring proposal last year, and Friday's win would have provided fresh impetus to empower small investors in Asia's fourth-largest economy, long dominated by powerful elites accused of taking minority investors for granted.
But activist investor Paul Singer’s $34 billion fund failed to convince other shareholders on Friday that the group should pay out excess cash and bring in more independent directors to improve governance and accountability. 
Its demand for 7 trillion won ($6.2 billion) in dividend - more than six times what Hyundai had offered - was rejected by other minority shareholders on the grounds that the automaking group needed to lift investment in new technologies at a time of plunging profit.
""The dividend proposed by the shareholder (Elliott) may sound tempting, but in the long term, it is like a poisoned chalice or nothing but cutting open the belly of a goose with the golden eggs,"" Hyundai Motor shareholder Na Hong-seob said at the automaker's annual general meeting in Seoul. 
Elliott also wanted a total of five board nominees at Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis to address ""governance shortcomings"", citing investments in non-core assets such as a $10 billion land acquisition in Seoul's Gangnam business district.
As of November, Elliott held more than 2.5 percent of common stock in Hyundai Mobis, 3 percent in Hyundai Motor and 2.1 percent in affiliate Kia Motors.
BIGGER CHALLENGE
The conglomerate still faces the bigger challenge of successfully revamping its ownership structure, a process which is attracting close scrutiny from Elliott and other investors amid a government-backed push to curb the power of South Korea's dominant family-run business empires, or chaebols.
A vote on restructuring requires approval from two-thirds of voters present, a higher threshold than the half required at general meetings.
Elliott garnered support of about 25 percent of voters present for its proposals for Mobis nominees at Friday's meeting. That compared with some 90 percent backing for the firm's own proposals. 
Elliott said it is ""encouraged"" by shareholder support for its proposals. ""We are confident that the future holds further improvements at Hyundai,"" an Elliott spokesman said in a statement. 
Some analysts said Elliott would not mind Friday's defeat as it had a bigger gameplan regarding Hyundai's planned restructuring. 
""Still a bigger battle has not yet started. I think Elliott aims to ultimately rally support from shareholders and win a better deal in terms of a restructuring plan in the future,"" Park Ju-gun, the head of corporate analysis firm CEO Score, said.
The results on Friday could reduce the activist investor's influence with South Korean investors, said Park Sang-in, a professor at Seoul National University. 
""Elliott was not able to give a good impression to domestic investors. So investors who used to be favorable to Elliott may now have second thoughts,"" he said. 
""However, Hyundai should present a reasonable restructuring plan rather than slightly tweaking last year’s proposal to win shareholder support.""
Hyundai Motor's shares fell by about a quarter last year, and while it has showed some improvement in 2019 the company's outlook remains bleak following six consecutive years of falling net profits.
""The auto industry is expected to see a tough year ahead, as falling demand in the United States, a major market, and stalling growth in China and Europe remain,"" Hyundai Motor Chief Executive Lee Won-hee told shareholders.

Shares of Hyundai Motor fell 1.2 percent on Friday while Hyundai Mobis shares declined 0.5 percent in a flat wider market.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Eisai Co Ltd on Friday said it has begun phase 3 clinical trials of Alzheimer's treatment BAN2401, a day after the Japanese drugmaker and U.S. partner Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) scrapped trials for another Alzheimer's drug, aducanumab.
The aducanumab announcement knocked $18 billion of Biogen's stock value. On Friday, Eisai was untraded, flooded with sell orders at 7,565 yen, almost 17 percent lower than its previous close.
The demise of aducanumab came after independent experts determined the trials had little hope of succeeding, marking the latest setback in the quest to treat a mind-wasting disease that affects 5.7 million people in the United States alone.
Eisai and Biogen were jointly developing three experimental drugs for Alzheimer's: aducanumab, BAN2401 and elenbecestat, all designed to target the brain-destroying protein beta amyloid.
""As we have believed aducanumab was the best hope for treating Alzheimer's, ending its trials is big negative surprise,"" said analyst Motoya Kohtani at Nomura Securities.
BAN2401 has been met with scepticism since the partners reported promising but confusing 18-month results in July. Yet Eisai remains confident in its continued development.
""We still believe that amyloid beta hypothesis is potentially the right approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease,"" an Eisai spokesman told Reuters.
Eisai will conduct phase 3 trials of BAN2401 involving 1,566 patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease dementia with confirmed amyloid accumulation.
Alzheimer's treatments are known as being particularly difficult to develop, as both diagnosis and the recruitment of appropriate trial participants are challenging.
From 1998 through 2017, only four treatments have been approved with another 146 attempts resulting in failure, according to the Adis R&D Insight database.

Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia. In Japan, the government estimates there will be 7 million dementia sufferers in 2025, from 4.6 million in 2012.

(Reuters) -  Murphy Oil Corp  (NYSE:MUR) is exiting Malaysia with a $2.13 billion sale of its oil and gas assets there to Thailand's PTTEP and said it will use the proceeds to pay down debt, buy back shares and fund potential deals in the United States. 
Besides the enterprise value of the sale, PTT Exploration and Production Public Co Ltd (PTTEP), a unit of state-owned PTT PCL, will also pay Murphy Oil up to $100 million as a bonus if certain exploration projects show results before October 2020, the companies said on Thursday. 
The deal between Murphy and PTTEP comes as M&A activity is heating up in Malaysia's oil and gas sector, where global companies pursuing expansion plans are spotting opportunities. 
Reuters reported that Murphy was nearing a deal to sell its Malaysian assets to PTTEP earlier on Thursday. 
""Like many Asian national companies, PTTEP suffers from a maturing domestic portfolio. To improve its production outlook the company has been on the hunt for license extensions and counter-cyclical M&A opportunities, with a focus on Southeast Asia,"" said Alex Siow, a research analyst at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, in an email. 
""This is the biggest oil and gas deal in Southeast Asia for over five years, and supports our view that 2019 is set to be a big year for M&A activity in the region,"" he said. 
Reuters reported in November, citing sources, that Murphy was in talks to sell its Malaysian assets after an unsolicited bid. Sources had said Spanish oil major Repsol (MC:REP), whose presence in Malaysia is focused on the upstream sector, or other global majors could be potential buyers for Murphy's assets. 
Murphy had proven reserves of 816 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in 2018, of which 129 million boe were from Malaysia. Those assets produced over 48,000 boe per day for Murphy last year. 
The deal follows moves by other U.S. oil majors to turn investment to high-yielding shale fields at home, where output has soared to more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd), rising over 2 million bpd since early 2018. 
WESTERN FOCUS 
Murphy, which also has operations in Canada, Brazil and other regions, said it will focus on the Western Hemisphere - mostly on the Eagle Ford basin in Texas and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico - for future exploration and production deals. 
""We expect to generate approximately $1.2 billion of free cash flow at a flat $55 West Texas Intermediate price,"" CEO Roger Jenkins said on a call with analysts.
Futures for light crude were trading at around $60 per barrel on Friday. [O/R] 
Murphy shares rose as much as 1.8 percent before closing at $30.97 on Thursday. 
PTTEP said the deal is expected to promptly raise sales volumes by 15 percent and operating cash flow upon completion. 
""This diversified self-funded portfolio will add a mix of production, development and exploration assets that will provide immediate revenue stream, production and reserves for both short and long term,"" PTTEP said in a statement. 
Malaysian state-owned Petronas partners Murphy in Malaysia, which has seen M&A pick-up in the energy sector.
In September, Austrian oil and gas company OMV agreed on a joint venture with Sapura Energy Bhd, paying $540 million for a 50 percent stake in the exploration assets of the Malaysian firm. 
In August, citing sources, Reuters reported that U.S. company Hess Corp's Southeast Asian offshore natural gas assets had attracted bid interest from PTTEP and OMV. Hess later said it had no plans to sell its Southeast Asian assets. 
Murphy also announced a $500 million share buyback as well as debt reduction of about $750 million. The company had about $3 billion in debts as of December 2018.
The deal on the Malaysian assets is expected to close by the end of the second quarter. 

Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) served as advisor to Murphy on the sale, while Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co was the financial advisor. Jefferies Group LLC was the financial advisor to PTTEP.

Net profit for Q4 fell 32% from the same period last year to 14.3 billion yuan ($2.1 billion), according to a statement released after the Hang Seng Index closed on Thursday. Tencent said the fall in profit was due to costs related to the listing of Tencent Music, the company’s streaming music subsidiary.

633,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 11:32PM ET</span>",American Airlines pilots expect to test 737 MAX software fix in Boeing simulator,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines pilots expect to test Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX software fix on simulators this weekend, the pilots' union told Reuters on Thursday, a key step in restoring their confidence in the jet after two fatal crashes.
Boeing has been working on a software upgrade for an anti-stall system and pilot displays on its fastest-selling jetliner in the wake of the deadly Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October.
Similarities between the flight path in the Lion Air incident and a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10 have raised fresh questions about the system, and pilots want assurances that the update is solid. The two crashes killed everyone aboard both planes, a total of 346 people.
American is the second largest U.S. operator of the MAX in the United States, behind Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). United Airlines is the third U.S. carrier to operate the MAX.
""This airplane can be a safe airplane, and there have been great strides on getting a fix in the works, but I'll have a better feel after we can test it out,"" said Mike Michaelis, safety committee chairman of the Allied Pilots Association, or APA, which represent American Airlines pilots.
Michaelis said one APA pilot and one pilot from American's management team would test the software fix in Renton, Washington, where Boeing builds the MAX and has two simulators.
Boeing declined to comment.
The MAX jets were grounded worldwide in the wake of the Ethiopian crash. For the aircraft to fly again, U.S. pilots must complete new training approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Boeing has proposed new computer-based training on the software update, which also needs FAA approval, followed by a mandatory test.
American and Southwest pilots have said the training should be enhanced, and Europe and Canada have said they would seek their own guarantees over the safety of the MAX.
Following the crashes, Chicago-based Boeing will offer as standard a safety feature that might have warned earlier of problems that possibly played a role, two people briefed on the matter said on Thursday.
PILOTS CONFRONTED BOEING EXECS
One month after the Lion Air incident, American Airlines pilots confronted four Boeing executives in Fort Worth, Texas, demanding to know why the manufacturer had not told them about the new system, known as MCAS, and made a cockpit warning light mandatory, pilots at the meeting told Reuters.
They also questioned whether a 56-minute iPad course on the MAX had been sufficient.
MAX simulator training is not required, partly because not many simulators exist. 
Southwest and American, which operate 34 and 24 MAX jets, respectively, expect to receive MAX simulators later this year.
Still, the events experienced on the Lion Air flight can be replicated in other 737 simulators, pilots said.
Canada's CAE Inc, the main simulator producer, said it has delivered nine of the simulators, which are now in high demand by airlines but take about a year to build. CAE expects to deliver 20 more in 2019.
""For now we want to get our safety experts in these unicorn simulators to show us what the software fix does,"" said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilots' union and a 737 pilot.

""When it comes to safely issues, it has to be a full-course meal, nothing a la carte,"" he added.

That’s what tonight’s decision from the Council enables us to do.”
“There was a clear result that we should leave the European Union,” May added. “We said, ‘Here’s the vote, what is your decision? And we will deliver on it.’ And I believe it is our duty as a government, as a Parliament to deliver on that vote.”
On the Sino-U.S. trade front, high-level officials including U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are due to meet in Beijing for a fresh round of talks next week.
Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that U.S. officials are not targeting a “swift trade deal.” Instead, the goal is to reach an agreement during a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago sometime before the end of April, according to the people."

The finance ministry is working on a new design for the fund to make it counter cyclical, deputy minister Arturo Herrera said in an interview with TV network ADN40, during a banking conference in Acapulco.
Grappling with Pemex's financial health has been a key challenge for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December. The entity holds roughly $106 billion in financial debt, the highest amount of any state oil firm in Latin America. 
""We'd like to design it as a counter cyclical fund, like the copper funds in Chile are designed, where the resources are used not when the government wants to, but when the economy makes them necessary... In times of abundance, you put money into these resources,"" he said.
""As a second part of the fund, we'd like to use it to pay some of the debt obligations that Pemex has,"" he said.
Pemex has some $16 billion of debt payments due by the end of next year. Herrera said Mexico's fund has a generous margin that could be put to helping Pemex. 
Herrera said he expected to make an announcement in the next two or three weeks on the plan to use the public income stabilization fund, which holds about 290 billion pesos ($15.4 billion). 
Rating agency Fitch downgraded Pemex's credit rating in late January to one level above junk status, citing the company's high leverage and tax burden. 
In February, Mexico said it would inject $3.9 billion into Pemex, promising to strengthen its finances and prevent a further credit downgrade. Investors largely saw the plan as only a short-term fix. 
Chile has two sovereign wealth funds. Unusual for Latin American countries, they were created to help finance pensions and as a ""rainy day fund"" for times of economic stress.

639,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>",Stop Brexit Petition Passes Two Million Names as Delay Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- More than 2 million people signed an online petition urging the government to cancel Brexit, with support rocketing in the wake of Theresa May’s statement Wednesday.
Whatever the prime minister hoped to achieve from her address to the nation, in which she blamed members of Parliament for the impasse in the Brexit process and told those who voted to break with the EU she was on their side, it’s unlikely she expected a slew of celebrities to urge their social media followers to oppose her plan.
Parliament’s petitions website repeatedly crashed as the number of signatures shot up -- fueled by endorsements from singer Annie Lennox, actor Hugh Grant, science broadcaster Brian Cox and comedian David Mitchell.
“The rate of signing is the highest the site has ever had to deal with,” the House of Commons petitions committee said on Twitter. “Between 80,000 and 100,000 people have been simultaneously viewing the petition,” it said, “nearly 2,000 signatures are being completed every minute.”
The tally passed 1 million shortly before 3 p.m. London time Thursday after the link to the petition went viral on social media platforms including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter. It passed 2 million just after 10:35 p.m. while EU leaders were locked in talks with May at a summit in Brussels, negotiating a delay to the divorce date.
“The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is ‘the will of the people,”’ the text of the petition says. “We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU.”
Any petition exceeding 100,000 signatures is eligible for debate by Parliament. It’s then up to a special Petitions Committee comprised of rank-and-file lawmakers to decide whether one should be held.
“I’ve signed. And it looks like every sane person in the country is signing too,” Grant wrote on Twitter. “National emergency. Revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU.”
Underlying data showed the most signatories coming from areas that supported remain in the 2016 referendum, including Edinburgh, London, Bristol and Cambridge. But there were also thousands of supporters in Leave-supporting areas such as northeast England, the Midlands and Wales.
Figures also showed signatories in countries around the world, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, suggesting not all may be U.K. voters.
May’s office made clear that she has no intention of revoking Article 50 and keeping Britain in the EU.
“We have said probably 12,000 times in this room -- and she has probably said thousands of times herself -- that is something she is not prepared to do,” the prime minister’s spokeswoman, Alison Donnelly, told reporters at a briefing in Parliament.

640,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 08:25PM ET</span>","As worries about populism in Europe rise, investors bet on stock market volatility","By Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are betting on heightened political uncertainty and greater volatility in European stock markets ahead of European Parliament elections in May amid growing concerns about rising populism.
In one of the first concrete signs in financial markets that investors are bracing for political instability, VSTOXX futures, which reflect investor sentiment and economic uncertainty, have jumped in recent weeks.
While the classic gauge of fear -- known as implied volatility, which tracks demand for options in European stocks -- is currently at 15.68, futures that bet on the same thing over the coming months show a pronounced jump.
That's because investors have piled on trades that bet on big swings in stocks as election day nears. 
Implied volatility for futures contracts expiring in May show a pronounced jump to 16.8, compared with 15.35 in April. The contracts measure the 30-day implied volatility of the euro zone STOXX 50 index.
""We are seeing a bit of a kink around May when we have European elections and we have this wave of populism,"" said Edmund Shing, head of equities and derivatives strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
(GRAPHIC: Rising implied volatility - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UL77h9) 
LOOMING ELECTIONS
More than 350 million EU citizens will head to the polls between May 23 and 26 to elect a new Parliament, a vote that will shape the future of the bloc amid a backlash against immigration and years of austerity.
Mainstream center-left and center-right lawmakers may lose control of the legislature for the first time, as euroskeptic and far-right candidates build support.
Herve Guyon, Societe Generale's head of European equity derivatives flow strategy and solutions, said the rise of populism had triggered a recent flurry of speculative trades.
""Political uncertainty might be coming from the EU rather than the United States. We've seen investors doing very large trades to benefit from an increase in volatility around these events,"" he said.
""We as a bank don't expect the elections to be a massive game-changer. The populists won't get enough to disrupt the political system, but we do note some investors did take some positions on this event.""
The implied volatility is still well below levels seen in late 2018 when global stock markets were routed amid worries about rising interest rates, slowing economic growth and the trade war between Beijing and Washington.
In late December, it shot to above 26, its highest since February. 
But the flurry of activity suggests investors are seeking out new opportunities after a slide in implied volatility across major asset classes.
Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at asset manager Brooks MacDonald, said some of the activity may also be due to persistent uncertainty about Britain's exit from the European Union as the Brexit date of March 29 nears. 
This year, volatility across currency, fixed income and stocks markets has plunged as the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have taken dovish policy stances. 
The  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) currency volatility indicator hit multi-year lows this week, while the proxy for fixed income volatility is languishing at all-time lows.
In stocks, the Cboe volatility index, Wall Street's so-called ""fear gauge"", fell to its weakest in six months this week. 
""There's been a cross-asset volatility crash -- in euro-dollar, U.S. rates and equities -- in the aftermath of (ECB President Mario) Draghi's and (Fed Chairman Jerome) Powell's comments and the expectation of lower rates for longer,"" said Guyon.

641,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 08:12PM ET</span>","NYSE wins Uber, Pinterest listings: sources","By Liana B. Baker and Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc and Pinterest, two of the highest profile internet companies planning to go public this year, have picked the New York Stock Exchange as the venue for their stock listings, according to sources familiar with the matter. 
The companies and the NYSE declined to comment. 
NYSE has become the exchange of choice over NASDAQ for big technology companies in the past few years after NASDAQ famously bumbled the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO with massive technology errors. The exchanges compete fiercely for listing fees, and much like investment banks, often begin courting large companies long before they are ready to list. 
NASDAQ did score the IPO of ride hailing firm Lyft Inc, which could reach or exceed a $23 billion valuation when it prices its shares March 28. Lyft will be the first internet player to kick off a string of hotly anticipated public debuts that will energize the IPO market after a quiet start to the year. 
In a sign that investors crave newly issued stock, shares of Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI) surged 31 percent in their debut on Thursday, giving the jeans maker a market value of $8.7 billion.
Bloomberg first reported the Uber news on Thursday while the Wall Street Journal first reported the Pinterest news. 
Uber, a global logistics and transportation company most recently valued at $76 billion in the private market, is seeking a valuation as high as $120 billion, although some analysts have pegged its value closer to $100 billion based on selected financial figures it has disclosed.
Pinterest, which owns the image search website known for food and fashion photos, was valued at $12 billion in its last fundraising round in 2017. The San Francisco-based company has grown rapidly since its founding in 2008, boasting 250 million monthly active users last September.
Pinterest monetizes its website through advertisements, which it places among the ""pins"" that users put on the site.
Reuters previously reported Pinterest could raise around $1.5 billion in the IPO, which is likely to come in the first six months of 2019. The Wall Street Journal said on Thursday that the company could reveal its IPO filing as early as Friday and list its shares by mid-April.

642,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 08:01PM ET</span>",Suspicion and strife strain Ethiopian plane crash probe,"By Maggie Fick and Tim Hepher
ADDIS ABABA/PARIS (Reuters) - At the headquarters of the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority, a paper sign balanced above room 107 and a threadbare square of carpet welcome a stream of foreign visitors to the Accident Investigation Bureau.
The office - with three investigators and an annual budget of less than 2.5 million Birr ($89,000) - is leading a multi-party, multi-nation probe into what caused an Ethiopian Airlines flight to crash on March 10, killing all 157 people on board. 
Brusque foreign investigators in cargo pants and Ethiopians in suits or reflective vests wave away questions from reporters on how their inquiries are progressing. 
This modest agency is under intense international scrutiny because the results of its investigation could have far-reaching consequences for the global aviation industry.
If the investigators highlight flaws in the 737 MAX 8 that echo a recent crash of the same model in Indonesia, their report could deal a major blow to Boeing (NYSE:BA), the world's biggest planemaker and a massive U.S. exporter. 
But if investigators find Ethiopian Airlines fell short in maintenance, training or piloting, that could damage one of Africa's most successful companies, a symbol of Ethiopia's emergence as a regional power.
Disagreements have broken out in Addis Ababa between Ethiopian authorities and foreign investigators over issues including the handling of evidence and crash site management, according to several sources close to the investigation. 
Kevin Humphreys, a former Irish regulator who founded the country's air investigation agency, told Reuters the high stakes involved tend to make probes like this one particularly tough.
""There are tensions because it is unrealistic to assume that international protocols are always going to work. There is a potentially important economic impact from such investigations.""
An 18-strong team of American investigators has been sent to aid the Ethiopians with the inquiry, including representatives from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Boeing, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which certified 737 MAX planes as safe.
U.S. and some other foreign investigators are unhappy because Ethiopia is so far sharing only limited information, the sources said. 
""There is no opportunity for the international community to benefit and learn from this,"" said one of them, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Some foreign officials are also unhappy about the prominent role Ethiopian Airlines played in the probe, suggesting a possible conflict of interests, they said.
But one Addis Ababa-based source said the carrier's role in the investigation does not necessarily indicate it is trying to exert undue influence. The airline is more likely involved because it is the most well-funded and staffed state enterprise able to help the over-stretched inquiry team, he added.
""When you have a vacuum, someone has to fill it,"" he said.
Ethiopian Airlines' spokesman Asrat Begachew said the carrier was supporting the investigation. ""We are not taking the lead,"" he added, declining to comment further.
Under global aviation rules, interested parties like airlines and manufacturers are discouraged from speaking publicly about the investigation.
Yet in the first days after the Flight 302 crash, Ethiopian Airlines made all of the public statements, including announcing the black box recorders would be sent overseas for data extraction.
It was not until six days after the tragedy that the Ministry of Transport began briefing the media and public. 
Hours after the crash, Ethiopian Airlines tweeted a picture of its CEO Tewolde Gebremariam holding a piece of debris in the crater of the crash site, surprising aviation experts who said the site should have been preserved for investigators. 
Musie Yehyies, spokesman for Ethiopia's Ministry of Transport, said the government had been quick to share information about the crash. He denied there was any mistrust between the Ethiopians and other parties.
""Our friendship with the United States is obvious,"" he told Reuters. ""Plenty of governments have been offering assistance, and some of them have helped practically.""
The ministry did not respond to requests for comment on the airline's role in the investigation or any potential conflict of interest. 
Ethiopia's Accident Investigation Bureau and civil aviation authority, which fall under the transport ministry, declined to comment on the investigation or any grievances of parties involved. 
Boeing, the FAA and the NTSB also declined to comment.
BLACK BOXES
The cockpit voice and flight data recorders were recovered the day after the crash, but it took Ethiopian investigators three days to decide where to send them for the information to be extracted and decoded. Like many fast-growing players, the Ethiopians do not have the technology to perform the task.
In a sign of the distrust between the parties, the Ethiopians turned down an American offer to perform the analysis in the United States, according to two sources. 
U.S. authorities declined to comment.
Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde personally approached German authorities to request to send the black boxes to Germany to have the data extracted there, a separate source with knowledge of matter told Reuters. Airlines are not usually involved in such decisions, according to current and former investigators.
The airline could not comment on the investigation, a spokesman said in response to questions about the incident. 
However German officials said they too did not have the most recent software needed to extract the data, so the devices were eventually sent to France.
Partial data from the flight data recorder was shared informally late on Monday with U.S. and French investigators in Paris, but nothing from the cockpit voice recorder, three sources familiar with the matter said. 
It is common for the host investigator to closely guard voice recordings to protect privacy but unusual for relatively little data to be available a week after being downloaded.
""As an investigator, it is hard to understand the logic behind withholding safety-of-flight information,"" Greg Feith, a former senior air safety investigator with the NTSB, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Thursday.
Ethiopia said on Thursday it had begun analyzing cockpit data and was working with U.S. and European experts.
Following Ethiopian Airlines' last major crash, outside Beirut in 2010, an investigation led by the Lebanese and to which France contributed blamed crew mismanagement of the aircraft and poor communication in the cockpit.
The airline - led by the same CEO as today - said the report was ""biased, lacking evidence, incomplete,"" pointing to evidence of an explosion on board. 
HIGH STAKES
Most crash investigations end up pinpointing a combination of factors.
For decades, reconstructions by independent investigators have been credited with reducing air accidents to record low levels. The system of co-operation works by sticking to technical details and avoiding blame or other agendas.
Safety experts worry that too many turf battles can cloud the progress of an investigation.
""The sole purpose of an accident investigation is to reduce the chances of something ever happening again,"" said Paul Hayes, safety director at the Flight Ascend Consultancy. 
The Flight 302 crash triggered the global grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX jets, wiping billions off the company's market value. Also on the line are more than $500 billion worth of 737 MAX orders. 
Ethiopian Airlines is regulated by the country's civil aviation authority, but its resources are far more extensive. The carrier's operating revenue in the 2017/18 financial year was $3.7 billion. This dwarfs the regulator's budget, which is 360 million Birr ($12.5 million) for this fiscal year. 
CRASH SITE
Responsibility for leading the probe fell to Ethiopia because the crash occurred on its soil. Nairobi-bound Flight 302 went down into farmland minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa. 
The crash killed people from 35 countries, all of which are also entitled to examine the crash site and join in the investigation. America, China, Kenya, Britain, Canada, Israel, France and other nations have sent investigators.
Some nations were unhappy that Ethiopia was using heavy earth-moving equipment at the site, potentially damaging evidence or human remains, although others said that was the only way to move heavy items such as engines.
Some foreign officials also complained of being unable to access the site in the days after the crash.
After Israel's team were not given permission to visit the site, the Israeli prime minister eventually called the Ethiopian prime minister on Wednesday, a statement on the Israeli prime minister's website said.  
A permission letter - from Ethiopian Airlines - was issued late on Thursday for the Israeli ambassador and emergency response unit ZAKA, a source familiar with the incident added.
The European Union's aviation safety agency, EASA, waited more than a week to be allowed to join the crash investigation.

""The Ethiopian investigation body is very keen to keep a very, very closed circle around the investigation,"" EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky told the European parliament on Monday.

(Reuters) -  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) reported quarterly revenue that failed to beat Wall Street estimates for the first time in over a year, as sales fell short of expectations in its biggest market of North America, sending its shares tumbling 5 percent on Thursday.
Shares of the world's largest sportswear maker have gained nearly 19 percent this year, as investors cheered its ""Consumer Direct Offense"" strategy that includes a focus on online sales, new launches and supply chain improvements to bring fresh products to shelves faster.
The company has launched timed, limited-edition sales on its app, often in collaboration with celebrities and athletes, called ""drops,"" generating hype around its brands, especially with its Jordan line of basketball shoes.
Nike has also introduced sneakers such as the Air Max 720 and Epic React Flyknit 2 to capture market share in the United States.
The efforts, however, fell short of analysts' elevated expectations. North America sales rose 7 percent to $3.81 billion in the third quarter, falling short of estimates of $3.87 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
""While it's not very clear what caused the domestic weakness, it's possible that the news of what happened with the Duke University player's shoe had a short-term negative impact,"" said Kian Salehizadeh, a senior analyst at investment firm Blockforce Capital.
College basketball superstar Zion Williamson sprained his knee in February after his Nike sneaker split during a game, prompting an outcry on social media.
Salehizadeh, whose firm owns shares in Nike through ETFs, said overall retail weakness in the United States over the last few months could also have hit sales.
Nike Chief Financial Officer Andrew Campion highlighted timing of launches of some NBA apparel products last year on a post-earnings call. A decline at the Converse brand also weighed.
""Converse is losing out to brands like Vans, while Nike seems to be focusing more on the growth of its Jordan business,"" Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez told Reuters.
Nike said it expects low single-digit reported revenue growth in the current quarter, compared to analysts' estimates of a 6.1 percent rise.
This comes as analysts have said Nike is likely to gain after German rival Adidas (DE:ADSGN) warned that supply chain issues would curb sales growth in the first half of the year, particularly in North America.
Nike's total revenue increased 7 percent to $9.61 billion, in line with analysts' average estimate. 
The maker of Air Force 1 sneakers reported net income of $1.1 billion, or 68 cents per share, for the third quarter ended Feb. 28, beating estimates of 65 cents.

647,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 06:32PM ET</span>",Boeing to offer safety feature as standard in 737 MAX software upgrade: sources,"By David Shepardson and Cindy Silviana
WASHINGTON/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co plans to offer as standard a safety feature that might have warned earlier of problems that possibly played a role in the crashes of Ethiopian and Indonesian planes that killed almost 350 people, two officials briefed on the matter said on Thursday.
Boeing will mandate a previously optional cockpit warning light as part of a software update to the 737 MAX fleet that was grounded in the wake of the fatal crashes, said the officials, who asked not to be identified.
The March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 on board has set off one of the widest inquiries in aviation history and cast a shadow over the Boeing MAX model intended to be a standard for decades. 
Initial investigations show similarities between the Ethiopian crash and the Indonesian accident in October that killed all 189 crew and passengers. A direct link between the crashes has not been proven, but attention has focused on an automated flight-control system, MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System), that came into service two years ago with the MAX.
Chicago-based Boeing, which the officials said also will retrofit older planes with the cockpit warning light, previously offered the alert, but it was not required by aviation regulators.
It is unclear how long it will take Boeing to refit existing MAX planes with new software or hardware. Experts said it could take weeks or months to be done, and for regulators to review and approve the changes. Regulators in Europe and Canada have said they will conduct their own reviews of any new systems.
The software is designed to prevent a loss of lift which can cause an aerodynamic stall, sending the plane downwards in an uncontrolled way. In the Lion Air crash, it may have been erroneously activated by a faulty sensor, investigators believe. The FAA has said installation of the new software and related training was a priority.
STEPS TO IMPROVE SAFETY
Boeing did not immediately comment on the plan to make the safety feature standard.
However, in London Thursday, Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice president of commercial marketing, said the manufacturer is moving quickly to make software changes and expects the upgrade will be approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the coming weeks.
""That includes changes in the control laws of the airplane, an update of the displays, the flight manual, as well as the training,"" he said at a conference, adding Boeing has tested the improvements in a simulator and in the air. 
The product and training updates were being made ""to further improve the safety that ensures that this will not happen again,"" Tinseth said.
He said it was too early to speculate on what the investigations will show, but defended Boeing's design and production processes.
Boeing also said it would slow work at its 737 plant in Seattle next week to allow employees to catch up on work that was previously delayed, but said this was because of winter storms and supplier delays and not fallout from the crashes.
Meanwhile, in Jakarta, Indonesian investigators described the panic of pilots grappling with airspeed and altitude problems in the last moments of the Lion Air flight.
""It seemed the pilot felt he could no longer recover the flight. Then the panic emerged,"" Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator at Indonesia's national transportation committee, said. 
Reuters reported Wednesday the Lion Air pilots scrambled through a handbook to understand why the jet was lurching downwards in the final minutes before it hit the water.
A final report on the Lion Air crash is expected in August. 
Boeing has said there was a documented procedure to handle the automated system at the heart of the problem.
In both flights, crews radioed about control problems shortly after take-off and sought to turn back. 
MULTIPLE INQUIRIES
Investigations of Boeing's conduct are starting to pile up, with several lawsuits already filed on behalf of victims of the Lion Air crash referring to the Ethiopian accident. Boeing declined to comment on the lawsuits.
Consumer advocate and former U.S. presidential candidate Ralph Nader lost a grand-niece in the Ethiopian crash and urged whistleblowers to help challenge the aviation industry and get to the bottom of what happened.
""They lulled us into complacency,"" he said in an interview in Thursday's Wall Street Journal.
SIMULATORS
Simulators for the MAX are now being manufactured but they have yet to be delivered to most airlines that have ordered them. Ethiopian Airlines said on Thursday the simulators are not designed to replicate the MCAS problems.
The airline is among the few that do have such a simulator but the captain of the doomed flight had no chance to practice on it before the fatal crash, a pilot colleague said.

In Washington, Boeing faces a criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and executives also will be summoned to a U.S. Senate panel hearing for questioning.

648,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 06:32PM ET</span>",Levi Strauss shares surge 31 percent in stock market return,"By Diptendu Lahiri and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Shares in Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI) surged 31 percent in their debut on Thursday, giving the jeans maker a market value of $8.7 billion and suggesting strong investor appetite before much-awaited listings from Lyft and Uber.
The 165-year-old U.S. company's return to the public market comes at a time when stocks are near all-time highs and the popularity of denim is surging, driven by the resurgence of 1990s styles such as high-waist and pinstriped jeans.
""I'm not going to live or die by what the stock does day in and day out,"" Chief Executive and President Chip Bergh said in a telephone interview. ""We're here to run the business for the long term. It is humbling that the stock was so well received today. That is pretty awesome.""
The self-proclaimed inventor of the blue jeans, which has grown to become one of the world's most recognized denim brands, Levi Strauss hopes to use a part of the proceeds from the IPO to expand in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and India.
""Denim continues to prove prevalent in streetwear and on the runway, so we're not expecting it to go anywhere anytime soon,"" an analyst at retail analytics firm Edited said. ""That's why now is a great time for Levi's to capitalize on this momentum.""
Levi accounted for 5 percent of the global jeans market in 2018, according to market research firm Euromonitor. The market has remained flat from 2013 to 2018, but is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 2 percent until 2023 if prices remain at 2018 levels. 
Going forward, Bergh also said Levi can double its business in Asia in the next couple of years ""and then double it again"".
Levi does not disclose its earnings in China but Bergh said it makes up around a quarter of its total Asia business, which had just over $800 million in revenue last year.
Levi first went public in 1971. It then sold 1.27 million shares at $47 each and the stock opened at $60, according to a New York Times report. After 14 years, it was taken private by the Haas family, the descendants of founder Levi Strauss, in a $1.6 billion leveraged buyout.
Levi's second IPO was priced at $17, above the expected range, in an oversubscribed offering. By Thursday afternoon, the shares had hit a high of $23.15.
Levi's market splash marks the start of what could be a blockbuster year for IPOs with several high profile companies expected to list their shares.
Ride-hailing service provider Lyft Inc kicked off the investor road show for its market debut on Monday, while larger rival Uber is expected to go public in April.
The line-up also includes photo-posting app Pinterest and business messaging app Slack.
The Haas family, which has over 100 members and is between its fifth and sixth generations, according to Bergh, will retain 80 percent voting control of the public company. 
Bergh said a desire among existing shareholders to diversify, coupled with strong corporate performance and supportive market conditions, led to the decision to go public in 2019. 
""The market is pretty ripe and we're the first big IPO of the year,"" he said. ""There was a lot of pent-up demand because it's been pretty slow the last couple of months and that was also probably a tail-wind for us.""
The company's $8.7 billion market capitalization at the start of trading is based on outstanding shares of about 390 million, which includes the over-allotment option.
""There is a lot to like when it comes to Levi Strauss the brand and its outlook moving forward,"" said Jeff Zell, senior research analyst and partner at IPO tracking firm, IPO Boutique.
""The company and the underwriters targeted a reasonable valuation to start and allowed the true investor demand to dictate price which ultimately came one dollar above range.""
Levi's revenue rose 14 percent to $5.6 billion in 2018, the bulk of which came from men's denim. Its biggest market is the Americas, accounting for 55 percent of overall revenue.
The San Francisco-based company sells in 110 countries through 50,000 retail stores, and its rivals include Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) and VF (NYSE:VFC) Corp's Lee and Wrangler brands.

To attract young customers, Levi's is planning to expand its tailor shop and print bar that allow consumers to customize and put their own designs on the company's branded jeans and T-shirts.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 06:19PM ET</span>",Swiss watchmakers say slowing growth in China won't hurt sales this year,"BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Swiss watchmakers are confident they can grow sales this year even in the face of a cooling Chinese economy, executives told Reuters at an industry fair on Thursday, as demand strengthens in other markets like the United States and Britain.
Switzerland's watch industry, which relies heavily on Chinese customers, has seen exports - the best available indicator for demand - rise only 2.1 percent in the first two months of the year, following a 6.3 percent increase last year.
However, some are confident they will do much better this year. 
""We're aiming for double-digit growth in our watch business this year,"" Jean-Christophe Babin, chief executive of LVMH's jeweler Bulgari, said in an interview at the Baselworld show.
His comments were echoed by independent watchmaker Oris, also banking on a double-digit increase, while LVMH stablemate Hublot said it had an exceptional year in 2018 and was counting on 7-8 percent growth this year from a high basis.
Oris said sales in the United States, its biggest market, were growing strongly. That trend was confirmed by retailer Watches of Switzerland, which also reported firm UK demand, particularly for Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet products. 
Luxury watch brand Patek Philippe, whose most affordable models cost around 14,000 Swiss francs, said it expected sales this year to be at a similar level to last year as it was again going to deliver around 62,000 pieces.
Its president, Thierry Stern, categorically denied recent speculation the family-owned company could be up for sale.
Swetha Ramachandran, who manages a luxury brands equity fund for GAM, said privately owned brands like Patek or Rolex were seeing better demand than their listed counterparts because they had not given in to the temptation of easy volume growth when Chinese demand boomed a few years ago.
That meant they have avoided the build-up of excess inventory that has hurt some rivals, while protecting the scarcity value of their brands. 
""Private players are managing their business for price rather than for volume,"" she told Reuters in an interview earlier this week. 
She said Richemont was still one of her top 10 holdings due to its exposure to faster-growing jewelry, but she had exited Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) shares.
Switzerland's watch industry is going through a period of profound change, notably in distribution, as brands focus on developing their own boutiques -- brick and mortar or online -- while reducing their network of third-party retailers.
This development has led more and more brands to exit the traditional watch fairs in Basel and Geneva, which they had used to build up contacts with distributors. That was reflected in fewer exhibiting brands and much less crowded aisles at the Baselworld fair on Thursday.
Several executives said efforts to hold both watch fairs in April next year, instead of separately in January and March, were going in the right direction, but were not sufficient.

""April is too late in the year,"" said Hublot CEO Ricardo Guadalupe. ""At LVMH, we have not really decided what to do next year. We already signed contracts for Baselworld so we're likely to be in Basel, but we might also organize a separate event in January to present our new models.""

650,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 05:40PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Rebound in Existing Home Sales Predicted
With the Federal Reserve giving the market some pause over the state of the economy, tomorrow’s housing data will be closely watched, given that’s been the weakest sector.
The National Association of Realtors will report on February existing home sales at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that sales of existing homes rebounded in February, rising 2.2% to an annual rate of 5.1 million.
Also on the calendar, Markit will issue preliminary purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) for manufacturing and services at 9:45 AM ET.
The manufacturing PMI is expected to edge up to 53.5, while the services PMI is seen ticking down to 55.7.
2. Tiffany, PetroChina to Report
Two stocks will report earnings on Friday that bear watching.
Tiffany (NYSE:TIF), the upscale merchant of jewelry, will report before the market opens.
The company is expected to earn $1.60 a share in the fiscal-fourth quarter, down from $1.67 a share a year ago, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. Revenue is forecast at $1.34 billion, up 0.75% from a year ago.
Investors seem cheery about the company. The stock rose 3.1% today and is up 24.3% this year. But it is still 29.4% below its all-time high of $141.64 reached last summer.
Also, PetroChina (NYSE:PTR), the big Chinese oil-and-gas producer, reports before the open.
The company is expected to report earnings of 51 cents per American depositary unit, up from 47 cents a year ago. Revenue is projected at $87.8 billion, down slightly from a year ago’s $88.3 billion.
3. GBP/USD Defends $1.30, but for How Long?
GBP/USD showed some resolve late Thursday as it defended the $1.30 handle after a sharp spiral lower amid uncertainty over whether Britain would be able meet the terms laid out by the EU for an extension to Brexit.
A leaked draft of the European Council's conclusion on Brexit said the EU would grant the U.K. an extension to Brexit until May 22 if lawmakers vote for the withdrawal deal next week.
But that appears easier said than done. EU members are not open to renegotiating the withdrawal deal, the leaked conclusion noted.
U.K. lawmakers have rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's deal twice. And with little hope that May will be able to secure meaningful changes to the deal from the EU, there's every possibility it will suffer another defeat in parliament.
Despite Britain's fate of securing a trade deal seemingly hanging in the balance, some analysts believe that cooler heads will eventually prevail as an extension is good for both the U.K and EU.
""(A)t the crunch point though it should favor both sides choosing a longer extension rather than a no-deal Brexit which would then allow the pound to rebound,"" MUFG said."
651,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 05:16PM ET</span>","Nike Falters After Hours; Scholastic, Cintas Also Down","Investing.com - Here are the stocks moving postmarket.
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) fell 3.6% in after-hours trading following quarterly results that topped forecasts but were not a blowout by any measure. Sales rose 7% from the year-ago period.
But with shares near all-time highs, investors were clearly looking for a bigger statement from the athleticwear giant.
Videogame retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) edged up 0.3% after hours as it named George Sherman as CEO, replacing interim CEO Shane Kim.
Most recently, Sherman served as CEO of Victra, a retailer for Verizon (NYSE:VZ) wireless products and services. In May last year, Michael Mauler stepped down as GameStop's CEO after just three months on the job, citing personal reasons.
Publisher Scholastic (NASDAQ:SCHL) slumped 4.1% in postmarket trading. The company reported a loss of 32 cents per share, excluding items, wider than the consensus of 28 cents per share compiled by Investing.com.
Revenue for the quarter also missed targets.
And Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS), which provides corporate uniforms, lost 3.2% in after-hours trading after reporting mixed results.
Cintas reported earnings per share of $1.84 on revenue of $1.68 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $1.72 on revenue of $1.69 billion.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley holds top spot as activist defense firm: data,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was ranked as the top adviser to companies targeted by activist investors publicly for the third straight year in 2018 while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) vaulted past two competitors to the number No. 2 spot, according to Refinitiv data published on Thursday. 
In 2018, Morgan Stanley advised on 22 campaigns, working with Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), SandRidge Energy and Cigna (NYSE:CI) when those companies faced pressure from prominent agitators such as Elliott Management and Carl Icahn, the data showed.
Unlike announced mergers and acquisitions, many companies that fend off activists do so quietly and do not want their advisers making the situations public. This can create discrepancies in the data gathered in the league tables. 
Goldman Sachs advised on 18 public campaigns in 2018. In 2017 Goldman advised on six public deals, trailing Morgan Stanley, Lazard and Raymond James, claiming the fourth spot, Refinitiv data shows. 
Lazard dropped to the number three spot in 2018, advising 16 companies. In 2017, a less busy year overall, Lazard advised 14 companies.
Spotlight Advisors, founded by Greg Taxin, a lawyer who worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and Banc of America Securities, made its first appearance on the list, capturing the No. 4 four spot ahead of UBS, Citi, Raymond James,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Moelis & Co. 
Activists were busier than ever last year and launched 500 campaigns, 5 percent more than in 2017. They pushed companies to spin off divisions and asked for board seats, among other demands.
Consumer cyclical companies were the most heavily targeted last year, Refinitiv said, with 90 campaigns in the sector. One prominent campaign was at Campbell Soup Co, where Daniel Loeb's Third Point tried to replace all directors and initially pushed for a sale of the company.
Elliott Management, which launched campaigns at BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB) Ltd, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc,  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) last year, was ranked as the busiest activist, having launched 27 campaigns in 2018.
It beat out GAMCO Investors for the top spot.
Starboard Value, ranked as the third-busiest activist with 11 campaigns in 2018. 

Innisfree and Okapi were the top proxy solicitors, firms hired to gather shareholders' votes, while Olshan Frome Wolosky beat out two competitors to rank as the busiest law firm with 101 mandates working for activists.

""The diverging EU and U.S. regulatory framework governing business activities in Iran will be far more complex in the future,"" Nokia said in its annual 20-F report.
Under the nuclear deal struck between Iran and six big powers in 2015, sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union and United Nations were lifted in return for Iran agreeing long-term curbs on a nuclear program the West suspected was geared to developing an atom bomb.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the agreement last year, and new U.S. sanctions have largely succeeded in persuading European companies to put aside business projects with Iran. 
""As a European company it will be quite challenging to reconcile the opposing foreign policy regimes of the U.S. and the EU,"" Nokia said. 
Nokia made a total of 54.6 million euros ($62 million) in sales to operators in Iran in 2018. 
""Although we evaluate our business activities on an ongoing basis, we currently do not intend to accept any new business in Iran in 2019 and intend to only complete existing contractual obligations in Iran in compliance with applicable economic sanctions and other trade-related laws,"" it said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.84%, the S&P 500 gained 1.09%, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.42%.
A wave of buying in tech pushed the broader market higher as Wall Street analysts turned bullish on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ahead of its event on March 25, when the company is expected to launch a television and video service in a bid to bolster its services revenue and reduce its reliance on iPhones.
Needham upgraded its rating on Apple to strong buy and raised its price target on the stock to $225 from $180, saying the tech giant should be should be viewed as an ecosystem rather than a product company, which merits a higher valuation.
""We anticipate better than previously expected results from both Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories, as well as valuation upside created by falling churn and strong barriers to entry"" for competitors, Needham analyst Laura Martin said in a note.
Citigroup raised its price target on Apple to $220 from $180, betting the company will launch a $100 billion buyback program and boost its dividend next month.
Semiconductor stocks also played a big role in the rally, thanks to swashbuckling gains in shares of Micron.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) soared 9.6% after reporting earnings that beat estimates and announced that it would look to cut memory production in a bid to stave off the impact from falling demand.
But financials lagged. Along with pressure on bank stocks from a dovish Fed,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) fell 1.1% after the New York Post reported that directors of Wells Fargo were talking to Harvey Schwartz, a former top executive at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), about replacing current CEO Tim Sloan. Banking stocks were also weakened by the Federal Reserve's signal a day earlier to stand pat on rate hikes through 2019.
Homebuilders were also in favor as mortgage rates fell to their lowest levels in more than a year following the Fed's dovish statement.
The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell to 4.34%, the lowest in more than a year and 19 basis points lower than a year ago, according to Mortgage News Daily.
PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) and  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) ended the day sharply higher.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 04:27PM ET</span>",Fund managers skittish over Levi's long-term growth prospects,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) & Co's is betting it can convince investors there is still plenty of global growth left for the 165-year old company, but fund managers fret the iconic blue jeans maker's stock may be too pricey to generate a decent return. 
The San Francisco-based company returned to the public markets Thursday for the first time since it went private through a leveraged buyout in 1985 with a stock debut that sold $587 million worth of shares and gave it a market value of more than $8.7 billion . 
In its prospectus, Levi's said it plans to expand its women's clothing line and grow in markets such as China, which represented just 3 percent of its net sales in 2018. Levi's shares jumped more than 30 percent, which has mutual fund managers questioning whether a long-term investment in the denim company would be profitable. 
""It's a mature company that already has broad distribution and its customer base is shrinking because department stores are shrinking,"" said Chris Terry, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management. 
Unlike companies like  Under Armour  Inc (NYSE:UAA), whose shares are up nearly 22 percent year-to-date, Levi's does not ""have a ton of room to expand the brand"" because it is already so well-known, Terry said. 
The newly-public company would also face increased competition for fund managers' attention if VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) spins off Western jeans brand Wrangler's, as expected in the first half of 2019. Wrangler's also sells apparel, including cowboy hats, shirts, and jackets. 
""With Wrangler, you get Western wear, which is probably a larger secular growth opportunity"" than denim alone and has only one other major competitor in Boot Barn Holdings Inc, Terry said. Year-to-date, shares of Boot Barn are up more than 56 percent. 
Robert Bacarella, portfolio manager of the Monetta Fund, said concerns over Levi's expansion plans outweigh the attractiveness of its brand name at its current price. 
""We're all sitting around here asking, 'Where's the growth?'"" he said. ""If they can come out with a plan to show that they can grow market share and not be as dependent on retail stores then it becomes a lot more interesting.""
With its long history, the company comes to the public markets at a time when the most anticipated initial public offerings are technology companies tied to the growth of the smartphone. 
The average age of companies that have debuted so far in 2019 is four years, according to Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital. 
Fellow Bay Area companies Lyft, Uber Technologies Inc, AirBnb Inc and Pinterest, which are all expected to go public this year, have all been founded in the last 11 years. 
Concerns about Levi's growth rate would have been alleviated if its shares had remained near the $15 initial midpoint of the IPO pricing, or roughly seven and a half times its earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization, said Arun Daniel, a portfolio manager at J O Hambro Capital Management. 

""They could see double-digit growth in the women's category by taking share from competitors like Guess, which would be interesting because then you're getting both the brand and growth and it becomes an attractive story for 3 to 5 years,"" Daniel said. ""But it all comes down to price.""

661,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",JPMorgan's Kolanovic Says Bad Liquidity Is Behind Stock Chaos,"(Bloomberg) -- On the way down, and on the way up, a common theme unites the drama in equities over the last six months: thin liquidity.
That’s according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategists led by Marko Kolanovic, who say the market’s inability to absorb trades easily conspired with other fundamental factors in fomenting wild swings. In the fourth quarter, the firm’s measure of market depth based on S&P 500 e-mini futures dropped to less than one-third the average seen during other sell-offs of the past decade.
To Kolanovic, it’s key to understanding why stocks bounced back so fast even as many buyers sat on their wallets. While the S&P 500 has surged 20 percent from its December low, almost every category of investors tracked by JPMorgan, from individuals to hedge funds and computer-driven traders, have shown little inclination to chase the rally. Their equity exposure sits at the low end of a historic range.
“Liquidity thus explains how the market could go down and up so much on a relatively small change in positioning, and we would argue a small change in fundamentals since December,” Kolanovic wrote in a note to clients. “If liquidity was only a half or a third, it is reasonable to expect two or three times the speed of market moves for a particular level of flows.”
Dwindling liquidity is often dragged into discussions of market meltdowns. In December, for instance, when the S&P 500 plunged toward the brink of a bear market, both President Donald Trump and strategists from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) flagged it as potentially escalating the sell-off.
JPMorgan’s latest note highlighted a less scrutinized phenomenon: liquidity’s role in driving stocks higher. While the strategists didn’t give a reason why liquidity has stayed thin, they consider it part of an environment that sets the stage for further gains.
“Given liquidity, it is plausible that just short covering, buybacks, dealers’ gamma hedging, and some limited re-leveraging drove the entire recovery,” Kolanovic said. “This, in turn, opens the possibility that the current rally can continue during the spring.”
The strategists urged investors to embrace risk, citing a dramatic reversal in central bank monetary policy. In the latest policy update Wednesday, Federal Reserve officials slashed their projected interest-rate increases this year to zero from two while deciding to end the drawdown of the central bank’s bond holdings in September.
“This is an enormous shift in monetary policy, which we believe is not fully priced into various assets such as risk-on currencies, and equities, commodities, and other value assets,” the strategists said. “It is clear that the dovish turn is here to stay.”"
662,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",Australia's Property Stocks Are Ignoring the Housing Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian property stocks are proving largely immune to the worst housing slump in a generation, rallying to the highest in almost three years.
Diversified revenue streams, the demand for offices in a growing economy and low bond yields have propelled the S&P/ASX 200 A-REIT Index up 13 percent this year, compared with the nation’s benchmark index, which has climbed 9.2 percent. Fifteen of the 18 stocks on the gauge are in the green, with Charter Hall Group and Goodman Group leading the rally.
The last time real estate shares were higher, Australia’s housing prices were climbing after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut borrowing costs to record lows in 2016, fueling demand for property. Those rates have since remained untouched.
Australia’s property slump deepened in February as housing prices fell 0.7 percent, and are now down 6.8 percent from their peak in October 2017. Stricter lending standards have dried up the flow of credit to both investors and owner-occupiers.
The Top Three
The index’s top stocks, Goodman and Charter Hall, don’t meet the definition of traditional REITs because most of their income doesn’t come from collecting rent, said Pete Morrissey, a fund manager APN Property Group Ltd. For warehouse giant Goodman, a large portion of its revenue comes from development and funds management earnings.
The shift to online shopping has also been a boon to industrial property groups like Goodman, said Belinda Ngo, executive director for capital markets at the Property Council of Australia. Goodman, which lists Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). as its biggest customer worldwide, is up 25 percent this year.
Mirvac Group -- the third-best performer on the index -- derives more than half its revenue from residential assets, but has invested in high-quality apartments and built up its office and retail portfolios. The stock has jumped 21 percent this year.
“Residential sentiment weighed on them a lot in the past,” Morrissey said of Mirvac. “Finally, the market has seen through that.”
The office property market has also skyrocketed. Companies with solid office portfolios have benefited from a strong Australian economy that’s fueled demand for workspaces, Ngo said. Dexus, the nation’s biggest office landlord, is up 19 percent since December.
Still, not all companies on the index have been unscathed by the downturn. Stockland, a diversified real estate group that develops residential and retirement communities, set its earnings guidance at the low end of its target range this year, citing weak housing conditions.
Value Trap
Some are still cautious after the big rally. Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd. downgraded its sector recommendation to a hold from buy earlier this month, citing rising risks in the retail space.
“We see this as a value trap” analysts led by Rob Freeman said in the report dated March 8. “This is because half the sector is retail malls and we believe the outlook has never been worse than it is today.”
Retail REITs such as Scentre Group, which owns and manages the nation’s Westfield malls, and Vicinity Centres were among the worst performers on the index over the February reporting season.
Although retail dominates Australia’s REIT market, the index’s other members are pulling the sector higher given growing demand in other parts of commercial real estate, Morrissey said.
Bond Yields
The negative correlation between government bond yields and REITs is another reason for the surge. Australia’s 10-year bond yield has continued its decline this year, the lowest since 2016, and yield-hungry investors may be taking cover in REITs.
The volatility seen in equities markets late last year could have also helped Australia’s REITs. The stocks could have been seen as a safe bet for investors as they usually perform better as the market gets bumpy, Morrissey said."

CHICAGO/TOKYO (Reuters) - Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) and partner Eisai Co Ltd are ending two late-stage trials of their experimental Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab, a major setback in the quest to find a treatment for the mind-wasting disease and a blow to Biogen, which lost more than $18 billion of its value on Thursday.
Experts had seen aducanumab as one of the last tests of the hypothesis that removing sticky deposits of amyloid from the brain of patients in earlier stages of the lethal disease could stave off its ravages, which include loss of memory and the ability to care for oneself.
Biogen shares fell nearly 30 percent to $225.70, its largest drop since February 2005, when they fell nearly 43 percent to close at $38.65 on Nasdaq.
The decision was based on a so-called futility analysis of aducanumab data by an independent monitoring committee that determined the trials had little hope of succeeding.
Markets in Japan were closed for a national holiday so the impact of the news on Eisai will be delayed.
Eisai in July had touted promising but confusing 18-month results from another Alzheimer's drug, BAN2401, being co-developed with Biogen. That drug failed in a 12-month analysis.
'TRANSFORMATIVE FAILURE'
Investors had been cautiously optimistic about aducanumab following early promising data. Without potential future revenue from Alzheimer's, Biogen has poor growth prospects as it faces patent issues over its big-selling multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera and possible competition to spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza, Wall Street analysts said.
""We view this as a transformative failure for Biogen's pipeline,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a research note.
Abrahams, who reduced his Biogen price target to $240 per share, said further declines were likely given that ""investors owned Biogen to not miss out on what could have been one of the biggest blockbuster products in the pipeline of large biopharma.""
Any successful treatment for Alzheimer's, which affects about 5.7 million Americans, is virtually guaranteed to become one of the world's top-selling drugs. But efforts so far have had a dismal track record, with more than 100 failures. 
The two halted trials were in the final stages of testing aducanumab in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's and mild Alzheimer's disease dementia. Detailed results will be presented at a future medical meeting.
""This disappointing news confirms the complexity of treating Alzheimer's disease and the need to further advance knowledge in neuroscience,"" Biogen Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos said. 
Eisai and Biogen said they would continue to work on other Alzheimer's treatments, including BAN2401.
Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja said Biogen instead should be looking to build its pipeline through acquisitions.
""They need to stop wasting or stop investing money in Alzheimer's now,"" Suneja said.
Suneja said Biogen has about $42 billion in financing capacity and identified potential acquisition targets such as Sage Therapeutics Inc , GW Pharmaceuticals (O:GWPH) and Zogenix Inc that are ""very interesting companies that should be considered now, more seriously.""
WHAT'S NEXT?
Major drugmakers, including Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, AstraZeneca Plc, Roche Holding (SIX:ROG) AG,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Merck & Co and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), have abandoned Alzheimer's drugs targeting amyloid because of lack of efficacy or safety issues.
Roche is still testing an amyloid-targeting drug, gantenerumab, at a higher dose after it failed in a trial in early-stage disease. 
Dr. Ronald Petersen of the Mayo Clinic, who has consulted for Eisai and Biogen, said amyloid is clearly linked with Alzheimer's because it shows up in the brains of people with the disease. But removing it did not appear to help.
""Should we abandon amyloid? I'm not completely there yet, but you'd certainly like to see some kind of positive response.""
Many companies including Biogen, Eisai, Lilly and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), are pursuing alternative approaches, such as focusing on tau, another Alzheimer's protein that is more closely linked with the onset of symptoms.
Others are pursuing targets aimed at reducing inflammation, which is believed to play a role in the very early formation of the disease.
Dr. Howard Fillit of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation said research must identify biomarkers and diagnostics to help ""weed out ineffective drugs earlier,"" before they are tested in large, expensive trials.
Fillit said aducanumab hit its target and removed amyloid but still did not help patients, which makes him ""very pessimistic that the amyloid approach will work clinically.""
He said BAN2401 is not that different from aducanumab. ""If they want one more shot on goal, I would think that would be a business decision rather than a strong scientific decision.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co will mandate a previously optional cockpit warning light as part of a forthcoming software update to the 737 MAX fleet that was grounded in the wake of two fatal crashes, two officials briefed on the matter said Thursday.
Boeing previously offered the AOA DISAGREE alert, which warns pilots when the ""angle of attack"" (AOA) readings do not match, but it was not required by regulators. Boeing will now retrofit older planes with the light that did not initially receive it, the officials said. Boeing did not immediately comment Thursday.
There has been a long-running industry debate about how much information should be displayed in the cockpit, notably about the angle at which the wing is slicing through the air.
Federal prosecutors, the Transportation Department's inspector general and U.S. lawmakers are investigating the Federal Aviation Administration's certification of the 737 MAX.
The FAA declined to comment on the software upgrade Thursday but said last week it planned to mandate ""design changes"" coming from Boeing in its software upgrade by April for the 737 MAX. 
Indonesia's Lion Air did not install the warning light. Lion Air Fight 610 crashed in October minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 onboard. The company told Reuters in November it did not install it because it was not required.
The angle is a key flight parameter that must remain narrow enough to preserve lift and avoid an aerodynamic stall. A faulty AOA reading led the doomed Lion Air jet’s computer to believe it was stalled, prompting the plane’s anti-stall system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), to repeatedly push down the plane's nose.
The planemaker has come under fire in the wake of the Lion Air crash for not outlining the automated system, MCAS, in the flight manual for the 737 MAX.

665,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 03:05PM ET</span>",Talk of a New Wells Fargo CEO Swirls; Be Skeptical,"By Charley Blaine
Investing.com - If you're into who's in and who's out among the nation's big banks, today is a catnip kind of day.
The New York Post reported today that directors of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) were talking to Harvey Schwartz, a former top executive at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), about taking over from current CEO Tim Sloan.
Sloan, CEO since 2016, is under pressure from regulators, who don't think the nation's fourth-largest bank is making enough progress getting over the scandals that roiled it in the last few years. That included opening sham accounts and assessing customers fees for services they didn't know about and didn't want, charging higher fees to African-American and Latino borrowers with similar credit profiles as white customers and a computer error that cost hundreds of borrowers their homes in the financial crisis.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat running for president, said she believes Sloan should resign.
It is true that Wells Fargo's fourth-quarter earnings of $1.21 a share beat estimates of analysts polled by Investing.com. But that was after missing estimates for two quarters. Revenue has been steady over the last year. And the $1.11 forecast for fiscal first-quarter earnings is a penny below last year's $1.12.
The stock may be up 8.5% this year, but it is flat on the month and trading 16% below its 52-week high reached last summer. It fell 24% in 2018. It was off slightly on Thursday because of a different problem: the impact of the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates on banking profits.
Which brings us back to Schwartz, former chief operating officer at Goldman who lost out on the top post to David Solomon.
He's not talking about any discussions with Wells Fargo. There may be another candidate, which the Post said it couldn't name. And Wells Fargo denied there were any talks with anyone.
Even if Schwartz is talking to Wells Fargo, it's not clear he wants the job. Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco and has a major headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., and, the Post story said, he doesn't want to live in either place. And he is supposedly thinking about running a family investment office.
Then there's how much money Wells Fargo would have to pay to get an outsider to make a move to either place palatable. Sloan made nearly $18 million in salary and stock grants in 2018. Presumably, Schwartz would cost more -- much more. And you would have to get the regulators (the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve) and the Wells Fargo critics to sign on.
Plus, the situation is risky, given all of Wells Fargo's issues.
""When you replace a CEO in an institution that has issues and crisis -- and is in the news in a bad way -- it's a very, very difficult search,"" Jeanne Branthover, a managing partner at executive search firm DHR International, told Bloomberg last month."
666,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 02:59PM ET</span>","Chinese president lands in Italy, set to sign Belt and Road deal","By Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Rome on Thursday at the start of a three-day visit during which he will sign an accord drawing Italy into his giant ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure plan, despite U.S. opposition.
Italy, seeking new export deals to boost its stalled economy, will become the first Group of Seven major industrialized nation to join the multi-billion-dollar project, which is designed to improve Beijing's global trade reach.
Xi is due to meet Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Friday and is set to sign the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Saturday before traveling to the Sicilian capital Palermo.
More than 30 deals, worth up to 7 billion euros, are also expected to be agreed during the trip in an array of sectors, including accords opening up the northern ports of Trieste and Genoa to Chinese containers.
""We are at the heart of the Mediterranean, yet the Chinese are everywhere in the region except here,"" junior industry minister Michele Geraci said in a video on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
However, the prospect of the accord has caused ructions both within the coalition government and among Italy's allies -- notably in Washington, where the White House National Security Council urged Rome not to give ""legitimacy to China's infrastructure vanity project"".
And on the very day that Xi flew into Rome, European Union leaders in Brussels considered adopting a more defensive strategy toward China, having last week branded the world's second largest economic power a ""systemic rival"".
The European Union has grown increasingly frustrated by what it sees as China's slowness to open its economy and by a surge of Chinese takeovers in critical EU sectors, accusing it of distorting local markets.
Rome says such concerns should not stop it improving its ties and points to the fact that 13 EU countries have already signed MOUs with China, including Hungary, Poland and Greece.
""We have weighed up all the risks and I think this is a great result for Italy,"" said Geraci, who lived in China for a decade before joining the government last year.
Geraci later added that a Chinese company might even come to the rescue of Italy's perennially sickly national airline, Alitalia, which is struggling to find the foreign suitors it needs to stay solvent.
However, in a concession to Washington, the government moved hastily this week to protect its telecoms sector from foreign predators amid concerns that Italy might expose itself to hi-tech espionage as a result of closer links with Beijing.
China has shrugged off the controversy, with its vice foreign minister saying it was ""hard to avoid misunderstandings"" over the burgeoning Belt and Road project.
The initiative is aimed at creating a modern-day Silk Road, reviving the ancient trade routes that connected east and west. More than 150 countries, regions and international groups have already signed pacts with Beijing.

After his stay in Italy, Xi will fly on to Monaco and France at the head of a 500-strong delegation.

667,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>",Bond Traders Turn Eyes to What May Happen After Curve Inversion,"(Bloomberg) -- The surprising move by Federal Reserve officials to slash the prospects of an interest-rate hike this year has one of the Treasury market’s favorite indicators edging closer to signaling recession. And that means some traders are already eyeing the next move in the opposite direction.
With the U.S. 10-year yield dipping below 2.50 percent, the gap between the 3-month and 10-year Treasury yields on Thursday shrank to its narrowest point since 2007. The Fed’s revised outlook was a dead weight on that curve, pushing it from more than 15 basis points early on Wednesday to within four basis points of zero. An inverted curve is widely considered to be an accurate predictor of an economic slump, and BMO Capital Markets is among those forecasting that the measure is likely to drop below zero.
Yet while inversion risks are prominent on many analysts’ radars, these conditions are also sharpening the focus on the next big wave that some traders are chasing. That’s the one that could see front-end rates drop sharply lower and the curve again becoming steeper. Such a move may be prompted by the first signs that Fed is losing faith in the economic outlook and that officials will need to resume rate cuts.
The market is “approaching a period where the thematic bull-steepening of the curve will begin, and timing that moment will be one of the most important decisions investors face in 2019,” said Jon Hill, a rates strategist at BMO.
Indeed, steepening is already being seen at some points further out on the curve and the central bank’s latest signals did have something to offer some early adopters of the steepening trade, thanks to heavy buying in the belly. Bets on an impending easing cycle on Wednesday drove the 5-year yield lower versus the 30-year rate, pushing that differential to its widest level since November 2017."

NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Union pension fund adviser CtW Investment Group said on Thursday Lyft Inc ""faces an all-but-insurmountable barrier"" to profitability due to issues with the ride-hailing company's pricing strategy and new regulations driving costs higher.
The comments come four days into the roadshow for Lyft's much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO), in which it is seeking to raise around $2 billion at a valuation of up to $23 billion.
Investor demand has been strong so far, with the IPO book oversubscribing after just two days, making it more likely that Lyft will hit or even exceed its valuation target, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
This is despite Lyft not having yet turned a profit, reporting a loss of $911 million in 2018, wider than its $688 million loss in 2017. 
In a letter to potential investors in the IPO, CtW argued Lyft can only become profitable by reducing the share of revenue received by its drivers. CtW said Lyft's larger rival Uber Technologies Inc pursued this strategy.
""Over the past three years, Lyft has mimicked Uber's pay compression strategy, and IPO investors face the risk that the far smaller company will not be capable of sustaining low pay any longer than the market leader could,"" CtW Research Director Richard Clayton wrote in the letter.
CtW said challenges for Lyft would also come from local politicians, including a move by New York City to set a minimum wage for drivers. 
CtW works with union pension funds affiliated with Change to Win and which it says collectively manage $250 billion in assets. 
Asked why CtW was commenting on Lyft ahead of the IPO, Clayton said in an emailed statement the group wants to make sure decision makers managing workers' retirement savings take a careful look at Lyft before deciding whether to buy into the IPO. CtW also represents drivers unions which could be affected by the rise of ride-hailing services.
A spokesman for Lyft declined to comment. 
In meetings with investors this week, Lyft executives said the company would be profitable much sooner were it not for investments in areas such as its scooter business, Reuters has reported. Lyft executives also said they expect the costs of processing transactions to come down.

Lyft is scheduled to price its IPO on March 28 and begin trading on the Nasdaq the following day.

Delinquencies are actually low by historical standards, according to the firm, which invests in asset-backed securities. The Fed’s data was calculated to include loan balances that have already been charged off, which exaggerates delinquency numbers,  Schroders  (LON:SDR) said.
If defaults that have already been taken as a loss, so-called chargeoffs, are removed from the data set as is the common practice for most indices, it’s clear that auto-loan delinquencies are at relatively low levels, Schroders said. They are certainly below what was seen during the financial crisis era. In fact, U.S. consumer performance overall is generally strong.
“While there has been a modest expansion in consumer credit, delinquency levels and defaults are back to the low end of historical levels,” said Michelle Russell-Dowe, head of securitized credit at Schroders, in a telephone interview. “This good performance is an important consideration that is not well represented by commonly-sourced government agency reports such as the New York Fed auto delinquency data.”
The Fed said that delinquencies were high despite low unemployment and a benign economy. However, Russell-Dowe also points to the fact that bankruptcy filings are at a 10-year low, calling that a “good and meaningful generic indicator” of overall consumer health.
The New York Fed’s report last month showed that payments that fell behind by 90 days or more reached 4.47 percent in the fourth quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2012. However, these levels are significantly higher than rates seen in a comparable  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. 90-plus day auto ABS delinquency index, which excludes charged-off loans and shows delinquency levels under 1 percent for a mix of bundled prime and subprime auto loans:
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings had a similar message this week, saying in a research note that 90-plus day delinquencies for S&P-rated prime and subprime auto loan ABS was only 0.11 percent and 1.86 percent, respectively, as of Dec. 31. S&P also noted that delinquencies have been rising faster than actual loss levels on the packaged loans, which is said is a more important indicator. Credit protections in the deals, or cushions against loss, have increased commensurately with rising risk, according to S&P.
Deep Subprime Proliferating
Only 14 percent of auto loans originated last year were packaged into bonds, S&P said, but the securitization markets are typically used more often by so-called deep subprime lenders, rather than banks and credit unions. Even so, the ABS delinquency levels are still far less than the NY Fed numbers, pointing to the differences in calculation method.
Both Schroders and S&P acknowledged that delinquency levels have increased notably for asset-backed bonds underpinned by deep subprime borrowers. There has been growth in deep subprime lending over the last few years as private equity and venture capital firms have invested in auto lenders specializing in the least credit-worthy borrowers, pushing volumes amid increased competition.
“Subprime delinquencies of 30 days or more are back at their peak, and subprime borrowers don’t benefit as much from low unemployment as in the prime market,” said Schroders’ Russell-Dowe. “Additionally, the share of these private equity-backed subprime auto issuers in the ABS market has risen quickly; back in 2011 it was perhaps 10 percent, and now it’s closer to 50 percent.”
Then again, securitized debt makes up just a fraction of the overall auto credit market, while the majority is kept on finance companies’ balance sheets. Only about 10 percent of the $437 billion of low-rated car loans have been turned into ABS, according to Wells Fargo."

Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of $1.71 a share, beating the earnings consensus from Investing.com of $1.66. But revenue of $5.84 billion just missed expectations for $5.86 billion. 
""Taking everything into account, February numbers were essentially in line with our estimates and the Street as fears of a large top and bottom line miss resulting from weaker than expected memory pricing did not materialize,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) equity analysts said in a note.
The fall in prices has been attributed to falling demand for memory chips at various levels. Smartphone shipments have waned, and server shipments have stalled. The end of the cryptocraze has seen demand for GPUs fall, leaving graphics chip makers like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in a cold sweat.
In the conference call that followed the results, Micron's management vowed to slash output of DRAM and NAND flash memory to offset falling demand.
""Given the lower DRAM demand outlook from our customers, we have decided to idle approximately 5% of our DRAM wafer starts,"" said Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrota, according to a transcript of the call. ""We are reducing our total NAND wafer starts by approximately 5%, mostly through reductions on our legacy nodes.""
The ""controversial"" move to cut output signals that the excess memory inventory woes are likely to continue through the year, Morgan Stanley said. ""The inventory trends bring into sharp relief just how large the gap is between supply and demand.""
Micron earnings triggered a sea of green across semis, as Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO),  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) were up sharply, helping the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index add 3.4% on the day, boosting its year-to-date gains to nearly 25%."

Analysts have said that Spanish banks may consider consolidation as low interest rates in Europe pressure margins.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC has signed a deal to offer BlackRock's Aladdin investment management software to the bank's wealthy customers, in a boost to the U.S. asset manager's plans to squeeze money from technology by selling it to rivals.
Aladdin began as an internal tool at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) before becoming the linchpin of Chief Executive Larry Fink's plan to increase revenues from technology. It is used by investment managers to help to oversee risks and make investment decisions.
Robert Goldstein, chief operating officer at BlackRock, said HSBC's scale would mean many more advisers would have access to capabilities previously only available to institutional investors.
The partnership between Europe's largest bank and the world's biggest asset manager comes as both industries are battling to use technology to increase profits and improve service.
Guilherme Lima, HSBC's group head of wealth management, said the software would help investors to understand hidden risks in their portfolios by acting as an 'X-ray' that could look through a mix of individual stock holdings, mutual funds and index trackers to reveal that all of them are exposed to a single stock, for example, or macro-economic risk.
That will help HSBC to respond to growing demand from wealthy customers for their banks to offer advice rather than simply selling products.
""It's about being able to have a detailed conversation with the client and provide more value added advice,"" Stuart Parkinson, global head of product, investments and collaboration in HSBC's private bank, said. 
BlackRock's Fink has said he aims to increase revenues from technology to 30 percent of the firm's total by 2022, as the broader stockpicking business has come under pressure from lower cost index funds.
More than 200 institutions and around 25,000 investment professionals use Aladdin and its risk analytics, BlackRock says.
Some market participants have questioned whether this presents a systemic risk, as the growing number of firms using the software for investment decisions could make portfolios more correlated and hence exposed to market shocks.
BlackRock executives have downplayed this idea, saying customers use Aladdin in different ways to suit their own purposes.
HSBC has already begun to roll out the platform in the United States and in Hong Kong, the bank said. Over the next 2-3 years Aladdin will eventually be offered to all customers who hold $1 million or more with the bank.
HSBC's retail bank and its private bank which serves wealthier customers both chose Aladdin independently of each other after running a lengthy procurement process, HSBC's Parkinson said.

""The risks of a last-minute accident have increased,"" said Oliver Harvey, head of Brexit research at the German bank, adding that ""government strategy appears to be being made off the hoof"".
Deutsche Bank's new call on a no-deal Brexit came after JP Morgan also upped its chances of an exit without a deal to 15 percent from 10 percent. The deadline for an agreement on Brexit is next Friday.
Deutsche Bank cut its estimated chances of UK Prime Minister May winning the next parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal to 25 percent, from 35 percent previously. 
""In a worst-case scenario, we anticipate the government will seek an emergency extension of Article 50 even as late as the end of next week, should the third attempt to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement fail,"" Harvey wrote. 
He ascribed a 55-percent probability to that outcome. 
The bank also closed its ""short EUR/GBP"" recommendation as ratification of Prime Minister May's deal was no longer its base case.

Deutsche Bank had trimmed its expectation of a no-deal Brexit from 15 percent to 10 percent at the end of last month.

Stone, 52, replaces Bob Shanks, who will retire at the end of 2019 after serving the company for 42 years.
Stone held various financial roles at Amazon for two decades, and was most recently CFO of Snapchat messaging app owner,  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP).
He decided to quit Snap less than a year after taking the job, becoming the second finance chief to leave the company in a year since the much-criticized redesign of the app. 
Stone will take over as CFO on June 1, Ford said.
The No.2 U.S. carmaker said Shanks, 66, will work closely with Stone on the transition and then on special projects through the end of the year.
The last time Ford named an outsider to the role of CFO was in 1949 when Theodore Yntema, previously a consulting economist to Ford, was hired for the position.
Yntema mentored a group of young executives who came to be known as ""the whiz kids"". The group included Robert McNamara and Arjay Miller, both of whom later became Ford presidents.
Stone will report to Chief Executive Jim Hackett.
""Bob's leadership was integral to Ford's comeback during the great recession,"" Hackett said.
The automaker also named Mark Ovenden to the role of president of International Markets Group, replacing Peter Fleet, who will retire.
Fleet previously served as president of Asia Pacific - a region that reported the biggest loss during the fourth-quarter, hit by plummeting sales in China.
Ford, which ended 2018 with $23.1 billion in cash, said its losses in China would narrow this year.
Stuart Rowley, currently chief operating officer for Ford North America, was appointed as president, Ford of Europe, succeeding Steven Armstrong who is being named as chairman, Ford of Europe.

Ford said last week it plans to cut more than 5,000 jobs in Germany and would also reduce its workforce in Britain as it seeks to return to profit in Europe.

690,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 11:10AM ET</span>","Asian, European LNG prices crash below $5 on oversupply","By Sabina Zawadzki
LONDON (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) broke below the $5 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) mark this week following a 13-week price slide that reflects the absence of growth in demand or any major outages.
Spot prices for May delivery to Northeast Asia dropped 80 cents to $4.65 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) this week according to traders although there were few actual transactions with Asia's biggest buyers, Japan, Korea or China.
Asian LNG spot prices are now at their lowest level since May 2016 and close to the lowest point in Refinitiv records going back to 2010 of $4.00 per mmBtu, which was reached in April 2016.
They are also lower than the European natural gas hub price in the Netherlands and Britain, which usually trade at a premium to spot Asian LNG prices. The last time this happened was in January and February of 2015, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
There were two transactions completed in the Platts market on close (MOC) window, both cargoes to India. 
The first one was sold by Vitol to Gunvor for Indian west coast delivery at the start of May for $4.55 per mmBtu. Vitol also sold to  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) a cargo to Dahej terminal for the end of May at $4.75 per mmBtu. 
In Europe, prices were heard at discounts of 20 cents to month-ahead Dutch gas prices at the TTF hub, which were at around $4.98 per mmBtu on Thursday.
Deliveries into North West Europe have jumped to 67 cargoes, or 4.24 million tonnes, this month from 54 cargoes in January, which was a record high for the region since Refinitv Eikon data began in 2013.
The influx has helped to halve prices at both the Dutch and British hubs since their peaks in September. 
The market has been inundated with supplies coming onstream from the United States, Russia and Australia. In addition Egypt, which has had to import LNG in previous years due to gas shortages, has started to ramp up its exports.
A cyclone heading for north western Australia may disrupt LNG loading there, according to Kpler, a shipping intelligence company. 
Vessels have been cleared at Dampier, loading point for Woodside's Pluto and North West Shelf LNG, and Ashburton, the loading point for Chevron's Wheatstone LNG, according to Pilbara Port Authority.

691,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 11:00AM ET</span>",A tale of two projects: Mozambique LNG terminals echo global risks,"By Sabina Zawadzki
LONDON (Reuters) - Mozambique, one of the world's poorest nations, is set to become a top global gas exporter thanks to two huge terminals about to be built in a northern province.
The two liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, by Anadarko and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), will extract, liquefy and ship gas, found in such quantities offshore Mozambique that it amounts to a decade's worth of European consumption.
But the plans by the U.S. companies diverge in their financing, marketing and shipping strategies, reflecting uncertainties in a growth industry that has yet to achieve the flexibility and liquidity of its sister crude oil market.
Exxon will use its might as a decades-old LNG producer with a 20-million-tonne portfolio to partially pay for the project and absorb the LNG - together with its equally hefty partners. 
LNG novice Anadarko, meanwhile, has had to go through the time-consuming process of locking in long-term buyers for its gas and multi-billion-dollar financing from banks mindful of Mozambique's 2016 credit default and geopolitical hazards.
For this reason, Anadarko's project has been fully exposed to risk assessments made by buyers and financial institutions.
""I think what they've done is built the first project that across the board responds to the shifts to contract structures and pricing and how you finance an LNG project,"" said Jason Feer of Poten & Partners, an industry consultancy.
Although the gas projects are 1,000 km (600 miles) north of Beira, the town at the heart of the devastation caused by a cyclone and floods last week, the country's poor infrastructure and flare-ups of violence are also large risks.
Industry insiders say Anadarko will avoid the fate of London-listed  Ophir Energy  (LON:OPHR), which ended up losing its Equatorial Guinea license, its chief executive and over $300 million after it failed to get financing for its LNG project. 
But concessions have been made by Anadarko and its partners Mitsui, Mozambique state energy company ENH, Thailand's PTT and Indian energy firms ONGC, Bharat Petroleum Resources and Oil India. 
ANADARKO'S CONCESSIONS
Anadarko had to seal binding contracts with long-term buyers of the LNG it plans to produce to present to banks as proof of the venture's viability before receiving financing for what it hopes is two-thirds of the cost of the $20 billion project.
But in a fast-expanding, volatile market, such multi-year, multi-billion-dollar commitments are difficult to clinch.
""There are multiple price indexations, some flexibility in terms of volumes and there are a variety of contract durations,"" said Gary Regan of industry consultancy Gas Strategies. 
""Those are some of the ways in which they had to provide concessions to buyers during negotiations.""
Over 9.5 million tonnes a year (mtpa) of the project's 12.88 mtpa capacity is committed to eight buyers from seven developed and developing countries with various credit ratings, including utilities, major LNG portfolio holders and two state companies.
The contract duration varies from 13 to 20 years and volumes range from 0.28 mtpa to 2.6 mtpa. 
(Graphic: Anadarko's long-term buyers of LNG from Mozambique project link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hx1sIC).
All of the contracts are on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis, Anadarko told Reuters, which means the company needs to organize LNG shipment. This is risky as the LNG tanker market, tiny and undeveloped by global shipping standards, is volatile, experiencing record-high charter rates last year.
Finally, Anadarko had to lock in lower LNG prices than in the last wave of projects. One source familiar with the matter pegged Anadarko's prices above 11 but below 12 percent of Brent crude oil, compared to 14 percent five to seven years ago.
Anadarko said its contracts had exposure to crude oil and gas index-linked prices but declined to comment further.
There is every chance Exxon too will face low prices for its LNG but as it need not lock them in now, it can market the gas when it chooses to do so and for the best price.
""Balance sheet financing by majors such as Exxon enables projects to proceed at optimal timing regarding contract strategy and market openings,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Saul Kavonic said. 
Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
(Graphic: Spot Asian LNG, Brent crude and LNG shipping rates link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Cw3uUY).
RISK IT LATER
Anadarko said it would take a final investment decision (FID) by June thanks to the offtake agreements it now has providing the financing is agreed - still a significant hurdle. But once it does, it has a smoother path to production, due in 2024. 
""We are well placed to meet the objective of taking FID in the first half of this year,"" an Anadarko spokeswoman said.
Exxon, meanwhile, has effectively pushed back the risk Anadarko has had to face today closer to the start date of its own project, also 2024.
Together with partners Eni, the Italian major from which it took over the project in December 2017, LNG buyer Korea Gas Corp and state-owned China National Petroleum Corp, Exxon will take on the LNG volumes itself in a bet that there will be sufficient demand in 2024.
Exxon is also seeking project financing but its experience, robust balance sheet and eager LNG consumers as partners, mean finding money will be easier, industry sources say.
Here, Exxon is like Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), which has the world's largest LNG portfolio and which took FID on the $30 billion LNG Canada project in October with few buyers signed.
""The majors have kind of had to make a judgment call,"" said Freer of Poten & Partners. 
""They've had to decide they're not going to be in the LNG business because they don't have the pre-sales, or they've had to take more risk on the balance sheet. And the decision is they believe the demand for LNG is there.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche is seeking damages and compensation in a U.S. lawsuit against former executives of a Utah-based company, the Swiss drugmaker's latest case targeting what it calls fraudulent schemes involving its diabetes test strips.
Roche has filed several lawsuits in U.S. federal court in which it alleges individuals and companies obtained low-priced diabetes test strips meant for mail-order customers, only to re-direct them for sale via pharmacies where higher prices allowed them to profit from the difference.
""Defendants caused Roche to wrongfully pay over $87 million in rebates and to lose a similar amount of sales of retail strips,"" according to Roche's complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey on Tuesday against more than a dozen defendants including Jeffrey C. Smith, chief executive at Utah's Alliance Medical Holdings until 2017.
In Utah, where Alliance Medical filed for bankruptcy protection in 2017 after a raid by federal agents seeking evidence of potential healthcare fraud, Roche contends Smith and others from 2011 to 2017 sought fraudulent reimbursements for 1.84 million 50-count boxes of Roche diabetes test strips. 
Smith did not immediately return phone calls and e-mails seeking comment. 
For America's 30 million people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and prick their fingers daily, blood glucose test strips help keep their glucose levels in check, preventing blindness, heart disease or death. These plastic strips are costly, running to $160 for boxes of 100 and creating incentives for a ""grey market"" away from formal retail channels that strip makers contend is vulnerable to fraud and safety concerns.
In a separate U.S. lawsuit in Michigan, Roche alleges executives at another medical supply companies used a similar test-strip flipping scheme to cheat it out of $84 million.

Stocks in chipmakers have been pummelled in the last six months as demand for Apple's iPhones declined and prices for DRAM and NAND memory chips sank due to an oversupply, adding to concerns that a two-year-long semiconductor upswing was coming to a halt.
Micron's remarks came as it reported quarterly earnings above analysts' estimates on Wednesday as cost-cutting helped offset falling demand and prices.
A chip recovery will likely be fueled by fresh investments from data center customers and more memory content in phones, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts.
Micron's shares rose 8.7 percent on Thursday morning. Shares in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc and Nvidia Corp rose 2 percent, while Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) climbed 1 percent.
SK Hynix, the world's second-biggest memory chip maker, saw its shares surge nearly 7 percent by 0330 GMT, while Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd gained 4.3 percent.
Both Samsung and SK Hynix said in January that they expected sales of memory products to revive in the second half of the year.
Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan upgraded Micron's stock to a ""buy"" rating and predicted that the chipmaker's cost cuts would outpace price declines in the second half of 2019.
Shares of European chipmaker Infineon Technologies AG rose 1 percent, while STMicroelectronics NV added 1.6 percent.
Analysts have been wary about prospects for the memory chip market due to lower demand for smartphones and slumping investment from data center companies.
""We see 2019 as an industry cycle bottom and what makes this interesting is that Micron will emerge from it without negative earnings,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said, adding Micron could focus on returning at least half of its free cash flow to shareholders.
Tech research firm TrendForce in a report on Wednesday said it expects a only a slight decline in NAND flash chip sales in the second quarter as demand recovers from smartphones, computers and servers.
""Although it won't cause an immediate reversal of the oversupply situation, it will have a positive effect on the market environment,"" analyst Ben Yeh at DRAMeXchange, a Trendforce division, said in the report.

U.S. chip equipment makers, which supply tools for chip making and designing, also edged higher on Thursday.  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX) rose 2.5 percent and Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) jumped about 3 percent.

695,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 10:22AM ET</span>","Outdoing Uber, Facebook by Letting Saudis Bargain for Deliveries","(Bloomberg) -- Typing out your order on Mrsool is only the start of what’s made the Saudi delivery app more popular in the kingdom than Uber Technologies Inc. and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
The experience that follows recreates the bargaining of a traditional market. Once the customer picks out items from a store or restaurant, couriers bid to run the errand, offering a delivery price within a certain range, which shoppers can reject if they find the quotes too expensive. The back-and-forth can continue as the courier buys and delivers the order, chatting and sharing photographs or voice notes.
“People like to conduct business by conversing with others,” said Abdulrahman Tarabzouni, chief executive officer of STV, a $500 million venture capital fund anchored by Saudi Telecom that recently took part in Mrsool’s first funding round.
Created in 2015, Mrsool tapped into the quirks of the Saudi market while the economy went through a major transformation. Although the private sector has struggled to adapt to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s sweeping efforts to wean the kingdom off oil, e-commerce has taken off in a country addicted to smartphones as buying habits change and consumers increasingly look for deals online.
Meanwhile, as Saudis rethink their household budgets after policy changes like a value-added tax and cuts to energy subsidies, more people are looking to earn extra cash in their spare time by working as drivers or couriers.
Different Touch
But it’s the personal touch Mrsool brought to the business of mobile retail that powered its swift rise, with 4 million registered users, 150,000 couriers and 1 billion riyals ($270 million) of transactions processed last year alone. Apple’s App Store ranks it among Saudi Arabia’s 30 most popular downloads, several notches above Facebook and Uber.
A takeaway competitor like Uber Eats, which isn’t even in the top 100, offers a more impersonal interface in which customers order food by checking items off a menu.
Mrsool’s under-40 founders, Ayman Alsanad and Naif AlSamri, recently completed a multi-million dollar fundraising, getting cash from STV as well as local firm Raed Ventures and Saudi investor Mazen Al-Jubeir. Alsanad declined to say exactly how much capital was raised.
Brother to the Rescue
In an interview in the startup’s office in Riyadh, located behind an unmarked door above an Italian restaurant, Alsanad said he wants customers to see the couriers akin to a brother who comes to their rescue. It’s a role particularly suited to a country where women were banned from driving until last year, and most still don’t have licenses. Alsanad recalled using Mrsool to deliver baby formula to his wife.
More than half of orders are food, but there’s also demand for delivery of groceries, medicine and gifts like flowers or chocolate, Alsanad said. Customers have the choice of any store in their city. One client even used Mrsool to order gasoline after his car ran out of fuel on the highway. 
Among other features that have made it a hit at home is cash payment, since the economy still relies heavily on physical riyals. Alsanad said, however, that Mrsool plans to offer digital transfers soon.
International expansion is the next step. Alsanad said Mrsool wants to use the money raised in the funding round to grow regionally starting with Bahrain, connected to Saudi Arabia by a causeway.
“The target is to cover all of Gulf Cooperation Council countries,” followed by other markets in the Middle East, he said. “The crown jewel would be Egypt because Egypt is very accustomed to delivery.”

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Christian Sewing, the chief executive of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), believes there is a strong case for a merger with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), according to a person with direct knowledge of his thinking.
Sewing's stance sets the stage for a showdown with unions fearing massive job cuts and some skeptical investors. The supervisory boards of both banks meet on Thursday.
Sewing sees multiple benefits of a merger, including ""clear"" dominance in its home market, scale, and shared technology costs, the person said.
Deutsche's CEO also believes that a combined entity would improve the cost of funding, with ""the best funding ever"", the person said. Jobs would be cut with or without a merger, the person said.
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment.
In past months Deutsche Bank's CEO has urged investors to be patient, preferring to focus on internal restructuring before taking on a big project, according to other people with knowledge of his thinking.
The latest comments also contrast with the neutral tone set in a letter to employees on Sunday after both Deutsche and Commerzbank confirmed talks. Sewing said then that many factors could still prevent a merger. 
Deutsche Bank would not have entered talks if the bank expected negotiations to fail, said a second person with knowledge of Sewing's thinking.
The powerful Verdi labor union, which sits on the supervisory boards of both banks, has voiced fierce objections to a merger, saying that as many as 30,000 jobs are at risk over the long term.
Both banks currently employ 140,000 worldwide. A spokeswoman for Verdi said on Thursday that the union's position hasn't changed.
RESERVATIONS
At least three of Deutsche Bank's top investors have voiced reservations about a merger, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Two of them are awaiting details from Sewing and his colleagues at Thursday's meeting, two of the people said. 
The ratings agency Moody's said this week that a successful tie-up may lift the banks' profit but earnings would still remain below global competitors and a deal now would delay their current overhauls.
""We would view the impediments to execution on such a deal as very significant,"" it said.
Some German officials have pushed for a merger because they want a strong bank at home to compete with U.S. and Chinese competitors.
However, euro zone banking watchdogs on Thursday said banks planning mergers should make sure they could be wound down in a crisis to avoid taxpayers having to pay for any bailout.
""If a bank becomes too big, complex or interconnected... it needs to have additional capital,"" the ECB top watchdog Andrea Enria said, when asked in the European Parliament about a possible tie-up between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. 
Since the financial crisis a decade ago, European banks remain relatively weak compared with their U.S. counterparts, said John McFarlane, chairman of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) , and it will take a while for them to recover. 

""Even if you get consolidation in Europe, take Deutsche if that ever happens, it will still be less than 10 percent of JPMorgan's market cap and still be smaller than Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS),"" he said.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>",Tencent to cut reliance on China gaming after profit hit,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings signaled it will reduce its reliance on gaming in China, where a regulatory review and one-off investment costs led to its sharpest-ever quarterly profit drop and slowest annual profit growth in 13 years. 
""Our revenue mix is getting increasingly diversified, with fast growth from performance-based advertising and 'other' revenues,"" Tencent President Martin Lau said on Thursday.
Lau was referring to a segment that included Tencent's new cloud business, which posted its first annual revenue of 9.1 billion yuan ($1.36 billion). Lau added Tencent will add a new revenue category in its next earnings report to reflect the contribution from such fast-growing new businesses. 
Asia's second-most valuable company also said it will move younger staff into middle management in a shake-up that will see around 10 percent of its managers retire or become consultants.
Tencent is battling a slowing Chinese economy which could weigh down the technology sector as well as prolonged regulatory setbacks to its main business of gaming, with a nine-month hiatus in new game approvals in China preventing it from making money out of some of its most popular games.
Net profit for the September-December quarter dropped by more than expected by 32 percent, the biggest decline since Tencent went public in 2004, to 14.2 billion yuan, in part due to one-off losses from its portfolio companies. 
Smartphone games, Tencent's largest single revenue generator, grew 12 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier to 19 billion yuan, compared to 24 percent for 2018.
Lau warned Tencent's gaming releases in China this year would be initially be slower than previous years, this is due to a large backlog of requests the Chinese regulator has to go through. Tencent will seek to grow gaming revenue from overseas markets by exporting its games as well as investment, Lau said.
He declined to comment on Tencent's interest in bidding for South Korean gaming firm Nexon Co, a deal which could be worth as much as $13 billion. 
Tencent's total revenue in the quarter rose 28 percent to 84.9 billion yuan, slightly ahead of an average estimate of 83 billion yuan from 19 analysts. 
China's falling automobile sales amid the country's weakest economic growth in nearly three decades meant advertisers, especially big-ticket automobile firms, have ""become more conservative"" in their spending, Lau said. 
Online advertising, accounting for around a fifth of Tencent's total revenue, grew at a slower pace of 38 percent in the fourth quarter. 
The company recorded net other gains totaling 16.7 billion yuan for 2018, down from 20.14 billion yuan in 2017, mainly due to poorer investment gains, which Lau blamed on cyclicality and macroeconomic environment. 
User numbers for WeChat edged up to 1.097 billion.
Shares in Tencent closed down 2 percent at HK$363 before the results, giving it a market value of around $449 billion. 
The stock has risen by 15.6 percent so far this year, but the stock is still nearly 24 percent below its peak of HK$476.6 reached more than a year ago.

Never mind issues like  CEO Elon Musk's ongoing battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  employees being asked to help deliver cars by quarter-end, and what many analysts call a  demand problem — it has all done little to derail the bullish Ives, who has a price target of $390 — nearly 43% above the $273 a share where Tesla was trading on Wednesday.

""It was jaw-dropping in how efficient that process has now become in the tent,"" Ives told Markets Insider, referring to the Model 3 sedans being produced  underneath a giant tent at the Fremont factory. ""This is not a company that's slowing down production.""
While declining to elaborate on how many people were working underneath the tent or who from the Tesla accompanied the tour, Ives said his group viewed a ""robust"" and ""streamlined"" production process.

""In terms of the tent, this is not a situation where you have workers taking lunch breaks and relaxing,"" Ives said. ""You sense at Fremont this is a company that has pressure on the manufacturing process, just given underlying demand they're seeing in Europe and China.""
Analysts are concerned that  demand for Tesla's cars is waning, and while Ives says appetite in the US has indeed softened, he believes bearish investors are missing the bigger picture: ""They're viewing this as the start of the end, whereas I view this as more of an air pocket.""

When asked Wednesday how he could comfortably recommend investing in a company led by a CEO involved in an ongoing dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ives told Markets Insider that he's focused on the company's long-term potential.
""I view this as a company where, it was never going to be an easy road for Tesla,"" he said. ""A lot of the issues are unfortunate that are happening with the SEC and Musk, and it's created a sideshow that's been a bit of an overhang on the name. But I look at the name as the first inning of what I view as a massive EV transformation that's going to happen over the next decade."" 
Ives also said some of the  production issues at the Gigafactory appear to be resolved, and wrote in a report to clients out Wednesday that he believes the company's goal of producing enough batteries for 7,000 Model 3 sedans per week is realistic with ""more automation, robotics, data analysis, and streamlined capacity in Giga.""
As for the production and assembly of the Model Y crossover SUV —  unveiled at Tesla's Hawthorne, California, design studio last week and set to debut next year — Ives believes that will be done at the Gigafactory.
Meanwhile, across the Fremont factory's floor and in the tent there was ""laser focus"" on producing vehicles shipping off to Europe and China, Ives wrote in his note.
Tesla earlier this year began  building out a Gigafactory in China, its first such factory outside the United States. Ives is encouraged by the kind of growth it could spur.

Levi Strauss & Co., which is set to rejoin the stock market on Thursday at a valuation of $6.6 billion, will hope investors see the same longevity in the Levi's brand.
Shares priced Wednesday evening at $17 apiece, above the predicted price range of $14 to $16, signaling strong investor interest. It raised $623 million from the sale of 36.7 million shares. The founder's family will take the bulk of the proceeds, with the remaining $161 million earmarked for day-to-day costs and potential acquisitions. 
The jeans maker listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ""LEVI."" The trading floor's ban on jeans has been relaxed for the day and traders are encouraged to wear Levi's.
Levi's was founded in 1853 and first joined the public markets in 1971. It was taken private by descendants of Strauss in a $1.7 billion leveraged buyout in 1985.
The company claims to have created the first pair of blue jeans in 1873. Its products are now sold in more than 50,000 retail locations across more than 110 countries.
Levi's net revenue grew 14% to $5.6 billion in its  last fiscal year. However, a sharp rise in selling, general, and administrative costs meant net income inched up just 0.2% to $283 million.

702,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 09:09AM ET</span>",Ethiopia crash captain did not train on airline's MAX simulator: source,"By Maggie Fick and Jason Neely
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The captain of a doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight did not get a chance to practice on his airline's new simulator for the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 8 before he died in a crash with 157 others, a pilot colleague said. 
Captain Yared Getachew, 29, was due for refresher training at the end of March, his colleague told Reuters, two months after Ethiopian Airlines had received one of the first such simulators being distributed. 
The March 10 disaster, following another MAX 8 crash in Indonesia in October, has set off one of the biggest inquiries in aviation history, focused on the safety of a new automated system and whether crews understood it properly.
In both cases, the pilots lost control soon after take-off and fought a losing battle to stop their jets plunging down. 
The MAX, which came into service two years ago, has a new automated system called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). It is meant to prevent loss of lift which can cause an aerodynamic stall sending the plane downwards in an uncontrolled way. 
""Boeing did not send manuals on MCAS,"" the Ethiopian Airlines pilot told Reuters in a hotel lobby, declining to give his name as staff have been told not to speak in public. 
""Actually we know more about the MCAS system from the media than from Boeing.""
Under unprecedented scrutiny and with its MAX fleet grounded worldwide, the world's largest planemaker has said airlines were given guidance on how to respond to the activation of MCAS software. It is also promising a swift update.
Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the pilot's remarks. It has not said 737 pilots should train on one of the new simulators to fly a 737 MAX, which has larger engines mounted slightly more forward than the previous model.
""I think that the differences between the 737 NG and the MAX were underplayed by Boeing,"" said John Cox, an aviation safety consultant, former U.S. Airways pilot and former air safety chairman of the U.S. Airline Pilots Association. 
""Consequently the simulator manufacturers were not pushing it either. The operators didn't realize the magnitude of the differences,"" he told Reuters in a communication over the Ethiopian pilot's remarks.
AIRLINE CHIDES ""IRRESPONSIBLE"" VIEWS
Ethiopian Airlines said on Thursday its pilots had completed training recommended by Boeing and approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on differences between the previous 737 NG aircraft and the 737 MAX version.
They were also briefed on an emergency directive after the Indonesia crash, which was incorporated into manuals and procedures, it said in a tweet. The 737 MAX simulator was not designed to replicate the MCAS system problems, it added.
""We urge all concerned to refrain from making such uninformed, incorrect, irresponsible and misleading statements during the period of the accident investigation,"" it said.
Yared's brother said he traveled to Miami twice in the last two years to train on a simulator there, but he did not know which one. Miami has had a 737 MAX simulator since 2017. 
Globally, most commercial airline pilots refresh training in simulators every six months. In the Ethiopian crash, it was not clear if Yared's colleague - First Officer Ahmednur Mohammed, 25, who also died in the crash - had used the new simulator. 
The 737 MAX 8 was introduced into commercial service in 2017, but pilots of older 737s were only required to have computer-based training to switch, according to Boeing, airlines, unions and regulators. 
By December, two months after the Lion Air crash that killed 189 people off Jakarta, the main simulator producer CAE Inc of Canada said it had delivered just four MAX simulators to airlines. 
At that time, CAE had orders from airlines globally for 30 MAX simulators, which cost between $6 million and $15 million each depending on customization.
The world's largest 737 operator, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, will not have its first MAX simulator ready for use until October, its pilot union said on Wednesday.

""It is still very disturbing to us that Boeing did not disclose MCAS to the operators and pilots,"" the association told members in a memo seen by Reuters.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 08:42AM ET</span>",Global stocks wilt as Fed shift sparks stampede into bonds,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares wilted and there was a stampede into bonds on Thursday, after the U.S. Federal Reserve's abandonment of all plans to raise rates this year left traders wondering what might be lurking in the shadows.
World markets' reaction to a super-dovish Fed was not unlike the response to the European Central Bank's equally easy stance earlier this month -- the benefits of a reduced interest rate horizon came laced with doubts.
Banks suffered their usual worries about low borrowing rates to drag the pan-European STOXX 600 down and though a rise in metals prices and a weaker pound helped London's FTSE edge up, Wall Street futures were down 0.5 percent. 
But the real action was happening in bond markets.
With investors rushing to price in the prospect of U.S. rate cuts later this year, benchmark Treasury yields dived to their lowest since early 2018 and those on German Bunds -- Europe's benchmark -- to the lowest since October 2016. 
Ten-year Bunds were offering buyers virtually nothing again at yields of just 0.048 percent while widespread curve flattening -- where shorter and longer-term borrowing costs converge -- showed alarm bells were ringing. 
With central banks having already cut rates to the bone and tried full-scale money printing, investors are concerned that many are now low on traditional ammunition to fight recessions. 
""The Fed has the most leeway because it has raised rates nine times so it could cut rates nine times,"" Rabobank strategist Philip Marey said. ""But it will be much more difficult for other central banks which haven't even started to hike yet.""
The Fed's swerve had sent the dollar sliding as far as 110.47 yen, with its 0.6 percent loss overnight the biggest drop since the ""flash crash"" of early January.
The euro flew to a seven-week peak too before things started to reverse in Europe. It was last trading at $1.1390 having tested $1.1450 overnight, but it was still a world away from its recent low of $1.1177.
Brexit worries kept the pound down at $1.3175. Britain's Prime Minister was heading into an EU meeting in Brussels having requested a delay but there still much jostling going on just over a week before Brexit had been due to happen. 
That all left the dollar recovering at 96.200 against a basket of currencies, having lost 0.5 percent overnight. It was also poised precariously on its 200-day moving average, and a sustained break would be taken as technically 'bearish'.
""The downward pressure on U.S. yields continues to support our outlook for a weaker U.S. dollar this year,"" said MUFG analysts in a note.
MY WAY OR NORWAY
Going against the grain, Norway's currency shot up after its central bank raised interest rates and signaled a 50-50 chance another hike will follow by mid-year.
It looked very much the exception after the Fed, the ECB and China all capitulated back toward easier monetary policy and left many in their ranks reviewing what options they will need to deploy if things continue to sour. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.5 percent.
Chinese blue-chips, which spent the morning swinging between small losses and gains, were up 0.4 percent in afternoon trade, while Seoul's Kospi also added 0.4 percent as regulators announced plans to cut the stock transaction tax this year.
Australian shares ended flat after see-sawing throughout the day. A drop in the jobless rate tempered market expectations of a rate cut.
Markets in Japan were closed for a public holiday.
Gains in the broad Asian index followed a wobbly session on Wall Street, after a move toward risk taking sparked by the Fed's dovish shift was overtaken by growth and trade concerns.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday warned that Washington may leave tariffs on Chinese goods for a ""substantial period"" to ensure Beijing's compliance with any trade deal.
China-U.S. trade talks are set to resume next week. 
Global growth worries extended to commodity markets, where oil prices, which had jumped Wednesday on supply concerns, retreated.
U.S. crude fell 0.1 percent to $60.17 a barrel after touching four-month highs on Wednesday. But Brent crude regained some ground, adding 0.15 percent to $68.60.
Weakness in oil prices is seen to be limited by efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to curb supply. Widely watched U.S. data also showed supplies were tightening. 

Gold and copper gained though on the weaker dollar, with spot gold adding about 0.5 percent to $1,318.94 per ounce. Copper rose 0.9 percent to $6,517 a tonne, having touched a near three-week high earlier in the session.

705,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 08:11AM ET</span>",Short & distort? The ugly war between CEOs and activist critics,"By Lawrence Delevingne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - On the morning of July 11, Paul Pittman was on a corn farm in Western Illinois, unaware his company had taken a devastating hit.
Just before the stock market opened, an anonymous short seller named ""Rota Fortunae"" posted on Twitter and financial website Seeking Alpha that Pittman's small real estate investment trust, Farmland Partners Inc, had engaged in dubious transactions and risked ""insolvency."" 
The posting pushed shares down enough to make thousands of previously-purchased stock options profitable, according to a later expert analysis, in turn causing more selling by those on the other side of the trade who committed to buy shares at a higher set price. The accelerating losses were probably compounded by high-frequency trading algorithms activated by price swings and negative keywords, according to that analysis.
Pittman's stomach churned when he checked his smartphone around noon: Shares were off almost 40 percent. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2HyuFCE)
""The game was rigged,"" Pittman, 56, told Reuters.
What followed exemplified a new, ugly phase in a war between companies and activist short sellers, with businesses fighting back against social-media fueled attacks and investors accusing executives of trying to muzzle critics.
Farmland sued Rota Fortunae - Latin for ""wheel of fortune"" - and other unnamed individuals alleging a ""malicious scheme"" to profit from the spread of false information and well-timed stock options. The short seller, a Texas-based individual whose identity has been kept secret, sent a statement to Reuters via an attorney that the litigation aimed to ""intimidate and choke critical opinion"" and that the idea of crashing the stock through ""sophisticated trading"" was ""utter hogwash."" It is all under the watch of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been briefed on the matter.
The stand-off reflects a broader debate over how to balance the desire to keep public companies accountable with concerns over market manipulation. 
Short selling, said to be as old as stock markets, used to be a low-profile affair where bearish investors relied on the media, analysts or regulators to take the lead in exposing over-valued companies. New tools such as Twitter and Seeking Alpha changed that, creating a small but prominent group of brash public activists.
Successful campaigns that exposed corporate fraud or dubious practices, including Carson Block's Sino-Forest Corp takedown and Andrew Left's shorting of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (NYSE:BHC), underscored short sellers' role as market watchdogs. Such victories, coupled with elevated stock valuations, helped spur record numbers of short campaigns, according to industry tracker Activist Insight.
Activist Insight data show such campaigns can have a noticeable impact on stock prices. A 2017 working paper by researchers Yu Ting Forester Wong and Wuyang Zhao also showed they weigh on target companies' investments, dividends and access to financing.
Block, Left and other prominent short sellers interviewed by Reuters say they do thorough research and help keep companies honest.
Yet targeted businesses say many short campaigns waged this decade amount to ""short and distort"" schemes. They accuse some activists of spreading false or misleading information to drive a stock down and then quickly cash out, a mirror image of ""pump and dump,"" where unscrupulous investors promote speculative stocks before selling out at the top. 
Cases against short sellers are rare, though, given free speech protections and companies hesitant to put themselves under the microscope of regulators, lawyers say. 
SHORT IDEAS AND OPTIONS
Recent research provides fresh fodder for the debate. Columbia Law School securities expert Joshua Mitts said in a working paper that he had looked at 1,720 pseudonymous short idea posts on Seeking Alpha between 2010 and 2017 and found that 86 percent were preceded by ""extraordinary"" options trading.
Mitts told Reuters his review of the posts found that, like with Farmland, many short sellers appeared to use fast-expiring put-options bought before the release of a report to spur more selling by underwriters.
""Shorts have to rely on good research, not trading tricks, to punish a stock,"" said Mitts, whose work has led to paid consulting for Farmland and other companies. 
He has also found other unusual trading patterns, including dozens of cases of ""spoofing"" and ""layering,"" illegal trading strategies of placing and canceling orders to create a false impression of demand or supply. Mitts said, however, that high-frequency traders were probably responsible, not activists.
Prominent activists deny engaging in practices described by Mitts and say they rarely use options. Instead, they would typically borrow stocks and immediately sell them in anticipation of a price drop, so they can buy them back for less and pocket the difference.
""I'm sure there are a few anonymous guys out there doing tricky stuff, but it's not a systemic problem,"" Left said. 
One smaller short seller said he used put options in conjunction with Seeking Alpha posts to make larger bets given limited capital, but emphasized making unfounded claims could backfire.
""With options you can get totally destroyed,"" said the investor, who requested anonymity. ""A bad thesis can be debunked almost instantly.""
Activist Insight, which has analyzed hundreds of campaigns, found many cases where target share prices went up, not down. 
So far Mitts is virtually alone in analyzing trading activity around short campaigns, but his findings have already drawn the attention of a top U.S. regulator.
SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson told Reuters the research was ""important"" and challenged his agency to ""identify folks who are dancing a very fine line between trading and market manipulation."" 
The question, Jackson said, was whether the regulator would go after short sellers who engage in fraud as forcefully as it investigates companies for bad behavior.
""I hope the answer to that question will be yes.""
A hint came last September, when the SEC brought a rare ""short and distort"" case against hedge fund manager Gregory Lemelson for making false claims about Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc, an allegation which Lemelson has denied. 
Jackson said, however, laws on anonymity and free speech could limit any steps that went beyond straightforward cases involving false information.
On March 12, for example, a New York state judge dismissed a lawsuit against short sellers by Indian media company Eros International PLC, noting their opinions on Seeking Alpha and elsewhere were substantiated and therefore protected.
Still, companies are increasingly retaliating with lawsuits, hiring private investigators and using other aggressive tactics, according to some activists. Block, for example, said he has faced ""constant"" legal threats, at least one undercover operative, and a failed $50 million investigation to discredit his research. 
""More than ever, bad companies are trying to shoot the messenger through any means available,"" Block said.
FARM WAR
In the days after Rota's post, Farmland issued a public rebuttal and Pittman, a former farmer and financial executive, said the company had to go on an ""'I am not a crook' tour"" in meetings and calls with investors and business partners. 
Most were sympathetic, Pittman said, including farmers who had traded land for stock, but Farmland lost a potential partnership and had to cut staff from 17 to 13.
George Moriarty, executive editor of Seeking Alpha, said that courts have respected the site's status as a neutral platform and that its staff vetted all posts. In this case, Rota made ""limited factual corrections"" after Seeking Alpha contacted him about Farmland's rebuttal.
Still, shares have never quite recovered, and Rota told Reuters that Farmland has yet to substantively address his concerns. 
Stock analysts said Rota's language was dramatic relative to the underlying issues and instead focused on broader business challenges and the potential costs of fighting back. Farmland recently reported about $1.6 million in extra expenses over 2018, before insurance, citing Rota's campaign. That included defending against a related shareholder class-action and legal costs from its suit against the short seller.
Mitts has submitted his opinion on put options in the case, a pattern he said he discovered independently during his academic research. 
The short seller behind the Rota moniker told Reuters he planned to challenge Mitts' assertions and would continue his defense of first amendment rights. Farmland's lawyers said Rota's free speech argument was undercut by his acknowledgement of payments received for research on Farmland.
Whatever happens in court, the SEC is watching. Rota submitted his Farmland analysis to the agency's whistleblower hotline, while Farmland later briefed SEC staff on its side.

The SEC declined to comment, but on Jan. 29 it denied Farmland's request for records on Rota and options trading because, according to a letter revealed in a court filing, related information was in an ""investigative file"" from an ""on-going law enforcement proceeding.""

706,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 07:04AM ET</span>",Boeing's Woes Create an Opportunity for IAG,"Investing.com -- The grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX planes is causing headaches for the airlines that have quickly come to rely on them. For one airline in particular, it could even cost it its independence.
Shares in Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC), which has tried to revive the model of discount transatlantic flights, have fallen some 22% since the Ethiopia Airlines disaster. The 737 MAX makes up 11% of Norwegian's 164-strong fleet, and the airline had expected to have over 70 of them by the end of 2021. Norwegian's CEO has indicated it will seek compensation from Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Boeing has told airlines it expects to release a software fix for the 737 MAX’s flight-control system by the end of the month, the BBC reported on Tuesday. If it can keep to that deadline, then Norwegian could reasonably hope that its planes will be flying again before the Easter holidays.
But if they stay grounded into the summer tourist season, the cost in terms of lost revenue and short-term leases of replacement planes will be painfully high.
Idle planes put extra pressure on Norwegian, which is already struggling to make its model of discount long-haul flights profitable. Its operating loss nearly doubled to 3.85 billion Norwegian kroner ($450 million) last year, as an environment of intense competition and overcapacity stopped it passing on the cost of higher fuel prices. The company had to raise 3 billion kroner in fresh capital at a deep discount in February after British Airways' parent IAG (LON:ICAG) walked away from a potential takeover. Norwegian’s chief executive Bjørn Kjos had rejected two offers from IAG as undervaluing the business.
IAG chief executive Willie Walsh hasn’t ruled out making a third bid but said two weeks ago it was “unlikely”.
But with Norwegian now down 84% from the NOK 330 price tag it had when IAG turned its back - it raises the question of whether the owner of BA and Spain-based Iberia may be tempted to return to the table. The stock is half the price it was when IAG considered it interesting (even if the rights issue has increased the number of shares outstanding).
With a market value of only NOK6.31 billion, the airline could represent a very cheap option for IAG to strengthen its position on the key transatlantic route. The question for Walsh is whether it will get even cheaper if the 737 MAX stays grounded for longer than Boeing says."

Canada, China, Mexico and the European Union slapped import duties ranging from 10 percent to 25 percent on U.S whiskey and bourbon last year, resulting in a 11 percent drop in U.S. whiskey exports in the second half, according to a report from the Distilled Spirits Council.
For the first six months of 2018, whiskey exports grew 28 percent compared to the same period in 2017, partly helped by companies like Jack Daniels maker Brown-Forman Corp, fast-tracking shipments overseas, especially to Europe, before the tariffs kicked in.
Overall for the full-year 2018, whiskey exports rose 5.1 percent to $1.18 billion, a significant drop from the 16 percent rise seen in 2017.
Exports to the European Union fell 13.4 percent in the second half of the year, after rising 33 percent during the first six months. 
The European Union, which imposed a 25 tariff on American whiskey, is the largest market for the liquor, accounting for nearly 60 percent of total exports, according to the Council.
Earlier in March, Brown-Forman said absorbing the costs of tariffs in key European markets was the primary reason for the decline in its third-quarter gross profit margin.
The company also said its sales would take a hit in 2019 if the tariffs were to remain in place.
""The damage to American whiskey exports is now accelerating, and this is collateral damage from ongoing global trade disputes,"" Distilled Spirits Council Chief Executive Officer Chris Swonger said.

Total U.S. spirits exports rose 9.5 percent to $1.8 billion in 2018, but also slowed from 2017, the report showed.

Investing.com -- For the second time in a month, Europe’s stock markets are reacting negatively to central bank action that could reasonably have been expected to support them.
The Federal Reserve’s decision to implicitly abandon the idea of further interest rate increases this year has pushed markets lower, not higher, as market participants focus more on the pessimism about the economic outlook that underlies that development.
At 05:00 AM ET (09:00 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.68 points, or 0.2% at 380.08. Germany’s Dax was down 0.4% and France’s CAC 40 was flat.
The only clear outperformer was the U.K. FTSE 100, up 0.4% thanks entirely to its natural resources companies. The Fed’s action has made the dollar cheaper and depressed dollar yields, and that should support global demand for commodities which are priced in dollars. It will also make it easier for emerging markets to finance their dollar-denominated debts.
The news out of the Fed pushed the price of U.S. crude over $60 a barrel, and pushed the price of the international benchmark Brent as far as $68.69 – a four-month high for both blends. Consequently, oil majors  BP  (LON:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) are up some 1%, while smaller producers such as  Lundin Petroleum  AB (ST:LUPE) and  Tullow Oil  (LON:TLW) are outperforming.
Mining stocks are faring even better: BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB),  Glencore  (LON:GLEN),  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) are all up by over 2%. Miners and oil companies are getting a double-lift from Prime Minister Theresa May's single-handed attempts to wrestle the pound lower by threatening a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday evening.
The only other outperformers of note are semiconductor stocks. That’s a result of U.S. chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) predicting an upturn in the global market in the second half of the year. Germany’s Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and France-based STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) are both leading their respective indexs, up 1.3% and 2.0% respectively.
Among the biggest losers –  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), both down 3.5% after strong pushback from regulators against their proposed merger."

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock exchanges in Europe are not harming markets or gouging customers with the fees they charge for data, an industry-commissioned report said on Thursday.
The report from consultants Oxera for the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) wants to counter accusations from investment funds that ""monopoly"" bourses were continually hiking fees for market data to lift profits.
Investment firms have called on the EU's markets watchdog ESMA to review market data fees charged by exchanges, saying they keep on rising despite falling costs of computing and data storage.
Oxera's report concludes that ""economic analysis suggest that the current charging structures for market data are unlikely to have detrimental effects on market outcomes for investors.""
FESE said that while fees have been ""challenged by some"", the report showed that aggregate market data revenues have risen by only 1 percent a year, from 230 million euros ($261.2 million) in 2012 to 245 million euros in 2018.
""Costs have remained stable over the last five years,"" said Rainer Riess, FESE director general.
Policymakers should be very mindful that any changes do not harm how prices of shares are formed, Riess added.
TRANSATLANTIC
Investment funds face scrutiny over their own fees charged customers and want to cut costs.
They have to buy data to help show regulators that they are obtaining the best share prices on behalf of investors in a region where many platforms trade the same stocks.
The Alternative Investment Management Association, Managed Funds Association, Britain's Investment Association and two German funds bodies BVI and BAI, asked ESMA in December to enforce an EU securities law that requires market data to be sold on a ""reasonable commercial basis"".
The bloc's competition officials are also facing pressure to intervene.
In the United States the Securities and Exchange Commission repealed two data price changes last May for public feeds for Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange listed securities for the first time after complaints from asset managers.
The battle across the Atlantic has led to market participants like Fidelity Investments and hedge fund Citadel to back a new, low cost Members Exchange bourse to compete with NYSE.
FESE said the real issue was not prices but the ""often very low quality"" of data from off-exchange or ""dark"" trading platforms.
There has been talk for many years of a ""consolidated tape"" or a single pipe for gathering share prices from different platforms, like in the United States.
FESE said data intermediaries or vendors were already offering a de facto tape for prices on the bulk of so-called ""lit"" exchanges, where prices and trades are instantly visible.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 04:05AM ET</span>","Exclusive: KKR raising first Asia real estate fund, targeting $1.5 billion - sources","By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global investment powerhouse KKR & Co Inc is raising its first Asia-focused real estate fund, targeting $1.5 billion as it looks to deepen its real estate portfolio in the region, said people with knowledge of the matter.
The New York-headquartered private equity firm is moving toward first-close of the fund late in the second quarter, the people said, declining to be named as the information is confidential.
The firm itself will commit about $250 million in capital, and potential investors - also known as limited partners - include sovereign funds and pension funds, they said.
KKR declined to comment.
The fundraising comes as private equity firms globally have expanded from a model of buying out companies to turn around and sell for profit. They now invest through a range of alternative asset management products, including infrastructure, real estate, hedge funds and credit.
Investment firms raised $18.6 billion in 26 Asia-focused real estate funds last year, the highest since 2008, according to data provider Preqin. KKR's U.S.-based rival Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group raised the region's biggest real estate fund last year at $7.1 billion.
Like its peers, KKR has been building out new capabilities outside traditional private equity investments in Asia. It has committed about $2 billion in equity and debt across nearly 50 real estate transactions in the region including South Korea, Australia, China and India since 2011, the firm has said.
Late last year, it teamed up with two Korean partners to acquire a mixed-use real estate project under development in Seoul's Gangnam business district for about $1.9 billion.
It also invested in The-K Twin Towers, a commercial property in Seoul in 2014 with a Hong Kong-based hedge fund in a deal which South Korean media valued at 500 billion won ($489 million). The property was sold to Samsung (KS:005930) SRA at a premium last year.
The firm has also been an active financing provider in India through its real estate-focused non-bank finance firm KKR India Asset Finance Ltd.
KKR has a dedicated team of about 20 real estate professionals based in Asia Pacific spanning both the equity and credit deals.
Last May, it hired John Pattar, former chief executive of CLSA Real Estate, to head its Asia real estate team. Pattar ran CLSA's real estate funds for almost 15 years before joining KKR. It has also hired new heads of infrastructure and credit for Asia and is separately considering launching an Asia-focused infrastructure fund, Reuters has reported.
Earlier this month, it announced the hiring of Kate Richdale, former Asia investment banking chief of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in a newly created role as Asia-Pacific head of strategy and business development.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott has called for a shareholder vote to instruct management of German utility Uniper to enter talks on giving one of the latter's biggest investors the right to control it without having a majority of its shares.
Elliott, Uniper's second-largest shareholder with 17.84 percent, wants the so-called domination agreement to be discussed at the group's next annual shareholders' meeting on May 22, it said.
It added on Thursday it would otherwise ask for an extraordinary general meeting on the proposal to give top investor Fortum the domination rights.
Elliott's proposal comes a month after Uniper and Fortum announced fresh cooperation talks in an attempt to repair their relationship, which has been strained ever since the Finnish state-owned group launched a hostile takeover attempt in 2017. 
Fortum last year acquired a 47 percent stake in Uniper from E.ON, which it recently raised to 49.99 percent. Uniper has argued it would be more successful as an independent company.
For now, Fortum cannot raise its stake further, after Russian regulators ruled it is limited to hold less than half of Uniper because of a strategic water testing license owned by Unipro, Uniper's Russian unit.
That has restricted Fortum's influence on the company's strategy. Any domination of the company and its cash flows would need to be approved by 75 percent of the shareholders present at a shareholder meeting.
While the combined stake of Fortum and Elliott only adds up to 67.83 percent, that would likely be enough given traditional attendance rates at shareholder meetings. At Uniper's past two general meetings, shareholder turnout averaged about 74 percent.
Reuters reported in November that Elliott could use its stake to force Uniper's management to enter talks over a domination agreement.

""Elliott believes the thus-far ill-defined and ambiguous nature of the relationship between Uniper and Fortum has created an unsatisfactory and unsustainable dynamic, which is detrimental to Uniper,"" the investor said in a statement on Thursday.

""Banks want Goyal to bring his stake down to 10 percent, below the 17 percent envisaged in the bank-led provisional resolution plan (BLPRP),"" sources told CNBC-TV18.
The state-run banks are also pushing Goyal to step down, CNBC-TV18 added. 
Jet has more than $1 billion in debt, and owes money to banks, suppliers, pilots and lessors - some of whom have started terminating leases with the carrier.
The government has asked state-run banks, led by State Bank of India (SBI), to rescue Jet without pushing it into bankruptcy, two people within the administration have told Reuters, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to avert thousands of job losses weeks before a general election.
Several people who have worked closely with Goyal, 69, have told Reuters that his penchant for control has emerged as a major obstacle in negotiating a rescue deal.
SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar had said on Wednesday that a resolution plan was ""almost"" ready and that it would not involve a bailout for any individual, including Goyal. 

Jet and SBI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday, which is a public holiday in India.

715,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>","From California to Oslo: foreign subsidies fuel Norway's e-car boom, for now","By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent
OSLO (Reuters) - On the outskirts of Oslo, a row of Fiat 500es imported from California stand parked in the snow outside the Buddy Electric dealership, part of a global flow of pre-owned electric cars to Norway powered by green subsidies elsewhere in the world.
The company's production manager, Tor Einar Hanssen, said it had sold about 110 in the past year and a half, making a small profit on the cars, most of which had been used for a few years by U.S. leasing companies.
""They're surprisingly good in cold weather,"" he said.
A gleaming blue Fiat 500e is on sale for 129,000 Norwegian crowns ($15,000) with 24,000 km (15,000 miles) on the clock. It costs about 20,000 crowns($2,300) to import and adapt each Fiat, Hanssen said.
On U.S. used car websites, similar Fiats in California are advertised for about $10,000.
Norway has the world's highest rate of electric car ownership in the world, partly thanks to long-term perks such as free or discounted road tolls, parking and charging points, which boost the appeal of second hand models unwanted elsewhere.
The government also exempts electric vehicles from taxes on traditional vehicles that are very high in a country which does not have its own fossil fuel car industry to lobby against them. Rebates offered by other countries are another part of the equation.
In California, residents who own a new battery electric car for at least 30 months can get a rebate of up to $4,500, said John Swanton, of the California Air Resources Board.
The Fiats show how varying incentives around the world to promote electric cars, spurred by efforts to combat climate change and limit air pollution, can affect trade flows.
They can also distort national goals for shifting from fossil fuels, although U.S. exports to Norway of 4,232 used electric cars in the past two years are tiny compared with U.S. sales. The state of California alone aims to have five million zero-emission vehicles on its roads by 2030.
The issue has a bigger impact in some European countries, which may be over-estimating the greenness of their domestic car fleets due to exports to Norway, where top plug-in cars include Nissan Leafs, Volkswagens , BMW and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
""We're getting a certain amount of vehicle electrification for free, paid by other countries,"" said Lasse Fridstroem, a senior research economist at the Norwegian Center for Transport Research.
""But perhaps it won't last,"" he said of the used e-car imports. He and some car dealers say demand for electric cars elsewhere in Europe is picking up, and that Norway could swing to be a net exporter of used electric cars in coming years.
(For a graphic on 'Second-hand electric vehicles in Norway' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hy4lsB)
BOTTLENECK
At the moment, long waiting lists for new electric cars in Norway mean that people who obtain a new model in high demand, such as a Tesla Model 3 or Hyundai Kona, can potentially re-sell it above list prices that are already higher than elsewhere.
Part of the reason is a bottleneck in new e-car imports. This is caused, to some extent, by incentives for car makers to sell electric cars in the European Union, of which Norway is not a member, even if they are immediately exported to Norway.
To tackle this issue, from January 2019, sales of new cars in Norway are included in a broader EU calculation of the greenness of each manufacturer's European-wide car fleets, a target the carmaker must meet to avoid large penalties.
This could reduce Norway's demand for imports but may also mean its EU neighbors record fewer sales.
Last year, plug-in electric cars accounted for 31.2 percent of new car registrations in Norway, the highest in the world, and the share rose to 34.2 percent when including second-hand imports, according to the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV). The two figures surged to 40.7 and 43.5 percent in February 2019.
Statistics Norway said 11,913 used electric cars and vans were imported last year, up from 9,063 in 2017 when it started to compile data of the second-hand trade.
They came from countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain and South Korea, bringing some of the benefits of cleaner air and less noise intended for their citizens to Norway, where the environment is already far cleaner than in many other countries.
Trod Sandven, a Jaguar Land Rover dealer in Bergen in west Norway, bought 250 new Kia Soul cars last year in countries including Germany. After registering them for a day so that they counted towards manufacturers' green goals under the EU rules, he exported them undriven to Norway to sell as ""second hand"".
""They're brand new, with the plastic still on the seats. The only thing we do is the paperwork,"" said Sandven. He said he received no German subsidies, since that would require owning the cars for several months in Germany.
""Now it’s changing again, now we are exporting cars to other countries,"" he said. ""Norway is crowded with used electric cars and Europe is screaming for electric cars. It's changing every year.""
SWEDEN MOVES
Stockholm tightened subsidy rules last July after finding that about 10 percent of all electric and plug-in hybrids were exported within five years. Eighty percent of those exports ended up over the border in Norway.
""It is problematic that some of the used electric vehicles, that have been subsidized by Swedish tax payers, are exported,"" said Jakob Lundgren, spokesman for Sweden's Environment Minister Isabella Lovin.
Under the new system from July 2018, Swedes have to own a new electric car for six months before receiving a 60,000 Swedish crowns ($6,398.50) rebate. Previously, they got a 40,000 crown discount on buying the car.
Lundgren said there were no data yet to show if the rule change had made an impact.
With just five million people, Norway bought 46,143 new battery electric cars in 2018, making it the biggest market in Europe ahead of Germany with 36,216 and France on 31,095, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
EU rules in effect from 2020-21 will force new cars sold in Europe, including Norway, to average no more than 95 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilometer, with carmakers facing hundreds of millions of euros in potential fines for non-compliance.
Other nations tend to hand out subsidies to make e-cars cheaper but lag in infrastructure, such as charging points. Norway wants all new cars to be zero emissions by 2025. Among other nations, Britain and France have similar goals for 2040.
Electric cars depreciate less quickly in Norway than elsewhere, partly due to the ongoing benefits, which include low-cost ferry trips and use of bus lanes to avoid congestion.
""Norway has become a magnet for the rest of Europe to ship used battery electric vehicles,"" Matthew Harrison, executive vice president Toyota Motor Europe, said at the Geneva motor show this month. ""Frankly there is no used-car demand for battery electric vehicles"" elsewhere in Europe, he said.
Among sources of second hand imports, Fridstroem and other economists said they were baffled by those from Britain. Norway imported 2,147 electric cars from Britain in 2017, and 133 in 2018, according to Statistics Norway.
The steering wheel in British cars is on the right, the wrong side for driving in mainland Europe, making them unattractive in Norway.
A spokesperson for the British Department for Transport said the main conditions for plug-in car grants, of up to 3,500 pounds ($4,624.55), were that buyers have an address in Britain and register the vehicle in the country.
The Department did not comment when asked if some dealers might be buying electric cars made in Britain but designed for mainland Europe. That might be a loophole allowing dealers to pocket the grant and export the car to Norway, although it was not clear why the number of exports had dropped.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Geely Automobile Holdings posted an 18 percent jump in annual net profit, driven by higher sales of its sedans and sports utility vehicles (SUVs), but forecast flat sales growth in 2019 due to uncertainty about domestic demand. 
Geely, China's most high-profile car maker globally thanks to the Geely group's investments in European automakers Volvo and Daimler, posted a record 2018 net profit of 12.55 billion yuan ($1.88 billion), up from the previous year's 10.63 billion. 
That compared with the 12.8 billion yuan average estimate of 34 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
Total revenue for the year was a record 106.60 billion yuan, up from 92.76 billion yuan in 2017. That slightly missed the 108.59 billion yuan estimated by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of Geely rose by as much as 5 percent to HK$14.80 after the results, and were up 3.8 percent at 0600 GMT.
Geely, which sells vehicles under its eponymous and Lynk & Co brands, sold 1.5 million cars last year, 20 percent higher than the 1.25 million it sold in 2017.
The company said in a statement on Thursday that the deterioration of consumer confidence in China, the world's biggest auto market, caused by increased political and economic uncertainties had affected demand, but that its sales had only missed its own annual target by 5 percent. 
Its sales volumes started to particularly slow in the last quarter of 2018, with a 44 percent drop in December alone, according to monthly sales data filings.
Geely is forecasting largely unchanged sales this year as the country's giant auto market struggles with slowing economic growth and more cautious consumers. Last year, the market contracted for the first time since the 1990s. 
It said the strong performance last year was due to demand for its sedans and SUVs, and exports. It is launching a series of new energy and electrified vehicles as well as some upscale models to achieve higher profit margins.
In the statement, Geely also said the Group plans to acquire an engine plant in Zhejiang's Yiwu City from its parent company, Zhejiang Geely Holding, without providing more details.

On Wednesday, the Fed kept interest rates unchanged and indicated that there would be no more hikes this year. The statement was a shift from its stance three months ago, when it projected two interest rate hikes for this year.
“We don’t see data coming in that suggest that we should move in either direction. They suggest that we should remain patient and let the situation clarify itself over time,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a press conference. “It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy.”

Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 declined 0.5% after data showed the country’s jobless rate fell to a near eight-year low in February. The participation rate fell to 65.6% from 65.7% as fewer people went looking for work. That sent the jobless rate to the lowest level since June 2011 at 4.9%.
“Some employment reports are more keenly anticipated than others. Today was one of those reports that felt like a big one given the ongoing disconnect between the activity data and monthly updates on the labour market. It was also the employment report that followed the weak Q4 national accounts published two weeks ago,” Gareth Aird, senior economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a note that was cited by CNBC.
“Today’s data essentially validates why the (Reserve Bank of Australia) has said that the next move in interest rates could be up or down,” Aird said.

“We’re not talking about removing them, we’re talking about leaving them for a substantial period of time, because we have to make sure that if we do the deal with China that China lives by the deal,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. “They’ve had a lot of problems living by certain deals.”
His comments confused some traders, as he also said a deal is “coming along nicely.”
Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported the previous day that U.S. officials are concerned that China might refuse to accept U.S. demands in the countries’ ongoing trade talks.
Chinese officials have shifted their stance due to the lack of assurances from the U.S. that tariffs imposed on their products would be removed, even after agreeing to changes to their intellectual-property policies, the people added.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Lyft Inc executives are focused on cutting insurance costs and will phase in self-driving vehicles on simple routes first, they said at a road show for investors ahead of the ride-hailing company's initial public offering set for next week.
Reducing insurance costs is ""the number one initiative,"" said Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts at a luncheon at a Boston hotel on Wednesday for investors considering whether to buy into the closely watched IPO.
Roberts and Lyft co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer did not directly address questions from the audience during the hour-long event about when the company might become profitable, citing ongoing investments to build out technology and car-servicing centers.
Lyft reported a net loss of $911 million on revenue of $2.16 billion in 2018, according to its preliminary prospectus.
One audience member asked: ""The obvious question is, what revenue do you have to have to get to break even?"" Zimmer said that ""It's not necessarily just a question of scale. It's about beating down those operating costs.""
For instance, Green said the company might look to lower insurance costs by optimizing routes for safety rather than speed. 
The leaders also said the company will stay focused on transportation services, unlike rival Uber Technologies Inc that has expanded into markets like trucking and food delivery.
Uber is also expected to go public soon, with both companies benefiting from the rapid adoption of their services that have already upended the taxi industry.
But some investors have also expressed concerns the ride-hailing industry could itself be disrupted by the rise of autonomous vehicles. 
Zimmer said the arrival of such self-driving cars will be gradual over the next 10 years, much as wireless telephone networks have been upgraded. He said Lyft will initially roll out autonomous vehicles on simpler routes that would not stress their systems. 
He cited examples such as routes where speeds are below 35 miles per hour, U.S. routes without left-hand turns or tunnels, and during good weather.
In interviews after the event several investors expressed a range of reactions to the presentation, on condition they not be named per the policies of their firms. Two said they would be more likely to seek to buy into the IPO, which is oversubscribed, although one said ""It's hard to understand how they differentiate from Uber.""

A third investor echoed the sentiment and noted that many drivers serve both companies.

The case highlights the challenge faced by brands in China, whose products, such as cosmetics, and even automobiles, run the risk of being copied.
Police in the commercial capital of Shanghai also closed two assembly lines used to make the counterfeits and seized more than 4,000 bags, clothes and accessories, each of which they said cost the group 200 yuan to make.
Authorities launched the investigation last year, following a tip that knock-off luxury handbags were being sold on Chinese mobile messaging app WeChat, which is operated by Tencent Holdings.
They also made some arrests in January in the southern province of Guangdong and eastern Jiangsu, Xinhua said.

CARACAS (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) plans to sell several tons of gold placed as collateral by Venezuela's central bank on a $1.6 billion loan after the deadline for repurchasing them expired this month, sources said, a setback for President Nicolas Maduro's efforts to hold onto the country's fast-shrinking reserves.
Maduro's government has since 2014 used financial operations known as gold swaps to use its international reserves to gain access to cash after a slump in oil revenues left it struggling to obtain hard currency. 
In the past two years, however, it has struggled to recover its collateral. 
Under the terms of the 2015 deal with Citigroup's Citibank, Venezuela was due to repay $1.1 billion of the loan on March 11, according to four sources familiar with the situation. The remainder of the loan comes due next year. 
Citibank plans to sell the gold held as a guarantee - which has a market value of roughly $1.358 billion - to recover the first tranche of the loan and will deposit the excess of roughly $258 million in a bank account in New York, two of the sources said.
The ability of Maduro's government to repay the loans have been complicated by the South American country's dire economic situation as well as financial sanctions imposed by the United States and some European nations.
Most Western nations say that Maduro's re-election to a six-year term last year was marred by fraud and have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president. 
Guaido invoked Venezuela's constitution to announce an interim presidency in January. However, Maduro retains control over state institutions in Venezuela and has the support of the powerful military. He has branded Guaido a U.S. puppet.
With Washington's support, Guaido's team has taken control of state oil company PDVSA's U.S. refining subsidiary but its attempt to negotiate a 120-day extension of the repurchase deadline for the collateral was unsuccessful, the sources said. 
""Citibank was told that there was a force majeure event in Venezuela, so the grace period was necessary, but they did not grant it,"" said one of the sources, who belongs to Guaido's team.
A Venezuelan government source familiar with the matter confirmed that the country's Central Bank did not transfer the money to Citibank this month. 
Citigroup declined to comment. The Venezuelan Central Bank did not immediately respond to a request for information. 
In a report presented to the U.S. securities regulator in February, Citibank said Venezuela's Central Bank had agreed four years ago to buy back in March 2019 a ""significant volume of gold"" as part of a contract signed to obtain some $1.6 billion. Citibank said that, following the transaction, it owned the gold. 
Guaido is attempting to freeze bank accounts and gold owned by Venezuela abroad, much of which remains in the Bank of England. At the end of 2018, the Central Bank paid investment bank  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) about $700 million to recover ownership of a portion of gold used as collateral for a loan. 
However, the bullion remained in the custody of the Bank of England, despite the Central Bank's request to repatriate it. In light of that transaction, the sources said there was no incentive for the Central Bank to repay Citibank. RENEGOTIATE DEBT 
Guaido's team also began preparing this month for a possible debt restructuring in a bid to ease payments and stop any hostile action by creditors, said two sources who took part in the discussion. 
In meetings between members of Guaido's team with legal advisors in the United States, there were discussions of starting renegotiations soon not only with Venezuelan bondholders, but also with the Chinese and Russian governments and companies affected by a wave of nationalizations, said the sources. 
""We want to address the debt in a comprehensive way. We calculate that it totals $200 billion,"" said one of the sources. 
The Citgo refinery unit, Venezuela's main asset abroad, is under scrutiny because it serves as a guarantee for the issuance of a PDVSA bond and a loan from Russian oil company Rosneft. 

Guaido's advisers are also evaluating the payment in the coming weeks of around $72 million in interest coming due on PDVSA's 2020 bonds to avoid any action by creditors against Citgo.

(Reuters) - Levi Strauss & Co fetched a higher price than expected in its initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday, selling $623.3 million in shares as the U.S. jeans maker looks to return to the stock market after 34 years as a family-owned company.
The success of the IPO underscores the diverging fortunes of retail companies over the last few years. Vendors like Levi with consistently popular offerings have flourished as they reach more shoppers through online channels, while tens of thousands of brick-and-mortar stores have closed under pressure from e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
With the stock market hovering near all-time highs, Levi said it priced its IPO at $17 share, just above its target range of $14 to $16, valuing the company at about $6.6 billion. 
The company, which claims to have invented blue jeans in the 19th century and is named for the man who founded it in 1853, is set to debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the ticker ""LEVI"".
In the IPO, $462.4 million worth of stock was sold by existing stockholders and the company sold $160.9 million in shares. 
Levi is setting the stage for a bumper year for IPOs that will also feature the likes of ride-hailing startups Lyft Inc and Uber Technologies Inc later this year. IPOs in the U.S. amassed to $60.8 billion in 2018, up 23 percent from a year earlier and the highest since 2014, according to data provider Dealogic. 
The popularity of denim is surging, driven by new styles such as high-waist and pinstriped jeans. Earlier this month  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch Co posted strong results boosted by denim sales.
Levi reported net revenue of $5.8 billion for the 12 months ending Nov. 25, up from $4.9 billion the year before. Net income was $285.2 million, only slightly up from $284.6 million a year earlier.
The Haas family, the descendants of Levi Strauss, will sell a small chunk of their shares and will continue to control the company. They took it private in 1985 in a $1.6 billion leveraged buyout. Levi Strauss first went public in 1971.
Founder Levi Strauss moved to San Francisco in 1853 during the California gold rush, opening a dry goods business. 
The company he founded has laid claim to inventing blue jeans when Strauss and a partner in 1873 received a patent on using rivets to make clothes, a practice that still distinguishes the company's jeans. Over the years the company added new lines, including the office casual Dockers brand. 
The proceeds from the IPO will boost Levi Strauss' coffers to invest in broadening its product range.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank Of America and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are among the main underwriters of the IPO.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 08:17PM ET</span>",U.S. fund Elliott battles the odds in latest showdown with Hyundai,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - The showdown between U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management and Hyundai Motor Group is set to come to a head on Friday when shareholders gather to vote on the fund's demands for a hefty special dividend and a board shake-up.
Elliott's challenge to South Korea's second-biggest family-run conglomerate is the latest example of shareholder activism in Asia's fourth-biggest economy, long dominated by powerful cliques that took minority investors for granted.
The activist fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer tasted success last year when it and other investors opposed Hyundai's ownership restructuring plan on the basis that it would favor family members rather than minority shareholders.
While it looks likely to fail on most counts on Friday, even if it manages to gain a single seat at Hyundai it would be a major victory for shareholder empowerment in the country.
Elliott is trying to rally shareholder support for dividend payouts from Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis for 2018 worth a combined 7 trillion won ($6.2 billion), saying the group should dispose of its excess capital. 
That is more than six times higher than the $1 billion in payouts offered by the Hyundai affiliates, which say Elliott's proposals would hamper future investments and acquisitions.
Elliott has also demanded a total of five board nominees at Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis to address ""governance shortcomings"".
""We urge all shareholders to send an unambiguous message to the group in support of good governance and accountability, and to state unequivocally: The status quo is not acceptable – change must come to HMG,"" Elliott said in the letter to shareholders on Thursday. 
The campaign received a potentially fatal blow last week when South Korea's National Pension Service, the second-biggest shareholder in the two firms, said Elliott's demands were ""excessive"".
""I cannot help but think that Elliott is trying to make quick bucks and leave rather than enhancing long-term shareholder value,"" Kim Woo-chang, one of the members of the NPS panel which made the decision to vote against the proposals, told Reuters.
""Elliott's strategy has failed. It was short-sighted.""
The NPS holds stakes of 8.7 percent and 9.45 percent in Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis, respectively. About 30 percent of the two firms are owned by Hyundai affiliates and family members. Resolutions require approval from a majority of the votes of shareholders present at the meetings.
As of November, Elliott held more than 2.5 percent of common stock in Hyundai Mobis, 3 percent in Hyundai Motor and 2.1 percent in affiliate Kia Motors.     
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
Questions about Hyundai Motor Group grew in 2014 when it paid $10 billion to buy land for a new headquarters in Seoul, three times the appraised value.
Some investors remain deeply troubled by that decision and want to see change at the conglomerate, even if they are not ready to support Elliott's proposals.
""It is not that Elliott's demand is nonsense. Hyundai has accumulated cash, and it has a poor track record of using cash,"" said Park Yoo-kyung, a Hong Kong-based director of Dutch pension fund APG Asset Management, which holds shares in Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis.
""But we decided to give (the newly created board) the benefit of the doubt,"" Park told Reuters.
Leading proxy advisor ISS has recommended investors vote for Elliott's proposal to expand the board to 11 directors from nine at Hyundai Mobis to make room for director nominees from both the activist fund and management.
Seven out of nine funds which disclosed their proxy votes ahead of the meetings said they would back Elliott's proposals for board changes at Hyundai Mobis, according to the website of Korea Corporate Governance Service. 
For Hyundai Motor, five out of six funds said they would vote against Elliott's three director nominees, who will compete with Hyundai's nominees to win board seats.
Once this battle is over Hyundai still faces the bigger challenge of revamping the group's ownership structure, a process which is attracting close scrutiny from Elliott, NPS and other investors.

726,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 07:59PM ET</span>",Closing time? Japan convenience stores pressed to end 24-7 model amid labor crunch,"By Ritsuko Ando
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's 24-hour convenience stores are struggling to stay open around the clock as an industry that has continually expanded now finds itself at the sharp end of a labor shortage. 
Franchise owners, some of whom were forced to work amid massive snowstorms or in the wake of a family death, have launched a campaign to persuade industry leader 7-Eleven to allow stores to close earlier.
Although the debate has focused on their plight, it has also raised doubts over the future of a $100 billion industry that faces an aging population, slow economic growth and new competitors such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime.
""The question is, how much demand is there for 24-hour service in an age when online shopping is expanding?"" said Takayuki Kurabayashi, a Nomura Research Institute partner who specializes in consulting for the retail industry. 
Japanese convenience stores began expanding in the 1970s as their 24-hour accessibility proved a perfect match with the country's dense population and late-night work culture. 
The brightly lit stores, which locals call ""combini,"" are ubiquitous and an essential part of modern Japanese life, offering everything from neckties to packaged ""bento"" lunches for city workers. 
Rural Japanese rely on the stores for parcel and ATM services, or even as lifelines during disasters such as earthquakes. 
The franchise system promoted a nationwide expansion that took the total number of stores to roughly 58,000 last year, a majority operated by the big three: 7-Eleven, originating in the U.S. but now Japanese-owned; FamilyMart, UNY Holdings' convenience store arm; and Lawson, a subsidiary of trading house Mitsubishi Corp.
For years, the franchise model shielded operations from the direct effects of Japan's labor crunch. But now, the tightest labor market more than 40 years is hurting store owners, who pay salaries after handing over royalty fees. 
A union of convenience store owners said they were finding it increasingly hard to hire enough employees. Many owners said they worked long hours themselves to keep stores open 24 hours - a requirement in most franchise contracts.
""At the time of the agreement, we could not foresee the current labor shortage or spike in minimum wages,"" said Mitoshi Matsumoto, a union member who owns a 7-Eleven store in Osaka, referring to the deal he and his wife signed with the company.
Struggling to keep the store running after his wife's death last year, he began closing it for a few hours at night, and was threatened with a fine. 
His pleas to management and lawmakers drew widespread sympathy in a country in which ""work-life balance"" has become a buzzword and employers have come under fire for cases of death by overwork. 
Even the pro-business Nikkei newspaper wrote an editorial saying stores should be allowed reasonable working hours even if consumers suffer slight inconveniences.
Amid such pressure, the company said that on Thursday, it would begin testing shorter hours at 10 of its more than 20,700 stores. It emphasized that the change was experimental and that it was not yet altering its 24-7 format. 
SATURATION AND INNOVATION
Roy Larke, who analyses Japan's retail industry as editor of JapanConsuming.com, said he sees the sector as saturated and consolidation inevitable.
""We do have too many convenience stores now, sometimes literally next door to each other. There are probably around 10 percent too many,"" he said. 
Katsuhiko Shimizu, spokesman for Seven & i Holdings which owns 7-Eleven and general merchandise chain Ito-Yokado, disagreed.
""There's room for innovation,"" he said, citing the company's efforts to incorporate more automation and artificial intelligence in processes ranging from stocking to check-out.
Chains are also testing new formats such as outlets that combine drugstores, dry cleaners and even gyms. FamilyMart has opened some such stores with the country's largest discount chain, Don Quijote, to inject excitement.
Analysts warn against underestimating a sector known for maintaining high margins and rarely discounting, helped by constant product renewals and staples like 100-yen (90-cent) coffees. 
They also say it's too early to predict the outcome of Japan's online grocery delivery race, which is only getting started. 
Although Amazon's grocery and same-day delivery services are considered threats, convenience stores are also launching online platforms; their affiliations with traditional supermarkets and logistics networks are seen as advantages.
""It's not clear-cut whether Amazon will be overwhelmingly powerful here,"" said Larke. ""Especially in food, it doesn't have the game to itself."" 
Convenience stores, like other Japanese businesses, have also been expanding abroad. But Nomura Research's Kurabayashi warned that those foreign markets, including China, were also aging.

""What's happening in Japan is eventually going to happen elsewhere in Asia,"" he said. ""It's just a matter of time.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel plans a hearing on March 27 on aviation safety after two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 8 aircraft crashes since October, and said it will also schedule a future hearing with Boeing and other manufacturers, officials said on Wednesday.
The hearing on federal oversight on commercial aviation by the Senate Commerce subcommittee on aviation and space will include the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) acting administrator Dan Elwell, National Transportation Safety Board chairman Robert Sumwalt and Transportation Department Inspector General Calvin Scovel, the committee confirmed.
Federal prosecutors are investigating the FAA's certification of the Boeing 737 MAX that was grounded last week by regulators around the world. 
The panel chaired by Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, said that ""in light of the recent tragedy in Ethiopia and the subsequent grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, this hearing will examine challenges to the state of commercial aviation safety, including any specific concerns highlighted by recent accidents.""
A second hearing on aviation safety is planned ""in the near future to hear from industry stakeholders that would include Boeing, other aviation manufacturers, airline pilots, and other stakeholders,"" the committee said.
 Boeing Co , the world's biggest planemaker, faces growing obstacles to returning its grounded 737 MAX fleet to the skies, while details emerged of an Indonesian crash last October with potential similarities to the Ethiopian disaster on March 10.
On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said he would nominate Steve Erickson, a former Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) executive to head the FAA. Elwell, the deputy administrator, has run the agency on an acting basis for 14 months.
A House panel also is expected to hold hearings in the aftermath of the fatal crashes. Boeing did not immediately comment Wednesday.
Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who piloted a flight to land safely on the Hudson River in New York in 2009, said in an op-ed Tuesday the FAA has a ""too cozy"" relationship with industry.
""In too many cases, FAA employees who rightly called for stricter compliance with safety standards and more rigorous design choices have been overruled by FAA management, often under corporate or political pressure,"" he wrote.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) had hoped a new trial strategy focusing jurors on scientific evidence could stem a burgeoning tide of U.S. lawsuits over its glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup, but a second jury finding on Tuesday that the product caused cancer has narrowed the company's options, some legal experts said.
Bayer shares tumbled more than 12 percent on Wednesday after a unanimous jury in San Francisco federal court found Roundup to be a ""substantial factor"" in causing California resident Edwin Hardeman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
The jury decision was a blow to Bayer after the judge in the Hardeman case, at the company's request, had split the trial, severely limiting evidence plaintiffs could present in the first phase. Tuesday's defeat on terms considered advantageous to Bayer sets up the second phase to be even tougher and limits the grounds on which the company could appeal any final verdict, the experts said. 
""The fact that Bayer lost this trial despite it being set up in the most favorable way for them is a huge setback,"" said Thomas Rohback, a Connecticut-based defense lawyer. 
Bayer in a statement on Tuesday said it stood behind the safety of Roundup and was confident the evidence in the second trial phase would show that Monsanto's conduct was appropriate and the company not liable for Hardeman's cancer.
The company, which bought  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) last year, on Wednesday declined to comment beyond that statement.
Tuesday's finding did not address liability, which will be determined following the second trial phase that began on Wednesday. 
Bayer denies glyphosate or Roundup cause cancer. The German company faces more than 11,200 lawsuits over the popular weed killer. Last August, following the first Roundup trial, a California state court jury issued a $289 million verdict against the company.
Two weeks after that verdict, which was later reduced to $78 million and is being appealed, Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann reassured analysts that the company had a new legal strategy based on focusing jurors on the scientific evidence.
""Bayer and the joint litigation team are working to ensure that, going forward, this overwhelming science will get the full consideration it deserves,"" Baumann said in an Aug. 23 conference call.
A LOT AT STAKE
There is a lot at stake for Bayer, which acquired Roundup maker Monsanto last year for $63 billion. Though Bayer does not break out sales figures for Roundup, glyphosate is the world's most widely used weed killer, and Roundup is the leading brand. 
Bayer's new strategy was focused on keeping out plaintiffs' allegations that the company improperly influenced scientists, regulators and the public about the safety of Roundup. Bayer has denied it acted inappropriately and said in public statements following the August verdict that it thought the jury was inflamed by the claims of corporate misconduct. 
Vince Chhabria, the San Francisco federal judge overseeing the Hardeman case, agreed with the company's argument that such evidence was a ""distraction"" from the scientific question of whether glyphosate causes cancer. He agreed to split the trial in a January order.
Had Bayer had won the first phase, there would have been no second phase looking at company liability. Now that it has lost, almost all of the previously excluded evidence can be presented to the jury. 
Plaintiffs' lawyers hit Bayer with those allegations in their opening statements for the second phase on Wednesday. Aimee Wagstaff, one of Hardeman's lawyers, said Monsanto influenced the science around Roundup through its ""cozy"" relationship with regulators. 
Bayer could convince the jury in the second phase that, despite their finding that Roundup played a substantial role in Hardeman's cancer, the company was not liable. Experts said that was unlikely.
""They could present evidence of how careful they were in developing Roundup, but that's an uphill battle given that the scientific evidence was their strongest argument,"" said Alexandra Lahav, a law professor at the University of Connecticut.
A lawyer for Bayer on Wednesday argued that Bayer could not be held liable because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other regulators worldwide, approved Roundup without a cancer warning.
If the Hardeman trial had not been split and a final verdict went against Bayer, the company might have been able to appeal any damages award to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals by claiming the jury had been improperly swayed by inflammatory evidence, said Lori Jarvis, a Virginia-based mass tort defense lawyer. That argument will now be difficult to make.
""It would not be surprising at all for the 9th Circuit to uphold what the jury did in this case, particularly given the great effort Chhabria put into creating a level playing field for Monsanto,"" Jarvis said. 
Some lawyers said Bayer could still argue on appeal that plaintiffs' experts and their scientific evidence were insufficient and statistically invalid and should not have been admitted at trial. But they noted the 9th Circuit, which oversees the San Francisco federal court, has generally been permissive in allowing expert testimony. 
However, experts said it was probably too soon to write off Bayer's legal strategy, noting future Roundup cases could result in different outcomes. 

""It's a relatively early phase in this litigation as a whole and we just need to see more trials to understand Bayer's liability,"" said Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Los Angeles-based Loyola Law School.

PERGAMINO, Argentina/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Francisco Santillan, 55, a grains farmer from the heart of Argentina's soybean country, has two things on his mind: the rains and twists and turns in a bitter trade war between the United States and China that has hurt prices.
The weather-worn farmer, who rides a Harley-Davidson around the 4,500 hectares of farmland he manages, is expecting a bumper soybean crop when he begins harvesting this month, but he and his neighbors are holding off from sealing deals with buyers in the hope a trade war breakthrough will bolster prices. 
The United States and China, the world's top soybean producer and importer respectively, have slapped import duties on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of each other's products in their dispute. Tariffs made U.S. soybeans too expensive so Beijing stopped buying them, resulting in a glut that has hit soybean contracts in Chicago, the reference price for the global trade.
Trump said on Wednesday that a trade deal with Beijing was coming along nicely, with U.S. negotiators poised to head to China next week for another round of talks. Negotiations to resolve the dispute have been turbulent - Trump also said on Wednesday tariffs would remain in place for a long time and last week that he was in no rush to reach a deal. 
Benchmark Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures are hovering near $9 per bushel, only about 90 cents above decade lows posted in September.
""I am waiting for a better price,"" said Santillan, one of a group of farmers who spoke to Reuters among fields of green, knee-high soy plants in the country's fertile Pampas, where the ground was damp from heavy rains.
""The season is coming along very well. The harvest will be above 55 million tonnes and that will have a huge impact on the economy,"" Santillan said. ""But with news about the U.S.-China trade war determining Chicago reference prices, rather than supply and demand, it's like we are flying without instruments.""
CASH CROP
Much in Argentina, the world's No. 3 soybean producer and the top exporter of soyoil and the soymeal livestock feed that is fuelling Asia's shift in diet from rice to pork and poultry, hangs on the soy crop.
A severe drought last year dragged the economy into recession, while bumper tax revenues this year could help support government spending and prop up President Mauricio Macri's bid for re-election.
Delayed sales could hamper that. Just 16.2 percent of this season's expected crop was sold by early March versus 30.5 percent at the same point a year earlier, government data show.
The uncertainty over prices – and the delays to deals – could also rattle the global trade as major buyers look to lock in supply, namely Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co.
The ""ABCD"" quartet, which dominates global grain trade, rely on a steady flow of grain to turn a profit in a typically thin-margin business. Farmers' reluctance to sell at low prices has stung the grains merchants recently, particularly Bunge, which blamed limited farmer selling in Brazil for earnings misses last year.
Bunge's acting Chief Executive Gregory Heckman called Argentina ""one of the larger wild cards"" for the firm's oilseeds business in 2019, and said the firm anticipated farmers would hold more of their soybeans as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations.
""Soybean sales are happening slower this season than at any point over the last 10 years,"" said a Buenos Aires-based grains broker. ""Farmers are saying 'I don't like the price and I don't need the money now because I was able to make cash with wheat and corn. So I'll wait'.""
The uncertainty for the soy harvest comes at a complex time for President Macri too, who is battling to revive the economy while fending of challenges from political rivals ahead of national elections in October.
""For Argentina, the trade war between the United States and China is piling uncertainty on a country that is already full of uncertainty,"" said Jorge Bianciotto, who manages a 2,300-hectare farm called La Lucila in Pergamino.
""This generates risks in terms of next year's planting and investment decisions.""
His neighbor, Juan Girado, who manages a 500-hectare plantation, shared his concern.

""When they say the conflict is likely to end, prices rise. When the conflict looks like it's deepening, prices fall,"" he said. ""So with a big crop on the way, and with prices as low as they are, it would be good for us for the trade war to end.""

734,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 05:09PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Reverses Fed-Induced Gains as Financials Slump,"Investing.com - The Dow ended lower as it struggled to hold gains after the Fed's unchanged rate decision and strong signal not to expect many interest-rate hikes for a while.
Stocks were also held back by trade concerns and a slump in financials.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.55%, the S&P 500 lost 0.29%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a gain of 0.07%. The Dow jumped 137 points in six minutes after the Fed announcement, even briefly moving into the black on the day. But the gains were soon pared back.
The Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut its outlook on rate hikes, signaling no further tightening would be appropriate for the current year amid a slowdown in economic growth.
""In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes,"" the Fed said in a statement.
As rate hikes appear to be nearing their end, the Fed also said it will begin in May to reduce the amount of proceeds -- received from securities on its balance sheet -- it allows to roll off each month and will halt the program in September.
The Fed has been allowing as much as $50 billion a month of maturing securities to roll off its balance sheet, which peaked at roughly $4.5 trillion in Jan. 2015, but has now narrowed to about $4 trillion.
""The FOMC more than reinforced market expectations of an extended pause, if not possible end, to the tightening cycle,"" BMO said in a note.
The Fed's dovish monetary policy sent government bond yields tumbling, pressuring financials, mostly banks. Falling government bond yields stifle banks' ability to generate net interest.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) ended the day nursing steep losses.
The rate-sensitive United States 2-Year yield fell nearly 3%.
The Fed's policy decision arrived on the heels of a gloomy update from President Donald Trump on trade.
""We're not talking about removing (tariffs), we're talking about leaving them for a substantial period of time because we have to make sure that if we do the deal with China that China lives by the deal,"" Trump told reporters.
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.
In tech, FANG stocks rallied, led by a surge in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), up 4.6%.
On the corporate earnings front, there was little to cheer as FedEx (NYSE:FDX) fell 3.5% after the global air-freight delivery company reported tepid guidance.
In post-market earnings news, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) fell modestly after reporting mixed quarterly results with a beat on the bottom line but a miss on the top line. In the run-up to the chipmaker's quarterly earnings, some were concerned falling memory demand would materially weigh on performance.
Micron is up about 27% year to date and has played a big role in helping the broader semiconductor sector rack up gains of more than 20% so far this year.

735,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 04:54PM ET</span>",U.S. jury hears more evidence as second phase of Roundup cancer trial begins,"By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A lawyer for a man who sued  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) unit  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) after developing cancer on Wednesday told a jury about the company's alleged efforts to influence scientists and regulators, a day after the jury found Bayer's glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup to have caused the man's disease.
The jury in San Francisco federal court on Tuesday found Roundup to be a ""substantial factor"" in causing California resident Edwin Hardeman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but did not find Bayer liable.
Liability and potential damages will now be decided by the same jury in a second trial phase that began on Wednesday after the initial phase focused on scientific evidence alone.
Aimee Wagstaff, one of Hardeman's lawyers, said Monsanto influenced the science around Roundup through its close links to regulators, including a ""cozy"" relationship with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has not required a cancer risk warning for the weed killer.
Wagstaff also claimed Monsanto ghost-wrote scientific studies to influence regulatory reviews.
Bayer denies allegations that Roundup or glyphosate cause cancer, saying decades of independent scientific studies have shown the chemical, one of the most widely used weed killers, to be safe for human use.
But the company's share price fell more than 12 percent on Wednesday after Tuesday's jury decision, later recovering slightly. Shares closed down 9.6 percent at 63 euros ($71.53).
The trial, which began on Feb. 25, is also a test case for a future litigation. More than 760 of the 11,200 Roundup cases nationwide are consolidated in the federal court in San Francisco that is hearing Hardeman's case.
Hardeman's case marks the second U.S. Roundup trial after a jury in a similar case in August awarded $289 million in damages. That award was later reduced to $78 million and is on appeal.
Bayer in a statement on Tuesday said it was disappointed with the jury's decision.
""We are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto's conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman's cancer,"" the company said.
During the second trial phase, the jury will be asked to decide whether Roundup was defectively designed by failing to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect, and whether Bayer failed to warn consumers of potential health risks.
Bayer in response can introduce evidence of regulatory assessments concluding glyphosate to be safe.
The U.S. EPA, the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators have found that glyphosate is not likely carcinogenic to humans. The World Health Organization's cancer arm in 2015 reached a different conclusion, classifying glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" 
Brian Stekloff, a lawyer for Bayer, in his opening statement on Wednesday said Wagstaff had presented the jury with ""cherry-picked evidence"" and did not tell the whole story.
""It's not just regulators,"" Stekloff said. ""It's also other groups of scientists that have found no carcinogicity.""

736,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Brazil's new status would not affect prior ag commitments: WTO chief,"By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's agreement with the United States to forgo special treatment by the World Trade Organization (WTO) would apply only to future negotiations within the multilateral trade body, Director General Roberto Azevedo said on Wednesday.
For example, Brazil's self-defined status as a ""developing"" country has allowed it to subsidize up to 10 percent of its agricultural output, whereas the limit for ""developed"" nations is 5 percent, Azevedo said.
That would not change with Brazil's potential new status, he said at a foreign trade seminar, because the plan to forgo the special WTO status would not affect prior agreements.
After a White House meeting on Tuesday, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and U.S. President Donald Trump said in a joint statement that Brazil had agreed to begin a process to relinquish special and differential treatment in WTO negotiations, in line with a U.S. proposal. In return, the United States would back Brazil's bid to become a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a forum for rich nations.
""The proposal would only concern future negotiations and whether countries would benefit or request differentiated treatment in WTO talks,"" Azevedo said.
Azevedo said the United States has proposed new criteria to differentiate among a range of countries in the ""developing"" category, which includes major economies such as Brazil and China along with smaller nations such as Guatemala and Honduras.

According to Azevedo, such criteria could include whether a country is a member of the OECD or the G20 group of nations, and whether its participation in total global trade exceeds 0.5 percent.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 04:43PM ET</span>",Boeing faces growing pressure in Washington over 737 MAX crashes,"By Maggie Fick and Cindy Silviana
ADDIS ABABA/JAKARTA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The world's biggest planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) faced growing obstacles on Wednesday to returning its grounded 737 MAX fleet to the skies, while details emerged of an Indonesian crash with potential similarities to the Ethiopian disaster.
Aviation experts suspect an automated system, meant to stop stalling by dipping the nose, may be involved in both cases, with pilots struggling to override it as their jets plunged downwards. 
But they stress neither investigation is complete and crew actions and training will also be closely scrutinised.
The March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash has shaken the global aviation industry and cast a shadow over the flagship Boeing model intended to be a standard for decades to come, given parallels with the Lion Air calamity off Jakarta in October. The two crashes killed 346 people in all.
On Wednesday, the Seattle Times, citing unidentified sources familiar with the matter, reported the FBI was joining the criminal investigation into the MAX's certification. The U.S. Justice Department is looking at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) oversight of Boeing, a person briefed on the matter said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Pentagon Inspector General said on Wednesday it would investigate a complaint that Acting United States Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, violated ethical rules by allegedly promoting Boeing while in office.
Chicago-headquartered Boeing has promised a swift update of automatic flight software, but regulators in Europe and Canada want to be sure of the jet's safety themselves, rather than rely on U.S. vetting. 
As Ethiopian investigators pored over black box data from their crash, sources with knowledge of the doomed Lion Air cockpit voice recorder revealed how pilots scoured a manual in a losing battle to figure out why they were hurtling down to sea.
Investigators examining the Indonesian crash want to know how a computer ordered the plane to dive in response to data from a faulty sensor and whether pilots had enough training to respond appropriately to the emergency.
Communications showed that in the final moments, the captain tried in vain to find the right procedure in the handbook, while the first officer was unable to control the plane. 
""It is like a test where there are 100 questions and when the time is up you have only answered 75,"" said one of the sources with knowledge of the cockpit recording that has not been made public. ""So you panic. It is a time-out condition.""
At the end, the sources told Reuters, the Indian-born captain, 31, was quiet, while the Indonesian officer, 41, said ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"") - an Arabic phrase to express excitement, shock, praise or distress. The plane then hit water. 
U.S. 'CREDIBILITY DAMAGED'
Boeing has said there was a documented procedure to handle the problem, which crew are supposed to memorise. 
A different crew on the same plane the evening before had the same situation but solved it after running through three checklists, though they did not pass on that information to the doomed Indonesian crew, according to a preliminary report by investigators released in November.
Shifting away from previous reliance on FAA vetting, Canada and the European Union will now seek their own guarantees of the MAX planes' safety, complicating Boeing's hopes to get them flying again.
Regulators want to be absolutely sure of Boeing's new automated control system, known as MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System), and that pilots are fully prepared to handle it. It is meant to prevent a loss of lift which can cause an aerodynamic stall and send the plane downwards in an uncontrolled way. 
Facing such high-profile scrutiny, Boeing, one of the United States' most prestigious exporters, reshuffled executives in its commercial airplanes unit to focus on the crash fallout.
VOICE RECORDINGS
The FAA said its ""robust processes"" and ""full collaboration with the aviation community"" were key to safety worldwide.
In Ethiopia, which is leading the investigation of the cause of the crash, experts were poring over the in-flight recording of the captain and first officer.
As with the Indonesia flight, they radioed about control problems shortly after take-off and sought to turn back, struggling to get their plane on track before it hit a field. However, experts emphasise every accident is a unique chain of human and technical factors.
Ethiopia's civil aviation head Wosenyeleh Hunegnaw told Reuters the investigation was proceeding as quickly as possible within international standards. ""I'm 100 percent sure the report will be issued within 30 days,"" he said. 
For now, more than 350 MAX aircraft are grounded around the world, and deliveries of nearly 5,000 more - worth more than $500 billion - are on hold. 
Development of the 737 MAX, which offers savings of about 15 percent on fuel, began in 2011 after the successful launch by its main rival of the Airbus A320neo. The 737 MAX entered service in 2017.

While some airlines are worried about the impact on profits, they have been able to keep services going, swapping MAX planes for others, or using partner carriers.

738,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 04:41PM ET</span>",Banks stifle Wall Street rally following dovish Fed statement,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow ended lower on Wednesday as interest rate-sensitive financial stocks dragged down the indexes after the U.S. Federal Reserve affirmed a dovish monetary policy stance.
While all three major U.S. stock indexes briefly reversed earlier losses following the Fed statement, only the Nasdaq ended the session in positive territory.
""The first reaction to a Fed statement is always the wrong reaction,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. ""Hey great, the ambulance got here, oh wait – we need an ambulance. The Fed to the rescue – oh wait we need the Fed to rescue us?"" 
At the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting, the central bank indicated it sees no further rate hikes this year, and released details of a plan to end the monthly reduction of its balance sheet.
But while the indexes briefly turned positive after the statement's release, banks, which are sensitive to interest rates, put a damper on the rally.
The financial sector sold off sharply in the last hour of trading, ending the session down 2.1 percent.
R.J. Grant head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York saw ""a heavy pickup in selling in the banks especially,"" as the yield curve flattened.  
The stock market has rallied since the beginning of the year, when Fed chair John Powell said the Fed would take a ""patient"" approach to monetary policy.
Powell affirmed that sentiment at a press conference following the release, citing mixed economic data and risks associated with Brexit and trade negotiations as reasons for caution.
Indeed, Federal funds futures now see nearly even chances that the central bank will cut interest rates in early 2020.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 141.71 points, or 0.55 percent, to 25,745.67, the S&P 500 lost 8.34 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,824.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.02 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,728.97.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, six ended the session in negative territory.
Shares of  Fedex Corp  dropped 3.5 percent after the global package delivery company cut its 2019 profit forecast, citing slowing global trade growth.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) weighed on the Dow Jones Transport Index, a closely-watched gauge of economic health, pulling the index down 1.3 percent.
Rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) was also down, falling 2.2 percent.
 General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS). rose 2.2 percent after the packaged food company reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and boosted its full-year forecast.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.64-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 46 new highs and 42 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.76 billion shares, compared to the 7.53 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Last week Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, filed a complaint with the Inspector General saying that Shanahan had appeared to violate the ethical rules by ""promoting Boeing in the scope of his official duties at the Department of Defense (DOD) and disparaging the company's competitors to his subordinates.""
""The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General has decided to investigate complaints we recently received that Acting Secretary Patrick Shanahan allegedly took actions to promote his former employer, Boeing, and disparage its competitors,"" said Dwrena Allen, a spokeswoman for the Inspector General.
Prior to taking over as acting Pentagon chief earlier this year, he was the deputy defense secretary. 
Shanahan joined Boeing in 1986 and spent more than three decades there, working on the 737 and 787 Dreamliner. He was also the president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems and worked on the Apache (NYSE:APA), Chinook and Osprey military aircraft. 
""Acting Secretary Shanahan has at all times remained
committed to upholding his ethics agreement filed with the DoD,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Joe Buccino, a Pentagon spokesman. 
""This agreement ensures any matters pertaining to Boeing are handled by appropriate officials within the Pentagon to eliminate any perceived or actual conflict of interest issue with Boeing,"" Buccino said. 

During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last week, Shanahan said he would support an investigation by the Inspector General.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday put in jeopardy an $8.5 million settlement Google made with users to resolve a class action lawsuit accusing it of violating their privacy by sharing users' search queries with other websites.
The justices, in an unsigned opinion, threw out a ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that had upheld the settlement, directing it to take a fresh look at whether the plaintiffs had the legal standing necessary to sue and whether they were even harmed by the search engine operator.
Google, part of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., was accused in the lawsuit of violating a 1986 law governing the privacy of stored electronic communications.
Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, saying the increasingly common type of settlement at the heart of the case was ""unfair and unreasonable"" and should not have been approved by the 9th Circuit.
These so-called ""cy pres"" (pronounced ""see pray"") settlements are used in class action cases when it might be impractical to carve up low-value individual damages among a large number of plaintiffs. In endorsing the Google settlement in 2017, the 9th Circuit said each of the 129 million U.S. Google users who theoretically could have claimed part of it would have received ""a paltry 4 cents in recovery.""
Proponents have said these settlements can put otherwise negligible awards per person to good use by benefiting groups that work for the public good or support underfunded entities. Critics have said they encourage frivolous lawsuits and excessive fees going to plaintiffs' lawyers. 
Google agreed in the settlement to disclose on its website how users' search terms are shared but was not required to change its behavior. The three main plaintiffs received $5,000 each for representing the class. Their attorneys received about $2.1 million.
Under the settlement, much of the rest of the money would go to organizations or projects that promote internet privacy, including at Stanford University and AARP, a lobbying group for older Americans, but nothing to the millions of Google users who the plaintiffs were to have represented in the class action.
A Google representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. 
The settlement was challenged by attorneys including Ted Frank of the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute, which advocates against what it considers abusive class action procedures. 
Following the ruling, Frank said he expects the lower courts to again find that the plaintiffs may sue and that the issue will soon be back before the high court. ""The decision simply delays the day of reckoning for this unfair practice,"" Frank said.
The case began when a California resident named Paloma Gaos filed a proposed class action lawsuit in 2010 in San Jose federal court. 
The plaintiffs said that their privacy was violated when their search terms were disseminated by Google to other sites. One searched for her own name, another for financial and health data, and a third for information related to his divorce proceedings.

The Supreme Court may soon get another opportunity to clarify what is needed for plaintiffs to achieve the legal standing necessary to sue. The justices are considering whether to hear a pending appeal by online shoe retailer Zappos, a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), over whether customers are entitled to sue over a 2012 data breach.

746,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 03:42PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lion Air pilots scoured handbook in minutes before crash - sources,"By Cindy Silviana, Jamie Freed and Tim Hepher
JAKARTA/SINGAPORE/PARIS (Reuters) - The pilots of a doomed Lion Air Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX scrambled through a handbook to understand why the jet was lurching downwards in the final minutes before it hit the water killing all 189 people on board, three people with knowledge of the cockpit voice recorder contents said. 
The investigation into the crash last October has taken on new relevance as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other regulators grounded the model last week after a second deadly accident in Ethiopia. 
Investigators examining the Indonesian crash are considering how a computer ordered the plane to dive in response to data from a faulty sensor and whether the pilots had enough training to respond appropriately to the emergency, among other factors.
Following the second fatal accident, U.S. authorities are reviewing whether enough was done to ensure the plane was safe to fly, while attention has also focused on the training of the Lion Air crew and whether aeroplane manuals are clear enough.
It is the first time the voice recorder contents from the Lion Air flight have been made public. The three sources discussed them on condition of anonymity.
Reuters did not have access to the recording or transcript.
A Lion Air spokesman said all data and information had been given to investigators and declined to comment further.
""FLIGHT CONTROL PROBLEM""
The captain was at the controls of Lion Air flight JT610 when the nearly new jet took off from Jakarta, and the first officer was handling the radio, according to a preliminary report issued in November.
Just two minutes into the flight, the first officer reported a ""flight control problem"" to air traffic control and said the pilots intended to maintain an altitude of 5,000 feet, the November report said.
The first officer did not specify the problem, but one source said airspeed was mentioned on the cockpit voice recording, and a second source said an indicator showed a problem on the captain's display but not the first officer's.
The captain asked the first officer to check the quick reference handbook, which contains checklists for abnormal events, the first source said. 
For the next nine minutes, the jet warned pilots it was in a stall and pushed the nose down in response, the report showed. A stall is when the airflow over a plane's wings is too weak to generate lift and keep it flying.
The captain fought to climb, but the computer, still incorrectly sensing a stall, continued to push the nose down using the plane's trim system. Normally, trim adjusts an aircraft's control surfaces to ensure it flies straight and level.
""They didn't seem to know the trim was moving down,"" the third source said. ""They thought only about airspeed and altitude. That was the only thing they talked about.""
 Boeing Co  declined to comment on Wednesday because the investigation was ongoing.
REGULATORY SCRUTINY
The U.S. Transportation Department's inspector-general now plans to audit the FAA's certification of the Boeing 737 MAX, while European and Canadian regulators say they want to make up their own minds whether a promised software upgrade is adequate. 
The manufacturer has said that to handle the situation there is a documented procedure that must be memorized. A different crew on the same plane the evening before encountered the same problem but solved it after running through three checklists, according to the November report.
But they did not pass on all of the information about the problems they encountered to the next crew, the report said.
The pilots of JT610 remained calm for most of the flight, the three sources said. Near the end, the captain asked the first officer to fly while he checked the manual for a solution.
About one minute before the plane disappeared from radar, the captain asked air traffic control to clear other traffic below 3,000 feet and requested an altitude of ""five thou"", or 5,000 feet, which was approved, the preliminary report said.
As the 31-year-old captain tried in vain to find the right procedure in the handbook, the 41-year-old first officer was unable to control the plane, two of the sources said.
The flight data recorder shows the final control column inputs from the first officer were weaker than the ones made earlier by the captain. 
""It is like a test where there are 100 questions and when the time is up you have only answered 75,"" the third source said. ""So you panic. It is a time-out condition.""
The Indian-born captain was silent at the end, all three sources said, while the Indonesian first officer said ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is greatest"", a common Arabic phrase in the majority-Muslim country that can be used to express excitement, shock, praise or distress.
The plane then hit the water, killing everyone on board.
CHANGES MADE
French air accident investigation agency BEA said on Tuesday the flight data recorder in the Ethiopian crash that killed 157 people showed ""clear similarities"" to the Lion Air disaster. Since the Lion Air crash, Boeing has been pursuing a software upgrade to change how much authority is given to the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, a new anti-stall system developed for the 737 MAX.
Some U.S. pilots have complained they were unaware of the new system, which is mentioned in the index of the aircraft's full manual but not the text, according to a version seen by Reuters. Airlines have some discretion to customize the manuals.
The cause of the Lion Air crash has not been determined, but the preliminary report mentioned the Boeing system, a faulty, recently replaced sensor and the airline's maintenance and training.
On the same aircraft the evening before the crash, a captain at Lion Air's full-service sister carrier, Batik Air, was riding along in the cockpit and solved the similar flight control problems, two of the sources said. His presence on that flight, first reported by Bloomberg, was not disclosed in the preliminary report.
The report also did not include data from the cockpit voice recorder, which was not recovered from the ocean floor until January. 
Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesian investigation agency KNKT, said last week the report could be released in July or August as authorities attempted to speed up the inquiry in the wake of the Ethiopian crash.

On Wednesday, he declined to comment on the cockpit voice recorder contents, saying they had not been made public.

752,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 02:30PM ET</span>",Croatia weighs budgetary costs for saving troubled dock,"ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia will decide in coming days whether to place troubled shipbuilder Uljanik into bankruptcy or try to restructure the business at a cost to the state of around one billion euros, a top official said on Wednesday. 
Last month Uljanik, the country's largest shipbuilder, chose local rival Brodosplit as a strategic partner to restructure its operations, with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri acting as an adviser in the process.
""The restructuring would cost us 1.009 billion euros ($1.15 billion), while bankruptcy would cost us 557 million euros,"" Branko Bacic, a leading official of the biggest party in the ruling coalition, the conservative HDZ, said after a meeting of the ruling conservative-liberal coalition.
""Now we know the figures, but given the significance of the issue not just for Uljanik, but for our shipbuilding industry as a whole, we took a few days more for a decision,"" he said. 
Uljanik, which owns two shipyards in the northern Adriatic cities of Pula and Rijeka and is 25 percent owned by the state, has been working to stave off bankruptcy due to liquidity problems that began in 2017. Workers staged strikes twice last year over unpaid wages.
The latest difficulties for the government arose when it became clear that restructuring costs might reach two percent of the country's gross domestic product. 
Some analysts believe that shipbuilding no longer holds strategic importance for Croatia, meaning further state funding to save the dock would be the wrong economic choice.
Economy Minister Darko Horvat said on Wednesday that despite the lower initial cost of bankruptcy, it was debatable which option was more favorable in the long run.
The government has already paid out 3.1 billion kuna ($474.57 million) on the basis of state guarantees extended in previous years to help Uljanik stay afloat, driving the general budget into deficit in 2018. 
Sound public finances and lower public debt, which is currently just below 75 percent of gross domestic product, are important to Croatia's drive to adopt the euro in the next four to five years.
Croatia's once-prosperous shipbuilding industry has struggled since the collapse of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, losing business to competitors, particularly in South Korea and other Asian nations. 

Croatia has spent more than 33 billion kuna in the past 25 years to save and then sell state-owned shipyards, but those efforts yielded little success.

GOTHENBURG (Reuters) - Volvo Cars expects its margins on electric cars to match those of vehicles with combustion engines by 2025, the head of the Chinese-owned Swedish carmaker told Reuters.
Global automakers are planning a $300 billion surge in spending on electric vehicle technology over the next five to 10 years but have admitted that higher component costs and limited take-up in initial years will hit margins.
Volvo is investing about 5 percent of its annual revenue, equating to a little more than $1 billion a year, in building driverless and electric cars and has promised to deliver five fully electric cars to market in the next few years. 
It showcased the first less than a month ago, made by its luxury performance brand Polestar to rival to Tesla's Model 3. It also plans to launch a Volvo-branded electric compact SUV this year in the company's push to derive 50 percent of its sales from fully electric cars by 2025.
""It's very difficult to say if we're going to have the same margins in 2025 as we had in 2015 ... because electric cars are very expensive,"" Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters on the sidelines of a safety showcase by the company in Gothenburg. 
""But I would be absolute sure we will have the same margins with electric cars as we will with conventional combustion cars in 2025.""

Samuelsson said the convergence would be helped by reducing costs for components such as batteries and declining margins on conventional cars.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 02:24PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank merger talks heighten uncertainty for U.S. staff,"By Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG's merger talks with  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) have put its 10,000 U.S. workers on edge, three employees told Reuters, with some concerned a deal could pressure Deutsche to further shrink or even dispose of its U.S. businesses. 
The future of the bank's U.S. trading and investment banking presence had already been in question, with some shareholders calling for further cuts on top of ones announced last year, and speculation has intensified following confirmation of the merger talks on Sunday.
The German government, which has a 15 percent stake in Commerzbank, is expected to retain a stake in the combined business if a deal materializes. Some employees fear that could pressure the bank to focus on its home market.
Both banks have cautioned that the outcome of the talks remains uncertain, and the process could drag on for months. In the meantime key employees could decamp to rival Wall Street banks and hedge funds, further weakening a business that has underperformed for years. Several executives have left the bank's U.S. operations in recent months. 
""We don't know what's going on. Everything is up in the air,"" said one senior employee within the bank's U.S. equity sales business, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Chief Executive Christian Sewing reiterated in a memo to staff on Sunday that Deutsche aimed to remain a ""global bank with a strong capital markets business,"" and a source familiar with the matter said the merger would not change the bank's commitment to a strong U.S. presence.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Wednesday.
German finance minister Olaf Scholz, reportedly a proponent of the merger, has previously stressed the need for Germany's banking sector to support German companies who want to go abroad to export.
After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street, even as European rivals like  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG made big cuts to U.S. investment banking operations.
Deutsche Bank's U.S. business has brought in around half of revenue for its overall investment banking unit, which includes corporate and investment banking as well as trading, even though it came with a relatively high cost of capital.
However, encumbered by litigation and regulatory investigations into past misconduct, the business has struggled to compete with Wall Street rivals.
Deutsche had said last May that it would reduce its global headcount to well below 90,000 from 97,000. That included a 25 percent cut in equities sales and trading jobs, a significant number of which were in New York, where it has lagged rivals.
Cutting more jobs in the United States would not provoke the same political pushback that the two banks would face if they axe jobs in Germany, banking analysts say.
PAY CONCERNS
Even if Deutsche Bank keeps its U.S. operations largely intact following a Commerzbank deal, some staff fear pay and bonuses would decline because the combined entity would face a backlash from German taxpayers if its remuneration was seen as excessive.
Commerzbank, which is focused on personal and commercial lending, typically pays its staff less than Deutsche Bank. If the German government were to retain a stake in a combined entity, lawmakers would likely argue that it should keep a tight rein on pay.
Traders at Deutsche Bank's U.S. equities business have already felt a squeeze, with some receiving substantially smaller bonuses for 2018, the sources said.
That has contributed to a decline in morale, which has been exacerbated by the departure of senior staff including Brad Kurtzman, co-head of equities trading in the Americas, who is leaving at the end of this month, the sources said. 
A recent focus on recruiting college graduates, held up by senior management as an affirmation of the bank's long-term commitment to the trading division, has done little to quell concern, they added.
One employee, who asked not to be named, said further defections are considered likely as staff look to pre-empt further cuts should the Commerzbank deal go through.

Investing.com - Lumber Liquidators hopes it finally has its China problem resolved.
Investors' reaction: maybe.
Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) shares were up 2.6% Wednesday afternoon and briefly topped $10. Shares of the flooring retailer had fallen to a 52-week low of $8.81 on Monday after discussing the details of $33 million in fines and disgorgements agreed to for allegedly deceiving investors about formaldehyde in laminated flooring imported from China. The discussion came after reporting a loss in its fourth quarter.
It also agreed to settle a separate issue on the quality of bamboo flooring for an additional $14 million. A customer sued, claiming the flooring didn't live up to expectations.
There is no question the stock has suffered from the bad publicity. In November 2013, the shares peaked at $104.70 in a great year for stocks, with the S&P 500 up 29.6%.
Lumber Liquidators shares began to get truly pummeled starting with a 2015 ""60 Minutes"" investigation that alleged the company was buying laminated wood flooring from Chinese suppliers that contained unacceptably high levels of formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. Worse, the company denied it was happening.
And the drubbing was pretty much constant until, maybe, Monday's $8.81. Sales suffered as well, and the company showed losses for four-straight years. Fourth-quarter results showed a loss of $1.99 a share on revenue of $268.9 million. Most of the loss was related to settling the legal issues, which included criminal charges. Revenue was up nearly 3.5% from a year ago.
The pressures of the problem hurt cash flow in the last few years. But CEO Dennis Knowles said on Monday's analyst call that it secured enough bank credit to be able to fund its operations and fund the settlements.
Knowles also said that the company has upgraded its management to prevent another China-like episode. It's also trying to find new flooring sources. About 47% of flooring imports last year came from China and the 10% tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration last year have cut into profits as well.
The company, which operates 413 stores in 47 states and Canada, sees modest growth in sales in 2019, partly as customers digest the settlements. Plus, the company saw sales soften in the latter half of 2918 and expects that additional moderation in 2019. The company's goal is to reach 500 stores.
The company doesn't get much love from the analysts who follow it. None rate the stock a buy, although none see it as a sell. The consensus, according to Investing.com polling, is for the stock to move up to $11.44 over the next 12 months, a 15.3% gain.
Still, the stock still has a long way to go."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's big public companies will face a grilling by asset managers over their track record on diversity, excessive pension payouts to bosses and poor quality audits when they hold annual shareholder meetings over the coming weeks.
A committee of 15 asset managers at the Investment Association has picked the three issues that annoy investors the most to try to increase pressure for change.
It is the first time the IA has specifically set out what changes it wants to see in the annual general meeting season. It also marks a step-up in its campaigning efforts as Britain's corporate governance and stewardship rules are increasingly tightened by policymakers.
""These are three key things which are very topical at the moment and... we want to see significant change on going forward,"" Andrew Ninian, director of stewardship at the IA, said.
""And having a concerted effort... we think that we can get through significant change in this AGM season.""
Among the companies making up the IA's Corporate Governance and Engagement Committee are Britain's biggest asset manager Legal & General Investment Management, part of insurer Legal & General, and  Schroders  (LON:SDR).
The IA said if no action is taken ahead of each company's AGM, it will warn members of any specific concerns through its IVIS voting advisory service, which uses color codes blue, amber and red to alert members to the seriousness of the issue.
Boardroom diversity remains at the top of many asset managers' list of concerns and has been increasingly under the spotlight amid efforts to ensure women make up at least a third of boards and leadership teams at FTSE 350 companies by 2020.
The IA is particularly concerned about companies where it considers diversity is treated in a tokenistic way. Last week the IA wrote to the boards of 69 companies - a fifth of the FTSE 350 - which it said were lagging in their diversity efforts.
Bumper pension payouts received by some company bosses are also a pressing issue after changes to the UK's Corporate Governance Code in 2018 that said they should be aligned with the pension contributions given to a majority of the workforce.
From March 1, the IA said it would issue a 'red top' alert on any company that has given new appointees a pension rate higher than that of the majority of the workforce. Existing directors with more than a 25 percent contribution will be amber-topped.
The pressure to curb excessive pensions for bosses has already started to show results. Britain's biggest bank HSBC has announced plans to cut executive pensions from 30 percent to 10 percent after investors raised concerns.
""The main thing for us on the AGM season is fairness,"" Mirza Baig, Global Head of Governance at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors. ""There is a broad sense of awareness about unequal opportunities and pay, and that is feeding through to the AGM ballots."" 
The IA said its members would also push for companies' audit committees to show more effectively how they ensured a quality audit was undertaken. This follows a series of high-profile audit and accounting snafus, most recently Metro Bank.
Additionally, while companies are required to give a view on their viability, too often the view is on a short time frame such as three years which does not factor in longer-term risks.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 01:19PM ET</span>",Google fined $1.7 billion for search ad blocks in third EU sanction,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit Google was fined 1.49 billion euros ($1.7 billion) on Wednesday, its third large European Union antitrust penalty in two years marking the company's decade-long regulatory battle in Europe.
The EU antitrust chief, however, gave a cautious welcome to Google's measures to boost competition and give Android users a choice of browsers and search apps, suggesting the company's regulatory woes may be coming to an end.
The European Commission, which said the fine amounted to 1.29 percent of Google's turnover in 2018, said that the case focused on the company's illegal practises in search advertising brokering from 2006 to 2016.
""Today's decision is about how Google abused its dominance to stop websites using brokers other than the AdSense platform,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told a news conference.
She said its actions meant advertisers and website owners had less choice and likely faced higher prices that would then be passed on to consumers.
The case concerned websites, such as of newspaper or travel sites, with a search function that produces search results and search adverts. Google's AdSense for Search provided such search adverts. 
The misconduct included stopping publishers from placing any search adverts from competitors on their search results pages, forcing them to reserve the most profitable space on these pages for Google's adverts and a requirement to seek written approval from Google before making changes to how rival adverts were displayed.
THRIVING MARKETS
The AdSense advertising case was triggered by a complaint from  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 2010. Both companies subsequently dropped complaints against each other in 2016. 
Google said it was taking action to comply with EU orders in two previous cases, one of which concerned its Android mobile operating system that resulted in a record 4.34 billion euro fine last year while the shopping comparison case led to a 2.42 billion euro fine.
""We've always agreed that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone's interest. We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the Commission's concerns,"" Kent Walker, senior vice-president of global affairs, said in a statement.
""Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe,"" he added.
Vestager welcomed the move, saying: ""We see positive developments both in the shopping and Android case."".
Google's foe, the Initiative for a Competitive Online Marketplace, said regulators should stay vigilant.

""Competitors have withered or died. It's time for the EU and governments around the world to step in and address the underlying wrong,"" its chairman Michael Weber said in a statement.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",Volkswagen management and works council divided over restructuring plans,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen's supervisory board is set to meet on Friday to discuss the company's ambitious cost-reduction plans, Der Spiegel reported on Wednesday, citing company sources. 
The magazine said the extraordinary board meeting has been scheduled to mediate between management at Germany's biggest carmaker and the head of its works council, Bernd Osterloh, who is also a member of the supervisory board. 
A Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) spokesman said he did not know of any planned board session. 
A participant at a staff gathering on Wednesday told Reuters that Osterloh had said that unless the management offered concessions on planned job cuts there could be a confrontation that would ""paralyze the company for months"".
Volkswagen this month said it would shrink its workforce by up to 7,000, raise productivity and eke out 5.9 billion euros ($6.7 billion) in annual savings at its core VW brand by 2023 in an effort to raise operating margins to 6 percent.
Der Spiegel, which also referred to the staff meeting, reported that Osterloh demanded a jobs guarantee to 2029 and that the Wolfsburg-based carmaker restaffs all currently open positions. 
""I will tell Mr. Porsche the same thing this week,"" Osterloh was quoted as saying by the meeting participant who spoke to Reuters. 
Wolfgang Porsche is chairman of Porsche SE, the holding company that controls Volkswagen, and is a member of Volkswagen's supervisory board. Tensions had flared this month after he criticized what he described as rigid structures in Wolfsburg and demanded greater flexibility from VW’s workers to help Chief Executive Herbert Diess to overhaul the carmaker.
“We give job guarantees until 2025 or 2028 and have no idea what the competition in China will be unveiling in two years time,” Porsche said at the time.
Osterloh has retaliated by blaming management mistakes for high costs and low profitability at VW.

765,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 12:35PM ET</span>",'Golden cross' for stocks doesn't always glitter,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average triggered a technical signal on Tuesday that many investors believe could portend more gains for stocks in the short term, known as the golden cross. 
The chart pattern comes about when a short-term moving average moves above a longer-term moving average. Moving averages are popular trend indicators used by technical analysts. 
In the case of the Dow on Tuesday, the 50-day moving average crossed above the index's 200-day moving average, which is the most widely watched combination among technicians. Some analysts employ additional criteria in determining whether a cross is triggered, for example, if both moving averages are sloping upward, which the Dow's currently are.
Even with the Dow's slightly lower close on Tuesday on trade concerns, the 50-day managed to end the session above the 200-day moving average. 
Other major indexes, such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, have moved closer to a golden cross as stocks continue to rally off their late December lows, buoyed by a Federal Reserve pause in interest rate hikes and building investor optimism for a trade deal between the U.S. and China. 
""All signs are pointing towards continued good performance, and the golden cross just accentuates that because that is another positive story,"" said Ken Polcari, managing principal at Butcher Joseph Asset Management in New York. 
Polcari said the cross should not be looked at in a vacuum, however, and pointed to gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq that have lifted those indexes above their highs from early March as further evidence the market is strengthening.
""You have to look at it in the context of some of the other indicators,"" Polcari said. 
On Dec. 7, the S&P 500 triggered a bearish counterpart, known as a ""death cross,"" when the 50-day moving average fell below the 200-day. The benchmark index went down another nearly 11 percent before bottoming on Dec. 24. 
The Dow last triggered a golden cross on April 19, 2016 and closed out the year 9.5 percent higher from there. 
(GRAPHIC: Dow Golden Cross link - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ULiKEu)
Still, the golden cross is far from a bulletproof signal. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York, using a ""golden cross"" strategy yielded a lower return than the compound annual growth rates for the Dow and smallcap Russell 2000 index since 1990. 
The results were different for the S&P 500, however, with the ""golden cross"" strategy yielding returns similar to the index while also enabling investors to avoid major sell-offs and bouts of volatility. 
Since 2000, the biggest drop yearly using a cross strategy would be 6 percent versus 38 percent for the index. In addition, the strategy topped the performance of the index 55 percent of the time. 
(GRAPHIC: Dow triggers golden cross link - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HvPWNE).
As a result, Stovall thinks the strategy could be feasible for an investor depending on what their goal is. 

""In many ways (technical analysis) is an interpretive science. I think it is a good one, but not everybody interprets the pattern the same way,"" he said.

The meeting, attended by  BP  (LON:BP) CEO Robert Dudley, Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg and Vitol's Chairman Ian Taylor, among others, is a rare gathering in the Kremlin of some of the world's most influential energy players. 
Russia, one of the world's top oil producers and exporters, has been under Western sanctions since 2014, which include restrictions on some financial instruments and development of some types of energy resources by foreign firms. 
Putin, in opening remarks before the meeting was closed to reporters, said that Russia ""is doing all (that's) necessary so that foreign investors, our partners, friends feel themselves as comfortable as possible on the Russian market"". He did not elaborate.
Dudley, once the head of TNK-BP, a Russia-British joint venture bought by Rosneft in 2013 for $55 billion, last met Putin in February. BP now holds a 19.75 stake in Rosneft, whose CEO Igor Sechin was also present on Wednesday. 
Glasenberg and Taylor are rare visitors to the Kremlin, though they usually attend the economic forum in St Petersburg. 
Glencore has a wide range of interests in Russia from oil trading to aluminum and power assets, while Vitol is active in oil trading as well. Putin has invited all the company bosses to take part in an economic forum in St Petersburg, a 'Russian Davos', in June. 
The Kremlin meeting comes amid talk that U.S.companies could boycott Moscow's showcase forum in June following Russia's arrest of prominent U.S. investor Michael Calvey on embezzlement charges. Calvey denies the charges. 
The Kremlin called Wednesday's gathering a 'meeting with representatives of the UK business circles'. 
Russia-UK relations also turned frosty after Britain accused Moscow of the poisoning of a former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal - accusations Moscow denies. 
""As a group here we are grateful for the opportunity to participate in the effort in restoring trust and mutually beneficial relationships between our two countries,"" Dudley said in his opening remarks. 
Remarks by Glasenberg and Taylor were not made public.

768,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",Trade panel says U.S. producers harmed by structural steel imports,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission said on Wednesday that domestic producers were being harmed by imports of fabricated structural steel from Canada, China and Mexico, keeping alive an investigation that could lead to duties on the products.
The ITC's preliminary determination ensures that an anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation launched by the U.S. Commerce Department last month will move forward.
U.S. lawmakers, car companies and Canada and Mexico have strongly urged the Trump administration to drop U.S. national security tariffs on steel and aluminum imports after a deal announced last year to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The fabricated structural steel under investigation is used in major building projects, including bridges, office and residential buildings, parking decks and ports.
If the Commerce Department determines the imports are being dumped in the U.S. market at less than fair value, unfairly subsidized, or both, and if the ITC affirms its finding of harm, the United States will impose duties for an initial five years.
The department launched the trade case after receiving a petition from an industry trade group.
The United States imported $658.3 million worth of fabricated structural steel from Canada in 2017, $841.7 million worth from China, and $406.6 million from Mexico.
The Commerce Department alleges there are 44 subsidy programs for Canadian fabricated structural steel, including tax programs, grant programs, loan programs, export insurance programs, and equity programs. There are also 26 subsidy programs for China and 19 subsidy programs for Mexico, according to the agency.
Last month, a Canadian steel industry group said it would strongly oppose anti-dumping duties on certain steel imports from Canada. The Canadian Institute of Steel Construction said allegations “that these products from Canada are unfairly traded and cause injury to U.S. producers of fabricated steel products are baseless.”

770,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 11:58AM ET</span>","With 737 MAX grounded, airlines face daily scheduling challenges","By Tracy Rucinski and Allison Lampert
CHICAGO/MONTREAL (Reuters) - U.S. and Canadian airlines that fly the roughly 175-seat aircraft face a logistical challenge: which flights to cancel and which to cover with other planes following the global grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX jets.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and American Airlines Group Inc, the two largest MAX operators in the United States, said they have bolstered their reservation and operations teams to figure out how to spread flight cancellations across their networks, not just on MAX flights.
American Airlines, for example, had most of its 24 MAX jets flying in and out of Miami, where load factors have been full during the Spring Break season.
""We can't just cancel all of those flights, so the goal is to spread out the cancellations across our entire system to impact the least amount of customers,"" American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said.
This means that an American Airlines flight from Miami to the Caribbean initially scheduled on a 737 MAX may now fly on a 737-800 with a similar seat configuration, while that 737-800 flight is canceled.
""It's a challenge to explain to customers who weren't previously booked on a MAX why their flight is canceled,"" Feinstein said. 
The 737 MAX jets were grounded last week following two fatal crashes in the past five months, the causes of which are under investigation.
Southwest, the largest MAX operator in the world with 34 jets representing about 5 percent of its total fleet, is cancelling about 150 flights per day due to the grounding, but not all on MAX routes. 
Southwest shares were down 2.3 percent on Wednesday and American shares fell 2.1 percent. 
Steve West, Senior Director of Southwest's Operations Control, said the company is trying to cancel flights five days in advance, while looking at issues such as weather that could free up jets, like last week's snowstorm in Colorado. 
Southwest and American were already grappling with a larger than normal number of out-of-service aircraft, further straining their fleets.
So far United Airlines, with 14 MAX aircraft, has not canceled any flights due to the grounding, but has had to put smaller aircraft on some routes and fly the larger 777 to places like Hawaii.
It is unclear how long the grounding will last. Deliveries are also on hold, meaning an additional hit to airlines due to receive more of the jets this year.
Boeing has over 5,000 orders for the MAX, which sold fast thanks to its higher fuel-efficiency and longer range. Now airlines face a dent to 2019 profits.
Calgary-based WestJet said it took steps prior to the MAX grounding to start protecting trans-border flights to sunny destinations that were previously scheduled to fly with the carrier's 13 MAX planes.
Meanwhile, Air Canada said on Tuesday it would remove its 24 737 MAX aircraft from its schedule until at least July 1, 2019.
""It is easier to put the aircraft back in the schedule than to pull it out,"" said a source familiar with the carrier's thinking, who is not allowed to publicly discuss its strategy.

Ben la Grange is one of eight individuals named in an investigation of what an independent report by auditor PwC said was a complex scheme in which intercompany deals worth 6.4 billion euros ($7.3 billion) were wrongly recorded as external income to prop up profits and hide costs in underperforming subsidiaries.
""I am cooperating with all government agencies,"" said La Grange, who was suspended last August but remains on the Steinhoff payroll as a consultant. 
Former CEO Markus Jooste, who could not reached for comment via his lawyer, is among the eight executives named in the 15,000-word report conducted by PwC over the past 15 months. Jooste has previously denied any wrongdoing. 
Steinhoff is under investigation by South Africa police, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority capital markets watchdog and exchange operator JSE.
The state prosecutor in Oldenburg, Germany, has also been investigating the company for suspected accounting irregularities since 2015.
Steinhoff first disclosed the hole in its accounts in December 2017, shocking investors who had backed its reinvention from a small South African business to a multinational retailer at the vanguard of the European discount furniture retail industry.

LONDON (Reuters) - After plowing billions into emerging market equities since October, investors have started to show signs of hesitation, but an uptick in earnings expectations should reassure those hoping to capitalize on stronger economic growth in the emerging world.
Emerging equity funds have suffered outflows over the past three weeks, according to EPFR data, and investors in a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) survey described emerging markets as the ""most crowded trade"". 
Year-to-date net fund flows into emerging markets total $15.7 billion, against $61.8 billion exiting developed markets, and global asset allocators have been increasing their exposure, betting that the worst is over and a declining dollar will help emerging economies.
Francois Savary, chief investment officer at wealth manager Prime Partners, who has an overweight on emerging equities in his asset allocation, said investors are searching for growth in a world where it is looking increasingly scarce.
""It's not only a play on the last phase of the cycle, it is the fact that we have doubts about the U.S. economy down the road,"" added Savary.
The relative health of emerging companies' earnings compared to the rest of the world is a central draw. Analysts have increased their expectations for EM earnings growth this month while forecasts slide everywhere else.

CHINA GOLD RUSH
The inclusion of China's domestic A-Shares into MSCI's emerging markets index has also been a game-changer, making it far easier for international investors to access Chinese stocks.
Data from the Institute of International Finance showed that the lion's share of emerging market equity inflows - $10.6 billion of a total of $13.9 billion in February - piled into Chinese stocks.
""The Tencents, Alibabas and Baidus of this world are not just Chinese growth stories, they're becoming global international growth stories,"" said Edmund Shing, head of equities and derivatives strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in London.
""From that point of view, people are coming back to that sector and thinking that’s a better place to be. I would argue these leading technology companies are more innovative than their U.S. counterparts,"" he added.
But investors are treading with caution, having learnt the hard way not to be too hopeful after many false dawns.
""No-one is breaking out the champagne on this. We're just hoping we get a decent year, and arguing that U.S. valuations versus EM are quite stretched,"" said Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital. 
Return on equity across emerging markets has risen to a five-year high, while valuations, at 11.6 times forward earnings, are 30 percent cheaper than the S&P 500.
With the sugar rush of U.S. tax cuts wearing off, U.S. profit margins look set to wane while EM margins have further to go.
Earnings for EM overall are expected to grow 6.8 percent this year - down from the 12 percent growth expected back in September, but still set to outpace the United States.
Thawing China-U.S. trade relations have also helped buoy the market.
""Because they're seeing macro getting better, trade getting better, China doing the right things, as long as they can see that forward progress they can feel that some level of past disappointment can be just that - in the past,"" said Andrew Jones, emerging markets equity portfolio manager at Pinebridge Investments in New York.
A ""CROWDED TRADE""?
The BAML survey could be a bad omen for emerging markets. Previous ""crowded trades"" include bitcoin and the FAANGs, which went on to slide significantly.
On Tuesday, the latest survey showed short European equities had succeeded EM, however, comforting investors who say the asset class hasn't reached the eye-watering valuations characteristic of such trades.
""When I meet clients there is certainly a lot of interest, but have people really started to move? I would say no,"" said Robert Horrocks, chief investment officer at Matthews Asia.
The market is not factoring in the idea there could be a sustained earnings cycle in Asia, he added, saying Asian earnings could outgrow Europe by 3 to 5 percentage points.
Some, like Peter Elam Hakansson, chairman and CIO at East Capital in Stockholm, are homing in on specific countries where they see particularly strong earnings growth. 
""Some of the most interesting developments will be in Brazil and Russia where you had some very nice earnings growth but the market is not really appreciating it,"" said Hakansson.
Brazil and Russia have delivered the strongest year-on-year earnings growth of top EM countries, while Taiwan and South Korea - hit by U.S.-China trade tariffs - have had sharply negative earnings growth.
Data from Copley Fund Research shows that emerging market funds are overweight India and consumer staples stocks, while the biggest underweights are Taiwan, South Korea, communication services, and China and Hong Kong.
Others are seeking contrarian plays in the context of a U.S.-China trade war potentially nearing its end.
Al Bryant, EM portfolio manager at River & Mercantile in Chicago, said he holds some Chinese port operators.
""Global trade isn't going away,"" he said. ""That's our one option play, if you will, on a (trade) compromise coming out.""
Bryant is also focusing on small-cap stocks, which have a better earnings growth outlook while trading at lower valuations than large-caps.

""Small-caps are tilted away from state-owned enterprises, more tilted to privately owned and consumer companies whose story is a lot more attuned to the consumer demand you're seeing in EM,"" Bryant said.

775,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 11:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trident Energy takes lead in Petrobras oilfield sale - sources,"By Gram Slattery and Carolina Mandl
RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Warburg Pincus-backed firm Trident Energy is in exclusive talks with Petroleo Brasileiro SA to acquire a pair of Brazilian oil clusters, two sources with knowledge of the matter said this week, as the state-run company known as Petrobras moves to revive the sale effort.
Petrobras had agreed in July to enter into exclusive talks with Ouro Preto Oleo e Gas, a Brazilian energy company backed by private equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners, to sell its Pampo and Enchova shallow water oil clusters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.
At the time, the clusters were expected to fetch around $1 billion. However, Ouro Preto reduced its offer and Petrobras walked away, Reuters reported in January.
Petrobras has since entered exclusive talks with Trident Energy, which had bid for the fields in 2018 but did not enter into direct talks with Petrobras because its offer was below Ouro Preto's offer, according to the sources.
Trident was set up by former executives of independent Anglo-French oil firm Perenco in 2016. Its portfolio is comprised of production assets located in Equatorial Guinea. An acquisition of the Pampo and Enchova clusters in Brazil's Campos Basin would mark its first foothold outside of Africa.
Petrobras and Trident did not respond to requests for comment.
Petrobras is currently divesting a wide range of mature onshore and offshore oilfields, among other assets, in a bid to cut debt and refocus on Brazil's promising deepwater 'pre-salt' play. Last week, Petrobras CEO Roberto Castello Branco said he expected the company would complete $10 billion in divestments in the first four months of 2019.
The quick pivot to Trident after the collapse of talks with Ouro Preto illustrates the resolve of Petrobras to push ahead with those asset disposals. The often complex sales have proceeded in fits and starts.
Should Petrobras and Trident come to terms, the sources said, Petrobras will likely hold a final rebidding round, in which competing parties, including Ouro Preto, can submit final bids of varying values for Pampo and Enchova, so long as those bids have the same contractual terms as any agreement with Trident.

Together, Pampo and Enchova produced almost 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to July figures, making it the largest mature production asset in Petrobras' divestment portfolio.

777,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank-Commerzbank Capital to Be Key for ECB Green Light,"(Bloomberg) --  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) AG’s financial reserves will probably be key to winning approval on any merger from the European Central Bank, which has a history of telling lenders to do better.
“They should expect a rigorous examination,” Ignazio Angeloni, a member of the ECB’s supervisory board, said in an interview. The ECB looks at whether banks present realistic business plans and may push them to “different conclusions in terms of the capital and liquidity they may have.”
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank moved deeper into merger talks this week, recognizing that a series of turnaround plans have failed to restore revenue growth following deep cuts to their investment banking units. While the lenders are said to have broached the topic discretely with regulators, they haven’t submitted formal plans because the structure of the deal is still unclear, with asset sales and fundraising among the possible options.
The German banks will want to preempt the kind of demands the watchdog placed on a 2016 merger of two Italian lenders. In that instance, the ECB pushed Banco Popolare SC to raise its capital levels with a 1 billion-euro ($1.1 billion) stock issuance before combining with Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl.
If a deal goes ahead, Deutsche Bank may need to raise about 8 billion euros from shareholders or through sales of holdings such as its DWS Group asset management business, according to an estimate by Christian Koch, a DZ Bank analyst.
Job Focus
Another important aspect of a tie-up between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank would be savings from eliminating staff, notably in Germany where both banks have significant overlap. The deal may require 30,000 job cuts to make sense, people familiar with the matter have said.
“You often see a certain amount of optimism when these plans are presented,” said Angeloni. “Banks tend to paint a rosy picture when they present themselves to investors. It’s up to us to make sure things are safe and sound.”
The ECB doesn’t have a preference between whether banks should merge with domestic competitors or peers from other states, Angeloni said. “Of course, we are part of a set of European institutions that regard integration as a positive, desirable goal,” he said. “So we’d welcome sound cross-border mergers.”
One big stumbling block for international mergers is the fact that lenders can’t move capital and liquid funds freely between countries, he said. “They still can’t reap the full benefits of a merger given the current state of the law,” he said. “Those impediments need to be removed to make big banks more European.”
Angeloni, who helped set up the ECB’s supervisory arm in 2014 and is scheduled to step down from its board this month, also said:"

The company blamed performance on a slowing global macroeconomic environment. 
""Our third quarter financial results were below our expectations and we are focused on initiatives to improve our performance,"" said Frederick Smith, the company's chairman and CEO, in a statement out on Tuesday.
Here's what FedEx reported, compared with what Wall Street analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting.
""Slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue, as seen in the year-over-year decline in our FedEx Express international revenue,"" said Alan Graf, Jr., the company's executive vice president and CFO.
Last quarter,  FedEx slashed its earnings forecast, citing economic uncertainty in Europe and Asia. FedEx Express said it would not achieve its operating income goal of $1.5 billion by fiscal 2020.
Over the last year, FedEx shares have come under significant pressure, falling 33%, as analysts have grown increasingly worried that  Amazon's efforts in the logistics space were a viable threat. 
""We could have cut and paste this opening sentence from our notes over the last several Qs, as results continue to disappoint due to a plethora of negative items,"" including weaker revenue trends, wrote  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts led by Amit Mehrotra in a note to investors on Tuesday.
Still, the firm ""defended"" shares, and maintained its positive view of the stock — ""albeit fully understanding of investors' frustration with lack of progress"" — due in part to the view that it's a good value. 
Indeed, FedEx's relatively low valuation has recently gained attention as investors ""debate the company's path forward on earnings,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Brandon Oglenski in a note to clients sent out on Monday.
Shares are currently trading at 10 times forward earnings, versus the S&P 500's ratio of just over 16 times. In other words, the stock may be viewed as cheap relative to the broader market.
""While we agree valuation is tempting, management will have to provide a clearer picture for improving European results while also dealing with slower global demand and a likely higher capital spending outlook,"" Oglenski wrote.

779,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 09:56AM ET</span>",A Wall Street strategist who called the last stock plunge says investors are foolishly ignoring one thriving corner of the market,"When it comes to stock market analysis, the market's biggest companies are often pitted against the smallest.
For example, when the US-China trade war first started rearing its angry head, the prevailing narrative was that more domestically focused small-cap stocks would outperform their more globally exposed large-cap peers.
And while this is undoubtedly a compelling way to look at the market, there's an entire thriving middle class of stocks that goes largely unnoticed. Sure, you'd recognize many of the companies in the group, but they're not exactly big players in the broader market.
Mid-cap stocks are so overlooked, in fact, that the combined market value of the two biggest exchange-traded funds tracking the group is still a full $13 billion less than the top two small-cap ETFs.
Ed Clissold, the chief US equity strategist at Ned Davis Research, thinks the sleeper status of mid caps only enhances the group's investing appeal. And he's someone worth listening to, considering he successfully called the December stock meltdown at a time when most on Wall Street were still bullish.
""There are fewer assets chasing it, and fewer analysts covering it,"" Clissold told Business Insider during a recent meeting. ""So if something is being focused on, it has a chance of doing better.""
He continued: ""Mid caps don’t get caught up in the yin and yang between small and large, because they live in both worlds. It’s a great place for diversifying.""
If you're still not sold, consider the chart below, which shows the impressive recent uptrend in the Russell Mid-Cap Index, relative to the broader Russell 3000 universe.
Going beyond near-term historical performance trends, Clissold also cites technical reasons for his bullishness on the mid-cap space. He notes the group — when compared relative to the entire Russell 3000 universe — is trading above its 50- and 200-day moving average, which is a bullish signal.
Clissold ran the same test for large caps and found the group to be in a downtrend, and below both moving averages. Meanwhile, while small caps have rebounded slightly of late, the group is still at a multiyear low when compared to the Russell 3000.
With all of that established, Clissold has one more argument in favor of mid caps: their relative anonymity serves them well during rough patches.
""Mid-caps have historically tended to outperform both large- and small-cap stocks,"" he said. ""They have the beta characteristics of small caps to some extent. But in down markets, they don’t get caught up in the liquidity crunch as much."""

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS is to cut an extra $300 million in costs in 2019 after investment banking revenues plunged in the first quarter, Switzerland's biggest bank said, sounding a pessimistic note about full-year prospects.
Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti, who outlined the cost cuts in a speech to a London investment conference on Wednesday, said investment banking conditions were among the toughest in years, especially outside the United States.
""We are taking actions which will partly offset the impact of the difficult market environment so far this year, supporting capital generation,"" he said.
""At this point I still believe we can achieve returns at least in line with last year's,"" Ermotti said of the group.
Last year, UBS's reported return on common equity tier 1 capital stood at 13.1 percent, while its target for this year is 15 percent. 
The bank confirmed that Ermotti's comments related to the bank's group-level return on capital and cost-income goals. Return on capital is a measure of profitability.
Ermotti said at UBS's investment banking division revenues were down by about a third compared to the strong first quarter of 2018.
""We've seen some improvement lately but it remains patchy, and not enough to offset the challenging start to the year,"" Ermotti said.
The investment bank now expects to achieve mid-single-digit adjusted returns on attributed equity for the first quarter, compared to its 15 percent target over the 2019-2021 period and 12.9 percent achieved in 2018. 
""While clearly not in line with our long-term aspirations, I find it to be an acceptable outcome if it is a one-off in one of the worst first-quarter environments in recent history,"" he said. 
Volatile markets and uncertainty about global economic growth hit investment banking revenues in the fourth quarter for many big banks in Europe and the United States. Ermotti's comments highlighted that the first quarter was still tough.
""UBS sent a negative signal that Q1 investment banking revenues will be down across major European banks,"" one trader said.
Shares in UBS fell 2.5 percent by 1315 GMT, while shares in rival  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) fell 3.2 percent, with traders citing the downbeat tone of Ermotti's comments. 
UBS has now slowed hiring as well as its work on a number of IT projects to help the group to save an additional $300 million this year, with most of the savings coming through in the second half of the year, Ermotti said in his conference speech.
The bank's flagship wealth management business looked set to return to targeted inflows after $7.9 billion in net new money outflows over the final three months of 2018. 
Ermotti said a somber view amongst Asian customers, coupled with U.S. clients sticking more to the sidelines, kept transaction-based income under pressure, leading to a roughly 9 percent slide in wealth management revenues this quarter.

The CEO said U.S. clients had boosted their cash holdings to record highs, with about 24 percent of their balances now in cash.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",Aquis Exchange says Brexit clash could damage stock market,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The hardline stance by European Union regulators on share trading could split markets and damage prices for investors if there is a no-deal Brexit next week, a top exchanges industry official said on Wednesday.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on Tuesday identified 6,200 shares that EU investors can only trade inside the bloc if Britain left without a deal on March 29.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) hit back, saying that ESMA's stance risked disrupting markets, raising fears of a tit-for-tat move to force UK customers to trade EU shares only in London and thereby splitting liquidity.
Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange, said that a ""horror story"" could be unfolding for markets.
""Is this a land grab? To a certain extent,"" he told Reuters.
Launched in November 2013, Aquis now accounts for about 4 percent of pan-European share trading, using a novel form of pricing to take on incumbents such as Cboe, which has more than a fifth of the market.
AHaynes, a 40-year veteran in the industry, said he has never seen such an overt clash between regulators.
""It was a pretty harsh response,"" he said. ""This is regulators fighting in public. Your chances for equivalence went out the door last night.""
Brussels has said that clearing houses in London would gain equivalence for a year if there is a no-deal Brexit, meaning that EU customers could continue using them for a limited time.
This was not extended to trading platforms in London, used by asset managers and banks from across the continent.
Christian Voigt, senior regulatory adviser at trading technology firm Fidessa, said emotions were running high after ESMA's statement left market participants disappointed.
""While arguing what the regulator could have done, we shouldn't forget that it is all caused by a political decision not to grant equivalence,"" Voigt said.
PARIS PILOT
Aquis, Cboe Europe, CME and other trading platforms in London have opened EU operations to avoid disruption to customers from Brexit.
Banks have moved a trillion pounds in assets such as stocks, bonds and derivatives owned by EU customers to hubs in the bloc to trade there.
Aquis began testing trading from Paris on Wednesday, Haynes said.
Trading in euro-denominated shares is likely to remain in London for now if Brexit is delayed, as requested by the British government, or a transition deal is agreed, he added.
The Paris operation would increase overall costs for Aquis by about 5 percent, though most of this has already been incurrred, Haynes said.
Aquis revenue doubled to 4 million pounds ($5.3 million) in 2018, when it made a loss of 2.7 million pounds, having invested heavily on developing its technology and licensing arm. It floated last June with listing costs totaling a million pounds.
Haynes said analysts expect Aquis to become profitable in 2020 and that he is comfortable with those expectations.

784,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",Europeans Try to Kill MiFID Rule in Brexit Derivatives Fight,"(Bloomberg) -- The City of London is getting another reminder of how fraught post-Brexit dealings with the European Union could get in the $1.5 trillion-a-day market for exchange-traded derivatives.
Lobbyists for Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) AG, Euronext NV and other exchanges are calling on EU officials to reverse a key part of the bloc’s trading law called open access -- a policy that has wide support in London. The rule allows derivatives to be traded on one exchange and cleared at another.
The European Commission “should check very carefully if the ‘open access’ provisions will indeed work as intended in a new post-Brexit environment,’’ said Markus Ferber a leading lawmaker on recent market reforms known as MiFID II. “With the trading and clearing landscape changing so much in light of Brexit, a review of those provisions is only sensible.’’
If open access were revoked, it would leave traders tied into dealing and clearing at one venue. Supporters such as the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Plc have said these silos concentrate risks and discourage competition.
The question of whether to proceed with open access highlights the split in the derivatives industry on the need for competition for clearing services. Some EU countries are also using Brexit as an excuse to protect their national champions.
Open access was delayed at the start of the MiFID II reforms until mid-2020 after Germany’s top regulator initiated a postponement that others followed. The German Finance Ministry is now consulting on changes to MiFID II.
Lobbying Letters
Germany’s dominant market operator Deutsche Boerse, which operates a derivatives trading venue and clearinghouse, has long opposed the provision, while the London Stock Exchange Group Plc has been among its most vocal supporters.
Deutsche Boerse declined to comment, but said it had responded to the German Finance Ministry consultation.
The Federation of European Securities Exchanges, whose members include Deutsche Boerse and Euronext, made the case for reconsidering open access in a letter to the ministry. It said that open access for exchange-traded derivatives would create “unresolvable issues’’ for both trading venues and clearinghouses, while creating operational inefficiencies that could harm financial stability.
That sets up a battle with some of the world’s biggest brokers, who are important participants in the listed derivatives market and feel the pain of price pressure caused by a lack of competition.
A lobby group for brokers including BGC Partners Inc., and TP ICAP (LON:NXGN) Plc sent a letter to Germany, dated March 15 and seen by Bloomberg News, asking regulators to push ahead with open access. It wants to break what it said were “monopolies” at some large exchange operators.
“Open access will give market participants enhanced choice in trading and clearing services, thereby avoiding the concentration of risk presented by closed market infrastructures, and leading to lower costs,’’ the letter said.

785,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",Central Banks Kill Volatility. Now Wall Street Fears a Trap,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s volatility complex is roaring back to life as dovish central banks beat recession fears into submission, spurring the fastest return to market calm since 2012.
How long the serenity can last is the vexed question.
For now, hedge funds are amassing short wagers on equity price swings, while the Cboe Volatility Index sits close to a five-month low. Thanks to lowflation, interest-rate moves in the U.S. have fallen to a record as tranquility takes hold of global currencies.
Traders are in a bind: Bets on lower price swings offer diminishing rewards for the risk, but money managers banking on gyrations face a world of pain if a Goldilocks-lite economy keeps volatility at bay. Already this year, Argentiere Capital is said to have returned capital to investors after misfiring wagers on rising turmoil in its flagship $940 million fund.
As the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). see shadows of the cross-asset calm that preceded 2013’s Taper Tantrum, speculators riding the monetary put in the aging business cycle are in soul-searching mode.
“Why would an investor incur the risk associated with short-volatility strategies only to be compensated with a return comparable to a three-month Treasury bill?” said Pat Hennessy, head trader at IPS Strategic Capital in Denver, Colorado.
The Federal Reserve’s dovish tilt has driven all fear out of Treasuries -- boosting equity-investor confidence in the earnings yield and the discount rate for cash flows to suppress stock swings along the way.
Those punting on short-volatility trades “really need to be right” that monetary authorities will live up to their label as volatility killers, according to Benn Eifert, chief investment officer of QVR Advisors.
“Longer-term fixed income, currency and commodity implied volatility are mostly at or near their post-crisis lows,” he said. “The risk/reward of betting that they go even lower is poor.”
The link between the business cycle and the volatility market is far from straight-forward.
Short-vol equity strategies can deliver returns even as economies hurtle toward recession -- but the journey is famously bumpy. In 11 Fed easing cycles since 1972, the realized volatility of the S&P 500 rose “reliably’’ in the months preceding the first rate cut, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
With some Wall Street recession signals still flashing, hedging for an end-of-cycle uptick in volatility has a clear appeal. But trading with conviction is a challenge given the relative stability of the macro climate.
“As long as fundamental data -- the volatility of inflation etc. -- is very low we would avoid any strategic trades and only tactically examine periodic opportunities,” said Yannis Couletsis, director at Credence Capital Management Ltd.
If short-vol trades famed for their dependable income are offering thinner returns while long bets look risky, it may be a case of being nimble.
QVR’s Eifert is pursuing relative-value trades that “isolate specific market dislocations, as well as cheap, low-carry-cost long volatility positions.” He points to strategies across the volatility surface of the S&P 500 as an example. Long-term interest-rate swaptions are a potentially cheap way to bet on rising volatility, he said.
For Hennessy at IPS, the relatively low premium available from shorting VIX futures makes options contracts more attractive given the subdued volatility of volatility itself.
Meanwhile, some hedge funds in the becalmed $5.1 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market are snapping up riskier instruments from managed futures to gold.
Hedging Trades
There’s an upside to all this for real-money investors: Hedges are looking cheap. At a unit of Allianz (DE:ALVG), one of Europe’s biggest insurers, low price swings are offering the chance to load up on U.S. interest-rate derivatives.
“We are taking advantage of very low volatility to manage very actively the complexity of our portfolios,’’ said Franck Dixmier, global head of fixed income at Allianz Global Investors. “We were able to play some downward momentum on rates in buying calls and then playing a correction buying puts.”
All told, step back and the killer question continues to haunt traders of all stripes: At what point will market confidence in the ability of central banks to prolong the cycle give way?
“It is unappealing to be outright short vol at the current historically low levels,”  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA rates strategists led by Michael Chang wrote. But “it is also difficult to be outright long vol when market participants are demonstrating willingness to sell implied vols on any bounce,” they said.

The fund, Valor Siren Ventures Fund, will later seek to raise an additional $300 million, the world's largest coffee chain said on Wednesday, ahead of its annual shareholder meeting.
""We are inspired by, and want to support the creative, entrepreneurial businesses of tomorrow with whom we may explore commercial relationships down the road,"" Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said in a statement.
Starbucks is the latest U.S. food company to invest in startups. The largest U.S. meat producer,  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), started a fund called ""Tyson Ventures"" in 2016 to invest in businesses that focus on developing plant-based protein, while a clutch of other food and drink brands including Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc have also set up similar funds.
Starbucks reaffirmed its longer-term revenue and profit targets and said it would buy back $2 billion in shares, as part of a commitment to return $25 billion to shareholders through 2020.
The annual shareholder meeting comes as the coffee chain counters sluggish performance in its U.S. business through a revamp of its stores and introduction of fresher food and cold brews that has driven market-beating same-store sales in the past two quarters.
The company's shares are up about 11 percent since the beginning of the year, compared with a 13 percent gain in the S&P 500 Index. 

Valor Equity is an early stage investor in Tesla and its portfolio includes investments in Chicago-based Roti Modern Mediterranean and Wow Bao.

The packaged goods industry has been battling surging freight and commodities costs all of last year as railroads and truck fleets hike rates, forcing them to pass on the additional costs to consumers.
The burden of rising costs has been a double-whammy to the industry that has been struggling to turnaround and adapt to changing consumer preferences as they move from processed and sugary foods.
While price hikes by General Mills have boosted margins and helped overturn three quarters of declining revenue at its North America business, its biggest unit, it has partially impacted volumes for snacks and yogurt businesses.
The company has also been cutting costs to prop up margins and had last year decided to cut 625 jobs by the end of fiscal 2019. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter rose 170 basis points to 34.2 percent and beat the analyst average estimate of 32.89 percent. 
""Our year-to-date performance and fourth-quarter plans give us confidence that we will meet or exceed all of our key fiscal 2019 targets,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said in a statement.
General Mills, which owns dessert pre-mix brand Betty Crocker and Nature Valley granola bars, said it expects adjusted profit for fiscal 2019 to be between flat and 1 percent from a prior forecast range of flat to down 3 percent.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 83 cents per share for the quarter ended Feb.24 and beat expectations of 69 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company's net sales rose 8 percent to $4.20 billion, primarily driven by its acquisition of pet food maker Blue Buffalo, and was largely in line with expectations of $4.19 billion.
Shares of the company rose to $49.82 in early trading and drove gains for fellow packaged food companies. 
Shares of Conagra Brands, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co, J.M Smucker Co and  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) were up between 0.3 percent and about 1 percent.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Foreign investors sold Danish shares worth almost $14 billion in 2018 following a money laundering scandal at the country's largest lender Danske Bank, Denmark's central bank governor said on Wednesday.
Danske Bank is under investigation in the United States, Denmark, Estonia, France and Britain over 200 billion euros ($226 billion) in payments from Russia, ex-Soviet states and elsewhere that were found to have flowed through its Estonian unit between 2007 and 2015.
Non-residents sold Danish equities worth 91 billion crowns ($13.85 billion) last year, including 21 billion crowns' worth of banking shares, a report from the central bank showed on Wednesday.
The divestment of bank equities may reflect a loss of confidence in the Danish banking sector in the wake of Danske Bank's money laundering case, it said.
""The trust from international investors has certainly been reduced,"" governor Lars Rohde told reporters in Copenhagen.
He said political initiatives to combat money laundering were paramount to restore foreigners' trust in Danish banks.
He said Danish politicians should consider new rules to force banks to block payments if they are suspected of being related to money laundering, similar to current rules governing payments suspected of being linked to financing terrorism.
Danske Bank's annual report shows shareholders from the United States and Canada cut their holdings in the bank during 2018 to 17 percent of Danske's shares by the end of that year from 24 percent by end-2017.
British investors also reduced their holding in Danske Bank over 2018 from 16 percent to 12 percent, while Danes and other Europeans increased their holdings of Danske Bank shares.

MUNICH (Reuters) - BMW expects group pretax profit to fall by more than 10 percent this year, it said on Wednesday as it announced a sweeping 12 billion euro ($13.6 bln) savings and efficiency plan to help offset higher technology investment and currency costs.
The German carmaker reported a 7.9 percent fall in 2018 operating profit last week and said it would step up efficiency measures in anticipation of a difficult year in a sector grappling with the shift toward electric vehicles amid continuing Brexit uncertainty and global economic worries.
Group earnings before tax are expected to be significantly below 2018 levels, the company said at its results news conference in Munich on Wednesday.
""Depending on how conditions develop, our guidance may be subject to additional risks; in particular, the risk of a no-deal Brexit and ongoing developments in international trade policy,"" said Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter.
BMW continues to expect an orderly Brexit and said operational disruptions from a disorderly Brexit would be likely to normalize after four to six weeks. 
""If tariffs are in the range of zero and 5 percent, the business case would not dramatically change,"" BMW production chief Oliver Zipse said, referring to the group's production network and exports of Mini vehicles from Oxford in England to the European Union. 
BMW said it would expand group-wide efforts to increase efficiency and lower costs but ruled out forced redundancies.
About 1,500 staff have taken early retirement and another 2,500 are eligible for retirement and early retirement, the company said.
By the end of 2022 the company expects the efficiency program to deliver savings of more than 12 billion euros, it said in a statement.
ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT
Some of that would come from ramping up digital simulations to speed development of new models by as much as a third.
""Among other savings, digital simulations and virtual validation could eliminate the need for some 2,500 expensive prototype vehicles by the year 2024,"" BMW said.
However, the high cost of developing electric and self-driving cars will continue to weigh on earnings.
BMW said it expects the operating margin in its automotive division to fall to between 6 percent and 8 percent this year, below its 8-10 percent target, disappointing analysts. 
Last year's automotive operating margin was 7.2 percent but the launch of a new 3 series and a high-margin X7 sports utility vehicle was expected to boost margins this year, Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said.
The 2019 guidance of a 6-8 percent margin came in lower than the investment bank's 7-9 percent estimate, he added.
Bernstein Research analyst Max Warburton said: ""If BMW is facing this kind of difficulty and feels the need to guide this cautiously, what does this tell us about the rest of the sector?"" 
Mercedes has far fewer new products. Audi seems to be facing more pricing pressure. VW is surely raising its development spending faster, Warburton added.
BMW sidestepped questions about whether Chief Executive Harald Krueger would receive a contract extension, which is due this year if the supervisory board agrees. 
Krueger was hired for a five-year term in May 2015 and it is customary for German companies to communicate a year before contract expiry whether a board member's contract will be extended. 
BMW production chief Zipse and Klaus Froehlich, the company's board member responsible for development, are seen as potential replacements if Krueger does not remain as CEO.

The profit warning and weak quarterly results have resulted in a slew of price target cuts, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) cutting to $148 from $156, as the full year forecast cut was much bigger than expected and implied a tough fourth quarter.
In December, FedEx had slashed its forecast, citing a sharp downturn in worldwide trade, and now expects to earn between $15.10 and $15.90 per share this year. Analysts had expected full-year earnings per share of $15.97 for 2019.
J.P. Morgan expects ""turbulence"" in the near future and has downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"", cutting its price target to $202 from $227.
FedEx on Tuesday also blamed weak results on the additional cost for launching year-round, six-days-per-week operations at FedEx Ground in the United States, and continued weakness in its international Express business, which includes former Dutch delivery company TNT Express.
""Mix pressures and labor cost inflation are mounting faster than anticipated at Ground... We are increasingly concerned operating margins in percent terms will be pressured even if Ground can lower costs fast enough to grow operating profit in dollars,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Brian Ossenbeck said in a note.

794,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>",Hedge Fund Titans Aurelius and Elliott Clash in Distressed Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Years after leaving the New York-based hedge fund Elliott Management Corp., Mark Brodsky often found the firm he later started, Aurelius Capital Management, aligned with his old employer. The two fought side by side in many high-profile trades including a grueling, decade-long battle with Argentina over defaulted bonds.
But now Brodsky finds himself at odds with Elliott -- and his former boss there, Paul Singer -- in a new controversial default saga. This one centers on Windstream Holdings Inc., a U.S. telecom company that suddenly sank into default last month after Judge Jesse Furman ruled in favor of Aurelius’s lawsuit against the company for breaking bond covenants.
Aurelius is believed by market participants to have bought derivatives insuring against a Windstream default, with Elliott taking the other side of that trade. That would hand Aurelius a payout on the contracts, known as credit-default swaps, while Elliott could be faced with losses. Moreover, as Windstream begins to navigate bankruptcy proceedings, Aurelius and Elliott have what would appear to be very different agendas.
Aurelius, which started the year with $2.4 billion in assets, likely remains focused until the auction on preserving its CDS return. Elliott, which manages about $34 billion, holds a position in Windstream’s secured debt that gives it leverage in bankruptcy negotiations.
“Given the sophistication of the players -- Aurelius and Elliott -- I think the interesting stuff starts now,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross Business School. “Nobody will do a more sophisticated analysis than these two and nobody will be more willing to fight than these two.”
Representatives for Aurelius and Elliott in New York, as well as Little Rock, Arkansas-based Windstream declined to comment.
Squaring Off
With the two hedge funds seemingly on course to sit at separate ends of the table in the bankruptcy, it puts Elliott in the position to potentially focus on recapitalizing Windstream in exchange for assets or equity. Meanwhile, Aurelius could look to challenge that move -- possibly as part of a bigger group -- and pursue its own claims against the estate. It could alternatively tender its unsecured bonds in the CDS auction scheduled for April 3 and quit while it’s ahead, opting out of the bigger bankruptcy fight.
“They can declare moral victory thanks to Judge Furman’s opinion, but you can’t declare investment victory until you actually make some money,” Minor Myers, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who specializes in corporate finance, said by phone. “And if they do that with the CDS resolution, what’s the point of fighting Elliott?”
Windstream’s 10.5 percent second-lien notes due in 2024, issued last year in a debt swap involving Elliott, have fallen about 11 cents on the dollar in the wake of the default ruling, while its shares have slid about 90 percent. The 6.375 percent unsecured notes due 2023 that were at the center of the default trial are trading around 28 cents on the dollar.
Elliott proposed a loan to keep Windstream out of bankruptcy, according to people with knowledge of the matter, and the company outlined a financing proposal it received from financial institutions for up to $1.5 billion, contingent on Windstream meeting several conditions, according to court filings.
But it was too little, too late. Windstream filed for Chapter 11 last month, just 10 days after Judge Furman ruled that a spinoff of Uniti Group Inc. in 2015 violated its bond contracts, awarding a $310 million judgment to Aurelius. Windstream accused Aurelius of forcing the company into bankruptcy through an act of “predatory market manipulation” to benefit its CDS position, while the hedge fund claimed vindication.
“The Aurelius case shows the system working better than it might have without CDS, but it is leading to a puzzling situation here,” Myers said. “In general, you want people to be enforcing bond covenants.”
The court win for Aurelius also amounted to a triumph for Brodsky, who worked for Elliott for almost a decade before leaving to start his own firm. In addition to being among creditors awarded a $4.65 billion payout fighting Argentina’s 2001 sovereign debt default (they were together branded “financial terrorists” by the country’s former president), the two funds were involved in the bankruptcy of Oi SA, a Brazilian telecom provider, Peabody Energy Corp., and in an obscure bet that brought them outsized recoveries in the bankruptcy of General Motors (NYSE:GM).
Still, in the relatively confined world of distressed debt, firms can often find themselves aligned one day, and squaring off the next.
Neighbor’s Table
At Windstream’s first-day hearing in its bankruptcy, Milbank’s Dennis Dunne, counsel for a group of Windstream second-lien creditors, echoed the company’s sentiments, arguing that Aurelius was a bad actor that had “scoured the landscape to find a default it could prosecute.”
""It’s one thing to say I’m going to buy insurance on my neighbor’s house, it’s another to burn it down,” Dunne said. “It’s a third thing to collect a ton of money on that insurance and then expect to be welcomed at my neighbor’s table.”
Windstream is scheduled to be in court March 25 for a motion to stop utility providers from shutting off service. It will return April 16 for a hearing on a broader range of motions, including the final approval of a $1 billion loan it will use to fund itself during bankruptcy.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares faced an end to their longest winning streak of the year as investors took profits on Wednesday before the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decision, seen as offering clues to interest rate prospects over the coming year. 
European bourses followed Asian peers down, putting the MSCI's gauge of stocks around the world on course to break seven days of gains, with reports of renewed tensions in U.S.-China trade talks also fraying nerves. 
The Euro STOXX 600 fell 0.3 percent, with indexes in Britain and France also slightly down as investors closed positions before the Fed's decision, due at 1800 GMT.. 
Germany underperformed, its bourse dragged down as chemicals group  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) faced its worst day in 16 years after a second U.S. jury ruled its Roundup weedkiller caused cancer.
The U.S. central bank is expected to hold rates steady and cut the number of hikes projected for the rest of the year, signaling since early this year a ""patient"" approach to increasing borrowing costs.
That patience - interpreted as code for holding off on rate hikes - has come as the United States and other parts of the world begin to exhibit signs of slowing growth. 
Traders expect no rate hikes this year and some are even building in bets for a cut in 2020. 
""Some traders expect the Fed to be a little on the neutral side. The Fed will be optimistic - but not overly optimistic - to send a neutral but upbeat message to the market,"" said David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets in London. 
Also in play were concerns on rising tension in the U.S. trade negotiations, which pushed MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.2 percent. 
Some market players said investors took money off the table after a report of U.S. concerns that China is pushing back against American demands in trade talks.
On the whole, though, many investors are holding on to hopes of a deal between Washington and Beijing, even as officials from the two sides remained locked in negotiations.
Talks are set to resume next week - the first since President Donald Trump delayed a March 1 deadline to raise tariffs on Chinese imports - in an acceleration aimed at ending an eight-month trade war between the world's two largest economies.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plan to travel to China next week for another round of talks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.
EAGER FOR AGREEMENT
""China is eager to come to an agreement so I'm not too worried,"" said Wang Shenshen, strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. ""As long as they are holding meetings, many things will work out."" 
Kazakhstan's tenge fell half a percent against the dollar as Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, a career diplomat fluent in Russian, English and Chinese, was sworn in as president.
Tokayev pledged to continue the policies of veteran leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, who unexpectedly resigned on Tuesday after three decades in power, and will serve out the presidential term ending in April 2020.
It was unclear whether Tokayev, the former prime minister, will run for a full term as president of the vast oil- and gas-rich country of 18 million people, adding to uncertainty for investors already facing a shift from long-term structural reforms towards populist policies. 
Expectations of a more cautious Fed have dented the U.S. dollar, already under pressure this year as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell all but signaled a pause to the tightening cycle at the previous meeting.
The reports of increased tension in trade talks pushed the dollar up, with safe-haven bids in demand, though gains were slim as the Fed decision loomed.
The greenback edged up 0.1 percent against a basket of key rival currencies to 96.297, finding its footing after plumbing its lowest level since March 1 in overnight trading.
Sterling fell 0.3 percent to $1.3220 as turmoil grips Britain's exit from the European Union .
Prime Minister Theresa May will request a short delay to Brexit on Wednesday after her failure to get a divorce deal ratified, leaving the future of the Brexit divorce uncertain.
Oil prices were firm, supported by supply cuts led by producer club OPEC as well as U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela, though gains were limited by concerns over global economic growth.
International Brent crude oil futures were at $67.65 a barrel by 0925 GMT, up 0.1 percent from their last close.

801,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 05:48AM ET</span>",Plant protein startups vie to tap China’s hungry market,"By Vincent Chow
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Start-ups specializing in alternative protein, from eggless eggs to pea-stuffed burgers and cell-grown fish products, are piling into the Chinese territory of Hong Kong to tap the mainland's booming multi-billion dollar food market. 
At a time when traditional meat farmers have seen profits hurt by the U.S.-China trade war and the spread of swine fever, companies such as Impossible Foods, JUST and Beyond Meat are luring affluent Asian consumers with products they say are more sustainable and environmentally friendly than conventional meat. 
The global meat substitutes market was estimated at $4.6 billion last year and is predicted to reach $6.4 billion by 2023, according to research firm Markets and Markets. Asia is the fastest growing region. 
Backed by some of the world's top billionaires including Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing, philanthropist Bill Gates and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, plant protein firms are expanding into China for the first time this year.
San Francisco-based JUST, valued at $1 billion and which counts venture capitalist Peter Thiel as one of its backers, is planning to launch its mung bean faux egg product in six Chinese cities starting next month.
""China is the most important market to JUST globally,"" said Cyrus Pan, JUST's China general manager. 
JUST has inked deals with Alibaba's Tmall and JD.com to distribute its egg product starting in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenzhen, before expanding to other cities. 
The company says the use of mung bean as its key ingredient is important for food security and appeals to the Chinese market given its tradition as a dietary staple.
China has a history of food safety scandals from melamine-tainted eggs, smuggled frozen meat years beyond its expiry date and recycled ""gutter oil"" to crops tainted with heavy metals. 
Nick Cooney, managing partner of Lever VC, a U.S.-Asian venture capital fund focused on alternative protein startups, said firms like his are eyeing joint ventures, exports and product technology licensing opportunities in China.
""Chinese consumers seem to be more open to novel foods than those in nearly any other country,"" he said. 
Beyond Meat, which makes burgers and sausages from pea protein, has seen sales in Hong Kong increase 300 percent last year, said David Yeung, Beyond Meat's distributor in the special administrative region. 
Backed by Tyson, the world's largest meat processor, Beyond Meat filed for an initial public offering on the Nasdaq last November and plans to start distributing in the mainland in the second half of this year. 
Rival Impossible Foods, which makes burgers out of soy, has said plant-based meat will eliminate the need for animals in the food chain and make the global food system sustainable.
The group has received around $450 million in funding since 2011 with investments from Lee Ka-shing's Horizons Ventures and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Ventures. 
Since launching in five restaurants in Hong Kong last April, the group's products are now in over 100 restaurants in Hong Kong and Macau. 
Impossible plans to open in mainland China within the next two years. ASIAN TASTES
Hong Kong-based Avant Meats, which uses cell technology to replicate fish and seafood products, is developing a cell-based fish maw prototype due for launch in the third quarter of this year, its chief executive Carrie Chan told Reuters. 
Fish maw, or swim bladders, are popular in Asian soups and stews and are used to add collagen to food.
Right Treat, another Hong Kong company headed by Yeung, is replicating Asia's favorite meat - pork - using mushrooms, peas and rice for use in dumplings and meatballs. 
The company has seen its sales of its Omnipork triple since launching in Hong Kong in April 2018. It has since expanded to Singapore, Macau and Taiwan, and plans to sell in mainland China this year. 
""If we want to change the world, we must find ways to shift Asian diet and consumption, which means we must find ways to reduce Asia’s dependence on pork and other meat products,” said Yeung, who also runs Green Monday, a startup tackling global food insecurity and climate change.
Omnipork is available at more than 40 stores and will be stocked in major Hong Kong supermarket chains by the end of March, Yeung says. 
Advocates say meat substitutes are healthier and also use less water, produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions and use less land than producing the same amount of meat. 
Consumers, however, must be willing to pay a premium.
Omnipork retails for HK$43 ($5.48) for 230g (8 ounces) versus HK$37 for the same amount of minced pork. 
Impossible's burger at HK$88 is more than double the price of a Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) burger in Hong Kong.
Yet the explosion of alternative protein products across Hong Kong has given consumers such as executive recruiter Shazz Sabnani, greater variety.
""Before I had to rely more on vegetables and tofu-based products, whereas now I've introduced more of these fake meats to my diet.""
Still, not everyone is convinced about the fake meat trend.
Tseung So, a retired 70-year-old said the spaghetti bolognaise made with omnipork at Green Monday's ""Kind Kitchen"" in Hong Kong, was not as tasty as real meat. 
""Why would we eat this when we can eat the same dish but with normal pork? I don't think this will make meat eaters eat less meat but they will probably become more popular with real vegetarians.”

802,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 05:45AM ET</span>",Counting the cost: Nissan unpicks Ghosn legacy of 'high-handedness' and 'wrongdoings',"By Norihiko Shirouzu
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - In September 2007, despite weighty responsibilities at the helm of Nissan Motor Co and alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), Carlos Ghosn found time to get involved in a seemingly straightforward business decision.
Two days before Nissan's executive committee was due to formalize the choice of a company called TVS as a partner for sales and marketing in India, Ghosn threw his weight behind a different firm: Hover Automotive India Pvt Ltd, four company sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Hover had been a candidate but was knocked out of the running because it had been deemed insufficiently experienced in automotive distribution and marketing, they said. However, its founder and chairman, Moez Mangalji, was a close family friend of Ghosn's, the sources added.
A Nissan executive wrote to the team preparing for the committee meeting saying it was Ghosn's wish that Hover be recommended over TVS, two of the sources said, adding that this was enough to ensure Hover got the job.
The incident is part of Nissan's wide-ranging probe into what it calls years of serious misconduct by Ghosn. There is no evidence of Ghosn benefiting from the decision but it is an example of conduct investigators believe helped his friends at Nissan's expense, the two sources added.
A spokesman for Ghosn said the former Nissan chairman did not intervene on behalf of Hover, that Hover met key criteria to launch the distribution business, and all partnership decisions were made by Nissan's executive committee. 
""The baseless accusations against Mr. Ghosn and steady stream of leaks from certain Nissan executives are a transparent and dishonorable attempt to smear Mr. Ghosn's reputation, destabilize and reset the balance of power in the Alliance, and distract from Nissan's alarming performance,"" the statement from Ghosn's spokesman said.
The spokesman declined repeated requests by Reuters to be identified, citing the ""sensitive nature of the topics.""
A representative for Mangalji said Hover employed experts with substantial experience and ""that at no point was Hover aware of any special treatment on its behalf by Mr Ghosn or anyone else.""
Ghosn would continue to back Hover even after Nissan dealers in India began protesting in 2012 to executives about a collapse in sales, according to the sources, who declined to be identified, citing the sensitivity of the subject.
Those protests grew in 2013, with some groups representing Nissan's India dealers sending letters to senior executives, imploring them to step in, and Nissan ultimately dropped Hover as a partner the next year.
An internal Nissan document that summarizes some of the decision-making around the choice of Hover and which one source said was created in 2014, was also reviewed by Reuters. 
Company insiders say the Hover episode was a defining moment for some managers inside Nissan, leading them to question the agenda of a man who had been universally lauded for bringing Nissan back from the brink of bankruptcy.
At the same time, the sources acknowledge there was little resistance among the executive committee and other management to Ghosn's support for Hover and one other dealership decision in the Middle East that had raised eyebrows within Nissan.
""In so many ways it was assumed that what he said would not need to be questioned. That applies to just about every decision he made,"" one of the sources said.
TOO MUCH POWER
Looking back at Ghosn's reign, it is clear that too much power was concentrated in one man, and that management did not do enough, Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa told employees in a town hall meeting one week after Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest. 
""For 19 years, management, myself included, we allowed his high-handedness, allowed wrongdoings, and regret for that is what I think we all feel,"" he said, according to a copy of his speech reviewed by Reuters.
""Our biggest and most urgent task....is to undo the negative legacy that resulted from years of Ghosn's leadership and corporate governance,"" he added.
Last week, Nissan and major shareholder Renault said they would break up the all-powerful chairmanship position held by Ghosn, with the chairman of Renault serving as head of the alliance but not as chairman of Nissan.
An external committee is due to make recommendations this month on changing Nissan's corporate governance including procedures for executive appointments and compensation.
The re-evaluation of Ghosn's legacy is also driving a broader shift in Nissan's strategy, particularly Ghosn's practice of setting ambitious objectives for sales and profitability called 'commitments', where managers were held to account if they were not delivered.
""If you couldn't meet them then you'd be in trouble, those numerical targets came to feel like threats,"" Saikawa told the town hall meeting. ""Now, we have to change this, work out something that is healthier.""
PLETHORA OF ACCUSATIONS
Not until 2017 did a lone internal auditor, Hidetoshi Imazu, discreetly start making checks into dealings that Nissan now says were orchestrated by Ghosn.
Imazu had been aware of queries by Nissan's external auditor Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC about the purpose of a Dutch unit Zi-A Capital, according to one source. Payments for Nissan-owned luxury apartments used by Ghosn were made through Zi-A Capital and its units, sources have previously said. 
Imazu's concerns also followed a June 2017 Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-renault-nissan-bonuses/exclusive-renault-nissan-considers-hidden-bonus-plan-documents-idUSKBN1941FU that Renault-Nissan alliance bankers had drawn up plans to pay millions of dollars in undisclosed bonuses to Ghosn and other managers through a separate Dutch unit, the source said. 
Saikawa would only learn of the probe around October last year after Imazu and Hari Nada, head of Nissan's CEO office and an ally Imazu later teamed up with, had turned their findings over to prosecutors, two sources said.
Nissan declined to make Imazu, Nada and Saikawa available for comment on this article.
Tokyo prosecutors have accused Ghosn of under-reporting $82 million in compensation for 2010-2018 - pay he had arranged to receive after his retirement. 
He has also been charged with temporarily shifting personal losses to Nissan after a foreign exchange contract went sour and improperly steering $14.7 million in Nissan funds to a firm owned by Saudi businessman Khaled Al-Juffali.
Ghosn has said he is innocent and believed the compensation arrangements had been vetted by experts. Both Ghosn and the Khaled Juffali Company have asserted the $14.7 million in payments were for legitimate business purposes.
""Mr. Ghosn is innocent of the charges brought against him and he will be vindicated,"" the statement from Ghosn's spokesman said. 
Nissan investigators continue to pursue a number of other leads with the probe expanding as whistleblowers come forward, one source said.
The alleged schemes took so long to come to light, sources with knowledge of the probe said, due to Ghosn's practice of conveying his wishes verbally to trusted lieutenants rather than in writing. Many payments were made via the 'CEO Reserve', a budget for unplanned expenses, and were made through unconsolidated units which did not require vetting by the CFO or external auditors, they said.
In addition to the case involving Juffali, one key focus of the automaker's probe is a sum of more than $30 million in Nissan funds Ghosn arranged to have transferred via the CEO Reserve to a Nissan distributor in Oman owned by businessman Suhail Bahwan and whether the money was used to repay personal debt, the sources said.
Ghosn's spokesman said payments of $32 million made over nine years were rewards for the Bahwan firm being a top Nissan dealer. Such dealer incentives were not directed by the CEO and the funds were not used to pay any personal debt for Ghosn, the spokesman added.
One of the Nissan sources countered that dealer rewards were a planned event each year and were not paid via the CEO Reserve.
A spokesman for Bahwan did not respond to requests for comment.
The probe is also looking at the amount of money spent on Nissan-owned residences in Paris, Beirut and Rio de Janeiro and how the payments were made through units.
Ghosn's spokesman said officials at Nissan, including Saikawa and Nada, had been aware of and had approved of the provision of the residences. 
Investigators are also examining payments to Ghosn's sister, Claudine Bichara de Oliveira, for what two sources describe as a fictitious job advising on global donation activities.
Those payments date back to 2003 and total nearly $700,000 through 2016, documents seen by Reuters show.
An internal Nissan letter dated March 27, 2003 shows Ghosn asked Oliveira if she would work for Nissan's global donation advisory council and that she signed the agreement. A source said, however, there was no evidence that the council existed.
The spokesman, who also represents Ghosn's sister, said appropriate officials had approved the contract with the sister, and that Nissan officials opposed to Ghosn were attacking his family with false accusations.

Ghosn's first court appearance may be on May 23 as part of the preparations for the trial, NHK said, citing sources familiar with discussions between the prosecution and the defense.
Ghosn was released on $9 million bail this month after spending more than 100 days in a Tokyo detention center. He faces charges of under-reporting his salary at Nissan by about $82 million over nearly a decade.
Ghosn has said the charges are ""meritless"".

Investing.com -- German chemicals group  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) has more cause to regret its $63 billion acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) this morning, after a U.S. jury found that its weedkiller Roundup was responsible for causing the cancer of plaintiff Edwin Hardeman. It’s the second verdict against the company and worse is to come, as the current trial in California will now move on to assessing corporate liability.
Bayer is still arguing that the verdict is scientifically unfounded, but its arguments are falling on deaf ears as the market has wiped another 11% off the stock’s value this morning. That move alone is around $7 billion, which is more than the $6 billion in direct costs that analysts see as likely from the Roundup cases, so there’s an open question as to whether analysts have been too cautious or the market is overreacting.
Back in 2015, when management was streamlining the sprawling conglomerate, its shares were worth over twice as much. But the Monsanto acquisition, intended to make it the global leader in agrichemicals, has not only brought a whole bunch of legacy legal liabilities, it has also created a lack of focus that has hit operations at the rest of the group. Those problems will remain even if the direct costs of Roundup can be reasonably contained.
Aside from Bayer, markets are flat to lower, content to await the result of today's Federal Reserve meeting and tomorrow's EU summit before making any more major moves. Germany's Dax is down 0.8%, while the FTSE 100 is unchanged and the benchmark Stoxx 600 is down 0.3% at 383.24.
U.K.-based satellite group  Inmarsat  (LON:ISA) is up 16.5% after receiving a bid from private equity interests, and Hermes (PA:HRMS), the French luxury group famous for its scarves and bags, is up 1.1% after posting another set of results that showed its business in China is still thriving, despite all the talk of an economic slowdown there.
On the downside, the big mining companies in the FTSE 100 are all lagging, due partly to fresh news of problems in U.S.-China trade talks and to a sharp drop in iron ore prices overnight. Brazilian giant Vale (NYSE:VALE), which has been in regulators’ crosshairs since a fatal dam collapse earlier in the year, announced on Tuesday it had received court permission reopen one of its largest mines, which would ease a global supply bottleneck. It had said earlier in the week that it would have to close another large mine temporarily due to regulatory issues."

The Topix index is up 8 percent so far this year, lagging all developed stock benchmarks except for those in New Zealand, Israel and Singapore, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Weak global demand has weighed on Japan but a recession is unlikely given more stable capital expenditure and consumption, Goldman says in a March 20 note. The firm lifted its 3-month and 12-month targets for the Topix to 1,650 and 1,675, respectively, and raised earnings growth estimates for the next financial year, as it cut projections for fiscal 2018.
“The market is skeptical about the sustainability of Japanese profit growth, particularly since profits and margins have reached peak levels,” analysts led by Kathy Matsui wrote in the note. “However, despite weak 3Q FY18 earnings results, we still believe that growth is sustainable, albeit at a more muted pace.”
Goldman raised its EPS growth estimate for Japan to 5.6 percent from 3.1 percent previously, assuming a foreign-exchange rate of 105 yen per dollar. It cited “continued, albeit more subdued” earnings growth, supportive valuations, progress in the labor market, corporate governance reforms, corporate buybacks, and the Bank of Japan’s stock purchases for reasons behind the anticipated strength in Japanese equities in fiscal 2019.
Appetite for Japanese equities have yet to pick up, however, with foreigners continuing to net sell local stocks in the cash market. Foreign investors have offloaded a net 1.5 trillion yen of local equities this year through to March 8, according to data from the Japan Exchange Group.
Matsui also highlights China as a potential risk factor. “Since Japanese equities remain highly sensitive to the global economic cycle, the outlook for Japan’s most important export markets -- China and the U.S. -- as well as the outcome of trade talks will be critical determinants of the market’s direction in FY19,” she said.
Investors have cut their allocations of Japan stocks to 3 percent overweight from 10 percent as China growth concerns remain, according to a recent survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).

808,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 03:40AM ET</span>",Second U.S. jury finds Bayer's Roundup caused cancer,"By Jim Christie and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Tuesday found Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's glyphosate-based Roundup weed killer caused cancer, a blow to the company eight months after another jury issued a $289 million verdict over similar claims in a different case.
Tuesday's unanimous jury decision in San Francisco federal court, which came after five days of deliberation, was not a finding of Bayer's liability for the cancer of plaintiff Edwin Hardeman. Liability and damages will be decided by the same jury in a second trial phase beginning on Wednesday.
Bayer, which denies allegations that glyphosate or Roundup cause cancer, in a statement on Tuesday said it was disappointed with the jury's initial decision. Bayer acquired  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), the longtime maker of Roundup, for $63 billion last year.
""We are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto's conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman's cancer,"" the company said.
Shares in Bayer were down 9.6 percent at 0709 GMT in early Frankfurt trade.
Glyphosate is the world's most widely used weed killer. Monsanto's Roundup was the first glyphosate-based weed killer but is no longer patent-protected and many other versions are now available. Bayer does not provide sales figures for the product. 
The case was only the second of some 11,200 Roundup lawsuits to go to trial in the United States. Another California man was awarded $289 million in August after a state court jury found Roundup caused his cancer, sending Bayer shares plunging at the time. That award was later reduced to $78 million and is on appeal.
Bayer had claimed that jury was overly influenced by plaintiffs' lawyers allegations of corporate misconduct and did not focus on the science.
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria called such evidence ""a distraction"" from the scientific question of whether glyphosate causes cancer. He split the Hardeman case into two phases: one to decide causation, the other to determine Bayer's potential liability and damages.
Under Chhabria's order, the second phase would only take place if the jury found Roundup to be a substantial factor in causing Hardeman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The jury found that it was on Tuesday.
NOT AN ABERRATION
Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said Tuesday’s decision showed that the August jury verdict was not an aberration and that the Hardeman case could be an indication of what may happen in future similar cases.
Some legal experts had said Chhabria's decision was beneficial to Bayer, which says decades of studies and regulatory evaluations have shown the weed killer to be safe for human use.
""We will only really know whether it works for Bayer to isolate scientific issues once we see more trials,” said Adam Zimmerman, a law professor focusing on mass torts at Los Angeles-based Loyola Law School.
Chhabria has scheduled another bellwether trial for May and a third trial is likely to take place this year. All three cases will be split into causation and liability phases.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators have found that glyphosate is not likely carcinogenic to humans. But the World Health Organization's cancer arm in 2015 reached a different conclusion, classifying glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""
In the trial's second phase, Hardeman's lawyers will be allowed to present evidence allegedly showing the company's efforts to improperly influence scientists, regulators and the public about the safety of Roundup. 
Hardeman's lawyers, Aimee Wagstaff and Jennifer Moore, said they look forward to presenting that evidence to the jury to hold Monsanto accountable.
""Now we can focus on the evidence that Monsanto has not taken a responsible, objective approach to the safety of Roundup,"" they said in a statement.
Chhabria is overseeing more than 760 Roundup cases for which Hardeman's was a so-called bellwether trial intended to help determine the range of damages and define settlement options for the others.
Another Roundup trial is scheduled to begin in California state court in Oakland on March 28, involving a couple who claim Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The move is due to “cooling growth and intensified competition,” the article noted, adding that the company is also concerned about trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and regulatory clampdowns.
Shares in gaming companies, including Tencent, were dragged down and saw billions of dollars wiped off their market value last year as China halted its gaming approval process amid growing criticism of games for being violent and addictive for young people in the country.
Tencent’s stocks recovered this year after Beijing resumed the game approval process in December.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - All of  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Corp's flagship coffee brand Archer Farms will be certified fair trade by 2022, the company and Fair Trade USA told Reuters on Wednesday, a victory for that movement, which seeks to make sure producers are adequately compensated for their labor.
Coffee futures are currently trading near 13-year lows, weighed down by a record-large Brazilian crop. Prices are below the cost of production in most countries, forcing some farmers out of business and prompting concern from the industry on its long-term ability to source good coffee.
Archer Farms, Target's flagship-owned coffee brand, sells about six million pounds of coffee each year. Currently, about 20 percent of Archer Farms coffee is fair trade certified. 
The United States imported about 3.5 billion pounds of coffee in the 2018/2019 season, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
Fair Trade USA, the leading certifier of such products in North America, works to institute a floor price for farmers; for coffee, that minimum price is $1.40 per pound and farmers receive an additional 20 cents per pound sold. 
""The current market is nothing short of a disaster for coffee farmers,"" said Paul Rice, founder and CEO of Fair Trade USA.

The most active coffee futures contract fell last week to 94.65 cents per pound, the lowest since 2005. Farmers have been searching for ways to find pricing alternatives, including separate pricing mechanisms for high-grade specialty beans.

Overnight, Bloomberg citing people familiar with the matter reported that U.S. officials are concerned that China might refuse to accept U.S. demands in the countries’ ongoing trade talks. Meanwhile, Chinese negotiators want to receive more assurances that tariffs imposed on Chinese goods would be lifted once a deal is struck.
The report came after the state-owned Xinhua news agency said last Friday that the two sides have made progress toward striking a trade deal. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He had a telephone conversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer last Thursday, the report said, without giving further details.
Meanwhile, a Trump administration official said on Tuesday that Lighthizer and Mnuchin plan to travel to China next week for a new round of trade talks with Liu.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd said on Wednesday its new Galaxy flagship smartphones were selling well in China and it was confident it could reverse the recent slump in its fortunes in the world's biggest smartphone market.
Samsung's market share has plunged from about 20 percent in 2013 to less than 1 percent currently as fast-growing Chinese rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd proved more agile in responding to the latest trends.
""It has been tough in China in the last two years. We have changed everything from our organization and people to distribution channels,"" Samsung Electronics Co-Chief Executive DJ Koh told shareholders at the firm's annual general meeting.
""I think our flagship and mid-price models, these two products will bring a lot of change to the China market ... I am positive.""
While Samsung remains the world's largest smartphone maker with nearly a fifth of global unit sales, it underperformed a slumping market last year and has closed one of its mobile phone manufacturing plants in China.
The South Korean tech giant is pinning its hopes for a fight-back on its latest handset featuring a big, bending screen and the first 5G connection in a premium phone, a feature analysts do not expect Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to match until 2020.
FRUSTRATED SHAREHOLDERS
The upbeat outlook for mobile devices in China contrasts with the company's more pessimistic take on 2019, with trade tensions, weak economic growth and softer demand for memory chips expected to weigh on operations.
""We are expecting many difficulties this year such as slowing growth in major economies and risks over global trade conflicts,"" Co-Chief Executive Kim Ki-nam told the meeting.
Some shareholders vented their frustration and took the microphone to berate executives.
""If you're paid a lot of annual pay, you should work harder. I'm asking the management to do good work,"" one shareholder told the board.
The meeting drew more than double the usual crowd following a stock split last year which made it easier for retail investors to own Samsung stock. There was a long queue around the Samsung building to get in, and some shareholders complained they were getting hungry as the meeting dragged on.
Samsung is seeking new growth in areas such as network equipment manufacturing as sales of its mainstay chips and smartphones begin to drop.

As expected, shareholders voted to approve the appointment of board directors.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) on Wednesday said it will not pay short-term bonuses to most executives, a move that could help it avoid possible board removal should investors vote against its remuneration practices for the second consecutive year.
The country's largest listed wealth manager has been embroiled in accusations of deception at a government-mandated inquiry into misconduct in the financial sector. The business subsequently lost its chairman and chief executive officer and haemorrhaged billions of dollars in funds.
""The board understands that many of our shareholders are disappointed with AMP's business and financial performance in 2018,"" Chairman David Murray said in the wealth manager's annual report published on Wednesday.
""Reflecting the circumstances of last year, the board decided to award zero short-term incentives for AMP's group leadership team in 2018,"" excluding unit AMP Capital, which was not directly connected to any accusations raised in the inquiry.
The deferred part of bonuses for a number of former executives will also be forfeit, Murray said.
AMP believed shareholders had voted against pay plans last year in response to ""wider issues"" in the business as well as concerns about its remuneration framework, which was now being re-designed, Murray said.
Under Australian corporate rules, if more than a quarter of shareholders vote against a pay proposal for two years running, they can call for the board to be removed.
The annual report also showed Francesco De Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), who began his term as chief executive officer on Dec. 1, was paid A$1.2 million ($847,440) cash in 2018, reflecting a buy-out payment to leave previous employer  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN).
At the year-long Royal Commission inquiry last year, AMP revealed it charged fees without rendering services and had attempted to deceive regulators. The wealth manager denied any malicious intention and said the causes were administrative.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's commercial airplane division, facing its biggest crisis in years following deadly crashes of its flagship 737 MAX aircraft, has brought in a new vice president of engineering while dedicating another top executive to the aircraft investigations, a company email showed on Tuesday.
The management reshuffle comes as Europe and Canada said they would seek their own guarantees over the safety of Boeing's 737 MAX, further complicating plans to get the aircraft flying worldwide after they were grounded in the wake of crashes that killed more than 300 people.
John Hamilton, formerly both vice president and chief engineer in Boeing's Commercial Airplanes division, will focus solely on the role of chief engineer, the unit's Chief Executive Officer Kevin McAllister told employees on Tuesday in an email seen by Reuters.
""This will allow him to fully dedicate his attention to the ongoing accident investigations,"" McAllister said, adding that the staffing changes were needed as ""we prioritize and bring on additional resources for the ongoing accident investigations.""
Lynne Hopper - who previously led Test & Evaluation in Boeing's Engineering, Test & Technology group - has been named vice president of Engineering, McAllister said.
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment but confirmed the authenticity of the email. 
The shakeup showed how the world's largest planemaker was freeing up engineering resources as it faces scrutiny during crash investigations while also maintaining production of its money-spinning 737 single-aisle aircrafts.
Previously, Hamilton served as the vice president of engineering for Boeing Commercial Airplanes from April 2016 through March 2019, according to a biography on Boeing's website. 
From July 2013 through March 2016, Hamilton served as the vice president of Safety, Security and Compliance and oversaw the Commercial Airplanes Organization Designation Authorization - a program that takes on specific safety certification duties on behalf of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
Lawmakers and safety experts are questioning how thoroughly regulators vetted the MAX model and how well pilots were trained on new features. 
For now, global regulators have grounded the existing fleet of more than 300 MAX aircraft, and deliveries of nearly 5,000 more - worth well over $500 billion - are on hold. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hv2btC)

Boeing shares rose 0.3 percent on Tuesday, to close at $373.43. They are still down more than 11 percent since the crash in Ethiopia, wiping out over $25 billion off its market share.

817,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 07:39PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Ahead
It’s Fed day tomorrow and while the decision is almost certain, the press conference could bring some market-moving information.
The Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision on interest rates at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
There is more than 90% chance that the Fed will keep rates steady.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said that the central bank can remain patient and recent economic data has supported his thesis.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve’s NowCast of GDP growth has it just at an annual rate of 0.4%.
“The statement after the meeting will have to balance weakness in the current quarter, disappointment over household spending and optimism about business investment,” GrantThorton Chief Economist Diane Swonk wrote.
2. Watch the Dot Plot
The interest rate decision will likely play second fiddle to the Fed's economic projection, with many estimating that the dot plot – showing projections of where each Fed governor expects the interest rates to be at certain points in the future – will be revised downward.
The Fed's December dot plot signaled two rate hikes were in the pipeline for 2019, but with signs of a global slowdown, many economists expect the number of rate hikes will fall to only one this year.
""The FOMC decision and subsequent comments clearly establishes the Powell Put which means that Federal Reserve will not do anything intentionally to endanger the stock market and the domestic economy,"" said Doug Roberts at Channel Capital Research. ""This represents a continuation of the policy put in place by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and continued by his successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen.""
3. Are You Eating Your Cereal?
On the earnings front,  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) is seen reporting 69 cents a share in earnings for the fiscal-third quarter, down from 79 cents a year ago, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. Revenue for the maker of Cheerios and other packaged foods and Blue Buffalo pet foods, is forecast at $4.19 billion, up from $3.88 billion a year ago.

818,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 07:37PM ET</span>","FedEx cuts profit forecast again on economy, Express woes","By Lisa Baertlein and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) on Tuesday cut its 2019 profit forecast for the second time in three months, sending its shares down more than 5 percent and fueling fresh worries it is losing ground to delivery rivals such as  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) DHL Group.
The profit warning and weak quarterly results were another blow to FedEx, which slashed its forecast in December citing a sharp downturn in worldwide trade. 
The package delivery industry is widely seen as a bellwether for the global economy.
""Slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue,"" FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said in a statement on Tuesday.
Executives also blamed the results on the cost of launching year-round, six-days-per-week operations at FedEx Ground in the United States and continued weakness in its international Express business, which includes former Dutch delivery company TNT Express. 
FedEx bought that struggling business in 2016 for $4.8 billion and has had difficulties integrating it into its own network.
FedEx expects integration costs to exceed $1.5 billion and said in a regulatory filing that it will complete a project allowing packages to flow between the FedEx Express and TNT Express networks by the end of 2020, more than four years after acquiring the Dutch delivery company. 
Adding to those challenges, a 2017 cyberattack on TNT's European technology systems cost FedEx some $300 million to fix and sent a number of high-value, time-sensitive customers into the arms of stronger operators in Europe.
""It's cutthroat over there,"" said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. ""FedEx Express has some serious problems."" 
Germany's Deutsche Post DHL earlier this month said it saw no noticeable signs of a slowdown on the horizon, adding that its broad geographic and operational base would make it resilient even if global economic growth weakened. [L5N20U0TC] 
Atlanta-based UPS has less international exposure than FedEx and said in January that U.S. results helped buffer the impact of global economic softening. [L3N1ZV4LF] 
FedEx has shaken up management, including at its Express division, offered voluntary buyouts and limited discretionary spending to stem declines. 
Profit for the fiscal third quarter that included FedEx's peak holiday shipping and gift return season fell to $797 million, or $3.03 per diluted share, below analysts' average estimate of $3.11 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""It looks like UPS had a better holiday season,"" said Morrow Roberson, who added that FedEx also pinned weakness in the quarter on costs related to leasing additional vehicles to handle volume spikes.
FedEx now expects to earn $15.10 to $15.90 for the 2019 fiscal year ended May 31. Analysts had predicted full-year fiscal 2019 earnings per share of $15.97, on average.

In after-market trading, FedEx shares were down 5.5 percent at $171.36.

819,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 07:30PM ET</span>",How to Trade for a Fed Meeting Full of Potential Wild Cards,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s policy decision Wednesday is being eagerly anticipated by investors looking for further details about what the pivot to patience on rates means, how the new “dot plot” will look and how policy makers will approach inflation-targeting and balance-sheet runoff.
While there’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding these issues, markets are optimistic as shown by a rally in stocks and cross-asset volatility near historic lows. There’s a feeling in markets that policy clarity is improving not just at the Fed, but also at central banks in Europe, Japan and China.
Having said that, there are a number of possible wild cards that may come out of the Fed decision, due 2 p.m. Wednesday in Washington. Here are some thoughts from analysts and strategists on how to navigate markets through the Fed announcement.
UBS Group AG (Stuart Kaiser et al.) - New York
The euro has larger average and absolute moves -- 0.9 percent and +/- 1.2 percent, respectively -- than assets like the S&P 500 or 10-year Treasury yields when dots are lowered, strategists led by Kaiser wrote in a note Monday. The yen has also responded to lower dots, but to a lesser extent, they said.
“FX moves suggest a global risk-on dynamic, so low FX implied volatility offers attractive optionality for the FOMC,” UBS said.
Most of the impact on stocks from the Fed meeting will come before the announcement, they said. The S&P 500 has moved +/- 0.6 percent on days of Federal Open Market Committee statements since 2012.
However, on the five occasions dots were lowered, the gauge rallied an average 1.8 percent in the week before the meeting, “suggesting the moves were well-telegraphed,” the strategists wrote. S&P 500 returns were negative on average in the following week, he said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) (Zach Pandl, Ian Wright) - New York/London
Goldman is looking for confirmation that the FOMC’s move away from trying to tighten financial conditions will last for some time, which is one of the key points in the company’s medium-term bearish U.S. dollar view, strategists led by Pandl wrote March 15.
“Focus on a potential shift by the Fed to an average inflation target remains, and is likely contributing to U.S. break-even inflation and real rates moving in opposite directions recently,” strategists led by Wright wrote March 18.
During four periods since 1980 when the Fed held rates relatively high for an extended time, “at face value we find equities tended to do relatively well, although toward the end or the beginning of each period performance appears more mixed,” Wright said, adding that the tech bubble influences some of the observations.
Natixis (Joseph Lavorgna) - New York
Investors may be overly optimistic about the Fed’s ability to deliver fully on both the interest-rate and balance-sheet fronts, Lavorgna wrote in a note Tuesday, noting that the futures market now expects the next move on rates to be a decline.
“The size of the Fed’s portfolio is currently $3.79 trillion, down from a peak of $4.25 trillion in February 2017. The consensus assumes it will stop shrinking at $3.50 trillion,” Lavorgna wrote. “If the Fed does not confirm these expectations, a renewed bout of market turbulence could begin. Stay tuned.”
BMO Capital Markets (Jon Hill, Ian Lyngen) - New York
The Fed decision has a strong possibility of being a “buy the news, sell the fact” event given extremely dovish expectations, Hill and Lyngen wrote in a March 18 note.
They’re watching the 2s/10s curve, “particularly if the set-up for Wednesday corresponded to price movements probing multi-week lows,” they said. “This would indicate that momentum going into the decision is clearly leaning toward a flattening bias, at least in this benchmark curve, and open the door for a quick steepening back toward 20 basis points were the median 2019 dot to imply zero additional hikes.”
“The Fed’s aim is certain to be a continuing of the peaceful low-vol regime,” the strategists wrote. “Although the FOMC represents a potential risk event,” they said, “any resulting vol spike would likely be interpreted as a Powell-produced policy error.”
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). (Marko Kolanovic et al.) - New York
Commodity sectors of the stock market are likely to benefit from the Fed’s greater tolerance of an inflation overshoot, strategists led by Kolanovic wrote in a March 14 note. Those include European miners, beneficiaries of rising oil prices and stocks that are helped by rising inflation.
They raised their rating of commodities to a 2 percent overweight from a 0 percent active weight in the note, a monthly report on global asset allocation.
“Our commodity overweight also serves as an inflation hedge, given the Fed’s expected strategic shift,” they said.
BNY Mellon (John Velis) - New York
Currencies are unlikely to react heavily to the FOMC statement, according to Velis.
“With central banks around the world seemingly simultaneously warning of downside risks and setting policy to the dovish side of the spectrum, it would require the Fed to come out and practically assure us that rate cuts will be seen in the future (or conversely, suddenly rediscover their previous tightening bias) to upset the stability (some might say dead calm) currently observed in the currency markets,” Velis wrote in a note Tuesday. “We view this as a low-probability risk.”
Evercore ISI (Krishna Guha) - Washington
While the Fed’s plan to conclude its balance-sheet reduction is likely to come in the second half of the year, “when the reinvestment plan comes, it will skew towards bills and other shorter-dated Treasuries, favoring a slightly steeper yield curve,” according to Guha. Any comments from Powell in the press conference on reinvestment should be consistent with that, he said.
AMP Capital Investors Ltd. (Nader Naeimi) - Sydney
Naeimi, a portfolio manager at AMP Capital Investors, is going long the dollar versus a basket of currencies including the yen, Thai baht and South African rand, into the Fed meeting.
“The Fed won’t be hawkish -- so rates will be on hold -- but the Fed will be more hawkish than what’s priced into the markets,” Naeimi said. “Markets will be surprised when the Fed decides to go ahead with what’s planned instead of calling an end” to the balance-sheet rolloff.
Mizuho Bank Ltd. (Vishnu Varathan) - Singapore
“A pure short on the long end may be also on the cards, if one believes that ‘patient’ has been too stretched as of now, and so long-end yields may have to go a little higher (or at least adjust off the lows),” Varathan, the head of economics and strategy, said.
Pendal Group (Vimal Gor) - Sydney
Gor is long duration at the front end of the Treasury curve, and has yield-curve steepeners in place, he said in an interview Tuesday.
“The market will take virtually all of their utterances as dovish,” he said of the FOMC.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 07:05PM ET</span>","Scrap foreign ownership caps, investor group tells China","By Samuel Shen and Noah Sin
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - An industry body representing global asset managers in Asia has urged China to lift foreign ownership caps in listed companies, two weeks after the restrictions disrupted overseas buying of a Chinese stock and just as foreign inflows are set to swell.
In a policy paper released on Wednesday, financial lobbyist ASIFMA called on regulators to abolish the 10 percent individual and 30 percent aggregate foreign ownership ceilings in a China-listed company.
""If these limits are not removed, we are afraid that foreign institutional investors may not be able to invest in some of the listed companies, particularly the small cap companies,"" ASIFMA said.
Fang Xinghai, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said this month China is not considering relaxing the foreign ownership restriction.
His comments came after regulators halted foreign share purchases in Han's Laser Technology following the breach of the 30 percent cap. Index provider MSCI then deleted the Shenzhen-listed stock from its global benchmarks.
MSCI is expected to quadruple China's weighting in its emerging markets index later this year. Rival index publishers FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices also plan to add Chinese stocks to their global benchmarks.
""With the inclusion factor increasing further, instances of foreign ownership reaching its limit will likely become more commonplace if local regulation does not change,"" said Charles Sunnucks, fund manager for emerging markets at Jupiter Asset Management.
The index weight adjustments triggered by foreign ownership rules ""could be incrementally negative for market sentiment"" if it makes rebalancing more volatile for fund managers, said Laura Wang, chief China strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
The immediate risk is small, however, since only 18 of China's 3,500-listed companies currently have foreign investors that control more than 13 percent of the company's market capitalization, said Wang.
That risk could rise in tandem with foreign ownership in China and its weight in global indices.
China could draw up to $456 billion from global investors, if and when all A-shares are incorporated into MSCI's benchmark index, J.P. Morgan said in a report this month.
SHORT SWING EXEMPTION
ASIFMA also urged regulators to exempt global asset managers from the so-called short swing profit rule.
The rule, designed to prevent insider trading, bars shareholders owning more than 5 percent of a listed company to profit from selling or buying its shares within six months of the original purchase or sale, according to the ASIFMA report.
But it could also constrain large international investment firms that are not necessarily insiders but can manage hundreds of funds with each owning a small piece of a listed company.
""That surely is not the original intent of these rules,"" said Eugenie Shen, head of ASIFMA's asset management group.
China's securities regulator should explain the circumstances in which affiliates could be treated as the same unit, or 'acting in concert', ASIFMA said, calling the current lack of clarity ""the biggest obstacle for larger foreign institutional investors"".

(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Sage Therapeutics Inc's drug for postpartum depression, marking the first approval of a treatment specifically developed for the condition that affects a new mother's ability to care for herself or her baby.
The company said the list price for the treatment, to be sold under the brand name Zulresso, would be $7,450 per vial resulting in a projected average cost of $34,000 per patient before discounts. Sage shares rose more than 4 percent to $163 in extended trading.
The drug, which is administered as a single 60-hour intravenous infusion, is chemically identical to the hormone allopregnanolone. 
""You're talking about someone coming into the hospital or treatment center on a Friday and go home Sunday night,"" Sage's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jonas told Reuters ahead of the approval.
Postpartum depression affects one in nine women and is a common complication of childbirth, with onset typical during pregnancy or within four weeks of delivery. 
In severe cases, the mother may have suicidal tendencies, may not want to nurse her child and might even harm the baby.
Existing treatments include conventional antidepressants that require weeks to take full effect, psychotherapy and even shock therapy, none of which have been specifically approved for postpartum depression.
Zulresso's label will include a so-called black box warning flagging risks of excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness, and will only be made available through a restricted distribution program at certified facilities where the patient can be monitored for these side effects, the FDA said.
Patients will be advised to avoid activities such as driving until feelings of sleepiness have gone away.
Zulresso is designed to reduce depression symptoms by targeting receptors of the neurotransmitter known as GABA, helping restore the normal balance in the brain that is disrupted around the time of childbirth.
During clinical trials, the drug was shown to reduce depression symptoms within hours, with patients maintaining the benefit for up to a month and a half, Jonas said, adding the ""one and done"" treatment will require no maintenance doses.
Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja expects Zulresso peak sales of about $300 million to $400 million. 
But the inconvenience of a lengthy hospital stay for the required 60-hour infusion may limit sales. 
""I do not see Zulresso having significant uptake given the requirements for IV infusion and duration of the infusion,"" Dr. Sanjay Mathew, a member of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, told Reuters.
Sage has another drug for postpartum depression under development, SAGE-217, that will be in far more convenient pill form. In clinical trials, it has appeared to be effective in rapidly reducing symptoms without the loss of consciousness side effect.

Although inconvenient, Zulresso is likely worthwhile for mothers suffering from the disorder who face dangerous obstacles in caring for their newborn, said Dr. Marla Wald, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University.

(Reuters) - Viacom Inc said on Tuesday it had begun warning DirecTV's 24 million subscribers its channels could stop being shown on the AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc-owned satellite TV service if it fails to reach a new contract by midnight March 22.
Viacom, the owner of MTV, Nickelodeon, BET, and Comedy Central, accused AT&T of abusing its powers after buying  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX), which owns the Warner Bros Hollywood studios and HBO premium cable network.
Amid a wave of media consolidation, these types of conflicts have increased in frequency. In November AT&T-owned HBO stopped being carried on Dish's satellite television service after failing to reach a new deal and has not returned to the service. AT&T's DirecTV is a satellite TV rival to Dish. 
In the current round of negotiations, Viacom balked at new deal terms that restricted its ability to strike deals with other digital distributors or launch new direct to consumer streaming services, said one source briefed on the negotiations.
AT&T has also insisted on terms that would benefit AT&T's advanced advertising business at the expense of its competitors, according to the source. 
An AT&T spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.
""Having recently acquired Time Warner, AT&T appears intent on using its new market power to prioritize its own content at the expense of consumers, who are growing increasingly dissatisfied with paying more for less,"" Bob Bakish, chief executive officer of Viacom, said in an internal memo seen by Reuters.

Viacom said it has reached new distribution deals with Altice USA Inc,  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate former Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) executive Steve Dickson to head the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the White House said on Tuesday, as the aviation agency grapples with fallout from two fatal crashes in Boeing (NYSE:BA) airplanes.
Reuters reported on March 8 that Trump was expected to soon nominate Dickson to run the 45,000-employee agency that oversees U.S. airspace. Dickson left Delta in October after 27 years. 
The FAA, which has been run by an acting chief for 14 months, is facing mounting questions over its certification of the Boeing 737 MAX from federal prosecutors and lawmakers. Dickson's nomination had been in the works for months before the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Transportation Department's inspector general office said it planned to audit the FAA certification of the Boeing 737 MAX.
The office is developing the scope and objectives of the review and is expected to formally announce and begin audit work as soon as possible, an official told Reuters.
The FAA declined to comment, while Boeing said it would cooperate in the audit.
Last year, Reuters and other outlets reported that Trump was considering his longtime personal pilot, John Dunkin, to lead the FAA, an idea that came under criticism from some lawmakers. 
At Delta, Dickson oversaw more than 13,000 pilots and an internal support team of 400 employees. He flew the A320, B27, B737, B757 and B767 during his career at Delta and is a former U.S. Air Force officer and F-15 fighter pilot.

The FAA is dealing with a number of other issues, including how to integrate drones into the nation's airspace and modernizing air traffic control.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lyft Inc's initial public offering (IPO) is oversubscribed based on commitments made so far by investors, making it more likely that the ride-hailing startup will fetch or even exceed the $23 billion valuation it is seeking, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The development indicates that many investors are willing to overlook uncertainty over Lyft's path to profitability and its strategy for autonomous driving, for fear of missing out on the biggest and most high-profile technology IPO since  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) in 2017.
Lyft started its IPO road show on Monday and has spent the last two days meeting with investors in New York, the sources said. It has set an indicative IPO price range of $62 to $68 per share and is set to price the IPO on March 28.
The exact level of oversubscription could not be learned. The sources cautioned that the IPO price is still uncertain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Lyft declined to comment.
Lyft's progress in its IPO could bode well for larger rival Uber Technologies Inc, which is planning to kick off its IPO in April, Reuters has reported. It has been valued by investment bankers at as much as $120 billion.
Lyft said on Monday it aims to raise up to $2 billion in its IPO at a fully diluted valuation of as much as $23 billion, which includes restricted stock. 
There will be more meetings in Boston and New York this week between investors and co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer, as well as Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts and Catherine Buan, vice president of investor relations.
Lyft is pitching investors on the simplicity of its business, while Uber is expected to play up its more diversified strategy, according to the sources. Both Lyft and Uber have yet to turn a profit, with Lyft reporting a loss of $911 million in 2018, wider than its $688 million loss in 2017. 
In meetings with investors this week at the St. Regis Hotel in New York, Lyft executives said the company would be profitable much sooner were it not for investments in areas such as its scooter business, the sources said. Lyft executives also said they expect the costs of processing transactions to come down, the sources added. 
The executives also told investors they ultimately want to oversee a fleet of tens of millions of autonomous vehicles, according to the sources.
Unlike Uber, which has developed its own self-driving division, Lyft has chosen to strike partnerships to expand in the sector, including with car parts suppliers Magna International Inc and Aptiv Plc. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is an investor in Lyft.
""We question Lyft's competitiveness when it comes to scaling its own autonomous driving system, but believe Lyft's 'platform' play for other autonomous driving players can help afford Lyft some time to either perfect or scale its own technology or secure a long-term partner,"" D.A. Davidson & Co analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday. 
The IPOs of Lyft and Uber represent a watershed for Silicon Valley's technology unicorns, which for years have snubbed the stock market in favor of raising capital privately, with investors happy to back their frothy valuations.
The market rally of the last few years, however, coupled with the desire of some of the startups' insiders to cash out, is leading many technology firms, including Airbnb Inc, Slack Technologies Inc and Stripe Inc, to plan market debuts. 
Rob Lutts, chief investment officer of Cabot Wealth Management in Salem, Massachusetts, said the transition to autonomous vehicles would be ""hugely disruptive"" for both Lyft and Uber, and found Lyft's IPO documents did not offer much detail on its plans. 
""I'm not sure they've figured out what they're going to do. It's early days for all of that,"" Lutts said.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 06:23PM ET</span>",Brazilian government likely to pay Petrobras $10 billion in transfer-of-rights dispute: report,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The Brazilian government is likely to pay around $10 billion to state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA to settle the so-called 'transfer-of-rights' dispute, newspaper Valor Economico reported on Tuesday, though the parties have not agreed on final terms.
The financial daily, citing a source with knowledge of the matter, said the payment was a reduction from a previous proposal of $14 billion. Valor in January had reported that the government had agreed on the higher figure, but the government subsequently denied the report.
The two sides are close to an agreement, the paper said, reiterating statements by public officials in recent weeks.
Petrobras, as the firm is widely known, did not respond to a request for comment. The economy ministry said that ""the negotiations continue"" and the final values ""will be announced when they are agreed upon between parties.""
The transfer-of-rights dispute dates back to a 2010 deal between the government and Petrobras relating to a huge share offering that would have diluted the government's stake.
To maintain control of the company, the government sold Petrobras the rights to explore 5 billion barrels of oil in an area off Brazil's coast for 74.8 billion reais at the time. With that money, it bought additional Petrobras shares.
Brazil's oil regulator now estimates there are around 17 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the area, and the government is seeking to auction rights for the exploration of the excess oil. First, the two sides need to resolve the dispute over the area, which will result in a significant payment to Petrobras. 
Companies bidding for the excess oil in the area would have to compensate Petrobras for investments the company already made in the blocs. A Bloomberg report on Tuesday said that compensation could reach as much as $9 billion, on top of more $9 billion it said Petrobras could earn from the government in the revision of the transfer-of-rights contract. Bloomberg did not identify its sources.

On Friday, Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said - without specifying the currency - that Petrobras and the government had started off 60 billion apart in their negotiating positions, but were now only 2 billion apart. The figures likely refer to dollars, as the two sides at one point each believed they were owed $30 billion.

Of those, 145 are worth at least $10 billion, making them decabillionaires. Now, the world contains two centibillionaires simultaneously.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). co-founder Bill Gates, once the world’s richest person, has again eclipsed the $100 billion threshold, joining Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).’s Jeff Bezos in the exclusive club, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Gates’s fortune, now $100 billion on the nose, hasn’t reached such heights since the dot-com boom, when Bezos was only beginning his march up the world’s wealth rankings. The Amazon founder is now worth $145.6 billion, having added $20.7 billion this year alone, while Gates has gained $9.5 billion in 2018.
These two fortunes underscore a widening wealth gap in the U.S., where those with the most capital are accumulating riches the fastest. It’s also a worldwide trend. France’s Bernard Arnault has an $86.2 billion fortune, equal to about 3 percent of his country’s economy. The net worth of Spain’s Amancio Ortega represents 5 percent of that nation’s gross domestic product. And then there’s Bidzina Ivanishvili, whose worth about a third of Georgia’s GDP.
The Gates and Bezos mega-fortunes may not last long. Gates has donated more than $35 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and said he intends to give away at least half of his wealth. Bezos, meanwhile, may be about to cede some of his fortune for a different reason: he and his wife Mackenzie are divorcing.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Top U.S. trade officials head to China next week for new trade talks,"By David Lawder and Roberta Rampton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plan to travel to China next week for another round of trade talks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, a Trump administration official said on Tuesday.
The resumption in face-to-face talks, the first since President Donald Trump delayed a March 1 deadline to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, marks an acceleration of the negotiations aimed at ending an eight-month trade war between the world's two largest economies.
""Talks with China are going very well,"" Trump said at the end of a White House news conference with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
Since Trump's delay of the March 1 tariff hike, the two sides have only negotiated by telephone and video link. 
The administration official confirming the new round of talks did not provide further details on the expected duration of the talks or any further rounds. The source, who was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter, spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that following next week's negotiation in Beijing, Liu would travel to Washington the week of April 1 as the two sides aim for a deal by the end of the month. The report, citing unnamed administration officials, said the trade talks were in the final stages.
The Journal report and Trump's latest upbeat comments contrasted with a Bloomberg report on Tuesday that progress in the talks was slowing as Chinese officials have ""stepped back"" from some initial promises they made on improving intellectual property protections demanded by the United States. 
Washington and Beijing have slapped import duties on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of each other's products in their dispute, raising costs, roiling financial markets, shrinking U.S. farm exports and disrupting manufacturing supply chains.
Washington has demanded that Beijing implement stronger protections for intellectual property rights and end policies that it says coerce U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms in exchange for access to the Chinese market - practices that Beijing has denied. The United States also is demanding that China rein in hefty industrial subsidies that it blames for the buildup of excess production capacity in China. 
Since late February, the two sides have been working to refine language on reform pledges that China intends to take, along with an enforcement mechanism aimed at ensuring Beijing will follow through on such changes.
But Chinese officials have sought an immediate end to the tariffs that Trump has imposed on about $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. Trump administration officials have not specified any plans for rolling back such duties.
The deal under negotiation also is widely expected to include increased Chinese purchases of American goods, including farm and energy commodities, to help reduce the U.S. goods trade deficit with China, which hit a record $419 billion last year.

Among purchases of U.S. goods under consideration are new Chinese orders for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co jetliners. But the grounding of the company's 737 MAX models following the recent Ethiopian Airlines crash have cast a shadow over immediate hopes for such a deal, according to industry sources.

District Supervisor Shamann Walton will also introduce legislation at a meeting of the city's board of supervisors to prohibit the manufacture and distribution of all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, on city property.
A statement from the City Attorney's office said the legislation would prevent e-cigarette company Juul from expanding on city property if engaged in the sale, manufacture and distribution of tobacco products.
Juul is the largest U.S. e-cigarette maker. Shares of  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc, which holds a 35 percent stake in the company, closed down 2.3 percent. 
""By law, before a new tobacco product goes to market, the Food and Drug Administration is supposed to conduct a review to evaluate its impact on public health. Inexplicably, the FDA has failed to do its job when it comes to e-cigarettes,"" City Attorney Dennis Herrera said.
Earlier in March, the FDA released formal plans to curb the sale of flavored e-cigarettes and slow a surge in teenage use of the popular nicotine devices. 
The proposal also mandated makers of e-cigarette products to submit a formal application to the FDA by August 2021 in order to keep selling them, a year earlier than previously proposed.
FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Tuesday that the regulator should consider whether pod-based nicotine products should be sold at all given the recent increase in the use of the products by American teens.
""I'm having debates about whether or not flavored products should be sold in convenience stores and I think the real debate is whether or not any of these products should be sold in convenience stores,"" Gottlieb, who is leaving the agency, said at the Brookings Institution in Washington.

A Juul spokesman said the proposed legislation would only limit adult smokers' access to products that could help them switch away from combustible cigarettes.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - IKEA is scouting Mexico's biggest cities for its first store locations in the country, the furniture retailer said, as it expands in Latin America to battle growing competition in its core U.S. and European markets. 
The Swedish chain known for modern and inexpensive designs is looking at sites in Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey, the company's local franchisee said.
""We're looking at the biggest cities in Mexico, with those three being the most important,"" said Antonia Banuelos-Leon, country marketing manager for IKEA Mexico, in an interview on Monday. ""We're also looking at the country as a whole.""
The company is likely to announce its plans within a month, and is considering various store formats, Banuelos-Leon said. She declined to comment on store numbers or the timeline.
Stores in Europe and the United States drive the majority of sales for Inter IKEA Group and its franchisees, but rival retailers, especially online, are increasingly vying for shoppers. IKEA has 427 stores across 52 markets, with more in the works aimed at growing its customer base.
Late last year, IKEA announced plans to enter Latin America, starting with Chile in 2020 followed by Colombia and Peru.
Banuelos-Leon said IKEA Mexico, which is part of IKEA franchisee Ikano Group, opened an office in Mexico City last April and has advertised job openings in the capital and Guadalajara in recent months. 
The country's dense capital area, with more than 20 million people and scant open space, could challenge IKEA's traditional model, which calls for vast warehouses on city outskirts packed with goods from lamps to couches and eateries known for their Swedish meatballs.

That model is changing. In January, IKEA announced plans to open its first store in the center of Paris, selling a full range of goods on a compact footprint.

834,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 04:20PM ET</span>",Cannabis Investors Eye Uruguay in Weed Export Push,"(Bloomberg) -- Serious marijuana money is starting to show up in Uruguay.
Almost six years after the South American country of 3.4 million people legalized cannabis, investors are betting Uruguay can become an export hub for medical marijuana as the industry expands around the world.
Silverpeak Life Sciences Uruguay Inc, one of the largest companies in the country’s nascent medical marijuana industry, is in talks with investment bankers to raise $35 million this year to quadruple production and build a larger extraction lab in 2020, according to chief executive officer and U.S. cannabis investor Jordan Lewis.
""Our planned and desired expansion would be about 25 tons next year and that should push us above $100 million in revenue,"" Lewis said.
Cannabis investors have poured money into the U.S. and Canada, seeking to take advantage as easing marijuana regulations create a massive legal market for a drug that was demonized for decades. Meanwhile, Uruguay’s weed economy has been slow to develop, despite a significant head start.
Silverpeak’s wholly owned Uruguayan subsidiary, Fotmer Corporation SA, has asked cannabis regulatory agency Ircca to increase its annual production permit to 400 tons of cannabis flowers, he said.
The company will need to raise about $150 million between 2020 and 2023, possibly from public capital markets or a “strategic alliance” with a larger corporation if demand for cannabis products warrants increasing flower production to that level, according to Lewis.

Silverpeak and rival ICC Labs, bought last year for $217 million by Aurora Cannabis, one of Canada’s most valuable cannabis companies, are among a handful of companies that have put money into Uruguay, investing in greenhouses and extraction labs with a goal of supplying medical cannabis to Latin America, Europe and Canada. This year could mark the start of commercial scale exports as producers seek trade permits and product certifications.
Billion Dollar Potential
Uruguay, nestled between Brazil and Argentina, has yet to see the significant investments that have boosted the cannabis industry in the U.S. and Canada, despite becoming the first nation to legalize weed in 2013. Ircca has approved cannabis projects worth $57 million since 2015 and is currently reviewing other permits for 21 projects worth approximately $40 million.
The pace of investment might change as big North American cannabis producers start to consider Uruguay as a destination, Lewis said. Uruguay could become the first country to reach $1 billion in annual exports of medical cannabis products in as soon as five years with enough government support, he said.
“As soon as next year it could be a $100 million plus industry based on our projections alone and when you factor in some of the other companies,” Lewis said in an interview at Fotmer’s office near Montevideo.
Lewis, who is also an investor in a Colorado cannabis business, founded British Columbia-based Silverpeak with a group of local investors shortly after making an unsuccessful bid for a recreational pot license in Uruguay in 2015. Fotmer built 18 greenhouses and a small extraction lab with $7 million committed by Silverpeak.
Silverpeak’s estimated harvest of 6 tons this year could generate as much as $40 million in revenue if Fotmer obtains permits to ship cannabis flowers and small quantities of CBD and THC extracts to Australia, Canada, the U.K. and Germany, Lewis said.

835,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 04:12PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Downed as Trade Talks Sour ,"Investing.com – The Dow fell Tuesday as gains in consumer discretionary stocks and expectations for the Federal Reserve to continue its pledge to keep rate hikes on hold were offset by reports of souring U.S.-China trade talks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.10%, the S&P 500 lost 0.01%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.12%. The Dow had been up about 196 points before the rally abruptly stalled.
Signs of mistrust between the U.S. and China poured cold water on expectations that a trade deal would be wrapped up sooner rather than later, prompting selling across trade-sensitive sectors such as industrials and materials.
Some U.S. officials fear that China is failing to honor certain trade concessions, Bloomberg reported Tuesday afternoon, citing people familiar with the negotiations. In addition, sources told Bloomberg China wants to cut the troubled Boeing 737 Max from the list of U.S. exports it would buy. Boeing (NYSE:BA) saw a rally trimmed to a small gain in regular trading and was off slightly after hours
The Bloomberg report arrived as a summit to conclude a U.S.-China trade deal was postponed from this month to April, with Beijing reportedly taking issue with Washington's demand for a unilateral enforcement framework.
Washington has argued that an enforcement framework is needed to ensure Beijing complies with eventual terms of a trade deal, or risk penalties for stepping out of line.
Beyond trade, consumer discretionary and health care delivered gains for the broader market led by L Brands (NYSE:LB) and Cigna (NYSE:CI).
Investor expectations for the Federal Reverse to deliver a dovish outlook on monetary policy on Wednesday also limited downside in the broader averages.
The central bank’s pledge to keep monetary policy tightening on hold has been a key driver for the rebound in stocks this year after the sharp slump at the end of last year.
Tech also proved a bright spot, albeit with modest gains on offer, thanks strong gains from chip stocks led by AMD.
Advanced Micro Devices rallied 11.8% as Morgan Stanley delivered an upbeat assessment of the chipmaker after it won as part of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s upcoming cloud-gaming offering.
""We continue to be impressed by AMD’s progress at using innovative approaches to expand its markets in all segments,"" analyst Joseph Moore added.
Among other chipmakers, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose 4% and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) added 1.9%. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) will report earnings on Wednesday after the market closes.
In other company news, Google unveiled a new streaming game service amid a push into the $140-billion gaming industry. The tech giant will compete with with Sony, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and possibly Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is reportedly working on a similar service.
On the economic front, U.S. factory orders showed little change from the previous month, growing just 0.1% in January, missing economists' expectations for a 0.3% increase.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and DaVita HealthCare (NYSE:DVA) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.
Twenty-First Century Fox A (NASDAQ:FOXA),  Monster Beverage  (NASDAQ:MNST) and JB Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT) were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."
836,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 03:17PM ET</span>",Makeup brand Glossier valued at over $1 billion in latest funding round,"(Reuters) - Glossier Inc, the online cosmetics company with a cult following among millennials, was valued at over $1 billion in a latest funding round led by Sequoia Capital, joining a clutch of billion-dollar makeup brands that are powered by the founders' social-media popularity.
The series D funding round, which raised $100 million, included some existing and new investors such as Tiger Global Management and Spark Capital, Glossier said.
Glossier's products have been worn by Beyonce, Chrissy Teigen, Miranda Kerr and other celebrities, and are known for their ""millennial pink"" packaging. 
The company, launched by U.S. lifestyle blogger Emily Weiss in 2014, has grown to over 200 employees and last year doubled its online sales to $100 million.
Glossier was valued at $390 million after a $52 million funding round one year ago, according to PitchBook Data.
With nearly 2 million Instagram followers, the brand has grabbed eyeballs with ads that feature everyday people, products that cater to a variety of skin tones and emphasize a natural, ""no-makeup"" look.
The company earlier this month launched ""Play,"" a brand that sells more colorful, flashier makeup, as part of efforts to expand its customer base.
Kylie Cosmetics, Pat McGrath Labs, Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty and Huda Beauty are some other brands with a valuation nearing or above $1 billion, according to media reports.
Glossier on Tuesday also said it had hired Vanessa Wittman, a former finance executive at Dropbox and Yahoo-owner Oath Inc, as its new chief financial officer. 
""Beauty consumers increasingly want to interact with brands and purchase products online,"" said Megan Quinn, general partner at Spark Capital. ""The industry's conglomerates are ill-equipped to retrofit their businesses to this new reality.""

837,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",China’s Boeing Threat Has More Bite Than Bark,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The trade war may finally start to bite for  Boeing Co .
The aerospace giant is the only non-consumer, non-tech U.S. company that gets more than $5 billion of revenue from China, and as such, it was initially assumed to be among companies that would be most affected by trade tensions. So far, however, the impact from tariff crossfire has been rather limited. That may have been a reflection of China’s need for Boeing (NYSE:BA) orders in the short term to support local airlines and an inclination to maintain a balance between the U.S. planemaker and its European counterpart, Airbus SE. An eagerness to ensure Boeing’s ongoing participation at an assembly center outside of Shanghai that’s co-owned by Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (known as Comac) and an important part of the country's strategy to build a home-grown aviation industry could have been another factor.
But now, with Boeing on the defensive, China’s calculation of its political interests may be shifting. China was the first country to ground the company’s 737 Max jet after the plane’s second fatal crash in just five months, and now it’s reportedly considering excluding the aircraft from a proposal to ramp up purchases of American goods.
China may now see an opening to establish itself as more of a leader in the aerospace industry, having already embarrassed the Federal Aviation Administration by leading a global charge to ground the Max that left the U.S. regulator isolated in its defense of the plane’s airworthiness and nearly the last of its brethren to temporarily ban the jet from commercial flight. China may be wont to relinquish its new-found role as a champion of safety, particularly as Comac prepares to drive a wedge in the Boeing-Airbus duopoly with the roll-out of its C919 in 2021. China says the plane – which can fit up to 168 passengers, similar to the Max 8 plane implicated in the crashes – has more than 800 orders worldwide. But one of the primary lingering concerns about the plane is that China has less of a proven safety track record than its Western counterparts. Anything the country can do to burnish its image on this front is in the interest of not only Comac’s backlog, but also the confidence of the local population.
There’s likely a fair amount of posturing going on here, as is the case with most aspects of the ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. China’s decision to include aircraft purchases in its efforts to narrow the trade gap with the U.S. may have been more a reflection of the big ticket price for planes than anything else. The Max has a list price of more than $100 million before accounting for customary discounts; China has a $300 billion-plus annual goods trade surplus with the U.S. Economists were already skeptical of the feasibility of China’s reported pledge to reduce that surplus to zero by 2024, given the U.S.’s heavy reliance on imports from the country, but it’s especially impossible if airplanes aren’t part of the equation.
Regardless, this always struck me as more of a short-term fix. Sure, China could load up on Boeing jet orders now, but ultimately the country will be reducing its dependence on Boeing and Airbus once Comac starts delivering its new C919 jet. Point being, there was always an obvious limit to China’s willingness to prop up Boeing. Chinese Airlines have a total of 104 unfulfilled orders for the Max – not an insignificant percentage out of a global outstanding order book of 4,636 planes, but also not that big or disastrous of a hit when you stop to think about it. As my colleague David Fickling has pointed out before, the slender order books are at odds with predictions for an explosion in demand as China’s middle-class expands and are likely a reflection of Chinese carriers’ desire to back the C919.
The more immediate risk for Boeing is not that some arguably fictitious orders tentatively promised in trade talks won’t materialize, it’s that China walks away from some of its existing orders. Again, this isn’t a huge part of the backlog, but an aggressive move by China may inspire others to follow suit. 
The common thinking is that Airbus has its own hefty backlog and can’t easily ramp up production to replace Max orders. But it sure seems like it’s going to try to chip away where it can. French President Emmanuel Macron has reportedly held discussions with Ethiopia’s prime minister about shifting more of the country’s business toward Airbus jets. He will also discuss a major order with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month. Recall that Xiamen Airlines was reportedly mulling a break from a longstanding allegiance to Boeing in favor of Airbus, and that China and Airbus have had on-again/off-again talks about a separate $18 billion jet order.
The true financial fallout for Boeing from the Max debacle remains a question mark. But its rivals are wasting no time."
838,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",Africa's Richest Woman Loses Top Job at Angola Telecoms Firm,"(Bloomberg) -- Africa’s richest woman failed for now to secure a fresh mandate as chairwoman of Angola’s biggest telecommunications company, but managed to keep her seat on the board after a shareholder meeting on Tuesday to discuss corporate governance in the wake of legal action by one of the firm’s biggest investors.
The meeting at Unitel SA, in which Isabel dos Santos owns 25 percent stake, comes after an arbitration court ruled that Brazilian telecommunications company Oi SA was entitled to receive $654 million from other Unitel shareholders because they violated several clauses of the company’s shareholders’ agreement and failed to pay dividends to Oi.
Shareholders with as much as 75 percent of Unitel were expected to vote for the removal of dos Santos, Antonio Estote, an independent economist and professor at the Universidade Lusiada de Angola said before the meeting. Besides Oi, the shareholders are state oil company Sonangol and army general Leopoldino do Nascimento, who each hold 25 percent, according to Estote.
Unitel shareholders unanimously elected Isabel dos Santos and four other members to the board of the company. Miguel Geraldes, a former senior consultant at Huawei Technologies in South Africa, will replace Antony Dolton as general director of Unitel. The new board will take office on May 6 and elect a new chairperson, according to Unitel.
The daughter of former Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Isabel amassed a fortune during her father’s almost four-decade rule and has an estimated net worth of about $2 billion, according to Bloomberg. Besides Unitel, her business interests include media, retail, finance and energy, both in Angola and in Portugal.
Joao Lourenco, who replaced dos Santos in 2017, has made the battle against graft the cornerstone of his administration, dismantling the influence of his predecessor’s family over key sectors.
Sonangol has repeatedly said it wants a new board at Unitel, while Oi has publicly expressed its disapproval with management for withholding millions of dollars in dividend payments. Unitel didn’t say whether Isabel dos Santos could still be reappointed as chairwoman after the new board takes office on May 6.
“We can’t accept that a single shareholder with 25 percent stake can take unilateral decisions at the company, Sonangol Chairman Carlos Saturnino told reporters on Feb. 25. “We need to reach an agreement to appoint a new board.”

839,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 02:52PM ET</span>","EU, UK market watchdogs clash over no-deal Brexit share trading","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's markets watchdog published guidance on Tuesday identifying which shares investors in the bloc could no longer trade in London if there is a hard Brexit next week.
The move drew instant criticism from Britain's financial regulator, saying it risked disrupting markets.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, but it has yet to agree a divorce settlement and ""standstill"" transition deal with the bloc. The UK is now expected to ask for a delay to Brexit.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a list of 6,200 shares subject to the bloc's ""trading obligation"". This means they would have to be bought and sold on a platform based in the EU if Britain left the bloc without a deal.
It includes 14 shares listed in London but deemed to have enough trading ""liquidity"" on EU exchanges. EU investors could continue to buy and sell in London shares that are not on ESMA's list.
Without ESMA's guidance, EU investors could only trade shares listed on an EU exchange in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
ESMA said it was seeking to limit potential market disruption.
""ESMA wishes to highlight that the guidance provided in the public statement should only be applied in case of a no-deal Brexit occurring on 29 March 2019,"" the watchdog said.
""Should the timing and conditions of Brexit change, ESMA may adjust its approach and inform the public of any changes as soon as possible.""
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said ESMA's guidance meant that EU banks, funds and asset managers will not be able to trade some UK or EU shares in London, even where the UK is the home listing of the British or EU company.
It called for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to avoid potential disruption to market participants.
""We therefore urge further dialogue on this issue in order to minimize risks of disruption in the interests of orderly markets,"" the FCA said in a statement.
ESMA said it is mindful of the impact of a no-deal Brexit on EU market structures.
""Therefore, ESMA will consider, in light of possible market developments, whether to review its approach at the latest 12 months after the no-deal Brexit date,"" ESMA said.

In 2012, Citi implemented a program that provided reduced pricing for mortgage borrowers that kept certain levels of assets with the bank, typically referred to as relationship pricing. The bank later identified some errors with the program which resulted in some mortgage customers failing to receive the benefit for which they were eligible, the OCC said.
The errors affected borrowers across gender, race and ethnicity, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, the OCC found. Reuters previously reported that the OCC had been investigating Citi over the problem and initially decided to issue the bank with a written reprimand.
""Citi has no tolerance for discrimination in any form,"" the bank said in a statement. 

""Citi self-reported the issue to the appropriate regulators, conducted a comprehensive review, strengthened processes and controls to help ensure correct implementation going forward and has largely completed reimbursements to the identified customers.""

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged more than 6% as Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said the chip maker has a ""significant opportunity"" to benefit from the uptick in demand from cloud gaming chips.
Moore said he was ""surprised"" that AMD was able to play its way into securing a part of Google's upcoming cloud-based gaming services as the chip maker's graphics technology is not as cutting edge compared to those of its rivals, including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). (NVIDIA shares were up more than 4% today.)
""We continue to be impressed by AMD’s progress at using innovative approaches to expand its markets in all segments,"" Moore added.
The upbeat outlook on AMD comes as Google is expected to announce a new streaming, cloud-based gaming service during a keynote presentation at 1 pm ET today, at the 2019 Game Developers Conference, which got underway on Monday in San Francisco.
In the run-up to the Game Developers Conference, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has made little secret of its ambitious goals in gaming, promising to unveil a ""vision for the future of gaming.""
But Moore was reluctant to upgrade his outlook on AMD's stock, which has gotten ""ahead of itself."" The shares were up 26% year-to-date through Monday. If today's gains hold, the gain would jump to 34%.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has racked up gains of more than 20% since the turn of the year, topping the S&P 500's nearly 14% advance. But all eyes will be on Micron Technology's earnings, which will serve as a gauge of whether the broader rally in semis is too hot too soon or at its infancy.
Some analysts on Wall Street have turned bearish on Micron (NASDAQ:MU) ahead of its quarterly report due Wednesday after markets close.
Rosenblatt Securities said the chipmaker still faces ""challenging"" conditions for its memory chips. The firm cut its earnings and revenue expectations for AMD both for the second quarter and full-year of 2019 and 2020.
Micron is expected to report earnings of $1.66 a share on revenue of $5.86 billion, according to analysts polled by Investing.com, down from $2.82 a share and $7.35 billion in revenue a year ago."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Tuesday it would invest 10 billion reais ($2.65 billion) in two of its Brazilian plants in Sao Paulo state over the next five years, reversing what the state's governor said was a previous plan to shut down the plants, potentially costing 65,000 jobs. 
Under the new plan, GM will invest in its Sao Caetano do Sul and Sao Jose dos Campos plants, the latter of which had been starved of investments in recent years. 
The automaker is the sales leader in Brazil's market, the largest in South America, but had warned employees that it was dealing with heavy losses, adding that ""sacrifices"" would be necessary.
""When we embarked on this path last December, we had a really serious problem, which was the future of our factories in Sao Paulo,"" GM's CEO for South America, Carlos Zarlenga, told a news conference on Tuesday. He added that he initially doubted there was any way to keep the factories open. 
The news conference was hosted by Sao Paulo State Governor Joao Doria. 
While the amount pales compared with GM's most recent investment plan in Brazil in 2014, which totaled $4 billion, it does not include the automaker's plants elsewhere in the country.

851,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",Colombian proposal to ditch NY coffee price may send buyers elsewhere,"By Julia Symmes Cobb and Ayenat Mersie
BOGOTA/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A proposal by Colombian coffee growers' federation that producer countries sell their high-quality harvests untethered from the New York market price could encourage buyers to look for alternative providers, importers and exporters said.
The federation in late February said it would discuss a possible unlinking from the New York benchmark price with other producers of high-quality arabica and buyers in an effort to sell coffee above production costs.
Prices on the New York market have hovered at or below $1 per pound so far in 2019. Last week, the most-active ICE (NYSE:ICE) arabica futures contract bottomed at a 13-year low of 94.65 cents per pound.
Brazil harvested a record-large coffee crop last year, and is on track to produce another massive harvest this crop year, despite it being the off-year in its biennial production cycle.
Colombia, which prices much of its coffee at a differential to futures, is proposing an unlinking that would set its prices between $1.40 and $1.50 per pound. The Colombian federation is already beginning discussions with other producers, it said.
But despite the proposal's popularity with struggling growers, an alternative price could have buyers looking elsewhere.
""There was a time a while ago, when Colombia was so far above everyone else, quality-wise,"" said Shawn Hackett, president of Hackett Financial Advisors, a Florida-based futures brokerage and research firm specializing in agricultural commodities.
""Nowadays, there's some really good quality in Brazil, really good quality in Central America, in Africa."" 
PAST EFFORTS 
Colombia's federation has long made the case to large buyers that it is in their interest to ensure producers earn a profit. 
Colombian farmers need to make 760,000 pesos ($245.84) per 125-kg (275-lb) shipment on the domestic market to meet production costs, the federation has said. Prices were at 692,000 pesos per shipment on Monday. 
Coffee price cartels have been attempted before, but failed. 
An effort in 2000 to get coffee producers to hold back 20 percent of output until prices climbed to $1.05 per pound was scrapped after just a few producer countries - including Colombia - agreed to participate.
The higher the target price, the greater the incentive for those outside a price agreement to increase output, a United Nations report on the effort said. 
Successful control of coffee prices will also require the participation of importers, who have largely ignored requests to pay more, despite warnings that farmers will switch crops if they cannot turn a profit.
Due to slumping prices and delays in certifying organic beans, coffee producers in Peru, for example, have been seen abandoning their crop to work on plantations that grow coca, the main ingredient in cocaine, the federation there said recently.
In 2013, some Colombian farmers even floated switching from arabica coffee - which is a smoother-tasting, more expensive bean - to the cheaper-to-grow robusta, which is used more in instant coffee.
""If the spread between the market and the prices that the Colombian exporters are trying to charge gets big enough, you will probably see a lot of people switch over to other origins,"" said a U.S. importer. ""People will become less dependent upon Colombian coffee.""
Colombian exporters agree.
""I don't think the proposal is realistic,"" said Giancarlo Ghiretti, of specialty exporter Caravela Coffee. ""Selling large amounts of coffee outside of the market is difficult and risky. Large buyers will look to replace Colombia with other origins.""
The U.S. National Coffee Association said its members, who include major chains Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Peet's Coffee & Tea, agree growth requires stability for farmers, but price controls are generally unsuccessful.
""While the pressure to find quick economic fixes is understandable due to current market dynamics, history shows that policies designed to control price ultimately hurt those they are meant to protect,"" the industry group's president Bill Murray said in an email.
Colombia produced 13.6 million 60-kg bags of washed arabica last year, more than any other country but down 4.5 percent from 2017. Dry weather is expected to help the crop recover this year.

857,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 11:47AM ET</span>","Lenders and travelers stick with Ethiopian Airlines, for now","By Omar Mohammed
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Financiers, passengers and industry partners are, for now, still backing Ethiopian Airlines' quest to become Africa's dominant carrier, despite a March 10 crash that killed 157 people.
The causes of the Flight 302 tragedy will likely take months to establish. While much of the international focus has been on U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) and its 737 MAX 8 jet, the airline's reputation could also hinge on the results of the investigation.
Although crash inquiries focus on preventing future accidents rather than attributing liability, any findings that the carrier fell short in plane maintenance or piloting could be damaging.
For the present, however, passenger confidence in Ethiopian Airlines, long regarded as one of the most reliable in Africa, has remained steady, according to the company. Cancellation and booking rates are unchanged since the crash, said spokesman Asrat Begashaw. 
""We are operating as normal,"" he told Reuters. ""Our brand is keeping its level, and we are okay.""
Two banking sources with knowledge of the matter said that, barring a major new twist in the investigation with long-term fallout, banks were still comfortable lending to Ethiopian Airlines. 
""Ethiopian is a solid company,"" said one, an official from an international bank that helped finance the acquisition of some Ethiopian Airlines planes. ""No reason to change the way the bank sees its credit risk at this point."" 
A vote of confidence from lenders is important for the airline because its years of rapid expansion have largely been financed by international borrowing. 
The second source, a top European aviation banker, said Ethiopian Airlines was ""a good airline, with a good reputation"".
""So unless it (the crash) is a major problem of piloting or maintenance – and it is far too early to talk about that - they will still have access to financing,"" the source added.
The sources declined to be identified because the matters are confidential.
FOREIGN INVESTORS
Ethiopian Airlines has borrowed from foreign banks including JP Morgan, ING Capital and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) over the past decade. It also has outstanding bonds worth $540 million, though none due until 2024, Refinitiv data shows. 
The borrowing helped finance the acquisition of stakes in or establish partnerships with at least four African carriers, establishing hubs to feed traffic into Addis Ababa. Last year, the Ethiopian capital overtook Dubai as the main gateway for long-haul passengers into Africa. 
The airline's fleet grew from 35 planes in 2007 to 111 in 2019. It now flies to more than 119 international destinations, up from 52 a decade ago.
The expansion has made the state-owned carrier, founded in 1945, the most profitable major airline on the continent. Ethiopian's net profit in the 2017/18 financial year rose to $233 million from $229 million the previous year; operating revenue jumped 43 percent to $3.7 billion.
Last year, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced plans to sell a minority stake in the airline as part of a broad strategy to open up the country to foreign investors.
Industry analysts said it was too early to evaluate the impact of the crash on the airline's long-term plans but said, for now, its reputation remained largely intact.
""It's a very strong management team, with good vision,"" said Nawal Taneja, an author and professor at Ohio State University's Center for Aviation Studies. ""We've got to look at the strength of the airline as a whole, not just this one incident.""
PARTNERS, BOEING BOOKINGS
Those who want to travel across Africa have few options other than flying. Conflict, poor roads, and limited cross-border train transport often make travel by land difficult.
At Addis Ababa's Bole International Airport, businessman James Markland said he felt no reservations about flying with Ethiopian Airlines and had just come back from a day trip with the carrier to Asmara, capital of neighboring Eritrea. 
""Both flights were fine,"" the 62-year-old told Reuters on Tuesday. ""They were pretty full."" 
Analysts said the Flight 302 crash was unlikely to damage Ethiopian's partnerships with African carriers, key to a strategy that helped increase passenger numbers from 2.5 million a decade ago to 10.6 million last year, or with other industry players.
One such partner is ASKY, a Togo-based carrier which Ethiopian Airlines helped launch in 2010. 
""Ethiopian's accident has not affected our partnership in any way,"" said Lionel Tsoto, the airline's head of public relations. ""We continue just as before."" 
Global aviation leasing firm GECAS said the airline was a ""close and valued partner who we look forward to working with in the future"". 
The crash, which saw the Nairobi-bound flight go down minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa, triggered a global grounding of 737 MAX planes, wiping about 10 percent off Boeing's share price. GRAPHIC: http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/testfiles/boeing737maxseries
Investigators have noted similarities with another deadly crash in Indonesia five months ago involving a plane of the same type owned by Lion Air, but safety officials stress the investigation is at an early stage. 
Ethiopian Airlines, which grounded its handful of remaining 737 MAX planes, said it would decide whether to cancel orders for 29 others after a preliminary investigation. 
Analysts said it was unlikely that the carrier would cancel the orders, worth $3.5 billion at the current list price, because Boeing would have to fix any problems before regulators permit the jet to fly again. 
Boeing will be keen to retain the airline as a customer; more than half of Ethiopian's fleet are Boeing jets. 
""Ethiopian have been very loyal to Boeing in the past,"" said Phil Seymour, chief executive of the IBA Group, a Surrey-based aviation consultancy. 

""They will be in control of the conversation with Boeing now,"" he added. ""I would suspect that the business decision is to stick with the order.""

Some lawmakers and industry officials had worried that the long-awaited tender could be postponed because Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen secured only half the 4 billion euro increase in military spending she had sought for 2020.
However the document, which is due to be approved by Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet this week, singled out the heavy-lift helicopter as the only major arms program on a list of ""mandatory elements"" of a new four-year budget plan.
The helicopter program is expected to cost Germany around 4 billion euros ($4.54 billion) in the longer term, a rich prize for the winning bidder.
Germany's defense ministry has previously said it expects to choose either of two U.S. helicopter models, the twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook helicopter built by Boeing, or the new CH-53K King Stallion built by Lockheed's Sikorsky helicopter unit.
Procurement of the 45-60 helicopters will continue beyond 2023, which is why the four-year plan budgets for a smaller sum.
The Defence Ministry issued a pre-solicitation notice for the new helicopter in February, saying it expected to issue a formal request for proposals in the second half of 2019. 
A ministry spokesman declined to comment on the finance ministry document or any specific funding requests.
""We're at the beginning of the process,"" he said.
German government officials will debate and refine the budget request in coming months, and changes are possible, but the fact that the helicopter program was designated mandatory should prevent a postponement of the program, experts said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog said on Tuesday it had fined Swiss bank UBS a record 27.6 million pounds for failing to report 136 million transactions properly for nearly a decade in a repeat offense.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the failings cover reports between November 2007 and May 2017.
""If firms cannot report their transactions accurately, fundamental risks arise, including the risk that market abuse may be hidden,"" said Mark Steward, the FCA's executive director of enforcement.
The FCA had already fined UBS 100,000 pounds in November 2005 for transaction reporting failings.
UBS said on Tuesday it was pleased to have resolved what it called a ""legacy matter"", which is was fully provisioned for.
""Although there was never any impact on clients, investors or market users the bank has made significant investments to enhance its transaction reporting systems and controls,"" UBS said in a statement.
Under European Union securities law, banks must report transactions like stock and bond trades in a timely and accurate way so that regulators can spot any suspicious moves quickly.
The FCA said UBS failed to ensure it made proper reports on 86.67 million transactions that were required to be notified to the regulator. It also wrongly reported 49.1 million transactions to the FCA that did not require reporting.
By agreeing to a speedy settlement, UBS qualified for a 30 percent discount, thereby avoiding a bigger fine of 39.4 million pounds.
UBS is the 13th financial firm to be fined for transaction reporting failures under EU rules that came into force in 2007.

862,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 10:01AM ET</span>",Ford Boosts Output of Biggest SUVs for Second Time in Two Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. is boosting production of its biggest, highly lucrative sport utility vehicles for the second time in two years at a U.S. factory already bursting at the seams.
The automaker is increasing Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator output by 20 percent -- about 20,000 additional SUVs a year -- by speeding up the assembly line and redesigning it so multiple workers can manufacture the SUVs simultaneously. Ford executives declined to say how much they’re spending, but an upgrade of the same Kentucky plant announced in February 2018 cost $25 million and followed a $900 million investment the year before.
The hot-selling SUVs are critical to Ford’s future because they generate profit per vehicle that analysts say can exceed $20,000. That helps finance the billions Ford is pouring into electric and self-driving vehicles that are considered the cars of tomorrow. While Ford won’t be adding factory jobs, it’s picked a fortuitous time to tout the expansion, with rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). drawing fresh ire from President Donald Trump for closing factories.
“This is one of our highest-volume plants in the world,” John Savona, Ford’s vice president of North American manufacturing, told reporters at the company’s headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. Ford “needed to figure out how to increase production in a plant that was already operating at top speed.”
Surging Sales
Navigator sales soared 70 percent last year, thanks to a bossy redesign, while Expedition sales rose 5.4 percent, according to researcher Autodata Corp. Retail deliveries of Expedition, revamped for the first time since 2003, jumped 35 percent, according to Ford. Perhaps most importantly, the average selling price of an Expedition climbed about $11,700 to $62,700.
Ford lacks the space to knock down walls and expand the factory, so it’s digging pits along the assembly line for workers to attach components such as running boards from below, while other workers above install interior parts. The company also is speeding up the line so it can crank out more than 60 SUVs an hour, Savona said.
Ford will make the changes in July while the plant is on summer shutdown for two weeks.
“We had to go up and down because we didn’t have space to actually do brick and mortar to put another line in,” Savona said. “We had to really get creative.”
Shifting Workers
Ford also will add 550 workers to the Kentucky factory, but they’ll come from the automaker’s neighboring Louisville plant, which makes the small Escape SUV.
The automaker is rolling out a redesigned Escape this year aimed at reversing the sales slide of its aging model. Savona declined to say if Ford eventually will need to replace the workers Louisville is losing to support the Expedition and Navigator.
With Trump assailing GM on Twitter for three days straight over ceasing production at a car factory in Ohio, Savona made a point to say Ford is “committed to manufacturing in the United States, as we have for more than 100 years.”
But as part of an $11 billion restructuring, Ford has begun dismissing salaried employees, and a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst has predicted the cuts could reach 25,000 worldwide. Net income fell by more than half last year, as the company lost money in every regional market except North America, where it has become increasingly dependent on big F-Series trucks and SUVs.
Challenging GM
GM continues to dominate the U.S. retail market for large SUVs with the Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon, which accounted for a combined segment share of more than 70 percent last year, according to Ford. But that’s down about 5 points from 2017, as Expedition’s share rose to 17.5 percent in 2018, from 11.9 percent in 2017.
“We are a challenger brand in this segment as the competition had been continually investing in product, and we had not had the same entire all-new product until now,” said Matt VanDyke, director of U.S. marketing for Ford. “We’re committed to growing this in the next year as we have more availability.”
To further stoke demand for the Expedition, Ford is rolling out a new ad campaign with the slogan: “Built to be a better big.” A commercial dubbed “Leave no man behind” will appear during the NCAA men’s basketball tournament and other prime-time programming showing the Expedition carrying eight people, while pulling a trailer with two horses.
“In this segment, we really want to emphasize big,” VanDyke said. “But better big.”

“The term ‘national champion’ isn’t a category supervisors use,” said Joachim Wuermeling, a top Bundesbank official who also sits on the European Central Bank’s oversight arm. Regulators don’t base their decisions on what they or others think the banking industry should look like and they don’t let national interests shape their actions, he said.
That echoes comments from Andrea Enria, who leads the ECB’s supervisory arm. “I don’t particularly like the idea of national champions, of European champions,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times published on the ECB’s website. “If there are foreign banks, foreign investors, bringing their expertise, their capital, into your jurisdiction, that should be welcome.”
Their views matter because bank mergers require the ECB’s approval.  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) confirmed on Sunday that they have entered talks on a possible government-backed tie-up after their separate turnaround plans failed to convince investors. Germany sees the deal as a way to ensure that it still has a bank capable of serving its export-oriented economy on the global stage, people familiar with the matter have said.
Neither of the supervisors commented specifically about a merger between the two German banks.
Banking watchdogs are neutral in their view of mergers, Wuermeling said at a conference organized by the Bundesbank in Frankfurt on Tuesday. The supervisors check whether merged banks satisfy “regulatory requirements now and in the future. That calls for a sound and sustainable business model,” he said.

870,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Riding with 'Uncle Diego': Uber's wild drive for growth in Chile,"By Aislinn Laing
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Uber driver pulled up to the international airport outside Chile's capital. As his passenger jumped into his gleaming Suzuki, he glanced around furtively for signs of trouble.
""Working in the airport isn't easy,"" he told a Reuters reporter, a rosary on the rearview mirror swaying as he raced towards the motorway. ""Uber in Chile isn't easy.""
That is because Uber drivers can be fined or have their vehicles impounded if caught by authorities ferrying passengers. Chile has yet to work out a regulatory framework for ridesharing.
""This (Uber) application is not legal,"" Chile´s Transport Minister Gloria Hutt said last year. ""It does not at present comply with Chilean legislation to carry paying passengers.""
Uber’s unregulated status in fast-growing markets such as Chile poses a potential risk for the firm as it prepares for a much-anticipated IPO.
It has also launched a cat-and-mouse game of sometimes comical proportions in this South American nation. Drivers warn each other of pick-up and drop-off points where police officers and transport department inspectors are lurking.
They also enlist passengers as accomplices. Riders are routinely instructed to sit in the front seat and memorize a cover story - just in case.
""If anyone asks, I'm your friend's Uncle Diego,"" one so-named Uber driver told Reuters on another recent run.
Another, 41-year-old Guillermo, told Reuters his standard alibi for male passengers is that they are his football mates. He and other drivers declined to give their surnames for fear of being identified by authorities.
Uber's app and website make no mention of its unsettled legal status in Chile, where it now boasts 2.2 million monthly users and 85,000 drivers since its launch here in 2014. 
The company advertises prominently on billboards around Santiago and through promotional emails as if nothing were amiss.
Veronica Jadue, the company's spokeswoman in Chile, insisted Uber was legal. She cited a 2017 Supreme Court ruling that thwarted efforts by Chilean taxi firms and unions looking to halt the service in the northern city of La Serena. The court cited legislation introduced in 2016 by the government of former President Michelle Bachelet to regulate ride-hailing services. ""The intention is to regulate it, not to prevent its development,"" the three-judge panel said. 
That legislation, nicknamed the Uber law, is still pending as the government, powerful taxi unions and app-based startups try to strike a deal.
Jadue declined to confirm whether the company knew that drivers in Chile were coaching passengers to help them mislead transit officials. ""We have stressed the importance of cooperating with authorities,"" she said.
A series of scandals has already damaged Uber's reputation. The company has been excoriated for its frat-house culture, sharp-elbowed business tactics and pitched battles with regulators worldwide. While the San Francisco-based start-up has been valued at as much as $120 billion, its growth has slowed. [uL1N20925L]
Clearing up its status in Chile and elsewhere will help. Still, would-be shareholders likely will be more interested in Uber's ability to maintain its dominance in Latin America and other places where rivals such as China's Didi Chuxing are moving in, according to Nathan Lustig, managing partner of Magma Partners, a Santiago-based seed stage venture capital fund. 
""They'll be more bothered by market share and whether Uber can be profitable in places...where there´s competition,” Lustig said.
PARKING LOT RENDEZVOUS
In a statement to Reuters, Uber said it is ""working diligently"" to ensure that ridesharing regulation moves forward in Chile.
In the meantime, penalties keep piling up. Since 2016, inspectors from Chile's Ministry of Transport have issued 7,756 fines ranging from $700 to $1,100 to Uber drivers. Local cops have doled out thousands of citations as well.
Drivers told Reuters Uber reimburses them the cost of their fines to keep them rolling. Uber said it does so ""on a case by case basis.""
The company's technology is helping too. For example, Santiago-area riders had complained on social media that drivers were frequently cancelling rides to and from the airport, a hot zone for citations.
The solution: a special category of service on Uber's Chilean app known as UberX SCL, named for the code for the Comodoro Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport. Those runs are handled by daring souls willing to run the risk of getting fined, drivers told Reuters.
Securing a driver can be only half the battle. On its Chilean website, Uber instructs passengers who are leaving the airport to meet their drivers in a short-term parking lot. Drivers told Reuters they use the Uber app´s messaging system to switch meeting points if they suspect citation writers are hovering.
Uber declined to discuss the reasons for its tailored communication in Chile. Spokeswoman Jadue said Uber's Chile products ""are designed to deliver a positive experience to riders and drivers.""
Matias Muchnick, a member of Chile's vibrant start-up community, said the ""chaos"" is embarrassing. The country touts its orderliness and sophistication to foreign investors, who might not see the adventure in ducking transit cops after stepping off their international flights.
“People get a bad first impression,"" the artificial intelligence entrepreneur said at a December investment conference in Santiago.
But David Brophy, professor of finance at the University of Michigan, said such tales could be a selling point for some IPO investors.
“The key thing is that people want to use it, even though it's not comfortable if you´re stopped by the cops,” he said.
EVEN POLICE USE UBER 
Uber has tangled with regulators across the globe, including in other parts of Latin America.
In Argentina, for example, the company remains unregulated years after entering the market. Lawmakers in Buenos Aires have largely sided with taxi drivers, who complain Uber charges artificially low fares while avoiding all the overhead born by cabbies.
But the region's commuters are hooked on the price and convenience, while car owners see opportunity. Uber says it has 25 million active monthly riders in Latin America and one million drivers.
In country after country, it has found success by following a familiar playbook: expand quickly in a legislative vacuum, then leverage popularity and market power to shape regulation.
Still, some local governments are reasserting their authority. In the United States, for example, New York City last year capped the number of rideshare vehicles on its streets. Los Angeles is contemplating a ride-hailing tax to reduce road congestion.
In Chile, negotiations on the Uber Law have been slow. 
Taxi unions want lawmakers to limit the number of rideshare drivers and ensure their fares do not undercut those of cabs. Transport startups, led by Uber, have run their own energetic lobbying efforts. Riders have voted with their smartphones; many have little sympathy for ""taxi mafias"" that long kept prices high and delivered patchy service.
Caught in the middle are Chilean officials. Hutt, the transport minister, admitted publicly that her children used the app and that she had too until she took her post last year. Uber drivers told Reuters that public servants - including police officers - are frequent customers.
In an interview in his Santiago office, Jose Luis Dominguez, the country's subsecretary for transport, acknowledged his agency's dilemma.

""(Uber) shouldn't be operating. Passengers shouldn't be using it,"" Dominguez said. ""But...ignoring that it exists would be like trying to block out the sun with your finger.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Fund managers have named bearish bets in European equities as the ""most crowded"" trade in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's survey for the first time in its history, suggesting sentiment for one of the world's most shunned markets may have troughed.
Investors have pulled cash from European stocks over the past year, betting the market would be weaker compared with the United States and other regions as euro zone economic growth slows and Britain's chaotic exit from the European Union raises worries about disruption to its economy.
Short European equities replaced long emerging markets, which held the title for just one month. 
The shift in investor views reflects broader uncertainty about the direction of financial markets as the Federal Reserve and ECB keep interest rates on hold amid signs that growth is slowing. 
It also suggests that fund managers believe the gloom that has seen $30 billion leave European equities so far this year may have been overdone.
In a note on Sunday,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) chief European equity strategist said he believes Europe is set to surprise on the upside as issues that weighed on growth in the second half of last year start to fade. 
A slowdown in China, the world's No. 2 economy, topped the list of biggest tail risks, ousting the trade war, which had been at the forefront of investor concerns for the previous nine months, according to the survey.
BAML's March survey - conducted between March 8 and 14, among 239 panelists managing $664 billion in total - also indicated that investor risk appetite had continued to fall, with global equity allocations remaining at September 2016 lows.

""With them, as with others, the planets could be aligned,"" Robert Peugeot was reported as saying, asked about targets for acquisitions or mergers.
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) declined to comment.
Shares in the Italian-American carmaker were up 5.2 percent by 1050 GMT, while Peugeot gained 2.7 percent, helping boost Europe's autos index which was up 2.5 percent. 
Peugeot's remarks came on the heels of reports the group's CEO Carlos Tavares is open to deals and that Fiat, General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Jaguar Land Rover could be ideal partners. 
FCA's new boss Mike Manley, who took over after deal-making guru Sergio Marchionne died last year, said this month the carmaker was open to pursuing alliances and merger opportunities if they make sense and strengthen its future.
FCA is often cited as a possible merger candidate because of its strong exposure to the North American market, where it generates the lion's share of profits, and because of its popular Jeep, RAM and Maserati brands. 
""PSA is essentially an EU pure play as things stand (roughly 90 percent of consolidated unit sales in EU) so an acquisition of a company with a broader reach would make strategic sense,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst. 
Investors and analysts alike were wary of betting on an imminent deal, though, mindful of potential antitrust obstacles.

875,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 08:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Advent and Blackstone among bidders for WPP market research arm Kantar - sources,"By Kate Holton and Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - A series of buyout funds including U.S. firms Advent and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are in talks with advertising group WPP (LON:WPP) to explore bids for a majority stake in its data analytics unit Kantar, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The sale, led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), may value Kantar at up to 3.5 billion pounds ($4.7 billion), but some private equity investors are fretting over the decline in profits and revenues that the business has suffered in recent years.
Hellman & Friedman and CVC Capital Partners are also working on the deal, the sources said, while industry players have so far shied away from the process.
Bain Capital has also expressed interest in making a bid for Kantar, another source said, adding Bain might later decide to team up with one of the other buyout funds in the race.
WPP sent out confidential information packs this week, with non-binding offers expected in April, one of the sources said.
WPP, Blackstone, Advent and CVC declined to comment, while representatives at Bain Capital and Hellman & Friedman were not immediately available.
WPP, the owner of agencies including JWT, Finsbury and Ogilvy, is in the middle of an overhaul launched by its new boss Mark Read following several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018.
The London-based group wants to sell a majority stake in Kantar to reduce debt as it braces for a tough year with revenue expected to drop by between 1.5 and 2 percent in 2019.
Kantar, a leading player in market research, provides brand and marketing communications research for some of the world's largest advertisers.
Yet it has suffered a decline in revenue in recent years, with underlying sales down 2 percent last year to 2.6 billion pounds and operating profit down 14 percent to 301 million.
""The deal poses some challenges for private equity funds as it's been on a downward trajectory for a while,"" one source said.
Private equity investors are examining the turnaround potential of a possible deal, the sources said, and would value the business at up to 10 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), hoping to reignite growth within the first three years of their investment.
Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said in February that Kantar could fetch more than 3 billion pounds, with WPP raising close to 2.1-2.2 billion pounds from a 60 percent stake sale.
WPP boss Read aims to complete the sale by the end of the summer as he needs cash to steer the world's biggest advertising group back to growth.
Read took the helm of WPP last year, pledging to spend 300 million pounds to restructure the group and bring it back in line with peers by the end of 2021.
Founder Martin Sorrell, 74, remains a major WPP shareholder but is now running a new company which last year beat WPP in the race to buy Dutch digital agency MediaMonks.

The company did not name the individuals last week, citing legal reasons. But during Tuesday's session in parliament South African lawmakers instructed Louis du Preez, who was appointed CEO last year, to reveal those involved.
Du Preez named former CEO Jooste and former Chief Financial Officer Ben la Grange, alongside six other people, who he said had inflated Steinhoff profits and asset values over several years.
Jooste, who resigned hours before Steinhoff disclosed the hole in its accounts in December 2017, could not be reached for comment through his lawyer. He has previously denied any wrong doing.

La Grange could not immediately be reached for comment through his lawyer.

877,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 07:47AM ET</span>","China smartphone maker Xiaomi beats profit view, sees more global expansion","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp said on Tuesday its fourth-quarter net profit more than tripled to 1.85 billion yuan ($275.59 million), on stronger revenue.
That exceeded the 1.7 billion yuan average estimate of 10 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue for the period increased 27 percent to 44.4 billion yuan, lower than the 47.4 billion yuan average estimate of 13 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
The results show Xiaomi is weathering fairly well a slowing Chinese smartphone market, the world's biggest, by increasing its focus on markets such as India and Europe.
For the full 2018 calendar year, Xiaomi brought in revenue of 174.9 billion yuan and made a net profit of 8.6 billion yuan.
This marks the third set of financial results for the company since its IPO in Hong Kong. Xiaomi shares have rallied nearly 30 percent since their 2019 lows in January, though they remain well below their July listing price
To compensate for its slowing home market, the company has aggressively expanded in Europe. After broadly rolling out in the continent in early 2018, the company now ranks as the region's fourth-largest phone vendor. 
Speaking on a call with reporters, Xiaomi CFO Shou Zi Chew said that sales from outside of China made up 40 percent of the company's revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018, adding that global expansion would be a priority for 2019. 
""We will continue to explore the global markets and replicate the success in India in other key markets such as Indonesia and Western Europe,"" he said. ""We will also expand into more new international markets in 2019.""
Xiaomi has also revamped its smartphone lineup, paving the way to sell more expensive devices that can raise profit margins. In China, the average selling price of the company's phones increased 17 percent, while overseas they increased 10 percent, according to the company's earnings report.
In February, upon the launch of Xiaomi's new flagship Mi 9 phone, founder Lei Jun said the device would be the company's last such handset priced at under 3,000 yuan ($446.99).
Sales from smartphones made up 65.1 percent of Xiaomi's overall revenue in the fourth quarter. Money from other hardware made up 25.1 percent while internet services made up 9.1 percent.
The latter segment was pivotal to Xiaomi's pitch to investors in the run-up to its IPO. The company touted its so-called ""triathlon business model"", wherein consumers who purchase smartphones go on to use apps and services that generate revenue via advertisements or micropayments.
Xiaomi also stressed it would increase research and development, and plans to invest over 10 billion yuan in artificial intelligence throughout the next five years.

Grant & Eisenhofer P.A. and DRRT filed the lawsuit in Copenhagen on behalf of investors from 19 countries, asserting ""fraud claims stemming from a massive Russian money-laundering scheme and multi-year cover-up by Denmark's largest bank and its senior leadership."" 
The bank's share price halved in 2018 as the scandal unraveled and it replaced both its CEO and chairman. 
At a shareholder meeting on Monday in Copenhagen, several shareholders voiced concern about potential lawsuits from investor groups.
""It is our fundamental position that the bank has lived up to its information obligation,"" Danske's new chairman Karsten Dybvad told shareholders. ""As such we don't find any basis for lawsuits or for a settlement."" 
Danske Bank was not immediately able to comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday.
The investors are seeking $475 million in damages, Grant & Eisenhofer said in a statement dated March 18. 
Danske and four former top executives are already facing a lawsuit in New York filed in January by a U.S. pension fund. That accuses the bank of defrauding investors and inflating its share price by hiding and failing to stop widespread money laundering.
Authorities in Denmark, Estonia, France, Great Britain and the United States are investigating the payments, including in a criminal probe by the U.S. Department of Justice. Danske has said it has been cooperating with authorities.

Abramovich and Abramov were among the Evraz shareholders who sold a combined total of about 25.4 million shares, or about 1.8 percent of the company, for some 151 million pounds ($200 million) on Monday.
Chief Financial Officer Nikolay Ivanov told a conference call on Tuesday the two had reduced their combined stake in Evraz to less than 50 percent, saying in his opinion this decreased the risk of sanctions being imposed on the company.
EVRAZ (LON:EVRE) shares traded down 5.6 percent by 1115 GMT, having spiked to a record 634.8 pence the previous session.
Evraz, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, has operations in Russia, the United States, Canada and other countries. It is one of the world's top steel producers based on crude steel production.
Major shareholders in at least four Russian companies have already offloaded or said they would offload some of their shareholdings this month via share sales.
Some used accelerated bookbuilding deals (ABB), a quick way to conduct a sale when books are open only for a very short period of time.
Abramovich and his partners sold $551 million of shares in mining group Norilsk Nickel last week via the same method. The shares represented a 1.7 stake in the company and were mostly bought by British-based investors.
Meat producer Cherkizovo said earlier on Tuesday it would offer 6.6 percent, or 2.9 million, of treasury shares and new shares to raise around $200 million via a conventional share sale.
The United States and other Western countries have imposed sanctions on Russian officials, companies and banks since Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
These measures have significantly changed the business landscape in Russia, forcing investors and company owners to adapt.

882,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 07:05AM ET</span>",Ship owners worry about clean fuel bill as ports ban 'scrubbers',"By Jonathan Saul and Nina Chestney
LONDON (Reuters) - More ports around the world are banning ships from using a fuel cleaning system that pumps waste water into the sea, one of the cheapest options for meeting new environmental shipping rules. 
The growing number of destinations imposing stricter regulations than those set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are expected to be a costly headache for cruise and shipping firms as they face tough market conditions and slowing world trade. They might have to pay for new equipment and extra types of fuel and adjust their routes.
Singapore, China and Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates have already banned the use of the cleaning systems, called open loop scrubbers, from the start of next year when the new IMO rules come into force. 
Reuters has learned that individual ports in Finland, Lithuania, Ireland and Russia, have all banned or restricted such equipment, according to interviews with officials and reviews of documents by Reuters. One British port has occasionally imposed restrictions. 
Norway is also working on open loop scrubber bans around its world heritage fjords, an official with the climate and environment ministry told Reuters. A ban on all types of scrubbers is also proposed, the official added. 
The IMO rules will prohibit ships from using fuels with sulfur content above 0.5 percent, unless they are equipped with exhaust gas cleaning systems. The open loop scrubbers wash out the sulfur and some industry experts believe they are the cheapest way to meet the new global rules.
Companies that invested in open loop scrubbers will be unable to use them while sailing through those port waters. They also fear the IMO rules could change again and ban open loop scrubbers altogether.
The world's top cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corporation has invested over $500 million to deploy the devices.
Carnival's Mike Kaczmarek, senior vice president for marine technology and refit with oversight of the group's scrubbers program, said the port moves were ""very troubling"".
""The more ports that participate in this, the greater the (economic) impact,"" he said. 
""A lot of people out there...in good faith have made significant investments.""
Ships with open loop scrubbers docking or sailing through those ports would need to store waste in tanks until it could be discharged elsewhere or avoid the ports. 
The other option is to use a scrubber with a ""closed loop"", which stores the waste until it can be treated on land. There are also hybrid scrubbers with a loop that can be open or closed.
Ship owners could also choose another energy source such as low sulfur fuel or liquefied natural gas (LNG). Some experts say there will be enough low sulfur fuel available to avoid fitting scrubbers. 
Data from Norwegian risk management and certification company DNV GL shows there will be a total of 2,693 ships running with scrubbers by the end of 2019 - based on current orders – and over 80 percent of them will be open loop devices, compared with 15 percent using hybrid scrubbers and 2 percent opting for closed loop scrubbers. 
REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY
Initial research to date into the environmental impact of open loop scrubbers has produced a range of results. The ports and authorities that have banned them have acted in anticipation of studies that conclusively show the discharge is harmful, environmental groups say. 
International regulation often lags local action and the IMO rules were agreed in 2016 after years of tense discussions. 
An official with Sweden's Gothenburg port said it recommended shipowners in their waters not to use open loop scrubbers as a precautionary principle to ""avoid discharges of scrubber wash water in coastal waters and port areas"".
Businesses are waiting to see if the IMO rules will change.
""What is terrible for business is uncertainty in regulation and changes which are not broadcast well in advance,"" said Hamish Norton, president of dry bulk shipping group Star Bulk Carriers, among the biggest investors in scrubbers. 
Jurisdictions that have not imposed restrictions are also watching closely.
The IMO encouraged member states in February to research the impact of scrubbers on the environment. An IMO spokeswoman said it was up to countries to make any proposal to tighten scrubber regulation, which would need consensus approval by its 174 member states. 
The 28 European Union countries submitted a paper to the IMO which said the use of open loop scrubbers was ""expected to lead to a degradation of the marine environment due to the toxicity of water discharges"". It said it wanted to see ""harmonization of rules and guidance"". 
A separate paper submitted to the IMO, commissioned by Panama - the world's top ship registration state - and conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said more scientific investigation was needed. 
THE FRONT PAGE TEST
A number of jurisdictions without bans, including Gibraltar, South Korea and Australia said they were investigating.
""We will study to find out how harmful it is to oceans and then consider what actions we can take,"" said an official with South Korea’s Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.
""If the IMO sets out a guideline on this, we will comply.""
Others are pushing back. Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, said it concluded in research last year that there was little impact on the marine environment from scrubber water discharges.
Carnival said a study it commissioned concluded that scrubbers were safe and discharges were over 90 percent lower than maximum allowable levels in various waters.
Nevertheless, many in the industry expect the rules to change.
Ivar Hansson Myklebust, chief executive with Hoegh Autoliners, said at a recent Marine Money conference the vehicle transporter was not ordering any scrubbers.

""The (open loop) scrubbers have a hard time passing the front page test taking pollutants from the air and dumping it into the sea,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC is stepping up a root-and-branch overhaul of its global banking and markets division, naming 83 new managing directors in a 1,300-strong promotions spree aimed at revitalizing its investment banking franchise.
After another year of underwhelming performance in 2018, HSBC's management team - bolstered by new finance chief and ex-investment banker Ewen Stevenson - are plotting a push to recover ground lost to rivals, with a revamp of its trading floor seen as top priority, sources close to HSBC said.
Samir Assaf, chief executive of global banking and markets, distributed a memo last Monday pointing out the significant rise in the number of women promoted this year.
HSBC is trying to close a gender pay gap of 61 percent, the worst among major British firms and largely caused by a lack of women in senior, higher paid roles. 
Around a third of the 83 new managing directors are female, the memo seen by Reuters showed, a 13 percentage point rise from the previous year, according to a source at the bank with knowledge of the matter.
A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment.
The wave of promotions comes just weeks after the bank axed dozens of sales and advisory jobs in London following an extended period of turmoil in its investment banking operations.
Last year saw an exodus of high-profile dealmakers in Europe, with sources saying there was frustration at a lack of a clear strategy.
36 of the promotions are in HSBC's global banking business, which includes its mergers and acquisitions and equity advisory bankers.
The bank has also poached senior hires from rivals, including former JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) banker Greg Guyett as head of global banking and former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Peter Enns as the global head of its financial institutions group.
HSBC tumbled further in investment banking league tables in some key market segments in 2018, with its fourth quarter performance in equities particularly weak.
Revenues there fell 20 percent from a year earlier, the second worst performance among major investment banks after France's  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
HSBC slipped to 20th among global equity deal bookrunners in 2018 from 16th the previous year, according to Refinitiv data. It also fell to 24th from 19th in the rankings for advising on completed mergers and acquisitions. 
The bank fared better in its traditional stronghold of debt underwriting, placing 6th according to Refinitiv data, with revenues growing 14 percent in its transaction banking business. 
MOOD LIFT 
Investors are pinning their hopes on Georges Elhedery to improve productivity and lift the mood in the bank's global markets business, after he took over the division from caretaker boss Thierry Roland on Friday.
Elhedery, who is relocating to London from Dubai to take up the role, is filling a position vacated by veteran HSBC banker Thibaut de Roux in September last year.
25 of the new promotions are in global markets, and other high-ranking appointments are in progress.
Nathalie Safar, one of the investment bank's most senior women, is leaving her position as global equities chief operating officer after eight years in the role, a second staff memo seen by Reuters showed.
She will take up a newly-created position of head of front to back resource and cost management, focusing on making savings that will fund investments in the bank's growth areas.

A search for her successor is underway, the memo said.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen said it has won a legal battle to stop Lloyds (LON:LLOY) cancelling a 100 billion pound ($133 billion) investment management contract early, a decision which could cost the bank hundreds of millions of pounds in extra fees.
Lloyds had argued the 11 billion pound merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management to form SLA in 2017 allowed it to end Aberdeen's 2014 contract to manage a large slice of its pension assets because it considered insurer Standard Life as a ""material competitor"".
But after a lengthy arbitration process, a tribunal ruled Lloyds was not entitled to give notice in February 2018 to terminate the deal, raising questions over the status of a new partnership with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and a wealth management tie-up with  Schroders  (LON:SDR).
SLA's victory also raises the prospect that Lloyds will have to pay some or all of the 390 million pounds the asset manager would have earned under the terms of the contract due to expire in March 2022, even if it continues to transfer assets to BlackRock and Schroders. 
These charges will come on top of the fees promised to the new partners. 
""The ruling does not allow any right of appeal. We would expect Lloyds to have to pay compensation. This is likely to be in the order of around 300 million pounds,"" KBW analyst Edward Firth said in a note to clients on Tuesday. 
SLA said it was considering appropriate next steps, while the prospect of a payout had lifted its shares by 1.4 percent at 0814 GMT, while Lloyds shares were up 0.2 percent.
""DISAPPOINTED"" 
For Lloyds, ""the sums are broadly irrelevant in the context of the Group"", KBW's Firth said, flagging an 'outperform' rating and 67 pence a share target price on its shares.
A spokesman for Scottish Widows said the Lloyds-owned insurer was ""disappointed"" with the ruling but it would press ahead with plans to transfer assets to BlackRock and Schroders.
""We will continue to work closely with Standard Life Aberdeen to ensure there is no disruption to performance or service,"" the spokesman said.
Lloyds awarded BlackRock a contract to manage 30 billion pounds in assets in October, to be invested using the U.S. company's index strategies in one of Europe's biggest investment contracts of last year. 

Previously Lloyds said the BlackRock deal would begin after the arbitration process or when the existing contract expires.

Boeing jets were featured on a draft list of American products China would buy to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S., the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private deliberations. Now, safety concerns are pushing China to examine whether to cut the 737 Max from the list altogether or replace it with other Boeing models after the crash of a plane operated by Ethiopian Airlines led to the aircraft being grounded worldwide, they said.
A reduction in aircraft purchases could make it harder for China to fulfill an offer it’s said to have made to pare its $300-billion-plus annual goods trade surplus with the U.S. over six years, and potentially delay any overall agreement between the two countries. Worth billions of dollars and a key U.S. export, planes would likely be a key component of any commitment by China to buy more American goods, along with soybeans, meat and natural gas.
China’s Ministry of Commerce, which is in charge of the nation’s trade talks with the U.S., didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A Boeing representative declined to comment.
For Boeing, China’s exclusion of Max purchases in a trade deal would mark another setback for a company that’s reeling from a crisis of confidence over its top-selling plane, which accounts for almost a third of its operating profit.
Chinese airlines made up about 20 percent of 737 Max deliveries worldwide through January, according to Boeing’s website. China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines Co. has 16 of the aircraft, with another 34 on order. China Eastern Airlines Corp. has 13, while Air China Ltd. has 14, according to Boeing. Other Chinese airlines that have bought the Max include Hainan Airlines Holdings Co. and Shandong Airlines Co.
The 737, which first entered service in the late 1960s, is the aviation industry’s best-selling model and Boeing’s top earner. The re-engineered Max version has racked up more than 5,000 orders worth in excess of $600 billion, including planes that have already been delivered.
Most of China’s airlines count the government as its top shareholder and aircraft purchases are often coordinated by state agencies including the Civil Aviation Administration of China and National Development and Reform Commission. No other country has more demand for aircraft than China, which is estimated to seek 7,690 new planes worth $1.2 trillion in the 20 years through 2037, according to Boeing’s latest forecast."

MILAN (Reuters) - Prosecutors in Milan have begun a formal investigation into alleged money laundering involving Dutch bank  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV's Italian business, a source close to the matter said.
ING had no immediate comment on Tuesday on the investigation, which was launched after prosecutors received requests for assistance from other European countries, where dozens of people had reported online scams, the source added.
Those being investigated by Milan prosecutors were carried out using various online accounts and the stolen money ended up in accounts opened at ING in Milan, the source said.
Last year ING, the Netherlands' largest financial services provider, admitted criminals had been able to launder money through its accounts and agreed to pay 775 million euros ($900 million) to settle the case.
Milan prosecutors had already notified the Bank of Italy, which had carried out its own inspections in addition to the prosecutors' initial investigations, the source said.
The Italian central bank, which made checks from October until the start of 2019, has told ING that it is not allowed to take on new customers in Italy after failing to prevent money laundering transactions through its accounts.
In the settlement last year, Dutch financial crime prosecutors said ING had violated laws on preventing money laundering and financing terrorism ""structurally and for years"" by not properly vetting the beneficial owners of client accounts and by not noticing unusual transactions through them.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - German wholesaler Metro AG has kicked off the sale of its China operations by calling for bids, in a deal that would value the business at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, two people with direct knowledge of the deal said.
Metro, which owns 95 stores in China and real estate assets in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, is planning to offload a majority stake in its China business, said the people.
The sale move is part of a global reorganization of the wholesaler and comes as China's wholesale and retail sectors are experiencing disruption from e-commerce players. 
Metro's China business could yet be valued at up to $3 billion, said two separate sources with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Potential bidders include electronics retailer Suning Holdings Group, supermarket chain operators Wumart Stores Inc and Yonghui Superstores, according to three of the people. 
Private equity firms such as Hillhouse Capital Group and Bain Capital are also studying a potential deal, they added.
Property makes up the bulk of the value in Metro's China business, the people said, cautioning, however, that there is a large gap between price expectations among buyers and the seller.
A Metro spokeswoman in Germany said the company is in talks with potential partners concerning the further development of its China business but declined to comment on details of its exchanges with potential partners or the sale process. 
Bain and Suning declined to comment. Yonghui and Hillhouse did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Calls to Wumart went unanswered.
First-round, non-binding bids are due in the second week of April, said two of the people.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are advising Metro, the people said. The banks declined to comment.
All the sources declined to be named as the deal talks are not public.
E-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holdings has also been in talks with Metro about taking a stake in the China business, Reuters previously reported.
Tech giants such as Alibaba and Tencent have been investing in supermarkets and shopping malls to help develop their online-to-offline strategy.
Alibaba in 2015 poured $4.6 billion into Suning's listed entity - Suning.Com Co Ltd and holds a 19.99 percent stake, its biggest step towards integrating online and store-based shopping at the time. 
Tencent, which has invested 4.2 billion yuan in a 5 percent stake of Yonghui, is also forming a partnership in China with Europe' s largest retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).
The German wholesaler opened its first China store in Shanghai in 1996 and now has over 11,000 employees in the country. Its sales in the country reached 2.7 billion euros ($3 billion) in the financial year of 2017-2018, according to its website. 
Once a sprawling retail conglomerate, Metro has been restructuring in recent years to focus on its core cash-and-carry business, selling Kaufhof department stores and then splitting from consumer electronics group Ceconomy.

Metro is also trying to offload its loss-making Real hypermarkets chain.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares inched toward their longest winning streak of the year on Tuesday ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting, while the pound kept calm after another dramatic twist in the Brexit plot bolstered bets on a lengthy delay to the process. 
With traders expecting soothing sounds from the Fed's two-day meeting which starts later, Europe's early 0.2-0.5 percent gains lifted MSCI's 47-country world index for a seventh straight day and to its highest since October.
Asia had stuck to tight ranges during its session, but all three major Wall Street indexes were pointing up again after bank and tech stocks had helped extend the year's 20 percent charge for U.S. markets on Monday. 
The dollar though was feeling the strain, skulking near a two-week low on the bets that with both U.S. and global growth now slowing the Fed will need to put its rate hike plans on ice. 
""The market has priced that the Fed's next move will be a (rate) cut,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), adding that it may have to if U.S. data continues to sour and key indicators such as the U.S. yield curve start flashing warning signs again.
Investors will particularly look to see whether policymakers have sufficiently lowered their interest rate forecasts to more closely align their ""dot plot"", a diagram showing individual policymakers' rate views for the next three years.
Also expected is more detail on a plan to stop cutting the Fed's holdings of nearly $3.8 trillion in bonds.
""A key focus is when the Fed will omit the word 'patient' from its statement, as that would be a pre-requisite for a rate hike,"" said Toru Yamamoto, chief fixed income strategist at Daiwa Securities.
SPEAKER'S STATEMENT
In currency markets, sterling found some footing after slipping to as low as $1.3183 in the previous session as lawmakers cast doubt on Prime Minister Theresa May's third attempt to get parliament to back her Brexit deal. 
May's Brexit plans were thrown into further turmoil on Monday when the speaker of parliament ruled that she could not put her divorce deal to a new vote unless it was re-submitted in fundamentally different form.
May has only two days to win approval for her deal to leave the European Union if she wants to go to a summit with the bloc's leaders on Thursday with something to offer them in return for more time.
Meanwhile, senior diplomats said the European Union leaders could hold off making any final decision on any Brexit delay when they meet in Brussels later this week, depending on what exactly May asks them for.
""The predominant notion adopted by the market is that as long as the worst case scenario of hard Brexit is avoided by delaying Brexit, the pound is a buy on dips,"" Rabobank strategists said in a note. 
With dollar nudging down ahead of the Fed, the euro made some ground at $1.1347 and the Japanese yen inched up 0.1 percent to 111.28 yen to the U.S. currency. 
Oil prices were near 2019 highs, supported by supply cuts led by producer club OPEC. U.S. sanctions against oil producers Iran and Venezuela are also boosting prices, although traders said the market may be capped by rising U.S. output. 

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures gained 0.2 percent to $59.23 per barrel, while Brent crude futures rose to $67.97, also not far from this year's high of $68.14.

BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German lawmakers on Monday criticized deputy finance minister Joerg Kukies and Goldman Sachs, alleging a conflict of interest in the U.S. investment bank advising state-backed Commerzbank on a possible merger with  Deutsche Bank .
Kukies, who was formerly co-head of Goldman Sachs (N:GS) in Germany, left the Wall Street firm a year ago to become deputy German finance minister.
Kukies has since advocated a merger between Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn), which unions warn could mean up to 30,000 job cuts, people familiar with the matter say.
Goldman Sachs is advising Commerzbank on the $28 billion plus deal deliberations, people familiar with the matter said.
""It's a conflict of interest,"" Fabio De Masi, a prominent leftist lawmaker in the German parliament, said, pointing to the state's 15 percent stake in Commerzbank.
A spokesman for Kukies told Reuters there was no conflict of interest and that he had worked in the trading department at Goldman Sachs, which was ""strictly separated"" from bankers who advised on mergers.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 
""In his 17 years at Goldman Sachs, Joerg Kukies exclusively worked for the sales and trading sector with no responsibility for the advisory/mergers and acquisitions section,"" the spokesman for Kukies said.
Although confirmation of merger talks between Germany's two largest banks, following months of speculation, has boosted their share prices, it has also triggered opposition and concerns over the impact on employment.
The issue is a highly emotive one in Germany and in its Tuesday edition, top-selling tabloid newspaper Bild raised a question mark over Kukie's future in the government. 
""When 30,000 jobs are on the line, the government must avoid the impression of a conflict of interest,"" De Masi added.
This was echoed by Danyal Bayaz, a German parliamentarian and finance expert from the country’s Green party.
""In the financial crisis, we saw that government and finance were too interconnected. Ten years later, we don't want to have the same. We want a strict separation from politics and industry,"" Bayaz said.

""It is important to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest,"" he added.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said it will boost U.S. production of its largest sport utility vehicles in a move to grab profits in a market where consumers favor larger, more comfortable vehicles.
Ford's Kentucky Truck plant in Louisville will increase the production rate for Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicles by 20 percent in July - the second 20 percent increase in a year for both models, executives said during a media briefing on Monday.
The move highlights Detroit automakers' aggressive efforts to capitalize on popular, profitable large vehicles in America's heartland, even as policymakers in California, China and Europe push for smaller, electric vehicles to reduce carbon dioxide emissions linked to climate change. 
The Trump administration, however, has proposed freezing U.S. fuel efficiency standards - a decision that would make it easier for automakers to sell large SUVs and pickup trucks. [nL1N20T0TB]
With gasoline relatively cheap, U.S. consumers are paying premium prices for large SUVs that seat eight people and can tow a four-ton trailer.
The average transaction price of a new Ford Expedition is $62,700, Ford U.S. marketing director Matt VanDyke said, up $11,700 from the previous year. Ford does not disclose profits by model line. Average prices for the luxury Navigator rose to $81,000 in February from $78,000 a year earlier, according to Lincoln data.
In January, Ford said transaction prices across its U.S. model lines averaged $38,400, above the $34,000 industry average.
General Motors Co (N:GM), which dominates the North American large SUV segment, will launch a new generation of its large SUV Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe, and GMC Yukon, models later this year.  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) last month said it will re-enter the large SUV segment with new models due out in late 2020. [nL1N20L156]
Ford workers and engineers redesigned portions of the Kentucky Truck assembly line to allow for the latest increase, Ford North American manufacturing chief John Savona said. 
For the first time, he said, workers at certain stations will be positioned at two levels - some in pits and some on platforms - to install parts on upper and lower sections of a vehicle in unison.
The redesigned Expedition and Navigator assembly system requires 550 additional workers, and those jobs will be filled by workers currently at Ford's Louisville assembly plant, which builds small Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUVs, Savona said.
Ford invested $925 million to build the new generation Expedition and Navigator SUVs at the Kentucky plant. The automaker is pushing for market share in a segment it largely surrendered to rival GM over the past decade.
Since launching its new big SUVs, Ford has improved its share of the U.S. large SUV segment by 5.6 percentage points, Ford's VanDyke told reporters on Monday. 
But GM still commands a 70 percent share of a market where vehicles sell for more than double the average price of a midsize sedan. Ford on Monday night launched a marketing campaign to win over customers. Their slogan: ""Built to be a better big.""

Investing.com -- Two companies, two warehouses, two very different reactions from investors.
ASOS (LON:ASOS) and Ocado (LON:OCDO), two U.K. names that are enjoying rather than suffering from the disruption of the retail sector, are heading sharply in opposite directions early Tuesday in Europe, as their struggles with warehousing problems puts their respective business models into sharp focus.
Online fashion shop Asos fell as much as 11% after the company said its new warehouse in the U.S. hadn’t been able to cope with higher-than-expected demand. It was the second U.S.-related disappointment from the company in a couple of months, after its Black Friday promotions went badly awry.
Nor has it had much better luck in France and Germany. CEO Nick Beighton told Reuters the company would have to invest more in promotions there in the second half of its fiscal year to get sales back on track.
The shares bounced to be down only 2.0% by 04:00 AM ET (08:00 GMT), reassured by Beighton’s comments that the U.S. business is now ‘gaining momentum’ and that the backlog will be cleared soon. But they’re still down by a quarter from before the Black Friday fiasco, and down by more than half from last year’s peak.
It’s a different story at Ocado, which hit new all-time highs after its latest quarterly update. The online grocer appears to have convinced investors that the disruption to its U.K. business after a fire at its biggest logistics center is no big deal – at least not compared to the money it stands to earn on selling its technology to the likes of Marks & Spencer and Kroger’s.The shares rose 3.4% and are now up nearly 50% this year.
Elsewhere in Europe, stocks are broadly higher after Wall Street hit a new four-month high on Monday. Germany's Dax and the U.K. FTSE 100 are both up 0.4%, as is the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600, at 383.64.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) are both retreating, however, after Europe’s new head of banking supervision Andrea Enria poured cold water on the idea of creating national champions. Union pushback has also underlined the difficulty the banks would have in realizing the cost savings that would make the merger worthwhile.
Meanwhile in France, telecoms group  Iliad  (PA:ILD) is down 5.9% after cutting its cash flow targets this year and saying it may sell some of its mobile assets."
895,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India government asked banks to save Jet, avoid bankruptcy - sources","By Aftab Ahmed and Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government has asked state-run banks to rescue privately held Jet Airways without pushing it into bankruptcy, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to avert thousands of job losses weeks before a general election, two people within the administration told Reuters.
The finance ministry has in the past year sought regular updates from the banks, led by State Bank of India (SBI), on Jet's financial health, the people said. In recent months, the banks have provided weekly updates about a revival plan and also sought government advice, the people added.
""Top officials at the finance ministry seek regular updates on the issue,"" said an official at one of Jet's lenders, who did not want to be identified as discussions are private.
Details of the discussion between the finance ministry and bankers on bailing out Jet have not been previously reported.
New Delhi has urged state-run banks to convert debt into equity and take a stake in Jet in a rare move in India to use taxpayer money to save a struggling private-sector company from bankruptcy. The two people plus one more source, however, said this would be ""transitory"" and lenders could sell the stakes once Jet revives. 
The government has also nudged its 49 percent-owned National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) - created to invest in stalled and new infrastructure projects - to buy a stake in Jet, a separate government source said.
Saddled with more than 1 billion dollars of debt, Jet is struggling to stay aloft. It has delayed payments to banks, suppliers, employees and aircraft lessors - some of which have begun terminating lease deals.
The world's biggest democracy is gearing up for an election next month and its booming aviation sector, which employs close to a million people, has been one of the job-creation success stories that Modi can point to as he seeks a second term.
It is crucial for India that Jet revives as the fall of its second-largest airline could have ""disastrous consequences for the investment climate"" in the sector, a top government official told Reuters.
The official is concerned that if Jet collapses it could drive up airfare in a fast-growing market, wiping out efforts to bring low-cost air travel to India's hinterland.
A chaotic end could also make it more difficult for the government to sell a stake in Air India, at least in the short run. Last year, it failed to sell part of its stake in the indebted carrier which currently relies on taxpayer money.
If the government's plan for Jet succeeds, then state-run banks including SBI and Punjab National Bank (PNB) as well as NIIF would together own at least a third of the airline until they find a new buyer.
Currently, Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways is Jet's largest shareholder with a 24 percent stake.
India's finance ministry, SBI, PNB and Jet Airways did not respond to requests for comment.
KINGFISHER'S COLLAPSE
Most companies in Jet's financial condition would be placed by creditors into India's new bankruptcy process, two bankers said. However, memories of the chaos sparked by  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines' demise in 2012 have prompted the government to seek a more sober road to rescue, they said.
Kingfisher's bankruptcy caused job losses, lessors lost millions of dollars and banks took massive writedowns.
Putting what is essentially a services provider like Jet through the bankruptcy process would diminish its value because it owns no major assets, unlike a manufacturing company, as most of its planes are leased, said another government official.
If it is pushed into bankruptcy and lessors start pulling even more planes out of service, there would be nothing left for any potential investors, the official said. Already 41 planes have been grounded by lessors in the past three months, leading to flight cancellations.
While on the surface Jet's future still hangs in the balance with its main shareholder Etihad at loggerheads over the final terms of any deal, behind-the-scenes support from the government means there is likely to be a bailout.
But there are no easy options, one of the sources said, adding that the lenders do not have the expertise to run an airline so they have to decide what to do once they convert their debt into equity.
New Delhi is also backing a proposal for Jet's founder and Chairman Naresh Goyal to step down if it means saving the airline, another official said.
""Saving Jet is not equivalent to saving Goyal,"" the official said.
RISING AIRFARE
Jet, with its fleet of 119 planes, once controlled a sixth of India's domestic aviation market. The 25-year-old airline is also one of only two full-service carriers that flies to international destinations. The other is Air India.
The government ideally wants four to six major airlines to ensure fares are competitive and passengers have greater choice, according to the top government source. 
India plans to build 100 new airports costing about $60 billion which would need a steady stream of flights to sustain them, and that is possible only if there are enough airlines, a separate official said.

""The investment in these airports will solely depend on operators willing to have regular flights at affordable prices and one operator going bankrupt does not help,"" he said.

The acquisition of Standard & Poor’s Investment Advisory Services LLC gives the New York-based bank another vehicle to bring its funds to investors through the creation of model portfolios -- ready-made packages of ETFs that its asset-management arm will oversee. Goldman currently offers 18 ETFs, which together manage about $11.6 billion or less than 1 percent of the $3.8 trillion market.
“We see it as a big opportunity for our ETF platform,” Michael Crinieri, Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s head of ETF strategy, said in a phone interview. “Our goal is to build ETFs that would be effective building blocks in these model asset allocation portfolios, so we see it as a driver of growth in the future.”
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019, GSAM said in a statement Monday, without disclosing the terms of the agreement. Standard & Poor’s Investment Advisory Services oversees about $33 billion in assets.
While model portfolios have existed for years, the ETF industry has been approaching the packages with a newfound urgency lately. The portfolios offer issuers a way to get their products into more hands and stand out in a marketplace of more than 2,000 funds. The pitch to advisers is that they can focus more on the personal side of their jobs -- spending time with clients and focusing on their wider financial health -- rather than on making asset allocation choices with ETFs or single securities.
“Our goal is to really provide cost-effective ETF model portfolios that will meet the needs of our adviser clients,’’ Crinieri said.
Advisers will be able to choose from GSAM’s model portfolios of ETFs -- offered for free -- as well as open architecture model portfolios of third-party ETFs charging a fee. While the Goldman models won’t charge an additional fee, costs from the underlying ETFs will generate revenue for the firm.
Vanguard Group,  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). all offer packages to advisers either directly or through various intermediary channels. While these fund providers typically charge nothing or very little for their models, the fees from the embedded ETFs are baked into the costs. And the packages give the issuers more control over how many products advisers buy."

Investors have started to place their bets for a stable government, especially after India's tensions with its nuclear-armed neighbor have slightly allayed. 
India prepares to vote in a massive exercise that begins next month, while the counting is scheduled to take place on May 23.
Foreign inflows into Indian equities soared to their highest in 15 months at $2.42 billion in February, a big swing from 2018's net outflows of $4.4 billion.
Hopes for deeper economic reforms and more monetary policy easing have helped bring back foreign investors to India. 
The risk/reward appears favorable for India once again, GS analysts said in a note dated Monday. 
India's sharp underperformance in the first two months of this year, signs of an uptick in demand leading to better-than-expected earnings season for the December quarter and pick-up in foreign flows led the brokerage to upgrade their view. 
GS had downgraded India to ""marketweight"" in September, citing near-term risks related to macro factors and earnings, stretched valuations and election-related uncertainties.

Telecom equipment maker Ericsson received 4.62 billion rupees ($67.42 million) from RCom as unpaid dues from a deal it had signed in 2014, a spokeswoman said on Monday.
India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, who controls oil-to-telecoms powerhouse Reliance Industries, appears to have offered support to ensure Anil Ambani paid off total dues of 5.5 billion rupees ($80 million) to Ericsson.

Asked about the looming competition, Hastings said the biggest challenge for Netflix is to ""not get too distracted"" by rivals but still ""learn lessons"" from them.
""These are amazing, large, well-funded companies with very significant efforts,"" Hastings said. ""They are going to do some great shows. I’m going to be envious. They're going to come up with some great ideas. We're going to want to borrow those.""
But, he added, ""we will make this a better industry if we have great competitors."" 

Hastings also said he expected Netflix, like other U.S. technology companies, to be blocked in China ""for a long time.""

904,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 11:18PM ET</span>","U.S. states probing Hyundai, Kia over vehicle fires: Connecticut AG","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - A group of U.S. states is investigating Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors Corp for potential unfair and deceptive acts related to reports of hundreds of vehicle fires, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said on Monday.
The South Korean automakers have recalled more than 2.3 million vehicles since 2015 to address various engine fire risks in a series of recalls. In November, Reuters reported that federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Hyundai and Kia to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects had been conducted properly.
""We are aware of multiple fires involving Connecticut vehicles, including some allegedly already repaired through the recall process. This is a serious matter, and we are moving aggressively and responsibly to uncover the facts and to ensure accountability,"" Tong said in a statement.
Hyundai and Kia said they were cooperating with the investigation. Hyundai added that it had improved its ""engine manufacturing"" and was reaching out to affected customers.
A spokeswoman for the Connecticut attorney general declined to say how many states were taking part.
Reuters reported in January that the companies would offer software upgrades for 3.7 million vehicles not being recalled.
A South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has been probing the timeliness of three U.S. recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles.
In 2015, Hyundai recalled 470,000 U.S. Sonata sedans, saying engine failure would result in a vehicle stall, increasing the risk of a crash. At the time, Kia did not recall its vehicles, which share the same ""Theta II"" engines.
In March 2017, Hyundai expanded its original U.S. recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles with those Theta II engines, citing the same issue involving manufacturing debris. On the same day, Kia also recalled 618,000 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles, all of which use the same engine.
Last month, the Center for Auto Safety, which has petitioned NHTSA to demand the recall of additional vehicles, told Congress that Kia and Hyundai must recall more vehicles at risk of fires after reports of 300 fires not the result of a collision.

On Monday, Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, asked NHTSA to launch a safety defect investigation into Hyundai and Kia vehicles with the ""Theta II"" engines and order an immediate recall of vehicles.

905,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 10:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi Arabia curbs family influence in Binladin group shake-up,"By Stephen Kalin
RIYADH (Reuters) - The influence of Saudi Arabia's Bin Laden family on its eponymous construction business has been curtailed in a restructuring that follows an anti-corruption crackdown by Riyadh, a document seen by Reuters shows.
Saudi businessman Khalid Nahas has been named chairman of the newly-established Binladin Group Global Holding Company, which is 36.22 percent owned by Istidama, a finance ministry subsidiary, and 63.78 percent by Binladin Company for Development and Commercial Investment.
Only two Bin Laden brothers, Saad and Abdullah, are represented on the new nine-person board, the document from the kingdom's commerce ministry reveals, in a break from the family's exclusive control over its earlier company, Saudi Binladin Group (SBG).
The stake owned by Istidama reflects the ownership relinquished by brothers Bakr, Saleh and Saad last year after they were arrested in the corruption purge led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
SBG, which for decades built Saudi Arabia's roads, mosques and palaces, is crucial to ambitious new plans for major tourism and infrastructure projects. It is not connected to Osama, one of the younger brothers in the family.
Other board members of the new entity include senior Saudi businessmen with experience at some of the kingdom's most successful companies such as state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco, petrochemical producer Saudi Basic Industries Corp, and property developer Jabal Omar Development Co.
Two sources familiar with the matter also told Reuters that SBG's chief financial officer, Klaus Froelich, had resigned following the restructuring. The former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) banker was hired in 2016 to help the firm overcome a crisis sparked by the collapse of a construction crane in Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters in December that SBG would soon have a ""normal board"" with family members and representatives of government ownership after a five-member committee restructured its governance.
That committee was led by Abdulrehman al-Harkan, a former chief executive of Riyadh-based developer Dar Al Arkan, who is not on the new company's board.
Jadaan left open the possibility that the Binladin company could eventually be listed on the stock market.
Reuters reported in September that SBG had ended up on a collision course with the government after chairman Bakr Binladin and his shareholder brothers resisted earlier pressure to list.

Saleh and Saad Bin Laden were released last year under the anti-corruption campaign, which netted princes and ministers, shattered investor confidence and was decried by critics as a shakedown and power play. Bakr was temporarily released in January but sources say he later returned to detention.

906,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 09:56PM ET</span>","Elon Musk never sought approval for a single Tesla tweet, U.S. SEC tells judge","(Reuters) - Chief Executive Elon Musk has never sought pre-approval for a single tweet about Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc since striking a court-approved deal about how to communicate important information about the electric vehicle maker, the top U.S. securities regulator told a judge on Monday.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is doubling down on the government's demand to find the Tesla CEO in contempt of a previous fraud settlement that required him to have the company pre-approve any tweets that could materially impact the automaker.
The ongoing public battle between Tesla's chief executive and the SEC piles pressure on Musk, the public face of Tesla, who is struggling to make the company profitable after cutting the price of its Model 3 sedan to $35,000.
The SEC said a Feb. 19 tweet that Musk sent to his more than 24 million Twitter followers claiming the electric vehicle-maker would build around 500,000 cars in 2019 was ""a blatant violation"" of the agreement.
The SEC asked Tesla in late February whether any of Musk's tweets had been pre-approved since that policy was adopted, according to the filing in federal court in Manhattan.
Tesla responded, after more than two weeks, to say simply: ""No.""
""It is therefore stunning to learn that, at the time of filing of the instant motion, Musk had not sought pre-approval for a single one of the numerous tweets about Tesla he published in the months since the court-ordered pre-approval policy went into effect,"" the SEC said in the filing.
The regulator last month alleged that Musk had violated a September settlement of fraud charges by tweeting material information about Tesla without pre-approval from the company.
In response, Musk had argued that his ""single, immaterial"" tweet was in compliance with the settlement, and that the SEC's push to find him in contempt infringed on his free speech.
Lawyers for Musk said the tweet complied with the company's communication policy for senior executives and was a ""proud and optimistic restatement of publicly disclosed information.""
The SEC said in Monday's filing that the pre-approval policy agreed in the settlement was designed to include a wide variety of his comments, not just those that were deemed material by the regulator's standards.
The fraud settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC resolved a lawsuit brought by the regulator over claims Musk made on Twitter in August that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The SEC called those tweets ""false and misleading"" and a go-private deal never materialized.
As part of that settlement, Musk stepped down as the company's chairman and he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million each in fines.
Tesla has backed off a plan to close all its U.S. stores and said it will instead raise prices of its higher-end vehicles by about 3 percent on average. Last week, Tesla unveiled its Model Y crossover SUV, targeted to begin production in 2020.
Musk called the regulator the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission"" on Twitter after the settlement, and tweeted that ""something is broken with SEC oversight"" just one day after the agency started pursuing the contempt order. 
Legal experts have said the SEC could pursue multiple avenues, including a higher fine, imposing further restrictions on Musk's activities or removing him from Tesla's board or helm. 
Tesla published a new communications policy in December for senior executives as part of the settlement. It called for Tesla's general counsel and a newly designated in-house securities law attorney to pre-approve any written statements about Tesla that could be material. 
A disclosure controls committee, made up of board members Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and James Murdoch, was tasked with overseeing compliance with the new policy.
The case is U.S. SEC v Elon Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 1:18-cv-8865-AJN-GWG

907,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 07:19PM ET</span>",Huawei leads Asian domination of U.N. patent applications in 2018,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms giant Huawei led the pack with Asia accounting for more than half of the international patent applications at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) last year, WIPO said on Tuesday.
Huawei, which has been under pressure since the United States demanded its allies bar Chinese vendors from participating in building 5G networks due to national security concerns, made 5,405 patent applications to the U.N. body, up from 4,024 in 2017. 
""It’s an all-time record by anyone,"" WIPO director general Francis Gurry told a news conference. 
WIPO oversees international treaties governing patents, trademarks and industrial designs. Its annual report on the applications it receives - a subset of all intellectual property filings globally - gives an early snapshot of the trends.
Asia-based filings accounted for 50.5 percent of the total applications received, Gurry said.
""Historically, this is really quite extraordinary,"" he said. ""Historically, this is a momentous occasion, this is something that is really a very, very significant result.""
The second-biggest user of the WIPO international patent system in 2018 was Mitsubishi Electric with 2,812 filings, followed by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) with 2,499. 
Although inventors in the United States filed more applications than in any other country, China looks set to take the top place this year or next, after a meteoric rise over the past quarter century. 
Having filed only one patent application in the WIPO system in 1993, its applications overtook Japan's in 2017 and grew by a further 9.1 percent to 53,345 in 2018, while the number of U.S.-based filings slipped 0.9 percent to 56,142. 
Asia accounted for six of the top eight companies, with China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) and BOE Technology Group and South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and LG Electronics also among the leaders. 
China also jumped up the academic rankings, with four of its universities making the top ten list for the first time. 
While the University of California remained well ahead among educational institutions, with 501 patent applications in 2018, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology was second, Shenzhen University and South China University of Technology leapt into third and fourth spot, just ahead of Harvard.
Gurry said Chinese universities benefited from an extremely strong emphasis on innovation and the commercialization of basic research, as well as access to the world's second largest national pool of research and development spending. 
He said China had introduced an equivalent of the U.S. Bayh-Dole Act, ensuring that patents taken out on government-sponsored research were being used, which may have had an influence on Chinese universities' attitude towards commercializing their research.
The WIPO report represents applications for patents, trademarks and designs that their owners feel are valuable enough to protect and promote in overseas markets. Another WIPO report, released in December includes millions of applications for IP protection that are never filed overseas.

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) is setting targets for hiring minority groups for the first time as it ramps up efforts to diversify its workforce, according to a memo sent by top executives to employees on Monday. 
The Wall Street bank, which last year said it wanted women to make up half of its entry-level workforce, now is aiming to ensure that 14 percent of new analysts and associates in the Americas are Hispanic or Latino and 11 percent of them black, according to the memo, which was seen by Reuters. 
In Britain, Goldman Sachs wants 9 percent of its entry-level workforce to be black. 
The bank, whose senior executives are primarily white and male, did not set targets for more experienced employees, but is now requiring businesses to interview at least two qualified diverse candidates for each open position. 
Goldman Sachs said in the memo it is “nearly there” with the targets it announced last year for campus hiring, and is exploring ways to increase the portion of staff who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, disabled or veterans. 
David Solomon, who took over as chief executive of the bank in October, has been vocal about increasing diversity. He and two deputies sent the staff-wide memo ahead of disclosures on its gender pay gap that are required in Britain.
Last year, Goldman Sachs reported a mean gender pay gap in Britain for its international business of 55.5 percent and a mean bonus gap for the unit of 72.2 percent. Other companies, including HSBC Plc, fared worse.

Goldman Sachs is not alone on Wall Street in its diversity and gender equality campaign.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) has also set goals to have half its global staff to be women, and 30 percent of its staff to be black and Hispanic or Latino in the United States.

Foxconn said the next phases of factory construction will begin by this summer ""and the facility will begin production in the 4th quarter of 2020.""
Foxconn initially planned to manufacture advanced large-screen displays for TVs and other consumer and professional products at the Wisconsin plant. It later said it would build smaller Generation 6 LCD screens instead.
The initial Gen6 facility will manufacture screens for education, medical and healthcare, entertainment and sports, security, and smart cities products, Foxconn said Monday.
In February, Foxconn reiterated it would still build a factory in Wisconsin after the company's chairman spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump, following a Reuters report the Taiwanese company was reconsidering its plans.
Reuters reported in January that Foxconn was reconsidering making LCD panels at a planned $10 billion Wisconsin campus and instead intended to hire mostly engineers and researchers there.
Foxconn has stopped using the $10 billion figure in recent releases and has not responded to questions about how much it now plans to invest in Wisconsin.
The planned 20-million-square-foot campus marked the largest investment for a brand new location by a foreign-based company in U.S. history when it was announced at a White House ceremony in 2017. It was praised by Trump as proof of his ability to revive American manufacturing.
Heavily criticized in some quarters, the Foxconn project was championed by Wisconsin’s then governor, Scott Walker, a Republican who helped secure around $4 billion in tax breaks and other incentives before leaving office. Critics called the deal a corporate giveaway that would never result in the promised manufacturing jobs and said it posed serious environmental risks.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Monday that much work on the Foxconn complex appeared to have halted over the last two months.

After the Reuters report in January, Foxconn, a major supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), issued a statement saying the global market environment had changed since the project was first announced and “necessitated the adjustment of plans for all projects, including Wisconsin.""

910,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 05:57PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. FedEx Heads Earnings Calendar
Package delivery behemoth FedEx (NYSE:FDX) leads earnings tomorrow, reporting after the bell.
The company is expected to report earnings of $3.14 a share for its fiscal third quarter, up from $3.11 a year ago, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. Revenue is forecast at $17.62 billion, up 6.8% from a year ago. FedEx shares rose 2.5% on Monday and are up more than 13% this year.
“FedEx stock looks cheap when compared to its peers after the significant downward correction of the past 12 months,” Investing.com’s Haris Anwar wrote Monday. “Its price-to-earnings ratio of 15.68 is lower than the industry average of 25.84.”
And whatever numbers FedEx reports tomorrow, investors shouldn’t forget the dividend of $0.65 per share, with an annual yield of 1.45%, Anwar said.
“This yield looks meager when compared to some high-yielding stocks in the market,” he said. “But we would still prefer FedEx stock over other, riskier, names because the company has a lot of room to grow its payouts.”
Ahead of trading, Michaels Companies Inc (NASDAQ:MIK), which operates the Michaels hobby-center chain and the Aaron Brothers picture-framing business, is expected to report $1.42 a share in the fiscal-fourth quarter, up from $1.19 a share a year ago. Revenue is expected at $1.78 billion, down 5.8% from a year ago. The stock is down nearly 47% from its 52-week high.
After the bell, Steelcase (NYSE:SCS), the venerable maker of office furniture systems, is expected to report 26 cents a share in earnings for the fiscal-fourth quarter, up from 19 cents a year ago.
And Smartsheet (NYSE:SMAR), which went public a year ago, is expected to report a loss of 14 cents a share for the fiscal-fourth quarter. Analysts see revenue jumping 50.8% to $49.7 million. The company makes cloud-based collaboration and work management software. The stock is up 191% since its IPO.
2. Factory Orders Seen Rising
It’s a light economic calendar tomorrow and investors will likely want to keep their powder dry until the Federal Reserve weighs in on interest rates on Wednesday.
The Census Bureau will report January factory orders at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT). On average, economists expect that orders rose 0.3% in January, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Factory orders rose just 0.1% in December, well below the 1.5% the market was expecting at the time.
3. Draw in Crude Supplies to Continue?
A fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute will be closely watched to determine whether U.S. oil producers have ramped up output following data last Tuesday showing a draw in oil inventories.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles fell by 2.6 million barrels for the week ended March 15.
Crude oil futures gained 1% to settle at $59.09 a barrel after Saudi Arabia talked up the prospect of extending output cuts beyond June into the second half of 2019.
U.S. oil prices are near four-month highs, but some have warned that a rise non-OPEC production, led by U.S. producers, could offset OPEC's efforts to avert a glut in global supplies.
""When it comes to non-OPEC production, all eyes are on the U.S.,"" Stratas Advisors said, but added that while it expects a substantial amount of U.S. production growth to occur this year (up 1.1 million bpd) ""we do not think volumes will be overwhelming.""
The rise in crude prices has also boosted demand for currencies with strong ties to the price of oil like the Norwegian Krone.
""Tactically, we still like longs in NOK at these (oil) prices. Short USD/NOK and short EUR/NOK both appeal,"" Societe Generale said in a note."
911,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 05:49PM ET</span>",Ethiopia and Indonesia crash parallels heap pressure on Boeing,"By Maggie Fick and Tim Hepher
ADDIS ABABA/PARIS (Reuters) - Investigators into the Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX crash in Ethiopia have found striking similarities in a vital flight angle with an airplane that came down off Indonesia, a source said, piling pressure on the world's biggest planemaker. 
The Ethiopian Airlines disaster eight days ago killed 157 people, led to the grounding of Boeing's marquee MAX fleet globally and sparked a high-stakes inquiry for the aviation industry.
Analysis of the cockpit recorder showed its ""angle of attack"" data was ""very, very similar"" to that of the Lion Air jet that went down off Jakarta in October, killing 189 people, a person familiar with the investigation said.
The angle of attack is a fundamental parameter of flight, measuring the degrees between the air flow and the wing. If it is too high, it can throw the plane into an aerodynamic stall.
""If that's the case, that does raise the possibility that there is a similar occurrence between the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents,"" said Clint Balog, a Montana-based professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Even then, it was too early to draw firm conclusions, he added. 
A flight deck computer's response to an apparently faulty angle-of-attack sensor is at the heart of the ongoing probe into the Lion Air crash.
Ethiopia's Transport Ministry, France's BEA air accident authority and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have all pointed to similarities between the two disasters, but safety officials stress the investigation is at an early stage.
""Everything will be investigated,"" Ethiopian Transport Ministry spokesman Musie Yehyies told Reuters.
Both planes were 737 MAX 8s and crashed minutes after takeoff with pilots reporting flight control problems. 
Under scrutiny is a new automated system in the 737 MAX model that guides the nose lower to avoid stalling, while Boeing has raised questions in the Lion Air case about whether crew used the correct procedures.
Lawmakers and safety experts are asking how thoroughly regulators vetted the system and how well pilots around the world were trained for it when their airlines bought new planes. 
BOEING PLANS NEW SOFTWARE
With the prestige of one of the United States' biggest exporters at stake, Boeing has said the MAX series is safe, although it plans to roll out new software upgrades in days. 
The fix was developed in the aftermath of the Indonesia crash when regulators suggested false sensor data could cause a system known as MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) to overreact and make the jet hard to control.
Canada is re-examining the validation it gave Boeing's 737 MAX jets, following reports of a U.S. probe into the aircraft's certification by the FAA, Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau said on Monday. 
Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said on Wednesday in a call with reporters that he was “absolutely” confident in the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX 8. The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Canada’s action.
The FAA finds itself in the hot seat, especially over its decision to certify the 737 MAX without demanding additional training. FAA and Boeing will face congressional questions about why the software upgrade took so long to complete and whether Boeing had too great a role in the certification process. 
Boeing has halted deliveries of its best-selling model that was intended to be the industry standard but is now under a shadow. Developed in response to the successful launch of the Airbus A320neo, some 370 MAX jets were in operation at the time of the Ethiopian crash, and nearly 5,000 more on order.
After a 10 percent drop last week that wiped nearly $25 billion off its market share, Boeing stock slid about 1.8 percent on Monday. 
Weekend media reports intensified pressure on Boeing and its domestic U.S. regulator following a call last week by a U.S. flight attendants union for a ""certification review."" 
The Seattle Times said the company's safety analysis of the MCAS system had crucial flaws, including understating power.
The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors and the U.S. Department of Transportation were scrutinizing the FAA's approval of the MAX series, while a jury had issued a subpoena to at least one person involved in its development.
Boeing and the FAA declined to comment on that.
Last week, sources told Reuters that investigators found a piece of a stabilizer in the Ethiopian wreckage set in an unusual position similar to that of the Lion Air plane.
FUTURE ORDERS AT STAKE
Ethiopia is leading the probe, although the black boxes were sent to France and U.S. experts are also participating.
Investigators were expected to select a handful of the roughly 1,800 parameters of flight data in their initial review, including those thrown up by the Lion Air investigation, before analyzing the rest in coming weeks and months.
Norwegian Airlines has already said it will seek compensation after grounding its MAX aircraft, and various companies are reconsidering orders. 
Boeing's main rival, Airbus, has seen its stock rise 5 percent since the crash, but cannot simply pick up the slack given the complicated logistics of plane-building. For now, Boeing continues to build planes while keeping them parked.
Some airlines are revising financial forecasts, too, given the MAX had been factored in as providing around 15 percent maintenance and fuel savings. 
WestJet Airlines Ltd on Monday became the second Canadian carrier to suspend its 2019 financial projections, following Air Canada in light of the 737 MAX groundings.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg sought on Sunday to allay some fears, saying the company was finishing a software update and pilot training revision ""that will address the MCAS flight control law's behavior in response to erroneous sensor inputs.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks and tech helped lead Wall Street higher on Monday, while Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Facebook were a drag and investors eyed this week's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting for affirmation of its commitment to ""patient"" monetary policy.
Following the S&P 500's best week since November, the benchmark index ended the session about 3.3 percent below its all-time high reached in September. All three major U.S. indexes closed in positive territory.
The Dow's fourth straight advance ran into headwinds from  Boeing Co , which fell 1.8 percent as the company faced increasing scrutiny following a fatal crash in Ethiopia on March 10. The drop in shares of the world's largest plane maker extended last week's 10.3 percent decline and was the heaviest weight on the blue-chip index.
The Fed's two-day policy meeting begins on Tuesday. Investors anticipate the U.S. central bank will reinforce its dovish approach toward further interest rate hikes.
""There's always trepidation going into a Fed meeting,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Anything that gives visibility to the potential for future rate hikes is going to keep people on the sidelines."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.23 points, or 0.25 percent, to 25,914.1, the S&P 500 gained 10.46 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,832.94 and the Nasdaq Composite added 25.95 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,714.48.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, eight closed in the black, with energy, consumer discretionary and financial companies enjoying the biggest percentage gains. 
The prospect of extended OPEC supply cuts sent crude prices to four-month highs, which boosted energy companies, while news of upcoming initial public offerings (IPOs), notably from ride-hailing service Lyft, sent the banking sector higher. 
""With markets close to all-time highs again, you see IPOs popping out of the woodwork,"" Ghriskey said.
The communications services sector was the largest percentage loser, weighed down by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
Facebook shares were down 3.4 percent after the European Commission's deputy head said ""at some point, we will have to regulate"" big tech and social media companies to protect citizens and a top-rated Needham analyst downgraded the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy."" 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) surprised investors with the launch of new iPad devices ahead of the company's expected March 25 launch of a content streaming service. The stock closed up 1.0 percent. 
Shares of Apple supplier Synaptics Inc plummeted 22.6 percent after Mizuho downgraded it to ""neutral"" from ""buy.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) advanced 2.1 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, on a report that the banks are helping Germany's two biggest lenders with a potential merger worth more than $28 billion.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 1.7 percent, leading the consumer discretionary sector's advance.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.19-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.65-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 29 new lows.

Wall Street got the week off to a modestly winning start powered by rising energy stocks as oil prices settled 1% higher after Saudi Arabia said it may need to extend oil supply cuts beyond June into the second half of 2019.
Rising consumer discretionary stocks added to gains in the broader market, led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), as the e-commerce giant's planned second headquarters in northern Virginia won approval from local officials. A surge in shares of Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) also firmed up consumer discretionaries amid reports the casino operator was in the early stages of exploring a merger with Eldorado Resorts (NASDAQ:ERI).
The communications services sector was an exception to the generally buoyant mood as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 3.3% after a downgrade from Needham.

Concerns about growing regulation risks weighed on the shares. The concern: More regulation could hamper the company's ability to monetize its data.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) cut some of its early losses, easing downside pressure on industrials, but the aerospace giant still ended the day 1.8% lower as French accident investigator BEA said the flight data recorder from the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max's black box showed ""clear similarities"" between the deadly crash on March 10 and a previous Boeing 737 Max crash in October.
The report from the French accident investigator arrived a day after The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors and the Department of Transportation are looking into the approval process for Boeing's 737 Max aircraft.

917,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 04:16PM ET</span>",U.S. firm FIS buys Worldpay for $35 billion in payments deal bonanza,"By Justin George Varghese, Rachel Armstrong and Pamela Barbaglia
(Reuters) - Fidelity National Information Services Inc (FIS) said on Monday it has agreed to buy Worldpay for about $35 billion, with the U.S. financial services provider striking the biggest deal to date in the fast-growing electronic payments industry.
The financial technology sector is consolidating fast, with global payments set to reach $3 trillion a year in revenue by 2023 as more people switch from cash to digital payments for online and high street sales, consulting firm McKinsey predicts.
""Scale matters in our rapidly changing industry,"" said FIS Chief Executive Gary Norcross, who will lead the combined powerhouse in banking and payments infrastructure.
Growth in payment systems has kept deals rolling even as merger moves in other sectors have stalled on concerns about trade tensions and a global economic slowdown.
The FIS deal, valuing Worldpay at about $43 billion including debt, comes a little more than a year after U.S. firm Vantiv paid $10.63 billion for the payments firm, which was set up in Britain and spun off from Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) in 2010.
And in January, U.S.-based  Fiserv Inc  (NASDAQ:FISV) bought payment processor First Data Corp for $22 billion, while Italy's Nexi plans to list in what could be one of Europe's biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) this year.
FIS and Worldpay combined will have annual revenue of about $12 billion and adjusted core earnings of about $5 billion.
""Vantiv had yet to realize all the synergies from the Worldpay merger but FIS's offer was too good to be refused,"" a source close to the deal said.
Shares in Worldpay, which has provided payment processing services for more than 40 years, closed 9.9 percent higher and Fidelity's edged down 0.7 percent.
""Parking the two companies together gives the enlarged business a very strong position by which to play the structural growth in digital payments. They will be able to provide clients a wider portfolio of services,"" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said.
Worldpay is a major player in card payments, particularly in Britain, while FIS, produces software for banks and asset managers as well as its financial services outsourcing business. 
""FIS should accelerate its revenue growth, significantly expand its position in the merchant acquiring space and generate many synergies,"" Worldpay shareholder Michael Schaefer, portfolio manager at Union Investment, said.
""DIVERSIFICATION PLAY""
Worldpay shareholders will receive 0.9287 FIS shares and $11 in cash for each share held, valuing the company at $112.12 per share, a premium of about 14 percent on its Friday close.
FIS shareholders will own about 53 percent in the combined firm and Worldpay's about 47 percent, with Worldpay Chief Executive Charles Drucker becoming executive vice-chairman.
""This is a fast-changing industry and FIS was under pressure after Fiserv bought First Data in January,"" another source close to the matter said, adding that Worldpay's Drucker, who had come from Vantiv, was the driving force behind the deal. 
""For FIS buying Worldpay means expanding beyond the world of financial outsourcing and tapping into payment processing and e-commerce, the source said, adding that it was a ""diversification play"" giving FIS access to the high-growth payments sector.
The companies said the deal would result in an organic revenue growth outlook of 6 to 9 percent through 2021, and $700 million of total core earnings savings over three years. They expect $500 million of revenue savings and are aiming to deliver nearly $4.5 billion of free cash flow in three years.
""The deal will lead to modest EPS accretion by 2020"", Norcross said in a conference call with analysts. 
FIS, which has grown through acquisitions in the past 15 years, offers software and outsourcing services to banks, asset managers and insurers and in 2015 completed its buy of financial software company SunGard for $9.1 billion.
It had bought Metavante, which provides payment processing services to financial firms, for about $2.9 billion in 2009. 
""FIS' experience and expertise in getting cost to revenue synergies should give (the) market confidence that the targets announced around this deal are very doable,"" Stephen's analyst Brett Huff said in a note, adding that FIS could see increased revenue as companies step up outsourcing.

Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were financial advisers to FIS, while Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP served as legal advisers to FIS on the deal.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP served as financial and legal advisers respectively to Worldpay.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 04:08PM ET</span>",U.S. judge says Rio Tinto must face SEC fraud case,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday rejected  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Plc's bid to dismiss a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit accusing the Anglo-Australian mining company of civil fraud in its handling of a failed investment in a Mozambique coal project.
U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said the regulator may pursue some claims in its October 2017 lawsuit against Rio Tinto, former Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott.
Torres narrowed the main fraud claim against Rio Tinto and Albanese to focus on the former CEO's statements about Mozambique growth prospects, finding no proof they intended to overvalue Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (""RTCM"") by more than $3 billion.
Albanese and Elliott still face SEC claims that their actions led to the overvaluation appearing in a semi-annual Rio Tinto financial report.
Rio Tinto's market value is more than $93 billion, making the company one of the biggest in the SEC's crosshairs.
Rio Tinto and lawyers for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.
The SEC accused the defendants of deceiving investors over Mozambique coal assets that Rio Tinto bought in 2011 for $3.7 billion, through a takeover of the former Riversdale Mining.
By overvaluing the assets, despite an internal assessment that they were worth negative $680 million, Rio Tinto was able to raise more than $5.5 billion from unsuspecting U.S. investors, according to the SEC.
Evidence included an internal May 2012 email from an RTCM executive that flagged poor communication between ministries, and the alleged ""influence of corruption on decision-making.""
Rio Tinto took a more than $3 billion writedown for Mozambique in January 2013. It sold the assets in late 2014 for $50 million.
The surviving SEC case includes a claim that Albanese intended to mislead investors in 2012 by describing the Moatize Basin, where RTCM was located, as a world-class basin coal deposit and long-term growth opportunity.
""Through these statements, Albanese was misrepresenting material facts to investors,"" Torres wrote in her 50-page decision.
In court papers, the defendants said the SEC had failed to establish fraud, and was ""plainly wrong"" to conclude a big writedown was needed sooner, given the complexities of the accounting procedures and valuation assessments.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission brought its own civil claims against Rio Tinto, Albanese and Elliott.

The case is SEC v Rio Tinto Plc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 17-07994.

919,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 03:17PM ET</span>",UnitedHealth Shares Finding Their Mojo Again,"Investing.com - UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has been a big reason why the Dow has held its own lately.
The world's largest health-insurance company was the Dow's best performer last week, up 6.73% adding 108 points to the index by itself. It was up another 1% today.
UnitedHealth's rebound came after falling 3.6% two weeks ago in a crummy week for stocks generally. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all fell for five-straight days.
The UnitedHealth rally is part of the easing of recent selling pressure on health stocks generally.
The Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLV) ETF was up 1.7% last week after falling 3.8% the week before. UnitedHealth represents nearly 7% of the Health Care ETFs assets, third-largest after Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
The selling in health stocks seemed prompted by investor panic over the push by Democrats on health-care-for-all plans. But many analysts noted that, even if a plan was passed by the House of Representatives, it would face intense industry opposition, with UnitedHealth a big leader, and will get nowhere in a GOP-ruled Senate.
The company serves some 115 million customers with its various coverage plans. In addition, it has a large pharmacy benefit management business that negotiates substantial rebates from drug companies and passes the rebates on to customers.
Analysts love the stock.
Twenty-four of 25 analysts tracked by Investing.com rate UnitedHealth a buy. The consensus is that the stock could top $307 in the next 12 months, a 22% gain from current levels. Technical measures also tracked by Investing.com rate the stock a strong buy.
UnitedHealth has been a star performer among the 30 Dow stocks in recent years as earnings and revenue routinely beat estimates. In 2017, it soared nearly 38%. In 2018, the stock rose just 13%, but that included a 6.4% drubbing in last fall's selloff.
An aging population is a big reason health insurance stocks have been strong in recent years. Add to that the ability to add acquisitions to complement their core offerings.
Critics say their premiums are rising too fast and operating pharmacy benefit plans just adds to the companies' bottom lines at the expense of consumers.
UnitedHealth made a stab at addressing that issue last week. It said Tuesday that, starting in 2020, new corporate customers will have to pass their drug rebates on to consumers."
920,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 02:55PM ET</span>",Google seeking to promote rivals to stave off EU antitrust action,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Google is trying to boost price comparison rivals such as Kelkoo in an effort to appease European Union antitrust regulators and ward off fresh fines following a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.7 billion) penalty nearly two years ago.
The European Commission said Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google had used its search engine market power to unfairly promote its own comparison shopping service. 
The company subsequently offered to allow price-comparison rivals to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page, giving them the chance to compete on equal terms. But competitors said the measure failed to create a level playing field.
Earlier this month, Google introduced a new link on its search results which aims to drive more traffic to price comparison rivals.
British competitor Kelkoo said on its blog that it was one of several companies selected to try out the new link which will initially be available in Germany, France and the Netherlands.
Google was not immediately available for comment. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said that she was aware of rivals' criticism of the company's proposal.
EU antitrust enforcers could levy fines up to 5 percent of Google's average daily worldwide turnover if it fails to comply with the 2017 order.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 02:43PM ET</span>",Danske Bank investors express anger over money laundering scandal,"By Teis Jensen and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank’s annual shareholder meeting extended into the fifth hour on Monday as retail investors expressed their discontent over the bank’s involvement in one of the world’s biggest money laundering scandals.
Some of the 700 or so shareholders present called for management to be held personally responsible and others demanded the bank be split up as the fallout from the scandal continues.
Denmark’s largest bank is under investigation in the United States, Denmark, Estonia, France and Britain over 200 billion euros ($226 billion) in payments that were found to have flowed through its Estonian branch from Russia, former Soviet states and elsewhere between 2007 and 2015.
Since the scandal surfaced last year the bank has replaced its CEO and the chairman, pulled out of Russia and the Baltics, boosted its compliance efforts and promised to donate 1.5 billion Danish crowns ($230 million) to fighting financial fraud.
Danske told shareholders on Monday that former and current executives have waived bonuses because of the scandal.
""The executive board has decided to waive the bonuses that could have been paid for 2018,"" new Chairman Karsten Dybvad said at the meeting in Copenhagen.
Dybvad said he supported the decision but did not disclose the size of the bonuses being waived.
Danske's share price halved in 2018 but has stabilized this year, with no major new revelations about the bank having emerged as other lenders have become entangled in the scandal, including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Swedbank. 
Yet the bank’s involvement in money laundering through its Estonian branch was by far the biggest issue at the AGM, where shareholders were greeted outside by about a dozen protestors.
""The bank has made a fool out of shareholders, customers and the entire Danish population,” shareholder Nanna Bonde said at the AGM.
Several retail investors voiced concern about potential lawsuits from investor groups. Danske Bank and four former top executives were sued in January by a U.S. shareholder that accused the bank of defrauding investors and inflating its share price by hiding and failing to stop money laundering.
""It is our fundamental position that the bank has lived up to its information obligation,"" Dybvad said when asked about potential investor lawsuits. ""As such we don't find any basis for lawsuits or for a settlement"".
The former CEO of the influential Confederation of Danish Industry replaced Ole Andersen as Danske chairman at a December extraordinary general meeting called by the Maersk family, the largest shareholder in the bank and in shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk.
Dybvad told Monday's AGM that 2018 had been a low point for Danske but also a turning point, adding that last year also marked the start of internal dialogue about the bank's role in society.

922,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 02:41PM ET</span>",Ride-hailing firm Lyft launches IPO road show in Uber's shadow,"By Joshua Franklin and Diptendu Lahiri
(Reuters) - Lyft Inc kicked off the investor road show for its initial public offering on Monday, targeting a valuation of up to $23 billion and seeking to woo money managers before larger ride-hailing rival Uber Technologies Inc goes public in April. 
The IPOs of Lyft and Uber represent a watershed for Silicon Valley's technology unicorns, which for years have snubbed the stock market in favor of raising capital privately, with investors happy to back their frothy valuations.
The market rally of the last few years, however, coupled with the desire of some of the startups' insiders to cash out, is leading many technology firms, including Airbnb Inc, Slack Technologies Inc and Stripe Inc, to plan market debuts.
Both Uber and Lyft are losing money, so like several unicorns before them, they will seek to tap investor anxiety about missing out on a red-hot technology IPO. Yet despite the hype, some investors and analysts say they will push the companies to outline a path to profitability, as well the prospects of eventually replacing some of their drivers with self-driving vehicles. 
""They need to give us some good direction on when they expect to turn the corner and get to profitability, and let us know what a sustainable sales and marketing level is,"" said Kathleen Smith, founding principal at Renaissance Capital, a research firm and manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds.
San Francisco-based Lyft said in a regulatory filing on Monday that it plans to sell a little more than 30 million class A shares, which have fewer voting rights than class B shares, at between $62 and $68 per share. 
It aims to raise up to $2 billion in its IPO at a fully diluted valuation of as much as $23 billion, which includes restricted stock. The company would fetch a public market capitalization, which counts only shares listed, of just over $19 billion at the top end of the indicated price range. 
Lyft is on track to be the biggest U.S. technology IPO since  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) in 2017, and would be the tenth-largest technology or internet IPO of all time in the United States, according to data provider Dealogic. 
Lyft begins its IPO road show in New York on Monday and Tuesday. The company will have meetings in Boston and New York later this week between investors and co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer, as well as Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts and Catherine Buan, vice president of investor relations. 
The road show will move to the U.S. Midwest and West Coast next week. The company is scheduled to debut on Nasdaq on March 29 under the symbol ""LYFT.""
SIMPLICITY VERSUS DIVERSIFICATION
Uber hopes for a valuation of as much as $120 billion, according to sources, although some analysts have pegged it closer to $100 billion based on selected financial figures it has disclosed. Uber is planning to kick off its IPO in April, Reuters has reported.
Uber, which promotes itself as a global logistics and transportation company, is much larger and more diverse than Lyft, whose core focus remains ride-hailing.
(Uber and Lyft, side-by-side: https://tmsnrt.rs/2VAzDBQ)
Lyft will pitch investors on the simplicity of its business, while Uber is expected to play up its more diversified strategy, according to people familiar with the matter. 
After Lyft's IPO, Green, the CEO, and Zimmer, the firm's president, will collectively have just shy of 50 percent of the company's voting rights. Their stakes would be worth $569.4 million and $392.7 million respectively, if the IPO prices at the top its target range. 
Their firm grip on the company has been criticized by some investors focused on corporate governance. 
""Lyft's dual-class share structure leaves investors virtually powerless. This is highly risky for long-horizon investors and for the integrity of the capital markets,"" Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, said in a statement earlier this month.
Lyft has nearly 40 percent of the U.S. ride-sharing market, but has warned that further growth could come at the expense of more losses for a company already deep in the red.
Lyft's revenue was $2.16 billion for 2018, double the previous year's and far higher than $343 million in 2016. It posted a loss of $911 million in 2018 versus $688 million in 2017. 

J.P. Morgan,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Jefferies are among the lead bookrunners for the listing.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>",GM considers options for its Lyft stake following IPO,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - As Lyft Inc cruises toward an initial public offering this month, one of the big winners will be General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), whose stake in the ride-hailing firm could be worth as much as $1.27 billion. 
GM is not talking about its plans for that investment, and investors polled by Reuters, owning a collective 35.7 million shares, do not have a consensus view. 
Some believe the No. 1 U.S. automaker should hold on to it for strategic reasons, while others want the money returned to shareholders through buybacks or a special dividend.
""Unless GM can leverage its investment in Lyft to accelerate its own robo-taxi ambitions with Cruise, we believe it would be appropriate to cash out its stake to repurchase its own under-valued shares,"" said Michael Razewski, a partner with Douglas C. Lane & Associates, which owned about 2.6 million GM shares at the end of 2018. 
Cruise Automation is GM's self-driving car unit.
Lyft on Monday launched the investor ""roadshow"" for the March 29 IPO, and it said it to sell Class A shares at $62 to $68 a share.
GM owns more than 18.6 million Class A shares, according to the Lyft filing, meaning its investment at the outset could be worth $1.16 billion to $1.27 billion. GM invested $500 million in Lyft in January 2016.
With a 180-day lock-up period during which GM cannot sell and the expected April IPO of larger rival Uber Technologies Inc further stoking interest in the ride-hailing sector, the value could subsequently rise.
GM spokesman Tom Henderson said the automaker is happy with its Lyft stake, but declined to discuss future plans for the shares. Lyft spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna had no comment.
Several shareholders would like to see GM sell the stake and use the proceeds to repurchase shares or pay a special dividend.
""If I want to buy Lyft, I'll go do it myself,"" said Scott Schermerhorn, managing principal with Granite Investment Advisors, which owns more than 210,000 GM shares. ""Take the proceeds and invest it in something that's core to their business or give it back to shareholders.""
However, Jacques Elmaleh, portfolio manager with Steinberg Global Asset Management, with almost 24,000 GM shares at the end of 2018, said it is too early to write off the relationship.
""I'd be inclined that they hold onto it and see how it plays out,"" he said.
Some of GM's larger investors - the United Auto Workers retiree healthcare benefits trust, hedge fund manager David Einhorn and T. Rowe Price Group Inc - declined to comment. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc did not respond to a request for comment.
GM's former president, Dan Ammann, joined Lyft's board as the companies eyed developing networks of self-driving cars together. However, there have been few signs of cooperation. Ammann - who now leads Cruise - left the Lyft board in June 2018.
Analysts have speculated GM will eventually sell shares in Cruise or spin it off, and the incentive plan disclosed last month for Ammann pointed toward a possible IPO.
Kyle Martin, analyst with Westwood Holdings, which owns more than 30,000 GM shares, would just as soon see GM sell the Lyft stake and use that money in Cruise.

""That's a meaningful amount of money that could certainly help them close the gap with Waymo and put them even further ahead of Ford,"" he said, referring to technology leader Alphabet's Waymo and GM rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell more than 3% as Needham downgraded the social media giant from a buy to a hold rating amid worries the financial impact of the pivot towards privacy and encrypted messages, as well as growing regulation risks, may hamper the company's ability to monetize its data. The stock has been enjoying a 22% rebound this year from the hammering it took in 2018, but it is still trading some 27% below its 52-week high.
Bank of America echoed Needham's bearish view on Facebook, cutting its price target on the stock to $187 from $205 on worries that a move toward ""a more privacy-centric platform could raise questions on three-year growth.""
The apparent pivot toward privacy comes as the company has faced backlash over numerous privacy scandals, prompting top-level executives to leave.
Two top executives including Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, one of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's top deputies, will leave the social media network, according to reports last week. The social media firm is also set to lose WhatsApp Vice President Chris Daniels.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, held a 0.9% gain after launching a new 10.5-inch iPad Air and an iPad mini with Pencil support. Both iPads come in 64GB and 256GB variations and are expected to hit stores next week.
The release of new iPads comes just a week ahead of the tech giant's event on March 25, when it is expected to launch a television and video service in a bid to bolster its services revenue and reduce its reliance on iPhones, which generate about 60% of total revenue.
""We raise our 12-month target price to $210 from $195 on a price over earnings of 16.1 times our 2020 view, above AAPL's ten-year historical forward average of 15.2x, warranted, we think, to reflect AAPL's ongoing shift to services,"" CFRA said in a note.

931,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",France tells banks to boost capital buffer,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's financial stability council ordered banks on Monday to hold extra capital in case a current lending boom turns to bust in the future.
The council, which includes the finance minister and the central bank governor, gave banks operating in France a year to build up a counter-cyclical capital buffer equal to 0.5 percent of their risk-weighted assets in France.
A source close to the council said that French banks were not expected to need to raise extra capital on the markets to meet the new requirement. 
The council already imposed a counter-cyclical buffer for the first time last June, setting a rate of 0.25 percent in the face of strong credit growth.
But loan demand has shown no sign of slowing since then as French companies have continued to binge on cheap debt, with growth in bank lending to non-financial companies running at six percent over one year in January, according to the central bank.
That is among the fastest rates of loan growth in the euro zone, and far faster than economic growth, which the central bank forecasts at 1.4 percent this year.
As a result, corporate debt has steadily climbed to 74 percent of gross domestic product while strong mortgage borrowing has pushed household debt to 59 percent of GDP.
While banks generally frown on being required to hold extra capital, the buffer is aimed at ensuring they can keep lending if the credit cycle takes a turn for the worse.
In a downturn, the council can allow banks to release the extra capital so that they can keep lending when the economy needs it most.

935,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 12:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sanofi says working on CEO succession plan,"By Matthias Blamont
PARIS (Reuters) - Pharmaceuticals group Sanofi (PA:SASY) is working on a plan to find a new CEO in agreement and consultation with current chief executive Olivier Brandicourt, a spokesman for the French drugmaker told Reuters on Monday.
Sanofi has an age limit of 65 for its CEO. Brandicourt will be 65 in February 2021.
""It is the responsibility of any company's board of directors to consider and plan for the succession of its CEO and executive committee members by identifying the next set of future leaders,"" a spokesman told Reuters.
""With this perspective, the board has been considering this succession plan for some time now, in agreement and consultation with our CEO,"" he said, without elaborating on a specific time frame.
Sources told Reuters talks over the future of the group's management had intensified in recent weeks.
Sanofi is to hold an annual meeting next month during which shareholders will be asked to vote to renew the mandate of the board's chairman, Serge Weinberg. 
Brandicourt was hired in 2015 to help revive the fortunes of France's biggest drugmaker and has been actively reshaping the business. He was previously the head of Bayer's healthcare arm.
Under his management, the company swapped its animal health unit to Boehringer Ingelheim in exchange for the German firm’s consumer healthcare operations in a $20 billion deal. It has also sold its European generics arm for 1.9 billion euros ($2.15 billion) to private equity firm Advent International.
New launches such as eczema treatment Dupixent, cost cutting and new priorities setting in research and development have also enabled Sanofi to return to profits in the second half of last year after a series of disappointing quarters due to falling diabetes sales.
Brandicourt's teams failed to land two strategic acquisitions, loosing out on buying California-based cancer specialist Medivation to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) in 2016, and failing to snatch up Swiss biotech company Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in 2017.
But the company regained momentum last year with the purchase of Belgian biotech company Ablynx for 3.9 billion euros. That followed the acquisition of U.S. group Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years.
Brandicourt hopes the two transactions will help Sanofi build a strong franchise in rare blood disorders.
Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Ablynx's most promising asset, the experimental drug caplacizumab for treating the blood disease Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.

Sanofi has made rare diseases a top priority since it bought Massachusetts biotech firm Genzyme in 2011.

BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) faced concerns from workers unions, Chancellor Angela Merkel's office and top shareholders on Monday after confirming merger talks.
Combining Germany's two largest banks could result in 30,000 job losses, a union warned, prompting Merkel's chief of staff to say the government was scrutinizing the issue.
The concerns underline the obstacles to combining the banks, which confirmed talks about a tie-up on Sunday following months of pressure from Berlin, which has pushed for a deal amid concerns about the health of Deutsche Bank, which has struggled to sustain profits since the 2008 financial crisis.
Chancellery Chief Helge Braun told Bild newspaper that it would be ""difficult"" if thousands of jobs would be cut, warning that the government was ""never passive when it comes to deals of such magnitude"".
Together the two banks employ 140,000 people worldwide, 91,700 at Deutsche and 49,000 at Commerzbank and a merged bank would have one fifth of the German retail banking market. 
Despite the worries about jobs, the market reaction to news that the two banks were engaged in talks, which ended months of speculation, was positive. Shares in Deutsche Bank were up 5.0 percent at 1216 GMT while Commerzbank traded 6.7 percent higher.
The supervisory boards of both banks are due meet on Thursday, with the merger likely to top the agenda.
However, two top shareholders in Deutsche Bank expressed their disapproval, with one questioning not only the logic but also the timing of a deal. 
""There is no obvious reason why these two banks should be merged,"" a person close to another shareholder said.
And while international credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's, which downgraded Deutsche Bank last year, said a well executed merger could reap efficiencies, it warned a deal would ""entail significant uncertainties and risks"".
In addition to regulatory and antitrust risks, an effort to merge would mean ""several more years of significant internal restructuring,"" while competitors move forward.
The banks have ""patchy track records in executing strategic programs,"" S&P said.
JOBS HURDLE
Berlin, which holds a stake of more than 15 percent in Commerzbank following a bailout, wants a national banking champion to support its export-led economy, best known for cars and machine tools.
However, the jobs impact could be a major hurdle. 
A merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank could result in as many as 30,000 job cuts over the long term, a representative of German union Verdi, who is a supervisory board member at Deutsche Bank, told n-tv broadcaster.
Most of the 30,000 positions at risk are based in Germany, with 10,00 at threat in the short term, Verdi's Jan Duscheck said in comments published by the TV station.

""A possible merger would not result in a business model that is sustainable in the long term,"" Duscheck said.

940,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 09:59AM ET</span>","Apple unveils new iPad, updates Mini ahead of video streaming launch","By Sonam Rai
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), in a surprise move on Monday, launched a new 10.5-inch iPad Air and updated its iPad Mini ahead of a March 25 event where it is expected to launch a television and video service.
So far in its annual March event, Apple has been making announcements related upgrades for its product lines, but this year the focus is likely to shift to services, especially after it reported its first ever drop in iPhone sales in January. 
The new iPad models, geared with Apple's latest A12 Bionic chip and support for Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, are already available for order at apple.com and in the Apple Store app in the United States and the United Kingdom, along with a few other countries.
""That it announced the new lineup in advance of next week's event suggests it wants to focus on the content next week over hardware,"" DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte said. 
""Refreshing its lower-end lineup in advance of its streaming video content announcement next week speaks to the potential for Apple in streaming video content, with a strong installed hardware base, iPhones, iPads and Macs.""
The 10.5-inch iPad Air, starts at $499 for the 64GB WiFi model and $629 for the WiFi plus cellular model. The new iPad mini starts at $399 for the WiFi model and $529 for the WiFi plus cellular model, the iPhone maker said in a statement.
With the new launch, the iPad will come in four different screen sizes, ranging from 7.9 inch to 12.9 inch.
""More iPad sales won't make a big impact on the company's enormous bottom line, but it can help to show consumers and investors that Apple still has the ability to create popular devices and features,"" said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at Investing.com.
In the year ended September 2018, Apple made about $19 billion in revenue from iPad sales, a very small portion compared with the nearly $167 billion it generated from the sale of iPhones. 
Shares of Apple rose 0.63 percent at $187.22 on early Monday trading.

In a letter, Goyal said he is ""committed to have the process completed as soon as possible and restore much needed stability"" to the airline's operations, and that he would make it a top priority to settle delayed salary payments for pilots and some other staff once a deal is finalised.
He also said that talks for the rescue deal with the airline's biggest shareholder, Etihad Airways, and lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), are ongoing. 

Saddled with debt of more than one billion dollars, Jet is struggling to stay afloat. It has delayed payments to banks, suppliers, pilots and lessors - some of whom have forced the airline to ground as many as 40 planes.

The Dow fell 26 points or 0.10% as of 9:43 AM ET (13:43 GMT). Boeing slumped 2.6% on news that data from the Ethiopian Air jet that crashed earlier this month suggests similarities with an earlier crash off Indonesia. The news was compounded by reports of federal prosecutors and the Department of Transportation looking into the development of the 737 MAX, the plane involved in both crashes.
Boeing is a heavy-component of the Dow, meaning strong movements in the airline maker’s stock impact the index.
Meanwhile the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were muted after their strongest weekly rise this year.The S&P 500 gained 6 points or 0.23% and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was up 19 points or 0.25%.

A Wall Street Journal report on Sunday said the U.S. Transportation Department was probing the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) approval of the 737 MAX and in particular its anti-stall (MCAS) system.
The Seattle Times separately reported that Boeing's safety analysis of a new control system known as MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) had crucial flaws, including understating power.
The paper also said U.S. FAA followed a standard certification process on the MAX rather than extra inquiries.
""Boeing (will face) a lot more scrutiny of its processes than it has seen previously,"" Richard  Safran  (PA:SAF) of Buckingham Research said.
""The Inspector General of the U.S. Transportation Department is going to be looking for any issues with respect to how management handled the certification process.""
Shares of the company have declined about 10 percent since the March 10 Ethiopian crash that killed 157 people, wiping nearly $25 billion off its market capitalization, according to Refinitiv data.
Ethiopia said on Sunday that the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines plane had ""clear similarities"" with October's Lion Air crash.
The U.S. Transportation Department's inquiry, which was launched in the wake of the accident in October that killed 189 people, has warned two FAA offices to safeguard computer files, the WSJ reported.
""The FAA will be called on the carpet for its role in the certification process and any contribution to the MCAS issue,"" Safran said.
Last Monday, Boeing said it would deploy a software upgrade to the 737 MAX 8, hours after the FAA said it would mandate ""design changes"" in the aircraft by April.

Boeing's shares were down 2.8 percent at $369.20 in early trading, making them the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

945,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 09:33AM ET</span>",Tesla's stock doesn't trade like it used to,"Over the last year or so, Craig Irwin has taken notice of something happening incrementally with  Tesla shares: they don't trade like they used to.
""We note a fundamental shift in the behavior of Tesla's stock,"" Irwin, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners, a Newport Beach, California-based investment-banking firm, wrote in a note to investors on Friday.
Irwin's comments came following  Tesla's Model Y reveal at the company's design studio in Hawthorne, California, on Thursday evening. 
""For the past several years Tesla's stock has behaved like an emerging growth company, where mgmt can invent their own milestones, meet these, and the stock would behave positively,"" Irwin wrote.
""Investors have now appropriately shifted focus to unit volumes, margins, and a practical assessment of the addressable market, in our view.""
In other words, shares of the electric-car maker — known for trading in a  volatile fashion over the last few years — appear to be moving more on fundamentals rather than the hope Tesla could meet its own ambitious, pioneering goals.
The shift Irwin has noticed in how the stock reacts to developments around the company has been more pronounced since the Model 3 production ramp-up in 2018, he told Markets Insider.
Read more: Elon Musk just unveiled Tesla's newest car, the Model Y SUV
More broadly, Irwin thinks there is ""clearly a large market"" for the Model 3, and likely one for the Model Y. But he said the announcement seemed to fall short of more aggressive expectations, and vehicle prices seemed to be ""too high.""
The cheapest version of the Model Y  is set to arrive in 2021, at a starting price of $39,000. Three more expensive versions of the vehicle will start at between $47,000 and $60,000, and are scheduled to begin shipping in 2020.
This week's unveiling of the Model Y comes at a chaotic time for the company. The automaker is facing what analysts say is a  demand problem, and  CEO Elon Musk is battling with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

On a recent conference call with reporters, Musk said Tesla was  unlikely to turn a profit in the first-quarter, a  reversal from his previous expectation.
Tesla shares were under pressure on Friday, losing 5% after  the Model Y launch event underwhelmed Wall Street analysts. That selling sent shares to a one-week low of $274.40. They have now fallen 29% from their August peak — reached on the day of CEO Elon Musk's infamous ""funding secured"" tweet.
Irwin has a ""neutral"" rating and a 12-month price target of $270 — about 2% below where shares were trading on Friday.

946,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",Lyft is seeking a valuation of up to $23 billion as it embarks on its IPO road show," Lyft says it will launch the investor road show for its initial public offering on Monday, seeking a valuation of up to $23 billion.
Shares are expected to price between $62 and $68 when they hit the Nasdaq exchange, valuing Lyft between $21 billion and $23 billion, the ride-hailing company said Monday in a press release. Lyft's trading symbol will be LYFT.
Reports that emerged before Lyft issued  an updated filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicated it would be seeking to persuade investors to make large commitments to its IPO rather than hold out for its larger rival  Uber, which is planning to launch its own public offering next month.
The company will be pitching itself to investors as a more focused bet on ride hailing to differentiate itself from Uber, which has diversified to areas such as food delivery and freight hauling and expanded around the world,  The Wall Street Journal reported.
Lyft has also branded itself in recent years as a more driver-friendly alternative to Uber. In its first S-1 filing earlier in March, the company said it  got a big boost from the ""Delete Uber"" campaign, which surged across social media amid Uber's struggles under its founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick.
That reputation has come under fire lately, however, as the company  fights new minimum-wage rules in New York City — the US's largest and most lucrative ride-hailing market. Lyft told a judge that the rules unfairly benefited Uber and that demand had dropped as prices increased to cover the higher payments.
Uber is seeking a valuation as high as $120 billion at its IPO, though some analysts have pegged it closer to $100 billion based on selected financial figures it has disclosed. Neither Uber nor Lyft is profitable.
Lyft's IPO will provide a funding boost as it continues to subsidize rides with promotions to attract passengers. The windfall from the IPO will also help finance investments in areas such as autonomous driving, according to sources.
After a quiet start to the year, technology companies are lining up for public listings as public equity markets hover near historic highs but remain vulnerable to geopolitical concerns, including tensions over trade agreements and a slowdown in economies such as in Europe and China.
Other Silicon Valley unicorns — startup companies with valuations of at least $1 billion — including the business-messaging company Slack and the image-sharing company Pinterest, are waiting in the wings to go public later in 2019, sources have said.
Lyft's IPO will mark the first time a ride-hailing company has debuted on the US public markets. Lyft launched in 2012 and is led by its founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer.
The ride-hailing industry, which touted $36.5 billion in sales globally in 2017, is expected to grow rapidly but is fraught with questions about the future of automated driving, regulatory pushback, and legal challenges over drivers' pay and benefits.
Lyft is expected to emphasize to investors its rapid growth in the United States and its relatively uncomplicated business model, which focuses on selling rides in cars, bikes, and scooters.
In its IPO filing, Lyft said its US market share had risen to 39%, from 35% early in 2018, gaining some ground on long-dominant Uber. Unlike Uber, Lyft operates only in North America.
Lyft's revenue was $2.16 billion for 2018, double that of the previous year and up 528% from $343 million in 2016. But Lyft posted a loss of $911 million for 2018, which climbed from $688 million in 2017 and $682 million in 2016, according to its IPO filing.
Losses could continue to mount, Lyft cautioned, as it continues to invest and eye a broader international expansion, and it could be forced to increase driver pay.
Uber's revenue last year was $11.3 billion, while its gross bookings from rides were $50 billion. But the company lost $3.3 billion, excluding gains from the sale of its overseas business units in Russia and Southeast Asia.
SoftBank's Vision Fund and Toyota Motor Corp. are part of a consortium of investors in talks to invest $1 billion in Uber's self-driving-car unit, Reuters reported Wednesday. Taking on large investors who will influence a key business is an unusual move for a company so close to an IPO."

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's listed companies could see holdings by foreign investors rise to 10 percent when their shares are included in index providers MSCI and FTSE's emerging-market indices, the chief executive of Tadawul told Reuters on Monday.
Tadawul is the Middle East's largest exchange and Saudi Arabia's main exchange. It has a total market capitalization of around $541.3 billion, with a free float of about 40 percent.
Saudi shares on Monday joined the FTSE Emerging All Cap Index with a weighting of 2.9 percent. In May, Saudi shares will join the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
Khalid al-Hussan said he expected equities on Tadawul to attract $5 billion of passive fund inflows after the FTSE Russell inclusion. Foreign investors currently hold 5.9 percent of Saudi shares.
Active foreign investors in the market have been increasing since the beginning of the year, and the number of qualified foreign investors registering to trade on the Saudi exchange is increasing everyday.
Hussan said he estimates the Saudi exchange to see ""around $5 billion of passive inflows coming from FTSE and around $10-11 from MSCI and some inflows from S&P.""
Foreigners have been net buyers of Saudi stocks since the start of the year, plowing more than $2.1 billion year-to-date into the Saudi market. The Saudi index is up nearly 9.6 percent, outperforming its Gulf peers.
""You have to applaud the Saudis for what they’ve done over the past year in relation to opening up the market, said Fadi Al Said, managing director and head of the MENA investment team at Lazard Asset in Dubai.
""I think the opening up the market, the QFI process, has gone through an evolution of simplifying the process,"" Al Said said.
Index provider MSCI incorporated shares of United Arab Emirates and Qatar companies into its emerging market index in 2014.
Foreigners excluding strategic investors own less than 2 percent of Saudi stocks, analysts have said. Currently, foreign ownership of listed stocks is capped at 49 percent.
Hussan said it was too early to discuss raising the cap, given current ownership levels and size of the market.
""We would love that challenge to happen in the market and it will show that our market is very attractive, but until then I don’t see that the 49 percent is an obstacle to international investments, taking into the account the size of the Saudi market.""
The Saudi main equities index closed up 1 percent on Monday.
Tadawul is expected to introduce index futures this year, pending the feedback it receives from investors to the rules and regulations of trading derivatives, which will be offered for public consultation over next two weeks, he said.

949,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",Foreigners Splurge on Saudi Shares as FTSE Begins Upgrade,"(Bloomberg) -- Foreign investors increased purchases of Saudi equities last week to the highest value on record as they positioned for the kingdom’s inclusion in major benchmarks.
Foreigners were net buyers of about 1.6 billion riyals ($427 million) of stocks in the five days through March 14, more than any other week since the data were first disclosed in 2015. The inflows picked up as FTSE Russell begins to include the country in its emerging-market category on Monday, attracting fund managers that follow the indexes passively.
Qualified foreign institutional investors, who were first allowed to directly access the Saudi bourse in 2015, were the leading category of purchasers. They’ve been net buyers almost every week this year, reversing a trend that started in October when they sold heavily amid increased volatility following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Saudi Arabia’s full inclusion in FTSE’s emerging-market category will be phased in over five tranches and completed by March 2020, while an upgrade by index compiler MSCI Inc. will happen in two stages later this year. The Tadawul All Share Index rose 1.1 percent on Monday, the most in almost six weeks, to end at the highest level since August 2015.
The bourse will eventually receive $5 billion from passive investors once the kingdom is fully included in FTSE’s benchmarks by March 2020, Tadawul Chief Executive Officer Khalid Al Hussan said in an interview in Riyadh on Monday. He expects additional passive inflows of as much as $11 billion from MSCI’s addition later this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares hit their highest levels in five months and the dollar dipped on Monday, as traders began to price in the likelihood of the U.S. Federal Reserve sticking to an accommodative stance at its policy meeting this week.
European markets extended a run of gains, helped by a jump in shares in German lenders  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) after they confirmed over the weekend that they were in talks to merge.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.1 percent by midday in London, also hitting a five-month high. (EU)
Britain's FTSE 100 outperformed its European peers with a nearly 0.7 percent gain at the start of a week that could see parliament voting for a third time on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan after ruling out a near-term no-deal exit.
MSCI's All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent on the day. The index set a five-month high, hitting its highest since Oct. 10.
With signs of global economic growth slowing, traders were focused on the Federal Reserve, which meets on Wednesday for clues about the likely path of U.S. interest rates.
In particular, traders will be focusing on whether policymakers have sufficiently lowered their rate forecasts to more closely align their ""dot plot"", a diagram showing individual policymakers' rate views for the next three years.
Also expected is more detail on a plan to stop cutting the Fed's holdings of nearly $3.8 trillion in bonds. The two-day meeting ends with a news conference on Wednesday.
Yields on three- and five-year Treasuries are dead in line with the effective Fed funds rate, while futures imply a better-than-even chance of a rate cut by year end.
The dollar index was lower 0.2 percent at 96.397, after having shed 0.7 percent last week.
""The market will be scrutinizing the extent to which the Fed scales back its interest rate forecasts,"" said Rupert Thompson, head of research at UK asset manager Kingswood. 
""The Fed is very likely to remain on pause for a good few months yet. But what is less clear is whether the market is right to assume that not only will there be no further hike at all but rates will actually be cut next year."" 
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 were higher by 0.1 percent, indicating a positive open on Wall Street later in the day. (N)
Data on Friday showed U.S. manufacturing output fell for a second straight month in February and factory activity in New York state hit nearly a two-year low this month, further evidence of a sharp slowdown in economic growth early in the first quarter.
A marked decline in Treasury yields has dragged on the dollar, leaving it at 111.53 yen from a top of 111.89 on Friday.
The euro was 0.3 percent higher at $1.1357, well up from the recent trough of $1.1174 which was hit when the European Central Bank took a dovish turn of its own.
The pound was down 0.25 percent at $1.3264 as lawmakers cast doubt on Prime Minister May's third attempt to get parliament to back her Brexit deal. 
May has only three days to win approval for her deal to leave the European Union if she wants to go to a summit with the bloc's leaders on Thursday with something to offer them in return for more time.
""The main event this week is Brexit, and signs are converging that something has to happen either way. The headlines suggest people are coming on board and it sounds like the DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) is probably going to back it,"" said David Slater, portfolio manager at Trium Capital. 
""The vote is only going to happen if Theresa May has a realistic chance of passing. However it pans out, (an agreement) will be sterling-euro and FTSE bullish.""
Slater added that if May's deal passes, he could see pound-euro above the 1.25 mark and the FTSE up 5 percent in a month after a good Brexit outcome.
In bonds, no news proved the most important news in euro zone bonds on Monday after ratings agency Moody's decided not to downgrade Italy's credit rating, prompting investors to buy Italian government bonds. 
Italy's 10-year government bond yield fell as much as four basis points on the day to 2.46 percent, its lowest since May 2018. Its spread over higher-rated Germany briefly narrowed to its tightest since September 2018.
In commodity markets, spot gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,304.35 per ounce.

Oil slipped to around $67 a barrel, weighed by concern that an economic downturn may dent fuel consumption, despite the prospect of prolonged OPEC-led oil supply curbs.

TOLEDO, Ohio (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) built the final Chevrolet Cruze small car at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant on March 6, despite demands from President Donald Trump, Ohio political leaders and the United Auto Workers union not to close the plant and leave nearly 1,500 workers laid off. 
Dina Mays, a 14-year veteran of Lordstown Assembly, was not at the plant for its last day. She had already moved on to her new workplace, GM's Toledo transmission plant, where the automaker builds 10-speed transmissions for popular pickup trucks.
The U.S. auto industry is heading into a new cycle of plant closings and job cuts. Sales in the world's second-largest vehicle market are projected to fall. Consumers shifting away from traditional sedans such as the Cruze have left GM with more workers assigned to building cars than the market can support. 
But GM has the reverse problem with trucks - for now, it cannot build them fast enough. That is helping GM find new jobs for displaced sedan plant workers, and blunt attacks from the UAW and politicians. 
The automaker recently announced it will add 1,000 jobs at a plant in Flint, Michigan, to build a new generation of GM's largest pickups. 
A GM spokeswoman said last week that 538 workers from a Detroit plant slated to close in 2020 and nearly 100 from Lordstown have already signed on in Flint to fill those jobs. 
That and other job opportunities could cushion the blow for most of the 1,450 workers currently laid off at Lordstown. The Ohio plant is one of five North American GM plants slated to close by January 2020.
GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra has said the automaker expects to have 2,700 job openings by early 2020 at other thriving plants, enough to absorb nearly all of those displaced in plants in Maryland, Ohio and Michigan willing or able to uproot for work hundreds of miles away. GM said another 1,200 affected hourly workers are eligible for early retirement.
Based on a plant-by-plant count provided by GM, if every worker displaced or soon to be displaced volunteers for or accepts a new job - and those eligible to retire do so - that would potentially leave up to 500 GM workers jobless, far fewer than the thousands decried by the UAW and Trump. 
Ohio is a key state for Trump's 2020 re-election chances. In July 2017 he vowed in Youngstown, Ohio, near GM's Lordstown plant, that those auto jobs were ""all coming back."" 
""Don't move,"" he told residents. ""Don't sell your house.""
On Sunday, Trump tweeted that he had spoken with Barra to demand she ""do something quickly"" to keep the Lordstown plant running. GM responded, ""Our main focus remains on our employees and offering them jobs in our plants where we have growth opportunities. We have opportunities available for virtually all impacted employees."" The company said the ultimate fate of the plant will be decided in contract negotiations with the UAW this fall.
NOMADIC LIFESTYLE
Mays and other veteran GM factory workers have been pushed into nomadic lives before. Mays is on her third GM factory in 15 years. In 2005, she moved to Lordstown in northeastern Ohio after being laid off at a GM plant in Baltimore, Maryland. 
""I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It's rough,"" Mays said. 
Her eldest son is at college and a 12-year-old son remains with relatives near Lordstown. ""But I have to be able to support myself and my kids."" 
After 25 years with GM, she has five years until retirement, so transferring ""was the best decision I could make."" 
For those who move, GM offers a $30,000 cash package to offset costs. If the company has jobs for laid-off workers elsewhere and they refuse them, they lose their supplemental pay and are eligible to hire on again only at their ""home plant"" - in this case, Lordstown. 
SCANT OPTIONS
For Joe Stanton, 55, transferring 160 miles (260 km) to Toledo from Lordstown made sense. 
With 25 years at GM, he also has five years to go before he can retire. He rents an apartment with Mays just outside Toledo to cut costs. He moved from Pittsburgh to Lordstown in 2006 when his GM plant there closed. He owns two homes, one near Lordstown and one in Pennsylvania. 
Stanton misses his adult son in Pittsburgh and girlfriend near Lordstown but said he is lucky not to have small children or sick parents to care for so he could move to Toledo. 
If the UAW renegotiates a new product for Lordstown, retooling the plant would take years, Stanton said. 
""That's a gamble I wasn't willing to take,"" he said. 
For those left behind, the outlook is bleak.
Tod Porter, chair of Youngstown State University's economics department, estimated Lordstown's closure could cost more than 8,000 jobs including at auto suppliers and service providers, in an area still affected by steel mill closures decades ago.
Dave Green, president of UAW Local 1112, which represents workers at Lordstown, said he is fighting for the plant to reopen but added unemployed GM workers have scant options.

""If you don't want a job flipping burgers for minimum wage, you got to get the hell out of here,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Responding to calls for more bank services for low-income consumers, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Monday began offering checkless accounts with access to its mobile app, branches and ATMs for $4.95 a month and no minimum balance.
The accounts come with debit cards, digital payments and free check cashing, but do not allow overdrafts.
Fees for overdrafts generated significant revenue for banks in the past. They have angered customers, brought down the wrath of politicians and discouraged people with low incomes from using banks.
Thasunda Duckett, chief executive of Chase Consumer Banking, said she hoped the new accounts will attract more low-income individuals and people who have never had bank accounts.
""The very first step in building financial health really starts with a bank account,"" Duckett said.
The annual cost of $60 for the new accounts compares with charges of $200 to $500 a year at check cashing and money order services, she said.
Some 6.5 percent of U.S. households had no one with a bank account in 2017, according to a study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
Regulators have been pushing banks to do more to attract low-income customers. ""Financial inclusion"" has become a rallying cry for groups trying to help people out of poverty.
JPMorgan's move comes after competitors Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) introduced similar accounts.
The new accounts mark an expansion of low-cost services because JPMorgan has 16,000 ATMs and 5,000 U.S. branches, second only to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.
Since 2012, JPMorgan has offered a prepaid debit card with many banking services for $4.95 a month. But customers said that card, called Liquid, came up short. It could not be used for Uber taxi rides and car rentals, for example.
The new account, called Secure, offers those features.
Financial technology startups, such as Chime and SoFi, offer accounts with large networks of ATMs and without monthly fees. Chase's fee, Duckett said, provides ATMs that accept checks and bankers to question in person.
The accounts will make ""some money,"" she said, but be less profitable than the bank's other businesses. 
Before the financial crisis, banks widely offered free checking, making money on overdrafts and merchant fees on debit cards. Post-crisis reforms slashed those fees and free accounts were cut back. 

Now that banks have built digital tools for better-off customers, the services can be extended to people with lower incomes.

Marriott, which owns the Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis luxury hotel brands, said it would add between 275,000 and 295,000 rooms over three years, potentially adding $400 million in fee revenue in 2021 and $700 million annually when stabilized.
The company also forecast a profit of $7.65 to $8.50 per share by 2021, the mid point of which was above $7.72 estimated by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
During the three-year period, the company plans to pay $1.9 billion to $2 billion in dividends and buy back $7.6 billion to $9 billion in shares, Marriott said.
The company, which plans to hold an investor conference on Monday, expects comparable hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth - a key measure of hotel health - between 1 and 3 percent on an annual basis for the three-year period.
Last month, Marriott missed Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and forecast a lower-than-expected full-year profit, blaming weak demand in North America, its largest market.

The company was hit by a massive data breach involving up to 383 million guests in its Starwood hotels reservation system and Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson earlier this month apologized before a U.S. Senate panel and vowed to protect against future attacks.

956,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>","U.S. heavy equipment makers feeling pain from tariffs, disputes: report","By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - U.S. makers of bulldozers and other heavy equipment are raising prices, losing sales and in some cases beginning to trim workers in response to the Trump administration's protracted trade disputes with various countries, according to a new report.
Advocates of tariffs point to continued job growth and low overall inflation as proof that tariffs are not harming these manufacturers, which include global producers such as  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Alamo Group Inc and Terex Corp.
But an economic analysis conducted on behalf the Association of Equipment Manufacturers and set to be released on Monday by IHS Markit, notes that increased costs and the disruption of supply chains will slowly filter through the overall economy, gradually raising prices for finished goods and curbing employment over the next decade.
Scott Hazelton, a co-author of the report, said tariffs will increase the cost of producing off-road equipment in the U.S. between 6 percent to 7 percent over the period. 
Caterpillar, a key component of the Dow, has said tariffs cost the company $100 million last year.
The study notes heavy equipment makers are particularly exposed to higher steel prices. Accounting for all steel used - both directly by these manufacturers and the parts they buy from others - the material represents 18.5 percent of the cost of a farm machine and 25.8 percent for mining machines.
""If you’re a domestic producer, you’re caught between eating a cost increase or raising prices and potentially losing business,” Hazelton said.
Gradall Industries Inc is among those getting hit at both ends of their business. The company, a subsidiary of Alamo Group Inc, has seen the price of massive metal castings it imports from China go up by 25 percent due to tariffs, for instance, on top of higher domestic steel prices. 
Mike Haberman, president of Gradall, said they raised prices twice last year in response to higher-cost imports and steel.
Meanwhile, ""our exports to China are down 30 to 40 percent,"" said Haberman, due to retaliatory tariffs China slapped on imports of Gradall’s machines and the economic slowdown in that country.
The Section 232 tariffs imposed by Washington hit most foreign suppliers of metals, which have prompted retaliatory duties from many of those countries.
Haberman said he has not shed workers yet, but stopped hiring last year.
Other companies, however, are beginning to eye job cuts. 
John Garrison, chief executive of Terex, said he plans to start reducing headcount in one of his business lines this year, but declined to specify which sector or the number of jobs that might be cut. 
The company has three segments - aerial work platforms, cranes and material processing machines.

""I can't say that it's all due to tariffs, but the economic uncertainty caused by the trade situation isn’t helping,” Garrison said.

957,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>","NBCUniversal, Sky team up to expand global advertising product","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is pooling the advertising power of its NBCUniversal and British-based Sky units to better target viewers worldwide, it said on Monday, a major step by the top U.S. cable TV provider to transform itself into a global media leader.
The initiative would allow global advertisers to target specific households based on their interests, widely seen as the future of TV advertising. It comes ahead of an important ad sales period in May called the upfronts, when major U.S. networks including NBC will tout upcoming shows and advertising technology in hopes of selling commercial time in advance of the next television season.
The AdSmart service offers the strengths of NBCUniversal's artificial intelligence in media planning, and Sky's long experience in targeting ads to households based on their interests. Comcast paid $40 billion for Sky, a satellite TV, broadband and mobile operator, in September to fuel global growth and counter declines in U.S. cable TV subscribers.
The service would ultimately allow global advertisers to automatically place ads on the most relevant shows, and measure the results across NBCUniversal and Sky's TV and digital platforms as advertising becomes more global. ""The strategy is no longer country by country or market by market,"" said Jamie West, group director of advanced advertising for Sky, in an interview. ""It eases the friction of purchasing across NBCUniversal and Sky.""
Showing viewers ads that more closely match their interests improves the viewing experience, and is ultimately better for marketers, said Linda Yaccarino, chairman of advertising sales and client partnerships for NBCUniversal, in an interview. 
NBCUniversal, which includes CNBC and U.S. Spanish language network Telemundo, uses AI to scan scenes in a TV show to place an ad in the optimal spot, a strategy called contextual alignment. For example, if a TV show depicts a flooded home, the AI-powered system could insert an ad for a home insurance provider.

961,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Turn Bullish on Europe,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s economy hasn’t given investors much cheer over the past year, but some are saying there are positive surprises in store.
For Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), an emerging trend of euro-area numbers coming in above expectations suggests the slowdown may have bottomed out. That verdict is shared by analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), who point to Europe’s dependence on the Chinese economy, which is showing signs of turnaround.
“There are tentative signs that the worst of the weakness is behind us,” Goldman Sachs economists led by Jari Stehn, wrote in a note. “In contrast to the material downside surprises last year, more recent data have generally come in ahead of expectations.”
The improvement is showing up in Citigroup’s economic surprise gauge, which is at a five-month high. The next test will be on Friday, when the flash Purchasing Managers Index for March will be released.
For the Goldman economists, euro-area growth is set to pick up to an annualized pace of 1.4 percent in the second half of the year, having recently stabilized at around 1 percent. While indicators may not point to stronger momentum yet, a boost is likely to come from easier fiscal policy, lower oil prices and stronger wage growth.
Many of the idiosyncratic issues seen in 2018 are starting to fade, including problems in the German auto industry, according to Graham Secker, Morgan Stanley’s chief European equity strategist. French consumer confidence has also picked up after a dent related to the Yellow Vest protests, though a flare-up at the weekend suggests that situation remains fragile.
Then there’s the improvement in new export orders in China’s composite PMI, which tends to lead the euro-area measure, according to Secker. That could be a boon to investors -- after a trough in euro-area PMI, European equities on average see a 9 percent gain in the following six months, he said.
“We think that the gloom is overdone and Europe looks set to surprise on the upside,” Secker said. “A fair share of Europe’s slowdown last year was ‘made in China.’ The sharp drop in growth there weighed heavily on Europe, given its sensitivity to trade and exports.”

962,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 05:40AM ET</span>",Goldman Sees These U.S. Stocks Faring Better If Inflation Rises,"(Bloomberg) -- If the Federal Reserve is indeed able to boost inflation, stocks with high pricing power should benefit, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Fed officials have talked about the potential for adopting an average inflation targeting approach. If they did so and tried to let price pressures mount, the odds of near-term rate hikes will probably decrease. That’s assuming it even works, as economists and central bankers have been overestimating inflation potential for years.
Such an outcome would be favorable to U.S. equities because of the more-dovish rate scenario, but likely less favorable for their earnings, Goldman strategists led by Ben Snider wrote in a note Friday.
“With input cost pressures high and likely to keep rising, companies will need to be more aggressive in raising prices or accept lower profit margins,” the strategists said. “Stocks with low labor costs should also outperform as inflation expectations rise.”
Snap-on Inc., Weatherford International Plc and National Oilwell Varco Inc (NYSE:NOV). are among stocks with high pricing power that could fare well amid the Fed pivot, Goldman’s report said. Stocks that could fare worse include Alaska Air Group Inc., ICU Medical Inc. and GoDaddy Inc., the firm said.
“Since at least 1985, high pricing power stocks have typically outperformed when the market perceived an imminent decline in corporate profit margins,” the strategists wrote. “In addition to companies with the pricing power to pass through rising input costs, firms insulated from those cost pressures should also outperform.”"

Investing.com -- All aboard the good ship Moral Hazard!
Common sense may suggest that combining two weak banks doesn’t make a strong one (anyone remember Bankia?), but  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) are both up sharply this morning after the two finally confirmed the worst-kept secret in European banking at the weekend.
At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), Deutsche was up 3.2% while Commerzbank was up 3.4% at a new 2019 high. Germany’s Dax was up 0.1% while the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.92 points, or 0.2% at 382.02. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.6%.
Try not to think about the banks’ obvious lack of enthusiasm for a deal that would create the euro zone’s third-largest institution by assets: Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing’s message to his employees couldn’t have hedged his bets any harder if he’d tried, while Commerzbank restrained itself to a single sentence, that lacked any words such as ‘opportunity’ or ‘value creation’.
And never mind how hard it will be to lay off enough German bankers to realize the hoped-for cost efficiencies (union bosses estimate at least 20,000), or the extra layer of IT complexity to a bank (Deutsche) that was called by its last IT head the most ‘dysfunctional’ place she’d ever worked in.
And whatever you do, don’t worry that the single most influential shareholder in the merged bank could be the very government that has structured its own banking market for years in favor of state-owned and cooperative banks that have other priorities than profit.
Only two things matter today for markets: first, the two have finally admitted that neither bank can save itself by its own efforts, a conclusion that most analysts reached some time ago. Second, a Deutsche-Commerzbank merger creates, for all practical purposes, a bank that will never be allowed to fail. In the short term, that should depress funding costs and support Deutsche’s investment banking business, in particular.
Both stocks currently trade at around a quarter of their book value, so investors can be forgiven for thinking that the short-term downside risk is limited. Where it leads in the long run is a story for another day."

The banks issued short statements following separate meetings of their management boards, indicating a quickening of pace in the merger process, although both also warned that a deal was far from certain.
They topped the gainers on the pan-European STOXX 600 index, which gained 0.14 percent at 0823 GMT, surpassing a five-month closing high it hit on Friday on the back of hopes of a less chaotic Brexit and progress in U.S.-China trade talks.

At the committee's latest meeting held late last week, members were at a ""near consensus"" to recommend stronger roles for outside directors and establishing committees for board member nominations, auditing and determining executive pay, the person who has direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The person was speaking on condition of anonymity given that final recommendations have yet to be announced. A spokeswoman for the committee declined to comment on the discussions.
The two automakers are retooling their partnership to create a more equal footing and avoid the all-encompassing power wielded by ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn before his November arrest in Japan on financial misconduct charges.
Last week, Nissan (T:7201), Renault (PA:RENA) and junior partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) established a new joint board comprising separate executives of all three automakers to oversee operations and governance, dismantling the previous structure which in practice had placed control of the alliance with Ghosn. 
Executives at all three automakers said the new structure was not intended to replace or change their master agreement, which was drawn up in 2002 and gives biggest stakeholder Renault the right to appoint Nissan executives and directors.

The external committee tasked by Nissan to propose ways to bolster the firm's corporate governance said on Sunday it would announce its final recommendations on March 27.

""I'm not here to sell a business,"" Lionel Desclee told reporters in Tokyo in his first public remarks since his appointment on Friday. ""Absolutely not at all.""
Japanese media reported last year that Walmart considered selling Seiyu, and that a sale could amount to around 300 billion to 500 billion yen ($2.69 billion to $4.48 billion).
Desclee, who has worked for European food retailer Delhaize Group and was previously CEO of pet shop chain Tom & Co, said he was too new in the job to discuss strategy but was sure that a sale was not in the works.
He joked of ""sleepless nights"" as he read media reports of a possible sale just as he was considering the Tokyo job.
""Thanks to this article I did thoroughly discuss Walmart's intentions,"" he said, adding that officials in Bentonville, Arkansas, assured him that he was being hired to grow, rather than sell, the Japanese business.
Walmart first entered the Japanese market in 2002 by buying a 6 percent stake in Seiyu, and gradually built up its stake before a full takeover in 2008. 
Japan has proven a difficult market for many foreign entrants such as  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) PLC and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) SA. Consumers demand fresh food and high levels of customer service in a highly competitive industry where margins are razor thin after years of deflation.

Under Walmart, Seiyu has closed unprofitable stores. It also launched an online grocery venture with Rakuten Inc last year, although it meets tough competition from rivals which will include Amazon's Fresh service.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, in talks to buy low-cost carrier Hong Kong Express Airways, believes budget airlines have a ""unique market segment"" it does not capture at present, Chief Executive Rupert Hogg said on Monday.
Cathay this month said it was in ""active discussions"" to acquire the airline controlled by HNA Group Co Ltd.
That would boost revenue and give Cathay access to the growing low-cost travel market at a time when a lack of slots at Hong Kong International Airport has constrained its ability to follow peers like Singapore Airlines Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd and set up its own budget brand.
""It does interest us,"" Hogg told Reuters of the budget airline sector during an interview in Singapore. ""We watch Singapore Airlines and Scoot; we can see they are trying to get connectivity between them.""
He declined to comment on the status of talks to acquire Hong Kong Express but said the low prices offered by budget carriers helped to stimulate new travel demand, making it a ""unique market segment"".
The potential acquisition comes as Cathay faces a more challenging outlook for revenue growth, according to Hogg. 
Higher airfare and cargo rates pushed revenue up 14.2 percent in 2018, helping the airline last week report a swing to a $300 million profit after two years of loss as a turnaround plan helped it cut costs and increase income.
""We've had great revenue growth, both cargo and passenger,"" he said. ""As we look forward we can see the sort of gains in percentage growth terms that we've had, by definition it is more difficult to achieve that.""
The 18 analysts polled by Refinitiv I/B/E/S on average expect revenue at the airline to grow 3 percent to HK$114.3 billion ($14.56 billion) in 2019.
Hogg said the airline was investing in technology to better handle schedule disruptions and product improvements such as better meals to help drive passenger revenue growth, but the macro-economic environment was weaker than last year.
""There is a lot of uncertainty,"" he said. ""Uncertainty is definitely bad for corporate sentiment and investment and travel. And it is bad for consumer sentiment.""
Cargo volume is also weaker than at the same time last year, falling 5.2 percent in January due to a slower Lunar New Year rush than the prior year.

""I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING,"" Trump said.
Referring to his conversation with CEO Mary Barra, Trump added: ""I asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW union — I don’t care, I just want it open!"" he tweeted.
Trump also tweeted on Saturday to urge GM to reopen the plant, saying: ""Toyota is investing 13.5 $Billion in U.S., others likewise. G.M. MUST ACT QUICKLY. Time is of the essence!"" 
Earlier on Sunday, the United Auto Workers, which has filed suit challenging GM's decision to end Cruze production at Lordstown, thanked the president ""for fighting alongside the UAW against @GM. We will leave no stone unturned to keep the plants open!""
GM said in a statement that it and the UAW would decide what happens to the plant.
""We remain open to talking with all affected stakeholders, but our main focus remains on our employees and offering them jobs in our plants where we have growth opportunities,"" it said. ""We have opportunities available for virtually all impacted employees.""
The last Chevrolet Cruze rolled off the assembly line on March 6 at Lordstown, the first of five plants in North America to end production this year, and ending U.S. production of the Cruze.
The idling of the Lordstown plant is costing 1,500 jobs there. Since 2017, GM cut two of the three production shifts there, eliminating 3,000 jobs amid sagging demand for small cars. GM is continuing to produce the Cruze in Mexico for other markets, but not for the United States.
The company has noted that over 400 Lordstown employees had accepted offers at other GM locations and that jobs were available at other assembly plants for anyone willing to relocate to other states.
The 6.3-million-square foot Lordstown assembly complex has manufactured more than 16 million vehicles since it opened in 1966, including nearly 2 million Chevrolet Cruze cars since 2010.

The Transportation Department's inquiry was launched in the wake of October's Lion Air accident that killed 189 people and is being conducted by its inspector general, which has warned two FAA offices to safeguard computer files, the Journal said. 
Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Federal Aviation Administration declined to comment. Two government officials briefed on the matter said it would not be surprising for the Transportation Department’s inspector general to investigate a major safety issue but could not immediately confirm the report.
The inquiry focuses on the anti-stall system, the Journal reported, citing a government official briefed on its status. 
Aviation authorities are looking into whether the system may have played a role in the Lion Air accident as well as the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that killed all 157 people on board, the newspaper added.
The Transportation Department is seeking to determine whether the FAA used appropriate design standards and engineering analyses in certifying the aircraft's anti-stall system, known as MCAS, according to the report.

LONDON (Reuters) - British companies look set to cut investment by the most in 10 years in 2019 because of Brexit, even if Prime Minister Theresa May gets a deal to ease the country out of the bloc, an employers group said on Monday.
Business investment was forecast to fall by an annual 1.0 percent in 2019, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said.
Weak investment by companies drags on productivity which puts a brake on wage rises and weighs on the overall economy.
""Political inaction has already had economic consequences, with many firms hitting the brakes on investment and recruitment decisions,"" Adam Marshall, the BCC's director general, said.
""Worse still, some companies have moved investment and growth plans as part of their contingency preparations. Some of this investment may never come back to the UK.""
Many financial firms have set up operations in other EU countries and carmakers have reduced their expansion plans in Britain. BMW said this month it could move some output in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
In 2018, business investment fell in each of the four calendar quarters, the longest such run since the global financial crisis, official figures have shown.
Finance minister Philip Hammond says he expects a pickup in investment by companies once a Brexit deal is done.
But the BCC said that the diversion of resources to prepare for the risk of a no-deal Brexit and the high up-front costs of doing business in Britain, as well as questions over Britain's future ties to the EU, would limit any quick investment rebound.
The BCC said business investment was expected to grow by 0.6 percent in 2020 and 1.1 percent in 2021.
It lowered its overall growth forecast for Britain's economy to 1.2 percent in 2019 - in line with the Bank of England's latest forecast - from a previous estimate of 1.3 percent. 
That would be the economy's weakest growth in a decade, reflecting a slowdown in the global economy as well as Brexit. 
The BCC saw only a weak pickup, with growth edging up to 1.3 and 1.4 percent in 2020 and 2021.
It said its forecasts assumed that Britain would avoid a disorderly exit from the EU. 
""A messy and disorderly exit from the EU would do real and lasting damage to the UK's economic prospects,"" Marshall said. 
Prime Minister Theresa May expected to ask lawmakers once again to back her Brexit plan this week after they rejected it twice previously. 
Also on Monday, property website Rightmove said the asking price of homes put up for sale rose by a monthly 0.4 percent in the four weeks to March 9, the weakest increase for that period since 2011.
Prices in London, where the property market has shown most weakness in the run-up to Brexit, fell by 1.1 percent.

""The closer you get to the wire without the clarity of an agreed way forward, the greater the propensity for buyers to wait and see rather than acting now,"" Rightmove director Miles Shipside said.

(Reuters) - Principal Financial Group Inc (NASDAQ:PFG) is in advanced talks to acquire  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's retirement plan services business, in a deal that could exceed $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
Wells Fargo has been seeking to streamline its business as it grapples with the fallout of customer abuse scandals. The bank is prohibited from growing in size after the Federal Reserve slapped it with an unprecedented asset cap in February 2018, citing ""widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns.""
The bank's retirement plan services unit, which includes Wells' 401(k) savings accounts business, would expand a similar business of Principal Financial. If the negotiations are concluded successfully, a deal could be announced later this month, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is confidential.
Wells Fargo and Principal Financial declined to comment.
Based in Des Moines, Iowa, Principal Financial is a life insurance and financial services group with a market capitalization of $14.5 billion.
It is the latest in a series of divestments pursued by Wells Fargo. 
In 2018, Wells Fargo announced deals to sell 52 branches spread across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin to Flagstar Bancorp Inc, as well as a $1.7 billion deal to offload its Puerto Rico auto finance business to the local unit of Popular Inc.

The disclosure three years ago that Wells Fargo created millions of fake customer accounts prompted regulatory probes into mortgage foreclosures, auto insurance sales and its wealth management businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines.

(Reuters) - U.S. casino operators Eldorado Resorts Inc and Caesars Entertainment Corp are in the early stages of exploring a merger, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The deal talks come after Caesars agreed this month to give billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has been pushing the company to sell itself, three board seats to his representatives and a say on the selection of its next chief executive officer. 
Caesars is providing some limited confidential financial information to Eldorado, which is carrying out due diligence on the potential combination of the two companies, the sources said.
Eldorado has yet to make a binding offer for Caesars, and there is no certainty any bid will materialize or that a deal will be successfully negotiated, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Caesars and Eldorado have market capitalizations of $5.4 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. They also had debt piles of $9.1 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, as of the end of December.
Caesars declined to comment, while Eldorado did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The combination of Caesars and Eldorado would create a more formidable competitor to larger casino industry players, such as Las Vegas Sands Corp, Wynn Resorts Ltd and MGM Resorts International.
""The universe of buyers (for Caesars) is limited, and Eldorado is best suited to extract full value from Caesars' assets in our view,"" Roch Capital Partners analysts wrote in a March 6 research note.
Caesars, whose casinos include the Harrah's and Horseshoe brands, emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2017, after failing to cope with some $25 billion in debt. It had 53 properties in 14 U.S. states and five countries outside the United States, including the UK, as of the end of December.
Eldorado owns and operates 26 properties in 12 U.S. states.
Last year, Caesars rejected a merger approach by Tilman Fertitta, the billionaire owner of Golden Nugget casinos. That deal would essentially have been structured as an acquisition by Caesars given its larger size. Fertitta has not submitted any new offer for Caesars this year, according to the sources.
Caesars has also said it is exploring strategic alternatives that could lead to some kind of transaction.

Icahn has been steadily raising his stake in Caesars in anticipation of a deal. Last week, he disclosed his stake had reached 17.8 percent, up from 9.8 percent when he clinched his deal over board seats with the company on March 1.

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Sunday it was finalizing the development of a software upgrade and a revision of pilot training for its 737 MAX, the plane that has suffered two fatal crashes in the last five months.
The updates are intended to address how the aircraft's flight control system - MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) - responds to erroneous sensor inputs, the planemaker said https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2019-03-17-Boeing-CEO-Muilenburg-Issues-Statement-on-Ethiopian-Airlines-Flight-302-Accident-Investigation in a statement.
A 737 MAX 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed shortly after take-off on March 10, killing all 157 on board. 
Ethiopia said on Sunday the crash had ""clear similarities"" with a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October, according to initial analysis of the black boxes recovered from the wreckage of the March 10 disaster.
Concern over the plane's safety caused aviation authorities worldwide to ground the model. 
Boeing has been working on a software upgrade for an anti-stall system and pilot displays on the 737 MAX, its fastest-selling jetliner, following the deadly Lion Air crash, and has said it was updating pilot training as well. 
One idea for revised training is an additional 10-15 minute iPad course that would explain the new software, according to Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilot union and a 737 pilot. 
However, specific new pilot training is not expected to be defined until the software fix is in place, industry sources said.
Boeing plans to release upgraded software for its 737 MAX in a week to 10 days, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.

Boeing did not immediately return a request for comment.

Boeing's safety analysis of the flight control system called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) understated the power of this system, the Seattle Times said, citing current and former engineers at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
The FAA also did not delve into any detailed inquiries and followed a standard certification process on the MAX, the Seattle Times reported citing an FAA spokesman. 
The FAA declined to comment on the Seattle Times report but referred to previous statements about the certification process. It has said the 737-MAX certification process followed the FAA's standard certification process. 
The report also said both Boeing and the FAA were informed of the specifics of this story and were asked for responses 11 days ago, before the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX last Sunday that killed all 157 people on board. The same model flown by Lion Air crashed off the coast of Indonesia in October, killing all 189 on board.
Last Monday Boeing said it would deploy a software upgrade to the 737 MAX 8, a few hours after the FAA said it would mandate ""design changes"" in the aircraft by April. 

A Boeing spokesman said 737 MAX was certified in accordance with the identical FAA requirements and processes that have governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives. The spokesman said the FAA concluded that MCAS on 737 MAX met all certification and regulatory requirements.

985,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2019 11:16AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank go public on merger talks,"By Andreas Framke and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) confirmed on Sunday they were in talks about a merger, although both warned that a deal was far from certain and analysts questioned the merits of a combination.
Germany's two largest banks issued short statements following separate meetings of their management boards, a person with knowledge of the matter said, indicating a quickening of pace in the merger process.
""In light of arising opportunities, the management board of Deutsche Bank has decided to review strategic options,"" Deutsche said in its statement.
Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank's chief executive, told employees that Deutsche still aimed ""to remain a global bank with a strong capital markets business...with a global network"".
Sewing also said that many factors could prevent a merger, and a Deutsche spokesman said the talks were expected to last for some time. For its part, Commerzbank described the outcome as open. 
Formal disclosure of talks appears to boost the chances of concluding a deal floated in 2016 before the banks opted to focus on restructuring.
GOVERNMENT ROLE
The German government has pushed for a combination given concerns about the health of Deutsche, which has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis.
The government, which holds a stake of more than 15 percent in Commerzbank following a bailout, wants a national banking champion to support its export-led economy, best known for cars and machine tools.
Berlin also wants to keep Commerzbank's speciality - the funding of medium-sized companies, the backbone of the economy - in German hands.
A merged bank is likely to rank as the third largest in Europe behind HSBC and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
However, sceptics questioned the strength of a merged operation.
""We do not see a national champion here, but a shaky zombie bank that could lead to another billion-euro grave for the German state. Why should we take this risk?"" said Gerhard Schick, finance activist and former member of the German parliament.
JOB FEARS
While the banks had not publicly commented on merger talks until Sunday, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz last Monday confirmed that there were negotiations.
On Sunday, the ministry acknowledged the announcement and said it remained in regular contact with all parties.
However, there were signs of political opposition.
Hans Michelbach, a lawmaker from the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), called on the government to sell its 15 percent stake in Commerzbank before a deal.
""There may not be an ownership by the federal government in a merged big bank indirectly through an old stake. We do not need a German State Bank AG,"" he told Reuters.
The supervisory boards of both banks are scheduled to hold long-planned meetings on Thursday, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The status of merger negotiations is expected to be discussed.
The merged bank would have roughly 1.8 trillion euros in assets, such as loans and investments, and a market value of about 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion).
It would have one fifth of the German retail banking market and together the banks employ 140,000 people worldwide, with Deutsche employing 91,700 people and Commerzbank 49,000.
Germany's Verdi labor union has objected strongly to a merger, saying that at least 10,000 jobs are at risk.
RISKS REMAIN
Deutsche, the largest bank in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, emerged unscathed from the financial crash but later lost its footing.
German officials fear that a recession or big fine, for example, could derail the bank's fragile recovery. 
Other than Deutsche, Commerzbank is Germany's only remaining big publicly-traded bank, after a series of mergers. 
Commerzbank, like Deutsche, has struggled to rebound, and German officials say it is vulnerable to a foreign takeover. If an international rival snapped it up, that would increase competition for Deutsche on its home turf.
The initial analyst reaction to a deal was skeptical.
There will only be limited benefits of adding Commerzbank's clientele of retail and small and medium businesses to Deutsche, said David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors, which specializes in risk management.
""It doesn't change the fact that Germany is not getting a flagship bank that can compete on the world stage. It's still a stunted bank with a lot of problems,"" Hendler said.
One of the biggest risks is how to fill what one German official has told Reuters will be a multi-billion-euro financial hole because a merger could trigger an adjustment to the valuation of some bank investments.

Commerzbank, for example, has about 30.8 billion euros of debt securities such as Italian bonds that now have a value of 27.7 billion euros - a drop of 3.1 billion euros. A tie-up could crystallize this loss. Deutsche has such securities at market value in its accounts.

988,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 17, 2019 08:28AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Morgan Stanley Eyes an Earnings Recession
Investors should brace for a U.S. earnings recession, while the labor market is set for its first real test of the Trump administration, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.
“The bottom line for us is that the earnings recession is real and it's broader than the one we experienced in 2015-16,” Morgan Stanley said in a note Monday. “It's also happening at a time when the economy has much less slack ... This is leading to more margin pressures than what companies were prepared for when we entered 2018.”
The latest labor report from Challenger, Gray and Christmas indicating a spike in February job cut announcements to the highest level since July 2015, combined with anemic nonfarm payrolls growth, indicates the labor costs are at last biting and hitting hiring intentions, the investment bank said.
Until there’s evidence that cost cutting is reversing current negative margin trends, “the risk is still to the downside for more disappointing releases which is likely to weigh on stock prices,” it added.
“We remained comfortable with our 2500-2800 range for the S&P 500 until further notice and remain more defensively skewed than normal in our sector recommendations,” Morgan Stanley said.
2. Homebuilders Unlikely to Hammer Out Gains
Mortgage rates have swung to their lowest level in a year, but the clouds over U.S. homebuilders are unlikely to clear anytime soon as the fundamentals of the housing market remain murky.
The sale of new U.S. homes showed little sign of life, falling 7% month on month and 4% compared with January 2018, the U.S. Census Bureau said Thursday.
Market participants have been closely watching building permits -- a key indicator of U.S. housing production -- but there's little to write home about.
Single-family homes permits, which account for the largest share of the housing market, fell to 812,000, the lowest since August 2017, data showed last week.
This arrived as a surprise after the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) housing market index, a gauge of sentiment of single-family homes, rebounded in January, amid a decline in mortgage rates thanks to falling U.S. bond yields as the Federal Reserve remains on pause.
""The bounce back in single-family starts mirrors our builder confidence surveys, as sentiment fell in the latter part of 2018 but rebounded in January after mortgage rates showed a notable decline,"" said Greg Ugalde, chairman of the NAHB.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.35% in the Feb. 21 week, mortgage guarantor Freddie Mac said Thursday, the lowest since early February 2018.
The tug of war between rising demand, boosted by lower rates, and the lack of homes builders are generating for sale have played out in big builder stocks with the iShares US Home Construction (NYSE:ITB) ETF down by nearly 14% over the past year.
Still, with spring in the air, some remain optimistic the crucial selling season will mark a turnaround.
“Despite recent headwinds, the housing market appears poised for a modest rebound headed into the spring selling season,"" Wells Fargo said in a recent note. ""Amid softer sales and rising inventories, home prices continue to moderate, which should provide some relief for buyers challenged by affordability.""
3. First-Quarter GDP Measure Looking Very Weak
There’s just a couple of weeks left in the first quarter, but when it comes to economic growth, government attention is still focused on last year’s fourth quarter. The next GDP update with be a revision of fourth-quarter numbers due on March 28.
Those looking for a snapshot on how the economy is doing right now, though, should turn to the Atlanta Federal Reserve.
The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow “forecasting model provides a ‘nowcast’ of the official estimate prior to its release by estimating GDP growth using a methodology similar to the one used by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.”
The measure “is best viewed as a running estimate of real GDP growth based on available data for the current measured quarter,” the Atlanta Fed said.
Unfortunately for those hoping for a rebound in GDP, the latest number, released Wednesday, for real annual growth is just 0.4%.
“After reports on durable manufacturing and construction spending were released by the U.S. Census Bureau this morning, the nowcast of first-quarter real gross private domestic investment growth increased from -2.9 percent to -2.4 percent, and the nowcast of first-quarter real government expenditures growth increased from 1.7 percent to 2.5 percent,” according to the Atlanta Fed.
But for equity investors, this may be encouraging. Such weak growth could mean a guarantee for the FOMC to keep rates on hold for the rest of the year.

989,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>","Brexit, yellow vests take fizz out of champagne sales","PARIS (Reuters) - Brexit and France's ""yellow vest"" protest movement pushed the number of bottles of French champagne sold last year to its lowest since 2004, trade group data showed on Sunday.
The Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC) said the number of bottles sold fell 1.8 percent to 302 million in 2018, though total revenue edged up 0.3 percent to a record 4.9 billion euros ($5.6 billion) as prices rose. 
""The fall in volume is becoming a bit worrying, with the slowdown in France and Britain not compensated by higher sales outside the European Union,"" CIVC co-president Jean-Marie Barillere told Reuters. 
French and UK sales together account for about 60 percent of total sales by volume. French sales fell 4.2 percent to 147 million bottles, with more bottles sold abroad than in France for the first time in 100 years, as a slow economy and the yellow vest anti-government protest movement weighed on sales.
Barillere said the protests had hit Paris tourist arrivals and French household confidence, hurting demand. 
Total export sales edged up 0.6 percent to nearly 155 million bottles, but total export revenue rose 1.8 percent to 2.9 billion euros as the focus on value of big houses, such as LVMH's Moët & Chandon and Pernod Ricard's Mumm, the world's best-selling champagne, paid off.
In Britain, sales fell for the third year in a row, due in part to uncertainty sparked by the country's planned departure from the European Union. Volumes dropped 3.6 percent to 26.8 million bottles for total revenue of 406 million euros. Volumes had already fallen 11 percent in 2017 and 9 percent in 2016.
CIVC said champagne was feeling strong competition from Italian prosecco, which is three to four times cheaper. 
Sales to the United States increased 2.7 percent to 23.7 million bottles for revenue of 577 million euros. 
Sales to Japan were up 5.5 percent to 13.6 million bottles, while sales to Hong Kong and China - each accounting for more than 2 million bottles - were up 12 and 10.1 percent respectively. 

The biggest sales increase was seen in South Africa, where volume was up more than 38 percent to 1.1 million bottles.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2019 04:10AM ET</span>",Lyft to launch road show for up to $2 billion IPO: sources,"By Carl O'Donnell and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Ride-hailing platform Lyft Inc will launch the investor road show for its initial public offering on Monday, seeking to raise as much as $2 billion and to be valued at more than $20 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
Lyft will be seeking to convince investors to make large commitments to its IPO, rather than hold out for its larger rival  Uber Technologies Inc  (UBER.UL), which is planning to launch its own public offering next month, the sources said. 
Lyft will meet with investors across the United States before pricing the IPO and listing on the Nasdaq at the end of the month, the sources said. It will be pitching itself as a more focused bet on ride-hailing to differentiate itself from Uber, which has diversified to areas such as food delivery and freight hauling and expanded around the world, the sources said.
Uber is seeking a valuation as high as $120 billion at its IPO, although some analysts have pegged it closer to $100 billion based on selected financial figures it has disclosed. Neither Uber nor Lyft are profitable.
Lyft's IPO will give provide a funding boost as it continues to subsidize rides with promotions to attract passengers. The windfall from the IPO will also help finance investments in areas such as autonomous driving, the sources said.
Lyft declined to comment. 
After a quiet start to the year, technology companies are lining up for public listings as public equity markets hover near historic highs, but remain vulnerable to geopolitical concerns, including tensions over trade agreements and a slowdown in economies including Europe and China. 
Other Silicon Valley unicorns - startup companies with valuations of at least $1 billion - including business messaging company Slack Technologies Inc and image-sharing company Pinterest Inc, are waiting in the wings to go public later in 2019, sources have said. 
FIRST OF ITS KIND
Lyft's IPO will mark the first time a ride-hailing company has debuted on the U.S. public markets. Lyft launched in 2012 and is led by its founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer.
The ride-hailing industry, which touted $36.5 billion in sales globally in 2017, is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, but is fraught with questions about the future of automated driving, regulatory pushback and legal challenges over drivers' pay and benefits. 
Lyft will emphasize to investors its rapid growth in the United States and its relatively uncomplicated business model, which focuses on selling rides in cars, bikes and scooters, Reuters has reported.
In its IPO filing, Lyft said its U.S. market share has risen to 39 percent, from 35 percent early in 2018, gaining some ground on long-dominant Uber. Unlike Uber, Lyft operates only in North America.
Lyft's revenue was $2.16 billion for 2018, double the previous year and up 528 percent from $343 million in 2016. But Lyft posted a loss of $911 million for 2018, which climbed from $688 million in 2017 and $682 million in 2016, according to its IPO filing.
Losses could continue to mount, Lyft cautioned, as it continues to invest and eye a broader international expansion, and it could be forced to increase driver pay.
Uber's revenue last year was $11.3 billion, while its gross bookings from rides were $50 billion. But the company lost $3.3 billion, excluding gains from the sale of its overseas business units in Russia and Southeast Asia.

SoftBank’s Vision Fund and Toyota Motor Corp are part of a consortium of investors in talks to invest $1 billion in Uber’s self-driving car unit, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Taking on large investors that will influence a key business is an unusual move for a company so close to an IPO.

Bill Johnson, who is set to retire as the CEO of Tennessee Valley Authority in April, is the front-runner to get the top job at PG&E, the Journal reported.
PG&E has also made offers to 10 new independent board candidates and is expected to unveil the slate as soon as next week, saying it has significant shareholder support, according to the report. 
Johnson's new role, which could also be announced next week, has not yet been finalized and other candidates were still being interviewed, the newspaper added. 
The utility filed for bankruptcy protection in January in anticipation of liabilities from the wildfires, including the catastrophic 2018 Camp Fire that killed 85 people.
PG&E declined to comment, while no one was available at U.S.-owned TVA to comment on Saturday.
A trio of activist investors, that together own nearly 10 percent of PG&E stock, has been working with the company to change its management, the Journal reported. 
The three hedge funds, Abrams Capital Management LP, Knighthead Capital Management LLC and Redwood Capital Management LLC, said in a filing on Friday they had agreed with PG&E to work together to appoint a new CEO and refresh its board. The board slate they have helped PG&E assemble is expected to include experts on cyber security, nuclear security and restructurings, the Journal said. PG&E's previous CEO, Geisha Williams (NYSE:WMB), stepped down in January after less than two years on the job. Last month, the company said it expected only five of its current 10-strong board to stand for reelection at an annual shareholder meeting in May. It also said it expected the board to include 11 independent directors by the time of the meeting, without specifying how big the board would finally be. 
The Journal said the efforts of the three investors are separate from those of another PG&E investor, BlueMountain Capital Management, which earlier in March named its own slate of 13 people it hopes to install as directors at the embattled power utility.

The measure follows inspections by Banca d'Italia from October last year until the beginning of 2019, which showed ING Italy did not do enough to prevent money laundering transactions through its accounts.
ING paid a record 775 million euro ($900 million) fine in a settlement with Dutch prosecutors in September last year for failing to spot criminal use of its Dutch accounts for years.
The bank said the shortcomings found by the Italian supervisors were the result of steps announced after the Dutch settlement, meant to enhance management of compliance risks. 
""In the coming days ING will work hard to address the shortcomings and resolve the issues identified,"" the lender said.

ING said it would refrain from taking on new customers in Italy during further discussions with Banca d'Italia, but would continue to serve existing clients in the country.

994,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2019 12:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Indian antitrust watchdog raids Glencore business, others over pulse prices - sources","By Aditya Kalra and Mayank Bhardwaj
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust watchdog raided units of global commodities trader  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) and two other firms in Mumbai on Saturday in an inquiry into alleged collusion on the price of pulses, four sources with knowledge of the raids told Reuters.
More than 25 antitrust officials carried out the raids at the offices of local units of Glencore and Africa's Export Trading Group, and India's Edelweiss group which previously had a commodities business, two government sources told Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been investigating allegations that the companies formed a cartel to discuss the pricing of pulses while importing and selling them in the Indian market at higher prices in 2015 and 2016, when India faced an acute shortage, the sources said.
A spokesman for Switzerland-based Glencore, Charles Watenphul, declined to comment, while India's Edelweiss, which sold its commodities trading business in November 2016, and the Export Trading Group did not respond to requests for comment.
Two years of drought pushed up prices of pulses such as chickpeas and black grams, which are a staple of Indian cuisine, in 2015 and forced New Delhi to offer duty-free imports, encouraging foreign and Indian traders who imported pulses to sell locally.
""The collusion by these companies led to higher prices of pulses,"" one of the government sources said, adding that the CCI's inquiry started three months ago.
The investigation will also assess whether the companies have continued their alleged collusion even after the prices of pulses stabilized in recent years, the source said.
IMPORT PRICES
The raids on five company offices in India's financial capital began on Friday and were concluded on Saturday.
Antitrust officials collected evidence, including documents and e-mails, and questioned company officials during the raids, a second government source said.
Another source, an industry executive, told Reuters that CCI's search involved going through company records at Glencore's office in Mumbai, confirming it was part of the watchdog's probe into accusations of fixing import prices.
The drought during 2015 wilted crops and exacerbated shortages of food such as protein-rich pulses and India, which consumes about 22 million tonnes of pulses annually, faced a shortfall of 7-8 million tonnes in 2015-16. 
The CCI's raids on commodities traders mark only its fourth such search operation in its near 10-year history. They can only be conducted with approval from a judge.
In October, the CCI raided the offices of global brewers such as Carlsberg (CO:CARLa) and Anheuser Busch InBev and found e-mails which allegedly showed violations of Indian anti-trust laws. (https://reut.rs/2JeQKEs)

The brewing companies have pleaded leniency under a CCI program, Reuters has reported.

(Reuters) - The Apple Watch was able to detect irregular heart pulse rates that could signal the need for further monitoring for a serious heart rhythm problem, according to data from a large study funded by Apple Inc (O:AAPL), demonstrating a potential future role for wearable consumer technology in healthcare.
Researchers hope the technology can assist in early detection of atrial fibrillation, the most common form of irregular heart beat. Patients with untreated AF are five times more likely to have a stroke.
Results of the largest AF screening and detection study, involving over 400,000 Apple Watch users who were invited to participate, were presented on Saturday at the American College of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans.
Of the 400,000 participants, 0.5 percent, or about 2,000 subjects, received notifications of an irregular pulse. Those people were sent an ECG (electrocardiography) patch to wear for subsequent detection of atrial fibrillation episodes.
A third of those whose watches detected an irregular pulse were confirmed to have atrial fibrillation using the ECG technology, researchers said.
Some 84 percent of the irregular pulse notifications were later confirmed to have been AF episodes, data showed. 
""The physician can use the information from the study, combine it with their assessment ... and then guide clinical decisions around what to do with an alert,"" said Dr. Marco Perez, one of the study's lead investigators from Stanford School of Medicine. 
The study also found that 57 percent of participants who received an alert on their watch sought medical attention. 
For Apple, the data provides firepower as it pushes into healthcare. Its new Series 4 Watch, which became available only after the study began so was not used, has the ability to take an electrocardiogram to detect heart problems and required clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who was not involved in the trial, called it an important study as use of this type of wearable technology is only going to become more prevalent.
""The study is an important first step in figuring out how can we use these technologies in a way that's evidence based,"" he said.
Researchers urged caution by doctors in using data from consumer devices when treating patients. But they also see great future potential for this type of technology. 

""Atrial fibrillation is just the beginning, as this study opens the door to further research into wearable technologies and how they might be used to prevent disease before it strikes,"" said Lloyd Minor, dean of Stanford School of Medicine.

The German automobile companies each published posts on Chinese social media announcing immediate price cuts for several models. The discounts come as China endures a shrinking market for automobiles as the economy slows.
BMW said it would reduce prices for both domestically produced and imported models, including the locally-made BMW 3 series and BMW 5 series, along with the BMW X5 and BMW 7 import models. The BMW 320Li M model will sell for a suggested retail price of 339,800 yuan ($50,620), a drop of 10,000 yuan from its original price.
The reductions mark the company's ""active response to the national VAT adjustment notice,"" BMW said in a post on WeChat, China's popular messaging app.
 Daimler  AG-owned (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz announced similar price cuts on a range of its cars, also effective immediately, in advance of the upcoming VAT drop. The cuts shown on its social media page range from 10,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan on select models. 
On March 5, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that China will cut VAT across a range of industries, with the tax set to drop in the manufacturing sector from 16 percent to 13 percent and in the transport sector from 10 percent to 9 percent.
The carmakers' cuts come as China's automobile industry faces a major slowdown. In 2018, China's car market shrank 5.8 percent, marking its first contraction in over two decades.

Policymakers have introduced a range of policies to stimulate demand for cars. In January, China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said it would loosen restrictions on the second-hand car market and provide subsidies to boost purchases in rural areas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators will ask the public if robotic cars should be allowed on streets without steering wheels or brake pedals as they try to set the first legal boundaries for their design in the world's second largest vehicle market.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has delayed action for 15 months on General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's request to deploy a limited number vehicles on U.S. roads without steering wheels or other human controls such as a brake pedal. 
In GM's petition, NHTSA will for the first time compare a vehicle in which all driving decisions are made by a computer versus a human driver. NHTSA called it ""an important case of first impression,"" presenting ""novel and important issues.""
The decision to move forward comes amid heightened concerns about automated piloting systems in vehicles and aircraft.
A fatal 2018 accident involving a self-driving vehicle operated by Uber Technologies Inc and two deadly plane crashes involving highly automated Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX airliners have put a spotlight on the ability of regulators to assess the safety of advanced systems that substitute machine intelligence for human judgment. 
NHTSA is also seeking public comment on a separate petition by Softbank Corp-backed driverless delivery startup Nuro to deploy a limited number of low-speed, highly automated delivery vehicles without human occupants.
For example, Nuro, which partnered with Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co last year to deliver groceries, seeks approval not to include a windshield in the vehicle.
The petitions want exemptions from U.S. vehicle safety rules largely written decades ago that assume human drivers would always be in control of a vehicle. 
NHTSA wants input on a detailed list of questions about the issues surrounding deploying vehicles without human controls.
NHTSA said it will accept public comments for at least 60 days.
GM has said it hoped to deploy the vehicles by the end of 2019 but was unsure if it will win regulatory approval by the end of the year since 15 months have elapsed without any NHTSA decisions.
GM spokesman Patrick Sullivan said on Friday the company's ""plans have not changed. We are still seeking approval for the petition.""
GM said it would initially limit the speed of the test fleet of no more than 2,500 modified Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles as part of a GM-controlled on-demand ride-sharing fleet, likely to be based in San Francisco.
GM must demonstrate the vehicles are at least as safe as human-driven vehicles to win temporary exemptions from the requirements.
Last year, Congress failed to pass legislation to speed the deployment of self-driving cars on U.S. roads after the Uber crash.
Last October, NHTSA said it was moving ahead with plans to revise safety rules that bar fully self-driving cars from the roads without equipment such as steering wheels, pedals and mirrors but acknowledged it could be a lengthy review.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc’s Waymo unit late last year launched a limited autonomous ride-hailing service in Arizona for the general public with no human driver. Waymo’s vehicles have human controls and a safety driver.

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Friday said its newest vice chairmen, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, were each awarded about $18 million last year, in the first detailed look at the pay of the men considered the leading candidates to succeed Warren Buffett as the conglomerate's chief executive.
Abel, 56, and Jain, 67, who became vice chairmen in January 2018, both received $16 million in salary plus $2 million in bonus, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Buffett sets compensation for both.
The payouts show Buffett's willingness to pay Berkshire's younger leaders in a manner similar to that at other publicly-traded companies, though Berkshire does not grant stock options.
For more than a quarter of a century, Buffett has taken a $100,000 salary at Berkshire. But his 16.5 percent ownership stake in the Omaha, Nebraska-based company forms the bulk of his net worth, estimated at $84.4 billion by Forbes magazine. 
Abel oversees Berkshire's non-insurance operations such as the BNSF railroad, aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, retail businesses such as Fruit of the Loom and Brooks running shoes, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, where he remains executive chairman and owns 1 percent of the voting stock.
Jain, meanwhile, has long been Berkshire's top insurance executive, and oversees its businesses in that sector, including auto insurer Geico and reinsurer General Re.
In a CNBC interview last month, Buffett said both men were ""doing a fabulous job.""
Jain also controls about $123 million of Berkshire stock, including shares owned by his wife and a private charity, while Abel oversees about $2 million, according to Friday's filing.
Buffett, 88, still oversees the bulk of Berkshire's common stock investments including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, and with Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 95, handles major capital allocation decisions.
The filing said Buffett's total compensation in 2018 was $388,968, including $288,968 for personal and home security.
Munger, also a billionaire, received a $100,000 salary. Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg was awarded $2.26 million.
Buffett's compensation was about 6.63 times the $58,691 median pay of Berkshire employees, based on a sample of about two-thirds of its roughly 389,000-person workforce.

The filing included no shareholder proposals to be voted on at Berkshire's May 4 annual meeting. Such proposals normally fail by large margins. Buffett still has 31.4 percent of Berkshire's voting power.

Avianca said this would reduce its financial commitments between 2020 and 2022 by $2.6 billion. The Colombian carrier has shifted its strategy to focus on profitability from growth. 
The airline is following in the footstep of regional rival LATAM Airlines, which in recent months has said it was reducing future fleet commitments by $2.2 billion.
Avianca, United Continental Holdings Inc and Panama's Copa Holdings announced late last year that they would form an alliance to try to expand their reach in the Latin American market, excluding Brazil.

Avianca is separate from Avianca Brasil, a struggling carrier that filed for bankruptcy in December, although they share owners. Up until last month, the two airlines had been carrying out due diligence for a potential merger, but that process has been suspended.

After receiving allegations in a 2016 anonymous letter that utility contractors had cheated on operator qualification exams, the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) said it directed gas companies to look into it.
Con Edison found evidence of cheating at two contractors, the PSC said, and violations of construction requirements at work done by the contractors.
""The investigation found that the company failed to inspect work completed by its contractors during construction and at sufficient intervals to ensure compliance, and that it allowed work to be completed by plastic fusers and plastic fusion inspectors who were not qualified to do the work,"" the regulator added.
A spokesman for Con Edison said the company was reviewing the order and would provide an appropriate response.
""Several years ago, we became aware of, and then reported to the PSC, suspected cheating by contractors on exams administered by an external party. Subsequent company inspections identified issues related to the work performed by those contractors,"" spokesman Allan Drury said.

Con Edison has been ordered to respond to the regulator within 45 days.

1001,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>","Apple infringed three Qualcomm patents, jury finds","By Stephen Nellis and Jan Wolfe
(Reuters) - Mobile phone chip supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc on Friday won a legal victory against iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), with a jury in federal court in San Diego finding that Apple owes Qualcomm about $31 million for infringing three of its patents.
Qualcomm last year sued Apple alleging it had violated patents related to helping mobile phones get better battery life. During an eight-day trial, Qualcomm asked the jury to award it unpaid patent royalties of up to $1.41 per iPhone that violated the patents.
The $31 million penalty is small change for Apple, the second most valuable U.S. company after  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), with a market value of $866 billion and annual revenue totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. But the setting of a per-phone royalty rate for Qualcomm's technology gives the chip supplier a fresh line of attack in its two-year old legal battle with Apple.
The biggest case, filed by Apple in early 2017, begins in April. Apple has sought to dismantle what it calls Qualcomm's illegal business model of both licensing patents and selling chips to phone makers. Qualcomm has accused Apple of using its technology without paying.
""The technologies invented by Qualcomm and others are what made it possible for Apple to enter the market and become so successful so quickly,"" Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel, said in a statement. ""We are gratified that courts all over the world are rejecting Apple's strategy of refusing to pay for the use of our IP.""
In a statement, Apple said it was disappointed with the outcome.
""Qualcomm's ongoing campaign of patent infringement claims is nothing more than an attempt to distract from the larger issues they face with investigations into their business practices in U.S. federal court, and around the world,"" Apple said. It declined to comment on whether it would appeal.
In other cases against Apple, Qualcomm has won sales bans on iPhones in Germany and China, though the Chinese ban has not been enforced and Apple has taken moves it believes allow it to resume sales in Germany. 
Qualcomm also suffered a setback with U.S. trade regulators who found that some iPhones infringed one of the San Diego-based company's patents but declined to bar their importation into the United States, citing the damage such a move would inflict on rival  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
The verdict on Friday could come into play in the trial in April because it puts a per-phone dollar figure on some of Qualcomm's intellectual property. Qualcomm's patent licensing model relies on charging phone makers a cut of the selling price of the phone, a practice Apple has alleged is unfair and illegal.
During an earlier trial between Qualcomm and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Apple executives outlined their company's extensive negotiations to reduce those license fees to $7.50 per phone for Qualcomm's patents.
The San Diego jury valued just three of Qualcomm's patents in the company's portfolio at $1.41, a figure that the chip supplier believes bolsters its contention that its licensing practices are fair.
""The three patents found to be infringed in this case represent just a small fraction of Qualcomm's valuable portfolio of tens of thousands of patents,"" Rosenberg said in a statement.
Gaston Kroub, a patent lawyer in New York not involved in the case, said the verdict was clearly a win for Qualcomm. But it does not say much about the value of Qualcomm's entire patent portfolio and was unlikely to spark settlements discussions, he said.

""Apple is very skilled at handling appeals and taking a longer-term view. This isn't something that will bring Apple to the table with any sense of urgency,"" Kroub said.

1002,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>",Airlines with buyers' remorse may use Boeing 737 MAX ban to revise orders,"By Conor Humphries, Jamie Freed and Allison Lampert
DUBLIN/SINGAPORE/MONTREAL (Reuters) - The grounding of Boeing's global 737 MAX fleet has brought headaches for airlines that need to find alternative aircraft to fly in their place, but it has given some carriers a welcome opportunity to re-evaluate orders for the plane. 
Countries and airlines around the world banned the 737 MAX this week after a deadly Ethiopian Airlines plane crash killed all 157 people on board. The disaster followed a fatal crash of the same model operated by Lion Air in Indonesia in October.
For airlines that over-ordered the latest version of Boeing's 737 workhorse, the grounding could be a good excuse to delay or cancel purchases, saving cash on the balance sheet, analysts said.
""These unfortunate developments could give airlines that have potentially over-ordered an opportunity to review their requirements and fleet strategy,"" CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said.
Many airlines have had to quickly find other aircraft to substitute for the grounded 737 MAX, which has also complicated plans by airlines to use the fuel-efficient, longer-range jet to serve new destinations. 
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, the world's largest operator of the MAX, was planning to fly the jet on its new California-Hawaii route later this year, while Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes inaugurated flights from Brazil to Orlando and Miami in November after receiving its first 737 MAX planes.
Normally there are financial penalties for airlines that cancel orders and for manufacturers that do not deliver according to the contract terms. It was unclear how much legal leverage the MAX grounding might give airlines to wiggle out of commitments or seek damages for costs and lost revenue. 
Among airlines that may regret ordering too many 737 MAX, Sobie cited Vietnam's VietJet Aviation JSC, which he said had based a decision to expand from an all-Airbus A320 fleet by adding 200 737 MAX jets on a flawed strategy of opening joint ventures in overseas markets.
VietJet said it was closely monitoring developments and would make a decision about its order once more is known.
Among other Asian airlines, financially troubled Malaysia Airlines said on Friday that its order for 25 737 MAX jets was under review. Garuda Indonesia said this week it might cancel its order for 20 737 MAXs, which it had already reduced from 49 before the crash.
Lion Air, one of Boeing's top three MAX customers in terms of total orders, had already thrown into question 187 unfilled orders after its October crash. It told Reuters on Wednesday it would halt all planned 737 MAX deliveries until after a final report into its crash is released later this year.
In Europe, analysts said there was a case for and against cash-strapped Norwegian Air cancelling MAX orders: The ban would offer a reprieve from debt commitments but could leave the airline at the back of a congested Airbus order queue or increase operating costs if flights were replaced with less fuel-efficient jets.
Loss-making Norwegian already said in February it was postponing delivery of 12 MAX aircraft from 2020 to 2023 and 2024 to cut expenditure and shift its focus from expansion to profitability, and this week became the first major airline to publicly say it will seek compensation from Boeing (NYSE:BA) over the MAX grounding.
A Norwegian Air spokesman declined to comment on Friday on whether it was discussing delaying or cancelling altogether MAX 8 orders, saying it was in dialogue with Boeing about a range of topics but had nothing new to share.
FLEET PAIN
For many large carriers like American Airlines Group Inc and China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines Co Ltd, the 737 MAX a tiny proportion of the total fleet.
But smaller airlines Iceland Air, Poland's LOT and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA had planned to use 737 MAX jets to cover 25 percent, 17 percent and 11 percent of their summer schedules respectively, Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said, giving them a higher exposure to the grounding.
""This is going to impact on their operations and cash flow,"" he said. ""Particularly into the Easter peak season next month and potentially through the summer as well... People will be scrambling for spare aircraft and there are not many, so lease rates will rise.""
Meanwhile, Air Canada on Friday became the first major airline to publicly attach dollars and cents to the uncertainty surrounding the 737 MAX, saying it was suspending its 2019 financial forecasts.

One silver lining for the airlines: Reduced seat capacity may allow them to hike passenger fares, analysts said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, led by technology companies, as a report on progress in U.S.-China trade talks lifted sentiment, pushing the S&P 500 to its best week since November.
China's state-run Xinhua news agency said Washington and Beijing were making substantive progress on trade talks, providing relief after news that a summit to seal a deal between the two sides would not happen at March-end.
Chipmakers, which tend to derive a large portion of their revenue from China, rose. The Philadelphia SE chip index climbed 2.9 percent while the S&P 500 technology index rose 1.2 percent.
Despite the mixed news recently on the trade front, many investors expect a deal will eventually happen, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. In addition, he said, ""Investors are warming up to the idea that central banks have taken a huge step backward in terms of tightening.""
U.S. data showed manufacturing output fell for a second straight month in February and factory activity in New York state was weaker than expected this month.
That followed a batch of weak data this week that lent support to the Federal Reserve's dovish stance on future interest rate hikes, which has helped to lift stocks this year.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co closed up 1.5 percent, lifting the Dow, after the world's largest planemaker said a software upgrade for the 737 MAX aircraft will be rolled out in the coming weeks.
Even so, Boeing's shares for the week lost 10.3 percent. The company's 737 MAX jets were grounded globally following a fatal crash involving one of its planes in Ethiopia on Sunday. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 138.93 points, or 0.54 percent, to 25,848.87, the S&P 500 gained 14 points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,822.48 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.62 points, or 0.76 percent, to 7,688.53. The S&P 500 posted its best weekly gain since the end of November and Nasdaq had its best weekly gain so far this year. For the week, the S&P 500 was up 2.9 percent, the Nasdaq was up 3.8 percent, and the Dow was up 1.6 percent.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc jumped 8.2 percent and was among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, after the company late on Thursday reported a quarterly profit that beat analysts' estimates.
Photoshop maker Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc, which also reported results late Thursday, fell 4 percent after its current-quarter revenue forecast missed analysts' estimates.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) shares were down 2.5 percent after the social media giant said late on Thursday that Chief Product Officer Chris Cox would be leaving the company.
The stock briefly added to losses and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) lost ground after the Washington Post reported that U.S. state attorneys general are signaling they are willing to take action against those and other companies.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares climbed 2.2 percent after it won a legal victory against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), with a jury in federal court in San Diego finding that Apple owes Qualcomm about $31 million for infringing three of its patents.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.63-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 61 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 92 new highs and 41 new lows.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 04:26PM ET</span>",British outsourcer Interserve taken over by its creditors,"By Iain Withers and Justin George Varghese
LONDON (Reuters) - Interserve, one of the British government's biggest contractors, was placed in administration late on Friday and immediately taken over by its lenders only hours after shareholders rejected a rescue plan for the debt-laden company.
The public services provider employs 68,000 people globally, including 45,000 in Britain, to clean schools and hospitals, run probation services and build roads and bridges but has been battling to avoid being consigned to the same fate as collapsed rival Carillion.
EY was appointed as administrator with Interserve's assets then moving immediately to a newly incorporated company to be controlled by the group's lenders, thereby wiping out existing shareholders.
It is ""business as usual for employees, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders"", Interserve said, but it did not comment on whether the management team will remain unchanged.
A spokesman for the Cabinet Office, which oversees government contracts, welcomed Friday's developments.
""It brings the company the stability required for it to compete for future business and continue to deliver good value public services for the taxpayer,"" the spokesman said.
The takeover by the company's creditors failed to deflect criticism, however, with fresh questions raised about the resilience of Britain's outsourcing sector a little more than a year after Carillion fell into liquidation. 
""Financial models adopted by these large outsourcers pose an ever-present and potentially very damaging risk to their supply chains,"" said Rudi Klein, CEO of Specialist Engineering Contractors' Group, which employs a number of subcontractors for companies such as Interserve. 
""Following Carillion's collapse, it was generally assumed that there would be a radical reappraisal of the public sector's approach to construction/infrastructure procurement,"" Klein added. ""This hasn't happened"". 
'FAILED MODEL'
Interserve ran into difficulty after a string of ill-advised acquisitions and loss-making contracts, but other British service providers have been hit in recent years after taking on work during the financial crisis at low prices for long contracts that have also proved problematic for groups including Capita and Mitie.
Britain's biggest labor union Unite, which represents more than 1,700 Interserve employees and is the largest union at the company, said it was seeking an urgent meeting with administrators.
""Once again we have seen the government's outsourced model fail,"" said Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe, Unite's national officer. ""The government has been asleep at the wheel since Carillion's collapse last year and if no action is taken we face further corporate collapses.""
The GMB union, which also represents Interserve workers, called for an end to the ""disastrous experiment"" of outsourcing.
""Shambolic mismanagement is putting jobs on the line and services in jeopardy. Our public services can't go on like this,"" the GMB said in a statement.
Tony Williams (NYSE:WMB), a construction analyst at Building Value, said there was nothing wrong with outsourcing, but the likes of Carillion and Interserve had squandered too much cash on misguided and expensive acquisitions.
INVESTOR FALLOUT
A debt-for-equity rescue package proposed by the company's lenders at a general meeting in Central London was opposed by 59 percent of Interserve's shareholders. 
The plan would have handed Interserve's lenders 95 percent of the company in exchange for cancelling 485 million pounds ($642 million) of its debts, with existing investors' holdings diluted to 5 percent.
Interserve said on Friday that a transaction was being implemented that would achieve broadly the same outcomes by exchanging the same level of debt for shares and injecting 110 million pounds of additional liquidity.
The company's lenders include RBS (LON:RBS), HSBC,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and hedge funds Emerald and Cerberus.
Glyn Barker, Interserve's chairman, warned against forcing it into administration ahead of Friday's shareholder vote, arguing it would be more disruptive and costly and wipe out all shareholder value. 
Interserve's largest shareholder, U.S. hedge fund Coltrane, which owns a 28 percent stake, had opposed the rescue plan after Interserve rebuffed an alternative proposal as unworkable.
A representative for Coltrane at the general meeting declined to comment on the situation, other than saying ""I voted for Donald Trump"" when asked how the firm had voted.
Interserve shares were heavily shorted heading into the vote, with hedge funds owning more than a third of Interserve stock, data from Refinitiv showed.
The brokerage arms of two leading investment banks - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) - which can help funds bet against a company, were among the top 10 holders.
At the close of trading on Thursday, two hedge fund firms - Brightsphere Inc and Millennium International - had short positions in Interserve greater than 0.5 percent, Financial Conduct Authority data showed.

1007,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 04:04PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Snaps Losing Streak as China Touts Progress on Trade,"Investing.com – The Dow racked up gains Friday, snapping a two-week losing streak on reports of progress in U.S.-China trade talks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.54%, the S&P 500 added 0.50%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.76%.
A wave of green washed over U.S. stocks after China official state-run Xinhua news agency reported that the United States and China had made ""further concrete progress on the text of the trade agreement.""
The news helped lift sentiment on U.S.-China trade, which had been dented a day earlier after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin admitted that a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to seal a trade deal would not take place at the end of March as previously discussed.
Trade-sensitive industrials, however, struggled to close in positive territory as  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) gave up gains from a day earlier, closing 3.2% lower.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), meanwhile, pared some of its early-week losses after Agence France-Presse reported that the aircraft maker was set to roll out a software upgrade for its 737-MAX in the next 10 days. Shares rose 1.5% and added nearly 39 points to the Dow's 139-point gain.
Tech stocks also underpinned the rally in the broader market as Wall Street analysts talked up the prospects for chip stocks amid expectations the U.S. and China are edging closer to a deal. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the Dow's leader with a 1.67% gain.
""We're of the belief that a deal will get done which would likely send the semiconductor space up higher,"" RBC said. The two most sensitive areas to trade within semis have been semi-cap equipment and GPUs, the bank added.
Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) both hit 52-week highs.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 2.5%, keeping a lid on growth in tech stocks, after its Chief Product Officer Chris Cox announced he would be leaving the company. The announcement comes amid a turbulent period for the social media giant in the wake of reports that federal prosecutors had launched a probe into data deals the company made with other tech giants.
Separately, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) had little to show for its better-than-expected quarterly results, ending the day modestly lower.
Consumer discretionary stocks also enjoyed gains thanks to a rally in shares of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) following its above-consensus fourth-quarter results released after Thursday's close.
In other company news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) unveiled its all-electric, mid-sized Model Y SUV, but the fanfare soured as Wall Street raised concerns about the timing of deliveries, sending its shares reversing 5%.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk, at a shareholder meeting in June, outlined plans to deliver the Model Y in the first half of 2020, but he said Thursday the first deliveries were likely in the fall of 2020 for higher-priced and longer-ranged versions and the spring of 2021 for the $39,000 base version, CFRA said in a note. ""This timing shift is important because we expect Tesla faces significantly increased EV competition starting with the 2021 model year.""
On the economic front, the Empire State Manufacturing Index and industrial production undershot economists' estimates, adding to concerns the U.S. economy is slowing down.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and American Tower (NYSE:AMT) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.

OAS is under investigation for alleged bribes to win infrastructure projects in Lima, including contributions to the campaign of former mayor Susana Villaran in exchange for work contracts, according to prosecutors.
Lead prosecutor Rafael Vela told Reuters that OAS had agreed to hand over all documents requested by his team.
OAS representatives in Lima could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Brazilian builder Odebrecht is at the center of the so-called ""Car Wash"" corruption investigation in Brazil, which has rippled across Latin America and which U.S. prosecutors have said is the biggest political graft scheme ever uncovered. 
Odebrecht agreed with Peruvian prosecutors in February to pay $228 million as civil compensation for bribes in four public works. It return, the firm will be allowed to re-apply for contracts in the country.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 02:54PM ET</span>","No new natural gas hookups in New York's Westchester County, Con Ed says","(Reuters) - New York energy company Consolidated Edison Inc (NYSE:ED) said on Friday it still plans to impose a moratorium on new natural gas service in parts of Westchester County after March 15 despite a $250 million plan by the state to reduce energy usage.
""The moratorium will still go into effect after March 15,"" Con Edison spokesman Allan Drury said, noting the company needs to stop hooking up new gas customers to avoid compromising gas system reliability because of limited space on existing interstate pipelines into the region. 
Westchester County is north of New York City.
New York State has blocked construction of new interstate pipelines for environmental reasons for years as Governor Andrew Cuomo and other state officials want utilities to focus more on renewable power sources and energy efficiency programs, instead of building more gas and other fossil fuel-fired power plants and infrastructure.
Consumers, however, want access to more gas to heat homes and businesses because it is cheaper and cleaner to burn than oil. This winter, U.S. Northeast households, on average, are expected to spend $723 to heat with gas and $1,646 with oil, according to federal estimates.
Drury said Con Edison has received more than 1,300 applications for new gas hookups since notifying the state of the moratorium on Jan. 17, well above the number the company normally receives during a two-month period.
On Thursday, the state announced several steps totaling $250 million to reduce energy consumption and fund alternative energy programs.
The state said the programs will ""provide immediate relief to Westchester County businesses and residents affected by Con Edison announcement that it will put new applications for firm natural gas service on a waiting list beginning March 15.""
The programs, which are estimated to reduce energy consumption equivalent to the amount of gas needed to heat over 90,000 homes, include funding for clean energy alternatives like electric heat pumps and high-efficiency appliances.
The problem with those programs is they only reduce demand, not boost gas supplies.
To provide gas to more customers and maintain system reliability, Con Edison has said it needs more programs to reduce demand and more interstate pipelines and storage facilities.

Several energy companies have tried for years to build gas pipelines from the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania to New York, but regulators in Albany have denied some of those projects, like Williams (NYSE:WMB) Cos Inc's long-delayed Constitution pipeline.

Without the extension, operations at Citgo, which is now under the administration of the opposition in Venezuela led by Juan Guaido, would grind to a halt, as the company wouldn’t be able to sell fuels to U.S. companies or even buy a pen from a U.S. person. That would threaten to cut off about 4 percent of American fuel-making capacity.
The extension of the deadline was expected and will allow Citgo to “operate profitably without too much trouble,” Rice University’s Francisco Monaldi, a Venezuelan-born expert on energy politics, said in a phone interview Friday.
Under a set of sanctions released at the end of January, Citgo -- which at the time was indirectly controlled by the government of embattled president Nicolas Maduro -- had an authorization to interact with U.S. companies or persons until July 27.
The deadline was extended for 18 months after a team appointed by Venezuela’s National Assembly leader Guaido officially took the reins of the company in February, according to a general license issued by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Citgo operates three refineries in the U.S. with combined capacity to process almost 755,000 barrels of oil a day, or about 4 percent of the U.S. fuel-making capacity. It operates more than 40 petroleum terminals in the U.S. and sells fuels to 5,300 Citgo-branded gas stations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. banking regulator said on Friday that PricewaterhouseCoopers will pay $335 million to settle claims of ""professional negligence,"" after saying the auditor should have identified problems leading to the 2009 collapse of Alabama-based Colonial Bank.
PwC did not confirm or deny the claims, but agreed to pay the settlement fine, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said in a statement.
The settlement is significantly lower than the $625.3 million a federal judge ordered the firm to pay the regulator in July.
Martin Gruenberg, an FDIC board member and its former chairman, dissented from the settlement because it did not require PwC to admit liability.
The FDIC had sued the company in its role as receiver for Colonial Bank, which once had over $25 billion in assets and 340 branches.
At the time, PwC had argued that the FDIC could recover $306.7 million at most, and that no damages were justified because numerous Colonial employees had interfered with its audits.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein ruled in July that PwC failed to identify a long-running fraud between the bank and its largest customer, the mortgage lender Taylor, Bean & Whitaker. Both failed in 2009, and the FDIC alleged the bank helped Taylor conceal overdrawn accounts.

""PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Receiver for Colonial Bank have settled professional negligence claims brought by the FDIC-R against PwC to their mutual satisfaction,"" PwC said in a statement.

Herbert Diess this week said ""EBIT macht Frei"" before apologizing for the comments and explaining he in no way wanted to draw a comparison to the Nazi-era slogan ""Arbeit Macht Frei"", which appeared on the gates of Auschwitz during the Holocaust.
EBIT refers to a company's earnings before interest and taxes.
""Experience at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) shows that brands with higher margins normally have greater freedom of choice within the Group. My statement referred to this fact,"" Diess, who made the remark at an internal meeting for employees, has said.
""At no time was it my intention for this statement to be placed in a false context.""
Volkswagen's supervisory board on Friday said the group's history and the responsibility is therefore bears was a major part of its corporate identity.
""The statement of the CEO Herbert Diess is in this context considered inappropriate and difficult to comprehend. The Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG strongly distances itself from this, but at the same time takes note of the immediate apology from Hr. Diess,"" it said.
Analysts at Bernstein said management change at Volkswagen had become a significant risk following the supervisory board's statement.
""For those looking for historic parallels, the last time anyone at VW used this language was in 2015, when Supervisory Board Chairman (Ferdinand) Piech said he was ""at a distance from"" (Martin) Winterkorn, the (then) CEO. Winterkorn was soon gone,"" they wrote.
Asked whether Bernstein analyst Max Warburton was right to suggest that Diess had lost support internally as a result of the remarks, Volkswagen's supervisory board said such an inference was inappropriate.

""This comparison is nonsense,"" a spokesman for Supervisory Board Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said on Friday.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>","Cash, demand concerns overshadow Tesla's SUV launch","(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc fell nearly 5 percent on Friday, as investors wondered if its unveiling of an electric sports utility vehicle would add to pressure on cash flow, while analysts worried the carmaker was not addressing slowing demand for other models.
Tesla, which introduced a cheap $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan last month and is struggling to convince backers its business model works, on Thursday launched the ""Model Y"" compact SUV - built on the same platform as the Model 3.
""It seems to be another distraction tactic presenting a new model and (to) divert from the problems with the other cars, the production and the profitability,"" NORD/LB analyst Frank Schwope said.
None of the 30 analysts who cover Tesla cut their price targets or recommendations for its shares, but the slightly bleak response to the new launch underlines the ambivalence of some on Wall Street to the company after months of legal wrangling and social media outbursts by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk. 
Some Wall Street analysts had raised concerns that demand for the higher-priced Model 3 was slowing down in the United States, especially after a reduction in the federal tax credit this year.
""We believe that Tesla's original business model for the production and profitability of the 'affordable' $35,000 version of the Model 3 is proving to be very difficult to achieve,"" ratings firm Moody's wrote in a research note.
The launch of the Model Y also reignited worries that Tesla would need to raise cash sooner than later.
Two Tesla analysts, both known as Tesla bulls - Gene Munster from Loup Ventures and Ivan Fienseth from Tigress Financial Partners - said the company would likely need to raise money later this year.
Cowen & Co's Jeffrey Osborne, who has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock, also agreed.
""We believe the event was more of a capital raising effort and branding exercise,"" Osborne said in a client note. ""We do not see the new Model Y igniting elevated demand or enthusiasm for the Tesla brand."" 
Tesla said it would debut a long-range Model Y next year with a range of 300 miles (482 km), priced at $47,000, as well as a standard version, priced at $39,000, in 2021.
Tesla has been cutting jobs and closing stores in a bid to make profits and expects a loss in the first quarter.

Shares of the company were down at $276.06 in afternoon trading.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald plans to expand its prime brokerage operations in Europe and has hired Sean Capstick in London to lead the efforts, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Capstick, most recently the London-based head of prime brokerage at Global Prime Partners, and formerly at hedge fund firm RWC, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), starts his role in May as head of European prime brokerage.
Capstick will report to global unit head Jon Yalmokas. 
Prime brokers provide a range of services to hedge funds such as financing trades, lending stocks and introducing them to potential investors.
The move follows the introduction a year ago of European Union rules that have led to large investment banks focusing on their larger hedge fund clients, creating space for Cantor and others to capture the business of smaller funds.
Separately, Cantor hired Michael Fitzgerald in New York as head of equity prime services origination, one of the sources said.
Fitzgerald's LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile confirmed he had started at the company in March and was most recently chief executive of the Digital Asset Custody Co. Prior to that he was chief operating officer at Ararat Capital.

""Some of these hearings have denied U.S. parties certain rights, including the opportunity to review and rebut the evidence against them,"" the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said in a statement. ""Denial of this fundamental right undermines their ability to defend themselves.""
The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) in December 2016 fined U.S. mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc over $900 million for what it called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales. The company has contested the ruling, but a USTR spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment on whether this case influenced the consultation request.
The United States and South Korea last year renegotiated some aspects of the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) to address U.S. complaints about the trade deal that was first implemented in 2012. But these changes were largely focused on the automotive sector to protect the U.S. truck market and provide U.S. automakers greater access to the South Korean market.

USTR said it was requesting consultations at this time because recently drafted amendments to Korea’s “Monopoly Regulations and Fair Trade Act” fail to address Washington's concerns that KFTC hearings continue to deny U.S. companies due process rights under the KORUS agreement.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss court will decide within weeks whether UBS must hand over historical client data to French tax authorities, a ruling that could open the door to fresh financial claims against Switzerland's banks. 
Although Switzerland exchanges bank account data on current clients with dozens of countries to crack down on cross-border tax cheats, court cases such as UBS's row with France over client tax avoidance are exposing potentially expensive legacy issues in Europe.
The Swiss supreme court's ruling could set a precedent whereby other Swiss banks have to hand over confidential historical data to foreign tax authorities that demand it. 
The case was triggered by lists of more than 10,000 UBS client account numbers that French tax authorities received from German colleagues after a search of the bank's local offices. 
France wanted names, birth dates and account balances to check whether the account holders had paid their taxes. Swiss tax authorities agreed but UBS fought the case in court. 
""It's quite clear that this ruling has implications beyond (UBS's) case and we don't know where it will end,"" said Daniel Buehr, a partner at law firm Lalive. 
Many other Swiss banks have for years also had active cross-border businesses with clients in France and other European countries which are now hunting down suspected tax evaders who hid money in Switzerland. 
ENTICING 
Separately, a French court last month found UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, guilty of illegally soliciting clients and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion, ordering it to pay 4.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in penalties. The bank has denied wrongdoing and is appealing the ruling, but has raised litigation provisions.
Legal experts say the huge fine slapped on UBS could entice other European countries to challenge the Swiss banks, especially if they are forced to hand over historic account data. 
Experts point to a similar case in which the supreme court last year granted assistance to German authorities seeking the owner of a Swiss bank account containing 83 million Swiss francs ($82.7 million).
The court ruled that knowing the account number was enough, saying it was not an improper fishing expedition - a key point in France's case.
If the supreme court rules that UBS has to supply client data to French tax authorities, it could give France new firepower in the dispute over whether the bank aided tax evasion. 
UBS is also under investigation in Belgium and Italian authorities have asked Swiss banks for information about their business there. https://reut.rs/2JbKMI2
""For governments that want to spice up their treasury, this is certainly an interesting option,"" said one senior Swiss official.
The case has echoes of when U.S. tax authorities asked UBS for information on the accounts of U.S. clients in 2008. 

It eventually complied, triggering extensive investigations of other Swiss banks suspected of helping Americans hide their wealth. UBS eventually settled for $780 million, while payments from all the Swiss banks snared in the probe ran into the billions.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google is likely to be hit with a third EU antitrust fine next week related to its AdSense advertising service, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday, with the sanction expected to be much smaller than previous fines.
The European Commission in 2016 opened a third case against the world's most popular internet search engine by accusing Google of preventing third parties using its AdSense product from displaying search advertisements from Google's competitors.
It said that Google, which at that time had held 80 percent of the European market for search advertising intermediation over the previous ten years, had kept its anti-competitive practices for a decade. 
In response, Google changed the conditions in its AdSense contracts with large third parties, giving them more leeway to display competing search ads.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager earlier this month told reporters that she was finalizing the case.
The Commission on Friday declined to comment on the timing of the AdSense decision. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Financial Times earlier reported on next week's European Union antitrust fine.
Last year, Vestager slapped a record 4.34 billion euro ($4.91 billion) fine on Google for using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals. 
That following a 2.4 billion euro fine imposed on the company in 2017 for blocking rivals of shopping comparison websites.
The AdSense case may not be end of Google's EU antitrust woes.
EU antitrust enforcers have asked Google's rivals if it unfairly demotes local search competitors, according to a questionnaire seen by Reuters, a move which could lead to a fourth case. 
Online mapping services and others could also soon be in the spotlight.

Including pensions and perks, Hackett made $17.7 million. The company said Hackett, who took the helm of the No. 2 U.S. automaker in May 2017, made 276 times the median total compensation of all Ford employees of $64,316.

1036,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>","Markets ‘Misinterpreting’ Fed, Warns Manager Shunning Treasuries","(Bloomberg) -- In a world calling for investors to load up on U.S. Treasuries, this money manager is going the other way.
 Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Management’s Andrew Szczurowski, whose government bond fund has outperformed 97 percent of peers in the past three years, is underweight duration as he isn’t buying into the widely prevalent market view that the Federal Reserve is done hiking interest rates for now. For him, factors supporting U.S. government bonds, such as trade wars and disappointing data, should start to fade in the second half of this year.
“In Treasuries, I just don’t think there’s any value,” said Boston-based Szczurowski, whose firm has $493 billion under management. “The market is misinterpreting the Fed a little bit and I personally don’t think the Fed’s done hiking.”
Speculators have been moving away from the record positions seen last year betting against Treasuries as the Fed shifted toward more dovish rhetoric. Market pricing has wiped out the prospect of any rate hikes this year and is now even signaling a cut in 2020, prompting BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). to recommend buying U.S. sovereign bonds.
Szczurowski predicts the Fed could instead lift interest rates once or even twice this year and then “three more for the cycle itself,” adding that “it’s not unreasonable” for two-year Treasury yields to climb back toward 3 percent by the end of this year.
The yield was at 2.46 percent as of 8:00 a.m. in New York Friday. Only 12 of 49 forecasters in a Bloomberg bond yield survey see two-year Treasury yields climbing to or above 3 percent by the end of 2019. Szczurowski is investing in U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, which he said can outperform Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities or TIPS.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Friday after a report that U.S.-China trade talks were making progress and a vote by UK lawmakers to delay Britain's exit from the European Union.
European stocks markets opened higher, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index reaching its highest since October. Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 index outperformed, boosted by growing expectations Britain will not leave the EU on March 29 without a deal. 
S&P 500 futures also gained, indicating stocks would open higher on Wall Street. 
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by telephone with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lightizer, and the two sides made substantive progress on trade, the news agency Xinhua reported.
Investor sentiment on trade has see-sawed on rumblings coming out of the ongoing negotiations between the world's two biggest economies, which have both slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on each other.
Only on Thursday, Mnuchin said a summit to seal a trade deal between U.S. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will not happen at the end of March as previously discussed because more work is needed in the negotiations.
""There are still quite a lot of moving parts (to Brexit)...The markets have reacted purely to the rhetoric (on trade talks) and no action,"" said deputy chief investment officer Edward Park, at asset manager Brooks MacDonald.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan gained over half a percent.
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent on the day and was set for its best week since early January. 
The Shanghai Composite Index added 1 percent and Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.8 percent.
South Korea's KOSPI rose nearly 1 percent. The index had risen as much as 1.2 percent but gave up some gains following reports that North Korea might suspend nuclear talks with the United States.
Comments from Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also helped sentiment. His remarks suggested Beijing is ready to roll out more forceful stimulus to bolster China's economy.
China has so far promised billions in tax cuts and infrastructure spending, as weakening domestic demand and the trade war with the United States curbs economic growth.
European stocks rose to a five-month high after Britain's parliamentary vote on Brexit. The pound was flat on the day at $1.3247. 
""We view the overall outcome of this week’s votes ... as positive for UK assets,"" strategists at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) wrote in a research note. ""Indeed, the pound has risen by 2 percent on the week. Yet, while most of the routes ahead now look net positive, we still expect a bumpy path.""
Elsewhere in currencies, the dollar index slipped 0.1 percent to 96.670 after rising 0.25 percent on Thursday to recover from a nine-day trough of 96.385.
The U.S. currency was flat at 111.70 yen. It had dipped to 111.49 yen after the Bank of Japan left interest rates unchanged.
The central bank offered a bleaker assessment of exports and output, as global demand waned. Observers said, that it may be too early to expect the BOJ to ease policy further.
The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1315 after slipping 0.2 percent overnight.
In commodities, U.S. crude futures briefly hit a 2019 high but later retreated along with benchmark Brent oil as worries about the global economy and robust U.S. production put a brake on prices. 

Brent was down nearly 1 percent at $66.60 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil fell half a percent to $58.3 per barrel.

Torres also said his predecessor Francisco Gonzalez, who on Thursday stepped down as BBVA's honorary chairman while awaiting the results of the inquiry, and the bank will cooperate with judicial authorities investigating the case. 
""In relation to the case, BBVA will continue investigating rigorously, also actively collaborating with judicial authorities to clarify the facts,"" Torres said.
The case is not officially on the agenda of the shareholders meeting in Bilbao, but the Spanish Association of Minority Shareholders (AEMEC) expect investors to voice their concerns over the potential reputational damage to the bank.
The inquiry relates to jailed ex-police chief, Jose Manuel Villarejo, who news reports say the bank hired to spy on top executives of a potential buyer, construction company Sacyr, in 2004 when Gonzalez was BBVA's executive chairman. 
BBVA has acknowledged that it hired Grupo Cenyt, a security firm owned by Villarejo who was arrested in 2017, as part of a separate investigation.
Torres, who replaced Gonzalez as executive chairman in January, has so far said that Cenyt provided various services to BBVA, but that the bank had found no evidence of spying.
The case was first reported in mid-2018 and was recognized by the bank in January after Torres sent a letter to staff addressing the allegations.

BBVA shares were up 1.3 percent at 1255 GMT, bringing their gains so far this year to 15 percent and outperforming other Spanish and European banks.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 07:52AM ET</span>",Swedbank report showed $10 billion 'suspicious' Baltic payments: Swedish TV,"By Esha Vaish and Johannes Hellstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - An internal Swedbank report in September detailed ""suspicious"" transactions totaling around $10 billion between customers of Swedbank and Danske Bank in the Baltics from 2007 to 2015, Swedish state television SVT reported.
Swedbank said on Friday the figure reported by SVT was the gross amount of transactions with Denmark's Danske Bank identified in its initial review and it had acted on any suspicious activity, including reporting customers to police.
SVT said the report, which Reuters has not seen, showed a large number of suspicious clients had moved 3.2 billion euros ($3.6 billion) and $6.7 billion between the two banks, more than double the number SVT had previously identified.
Several European and overseas banks have been dragged into the Danske Bank scandal, which centers on suspicious transactions of 200 billion euros that originated in Russia and elsewhere and flowed through its Estonia branch in 2007-2015.
""As we have repeated many times, we act on different signals. Therefore, it was natural for us to act when the disclosures about Danske Bank came out on the market,"" Swedbank CEO Birgitte Bonnesen said in a statement.
""In the analysis last year, we looked at both current and former customers in the Baltic countries... In many cases, there was no need to act further, but in some cases we proceeded with, among other things, reports to the finance police,"" she said.
Swedbank shares, which have lost more than 16 percent since an SVT report on Feb. 20 tied it to at least 40 billion Swedish crowns ($4.3 billion) of suspicious transactions with Danske Bank, were down 0.6 percent at 175.05 crowns at 1129 GMT.
FOUR-WAY PROBE
Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) said it had received a report from Swedbank on March 1 about suspected money laundering, which it was including in an ongoing probe.
The regulator, known as FI in Sweden, said in February it was conducting a joint investigation with the Estonian financial watchdog and reaching out to Latvia and Lithuania. On Friday, it said a four-way investigation was now underway. 
""The report is one of several data that will be included in the joint investigation conducted by FI with the three Baltic regulatory authorities,"" it said in a statement.
Danske Bank and the Estonian watchdog declined to comment. Regulators in Lithuania and Latvia could not immediately be reached for comment.
Swedbank is under pressure from some of its biggest shareholders to reveal more about what it knew about the allegations. The bank hired external auditors FRA to look into the original SVT report after investor demands.
""For more meaningful details we'll need to wait for the findings of the FRA report pre-AGM and to see the scope of the Swedish FSA review,"" said KBW analysts, who have a ""market perform"" rating and 200 crowns target price on Swedbank.
Ramsay Brufer, head of corporate governance at Alecta, the bank's third largest investor, said he assumed Swedbank had passed the internal report to FRA for its review. Swedbank did not reply to a Reuters' request for comment. 
In its statement, Swedbank said its internal report covered an in-depth analysis of about 2,000 customers throughout the Baltic countries. 
The bank, which has 900,000 private and 130,000 corporate customers in Estonia, also said that based on last year's transactions flagged by its anti-money laundering systems, it had made four notifications per day to Estonia's finance police.
Swedbank has declined to comment on the data in the original SVT report and a criminal complaint by Bill Browder, an investor who campaigns to expose corruption, saying it cannot comment on details due to Swedish banking secrecy laws.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Honda says any Brexit delay must be long enough to give stability,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Honda said any delay to Brexit must be long enough to give businesses stability whilst BMW is still preparing for a ""worst-case scenario"" no-deal Brexit after lawmakers backed postponing Britain's exit from the EU. 
The country's car sector, which employs more than 850,000 people, has quickly gone from a manufacturing success story to posting drops in investment, sales and output. 
Honda, which builds just over 10 percent of Britain's 1.5 million cars, announced earlier this year that it would close its factory, in the biggest blow to the sector in many years, but said the decision was not due to Brexit. 
Adding to uncertainty for companies, British lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to seek a delay to Brexit, which had been due on March 29. 
""We are now looking to the government to deliver a clear, legally certain, path forward to avoid no deal,"" said a Honda spokesman. 
""Any extension ... must be purposeful and long enough to give business stability."" 
Since Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union, companies have been triggering a series of contingency plans to help prepare for any loss of free and unfettered trade with the car industry's biggest export market.
Honda, BMW's Mini and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) brands and Jaguar Land Rover - together accounting for around 55 percent of UK car output - all plan to shut their factories in April from between a week to up to a month in case of any disruption from a no-deal Brexit.
A delay would ruin such plans as shutdowns are generally organized months in advance so employee holidays can be scheduled and suppliers can adjust volumes.
BMW, which builds over 15 percent of Britain's car output at its Mini and Rolls-Royce factories alongside more than 375,000 engines at its central English Hams Hall facility, said it was continuing to ready itself in case of a no-deal Brexit or delay. 
""Preparations cover all key areas of our business including manufacturing, sales ... customs processes, IT and logistics,"" the firm said. 
Earlier this month BMW said it could move some output out of Britain if the country does not secure an orderly departure from the European Union, and again called for clarity on Friday. 

""The BMW Group therefore continues to appeal to all sides to achieve long-term planning security, maintaining the frictionless free-trade on which our production and sales operations are based.""

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>","Wall Street weekahead: U.S. funds focus on media stocks, banks to find value as mid-caps rally","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 400 Mid-Cap index has surged to its best start to a year since 1991, both rewarding fund managers and forcing them to work harder to seek out bargains in a group that is now the most expensive part of the U.S. market based on their historical averages. 
The rally in mid-cap stocks - companies with a market valuation between $2 billion and $10 billion - has come during a broad rally in global stock markets as investors price in a resolution in the trade talks between the United States and China and fewer interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. 
Mid-caps are up 14 percent for the year to date and sport an average price-to-earnings ratio of 16.9 times forward earnings, for their highest valuation premiums to small-cap stocks since 2017, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) research. 
Yet fund managers from Janus Henderson, Hotchkis & Wiley, and Fairpointe Capital are among those who are still finding values by concentrating on financial, energy and media stocks and eschewing the high-priced real estate investment trusts and utility companies that make up nearly a fifth of the benchmark index. 
""The window for the big bargain bin was the fourth quarter and that was about it,"" said Kevin Preloger, a portfolio manager of the $3.3 billion Janus Henderson Mid Cap Value fund. ""We're looking for companies that have good balance sheets and good cash flow, but the tough part is reasonable valuations.""
Preloger's fund is finding them in financial companies such as M&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB) and Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG) Inc that are increasing their stock buybacks at the same time they have been beating analysts' earnings expectations. Shares of M&T, for instance, are up 20.8 percent since the start of the year and trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.8.
""Financials are the cheapest sector in the space, and their earnings are also growing,"" Preloger said. 
Stanley Majcher, a portfolio manager of the $1.4 billion Hotchkis & Wiley Mid-Cap Value fund, is buying into overlooked financial and energy stocks because he considers them less risky than utility companies or REITs with higher valuations. 
""Energy is very out of favor and there's a perception that it's a risky business because oil prices are likely to be low for a long period of time because of the market share war between OPEC and the U.S.,"" he said. ""But we see low volatility of demand and more discipline on the supply side."" 
Among its largest holdings, Majcher's fund has several energy companies, including Whiting Petroleum Corp, Kosmos Energy Ltd and  Ophir Energy  (LON:OPHR) PLC, according to Morningstar data, with mixed results for the year to date. Shares of Whiting are up 12.4 percent year-to-date, while shares of Ophir are up nearly 53 percent over the same time. 
Thyra Zerhusen, a portfolio manager of the $2.6 billion AMG Managers Fairpointe Mid Cap fund, said her fund is finding opportunities in media stocks such as broadcast company Tegna Inc, which was spun off of Gannett Co, magazine and local broadcasting company Meredith Corp, and New York Times Co, all of which should see a significant boost in revenues from the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, she said. 
""With everybody running for president, the political advertising goes to these smaller market stations. Newspapers are almost non-existent now,"" except for the New York Times, which continues to grow its digital subscriptions, she said. 
She is also adding opportunistic positions in companies such as Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp, which completed its merger with the transportation unit of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Feb. 25. Shares of the company are up 2.9 percent year-to-date, and remain 35 percent below where they were trading six months ago. 

""We're trying to add stocks where there may be a short-term problem hitting the share price but the long-term outlook looks okay,"" she said.

1045,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 06:34AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Some lessors to end deals with Jet, prepare to fly planes out of India - sources","By Aditi Shah and Anshuman Daga
NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some lessors of India's Jet Airways have begun terminating lease deals over unpaid dues and are preparing to move the leased planes abroad, escalating a crisis for the cash-strapped carrier, five sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Two lessors have applied to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), India's aviation regulator, to deregister at least five planes leased to Jet, three of the sources said. Termination of lease agreements normally precedes applications made to the DGCA.
Jet has delayed payments to its pilots, suppliers and lessors for months and defaulted on loans after racking up over $1 billion in debt. While it is now meeting some of its payments, it's survival hinges on emergency funding from the country's main state-backed banks.
Frustrated by the unpaid dues, Jet's lessors, including many of the world's biggest players such as GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), Aercap Holdings and BOC Aviation have already taken control of some their planes, sources said, leading to the grounding of nearly a third of its 119 aircraft fleet.
Once the planes are deregistered, they can be taken out of the country and leased to other airlines.
One of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said that of the planes being deregistered, two are potentially being flown to China and one to Ireland.
Another industry source said GECAS and Aercap had filed an application to deregister a total of five planes.
Lease terminations could hit the already fragile confidence of business partners of Jet. 
Jet did not respond to requests for comment. AerCap declined to comment and there was no immediate response from GECAS to a query sent outside normal business hours.
All the sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Founder chairman Naresh Goyal, who transformed Jet to India's biggest full-service carrier from its humble start 25 years ago, has said it is thrashing out a bailout plan, led by the state-run banks and Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways.
Before the groundings, Jet controlled over a sixth of the market, capitalizing on a boom in flying. But high fuel taxes, a weak rupee and ultra-low fares have hurt profitability.
Jet's financial troubles have rekindled memories of  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines' collapse in 2012 that forced lessors to write off millions of dollars.
Last week, FLY Leasing Ltd said it had grounded three planes on lease to Jet and would take them back and reallocate them elsewhere if the airline failed to get approvals for its restructuring plan this month.
Jet has been forced to cancel hundreds of flights and irate passengers have turned to social media platforms to express their outrage.
REPOSSESSION STILL TOUGH
After Kingfisher Airlines' disorderly collapse in 2012, India modified rules in line with the Cape Town convention, an international treaty that makes it easier for foreign lessors to repossess aircraft during payment defaults.
India said last year it was seeking to revise some local laws, which still conflicted with the full implementation of the convention making it a more complicated process in India than in some other countries.
In theory, lessors have the option of filing a complaint with the government, which in turn can cancel the registration of a plane within five working days, allowing lessors to repossess it subject to certain conditions, including unpaid dues. However, this is often a long process.
According to a government notice issued in November, after any application is filed, all airport operators and other private entities, within five days, need to inform the lessor and DGCA of pending dues related to that aircraft for three months preceding the date of deregistration.
Only after these are cleared, the lessor is allowed to fly the aircraft out of India.
On March 11, DGCA clarified that some of the entities included airports, fuel vendors, tax authorities and customs departments, a move that could further complicate reposessions.

Akshay Nagpal, partner at law firm L&L Partners, said that while this notice is aimed at asking the government and other agencies to be more vigilant in seeking their dues, ""one cannot rule out lessors viewing this as a step back from their long-time demand of making repossession easier.""

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 06:15AM ET</span>",Mutual funds start to put their mouth where their money is,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Corporate America's biggest shareholders have traditionally been content with sharing their views on a company's strategy privately with management.
But now some mutual funds are beginning to rethink their stance, amid pressure from investors for them to justify the fees they charge and a push to boost the performance of their holdings.
Wellington Management Company LLP's decision last month to speak out against drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co's proposed $74 billion acquisition of  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG), calling what would be the largest-ever pharmaceutical takeover too risky and expensive, sent ripples across the investment world.
This is because these tactics have typically been the purview of activist hedge funds like Starboard Value LP and Elliott Management Corp, not a large institutional money manager like Wellington, with $1 trillion in assets under management.
But in the case of Bristol-Myers, Starboard spoke out publicly against the deal one day after Wellington unveiled its stance publicly. 
Wellington's vocal opposition to the deal is the culmination of some mutual funds gradually feeling more emboldened to publicly challenge a company's strategy, asset management executives and corporate governance experts say.
""There has been a growing chorus among investors who want these firms to speak up. With Wellington speaking up, it is going to put pressure on the others to do the same,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors, which invests with Wellington funds. 
In January, chemicals company Ashland Global Holdings Inc agreed to changes to its board after pressure from asset manager Neuberger Berman Group LLC, which has about $300 billion in assets under management.
T. Rowe Price Group Inc, which manages close to $1 trillion in assets, has opposed several acquisitions, including Michael Dell's offer to take his eponymous computer maker private, because it felt the proposed deal undervalued the company.
Spurring on these funds to challenge companies publicly is the need to show their worth as so-called active money managers, picking stocks rather than just betting on indexes. 
At a time their performance has been lackluster and many have struggled to keep up with their benchmark index, they are under pressure from index-tracking funds who are gaining more market share in asset management. These ""passive"" money managers charge investors far less, in part because they do not need the army of analysts and portfolio managers to make investments.
""More funds are willing to agitate in search of returns,"" Mark Shafir,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Inc's co-head of global mergers and acquisitions, said on Thursday at the corporate law institute conference organized in New Orleans by the Tulane School of Law.
RAMPING UP PRESSURE
Despite their deep pockets, taking a public stance on corporate strategy does not come easily to many of these funds, in part because they are unaccustomed to readying the kind of presentations aimed at swaying other shareholders.
For example, Wellington's statement on Bristol-Myers Squibb's Celgene deal was just four sentences long. By contrast, Bristol-Myers published a 46-page document defending its deal. 
The world's biggest active mutual fund managers, including Fidelity Investments and Capital Group, have preferred to use their influence discretely, taking advantage of their access to management to gain insight into a company's strategy and offer feedback behind closed doors.
To stay on good terms with corporate management, large mutual funds have often been happy letting activist hedge funds agitate over a company's perceived problems.
To be sure, even passive investors have started to pressure companies behind the scenes, especially on social, governance or climate change issues that a younger generation of investors cares more about.
For example, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group voted against management at oil major  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) in 2017 over its reluctance to disclose the risks it faced from climate change, and pressured weapons manufacturer Sturm Ruger last year over its refusal to publish a report about the safety of its products. 

""Corporate America had better take note because the folks who actually pick stocks have finally decided to flex their muscles,"" wrote Don Bilson, head of Event Driven Research at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.

An index of global stocks is up more than 16 percent since the end of 2018 as falling market volatility and a renewed dovishness from global central banks, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve has boosted risk appetite across the board.
BAML said most of the inflows went into exchange traded funds while mutual funds saw net outflows.
U.S. equity funds were the biggest beneficiaries with net inflows of $25.5 billion while emerging markets saw net outflows.
European funds also saw $4.6 billion of outflows after the European Central Bank slashed its growth forecasts and signaled a cautious economic outlook at its latest policy meeting.
The appetite for risk spilled over into bond markets as well with investment grade debt notching up the eighth consecutive week of inflows.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 05:35AM ET</span>","SEC sues Volkswagen, ex-CEO over alleged emissions fraud on investors","By David Shepardson and Edward Taylor
WASHINGTON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) (VW) and its former chief executive Martin Winterkorn over the German automaker's diesel emissions scandal, alleging a ""massive fraud"" on U.S. investors.
VW was caught using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global backlash against diesel that and has so far cost it 29 billion euros ($32.8 billion).
Regulators and investors argue VW should have informed them sooner about the scope of the scandal, while VW says it was not clear it would face billions of dollars in fines and penalties as others had paid out much lower sums for similar offences. 
The SEC said in its civil complaint on Thursday that from April 2014 to May 2015, VW issued more than $13 billion in bonds and asset-backed securities in U.S. markets at a time when senior executives knew that more than 500,000 U.S. diesel vehicles grossly exceeded legal vehicle emissions limits.
VW ""reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in benefit by issuing the securities at more attractive rates for the company,"" the SEC said, adding it ""repeatedly lied to and misled United States investors, consumers, and regulators as part of an illegal scheme to sell its purportedly 'clean diesel' cars and billions of dollars of corporate bonds and other securities in the United States.""
The suit filed in San Francisco seeks to bar Winterkorn from serving as an officer or director of a public U.S. company and recover ""ill-gotten gains"" along with civil penalties and interest.
Winterkorn, who resigned days after the scandal became public in September 2015, was charged by U.S. prosecutors in 2018 and accused of conspiring to cover up the German automaker's diesel emissions cheating. 
A lawyer for Winterkorn, who remains in Germany, declined to comment on the SEC action. 
VW said in a statement the SEC complaint ""is legally and factually flawed, and Volkswagen will contest it vigorously. The SEC has brought an unprecedented complaint over securities sold only to sophisticated investors who were not harmed and received all payments of interest and principal in full and on time.""
The automaker added that the SEC ""does not charge that any person involved in the bond issuance knew that Volkswagen diesel vehicles did not comply with U.S. emissions rules when these securities were sold"" but repeats claims about Winterkorn ""who played no part in the sales"".
German markets regulator Bafin could not be reached for comment about whether it was working with the SEC. 
""FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINED""
VW has spent billions to pay claims from United States-based VW owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, and has offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. That figure included $4.3 billion in U.S. criminal and civil fines.
But the SEC said VW ""has never repaid the hundreds of millions of dollars in benefit it fraudulently obtained.""
VW admitted to secretly installing software in 500,000 U.S. vehicles to cheat government exhaust emissions tests and pleaded guilty in 2017 to felony charges. 13 people have been charged in the United States, including Winterkorn and four Audi managers.
The SEC suit also names VW's VW Credit and Volkswagen Group of America Finance LLC, the entity used to sell the securities.
VW also faces investor lawsuits in Braunschweig, Germany.
Critics argue that VW should have informed investors on September 3, 2015 about having used a ""defeat device"" to cheat emissions tests, the same day that VW managers admitted to using illegal software to U.S. regulators. 
Investors were informed about VW's diesel cheating after U.S. regulators blew the whistle on September 18, 2015.
VW argues it did not have to inform investors earlier because it did not believe it was facing significant fines. 
VW's management had sought to strike a deal with U.S. regulators behind closed doors, a process that would lead costs to be ""controllable overall with a view to the business activities of Volkswagen Group,"" a VW document showed.
A defense filing made with the Braunschweig court says VW’s chief financial officer was informed that there was a potential problem with United States authorities on September 14, 2015. 
At the time, VW believed it could fix polluting vehicles with a software update and gauged the potential financial risk to be around 150 million euros, the Braunschweig document shows.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>","China investors catch option fever, prompting regulator warnings","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A rally that has made China's stock market the world's best-performing this year has fed a rush of leveraged bets in the country's stock options market, prompting regulators to warn investors of rising risks.
Growing interest in China's equity option market came after a contract soared as much as 19,267 percent in a single session last month. 
Data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange shows that the number of open contract positions in the ChinaAMC 50 ETF exceeded 3 million for the first time on record this week as investors hope to take advantage of the equity bull run to land huge profits.
An option gives investors the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a set price on a specific date. The ChinaAMC 50 ETF tracks the SSE (LON:SSE) 50 index, dubbed China's ""nifty fifty index"", which has risen more than 20 percent this year.
Interest has been concentrated in a call option expiring March 27 that gives investors the right to buy the ETF at 3 yuan ($0.4467), in effect a bet that the ETF will jump at least an additional 9.5 percent this month from its closing price of 2.74 yuan on Friday.
If the ETF does not reach the option's strike price of 3 yuan by the expiry date, the option will be rendered worthless.
Zhang Yi, an options analyst at Everbright Futures Co Ltd, said that a buoyant stock market has driven investor hopes of making a quick fortune.
""Some investors are jumping into the options market, without understanding the basics of this instrument, such as what the time value of an option is.""
The speculation has prompted a warning from the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
In a statement on March 8, the exchange noted large volumes, open positions, and price fluctuations on option contracts, and warned investors of the risk that the time value of the option would rapidly diminish ahead of its expiry.
The price of the 3 yuan call option expiring March 27 plunged more than 22 percent on Friday to 0.0052 yuan.
Despite the recent frenzy, Zhang said the words of caution from regulators and stringent risk-management rules in place mean that that there is little risk of a dangerous option bubble.
""China's option market is still small, and has huge potential to grow, as there's huge demand for this tool for risk-management,"" he said.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is gearing up to skewer companies it accuses of treating consumers badly in a yearly event that has previously named and shamed firms from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE). 
The state-run China Central Television (CCTV) will on Friday evening broadcast its annual consumer rights show, similar to CBS network's ""60 Minutes"" in the United States, that tends to be a mix of undercover reports and song-and-dance routine.
Known as ""315"", in reference to global consumer rights day on March 15, the show is usually greeted with trepidation by local and foreign brands, that have, in recent years, set up public relation teams in advance or handed out freebies around the day to take the edge off any possible criticism.
""This is the one day of the year that all eyes are focused on the consumer issue,"" said James Feldkamp, Shanghai-based CEO of consumer research and testing firm MingJian. 
""Some people may say it is losing its bite then suddenly it will have a big scandal that will have a big impact.""
This year, the show will grab more attention as it comes at a time when Beijing is locked in a trade war with the United States and has heavily criticized Canada over its decision to detain the CFO of Huawei Technologies on U.S. request.
Beijing has also continued to be critical of how companies, mainly international brands, refer to Taiwan in their marketing material or product package. Beijing considers the self-ruled, democratic island a wayward province.
Names of companies that will be targeted in CCTV's consumer rights show are not disclosed ahead of the broadcast. 
In fact, to maintain secrecy, people on the show have to sign a non-disclosure agreement, while producers are kept in a hotel and not allowed to go home a couple of months ahead of the screening, according to a former ""315"" executive.
It is unclear whether the show has had an impact on company sales, but it has drawn apologies from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), whose engine defects in the Touareg SUV it criticized last year, as well as from Apple, whose China after-sales service it scrutinized in 2013. 
CCTV did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. 
Thanks to the fast-expanding middle class in the world's second-largest economy, its consumers have become a powerful spending force with the ability to make or break brands. 
Companies are willing to do anything to avoid being named, the former ""315"" executive said, on condition of anonymity as he was not allowed to speak about the show to media. 
The show, first broadcast in 1991, has its own limitations on what can be exposed, the executive added.
Normally food-safety issues that could trigger public fear, giant state-owned enterprise or Chinese medicine firms are off limits, the person told Reuters. 

""We are all staying on alert,"" said a public relations officer at a major Chinese consumer tech brand.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.1 percent at 0826 GMT, piercing the Oct. 5 high set on Thursday and on track for its biggest weekly gain in a month.
All the major bourses were in positive territory, although London's FTSE 100 outperformed the pack, lifted by its heavyweight oil and mining stocks on higher metals and crude prices. Trade-sensitive DAX was up 0.1 percent.
The mood was also boosted by growing expectations that Britain will not leave the European Union without a deal on March 29 following Thursday night's parliamentary vote.
Technology stocks were the biggest gainers, up 0.6 percent, after better-than-expected results from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) overnight and boosted by hopes that Washington and Beijing will resolve their trade spat that has rattled financial markets.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by telephone with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, with the two sides making further substantive progress on trade talks, Xinhua news agency said on Friday.
The prospect of the trade talks taking longer than expected tempered some of the gains, and there was still no clarity on how close the two economic powers are on reaching an agreement.
Among individual moves, shares were driven by legal dramas.
UBS was down 1.3 percent after Switzerland's top bank said it is bulking up its litigation provisions to deal with a French court slapped it with a hefty penalty last month.
Swedbank dropped 1.9 percent as the Danske Bank moneylaundering scandal deepens.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets look set to close the week on a positive note, opening Friday broadly higher after Chinese media reports encouraged hopes of an early end to the country’s trade war with the U.S.
The two sides had contradicted each other’s spin overnight: Chinese reports had claimed “substantial progress” in talks with the U.S., according to Reuters. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that a summit between the two countries’ presidents would not take place before April at the earliest, pointing to the size of remaining obstacles to a deal.
Europe seems to have chosen to give the Chinese version more weight.
At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.40 points, or 0.1% at 378.92 – a rise of over 2.1% this week. Germany’s Dax was up 0.2%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.4%. Among the leaders are oil and gas stocks, with crude prices hovering close to 2019 highs after the International Energy Agency forecast the oil market could be in deficit in the second quarter.
The positive tone is also partly due to continued optimism that the most destructive Brexit  scenarios can be avoided, even though the week's events in London appear to have prolonged uncertainty over the final outcome.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) shares were down 0.6% after the company disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had charged its former CEO Martin Winterkorn with securities fraud – the first charges to be brought against Winterkorn personally since the Dieselgate crisis exploded in 2015. The charges allege that VW knew about its problem with excessive emissions while issuing billions of dollars in bonds between 2014 and 2015.
Also in Germany, payments company Wirecard (DE:WDIG)is down 7.2% after reports suggesting that Singaporean authorities have widened their investigations into possible fraudulent accounting to the company’s Indian unit. The company said Thursday it had exonerated an employee at the heart of the investigation, although he remains suspended pending the completion of an external probe by a local law firm.
Elsewhere, Swiss banking giant UBS Group (SIX:UBSG) fell to the bottom of the local Swiss market after putting aside nearly $400 million in respect of the 4.5 billion euro fine it received last month in France for helping clients to avoid tax. The bank is appealing the ruling and says it would release the provision if its appeal is successful.
And finally – later Friday there will be the draw for the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League. That should get a reaction from the stocks of Juventus (MI:JUVE)and Ajax (AS:AJAX)."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Heartened by signs of an end to a long-running trade war with the United States and monetary easing at home, China's stock indices have vaulted by a fifth since the beginning of this year and recovered a big chunk of 2018's losses.
The Shanghai stock index scaled the 3,000 mark for the first time since June this month. The rally has been characterized by heavy retail participation, rising foreign flows into the country and soaring turnover.
Here are some of the salient features of this rally:
China has outperformed its Asian peers and most other global stock markets this year. 
Beijing's efforts to support an economy growing at its slowest pace in 28 years, through tax cuts and government spending, are widely seen as the critical factor behind the recent run-up.
On top of that, the United States and China are possibly in the final weeks of discussions to hammer out a deal to ease their tit-for-tat tariffs dispute.

(For a graphic on 'Chinese stocks rise amid yuan appreciation' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2OayIG5)
The rally has been dominated by mid-cap firms. Shares in Eastern Communications have seen a jaw-dropping 752 percent gain since late November amid speculation the company would be a beneficiary from China's 5G tech push, even as the firm repeatedly clarified it has no revenue whatsoever from 5G business.
(For a graphic on 'China bulls charging to record highs' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2CmEP5d)
Trading volumes have jumped while investor confidence has been picking up. The number of Chinese stock investors had climbed to 147.5 million in January 2019, while market turnover soared to 2015 highs. Retail investors accounted for 99.6 percent of total investors.

(For a graphic on 'China's A-share market daily turnover soared' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Uze0BV)
Private equity funds have become one of the driving forces behind the rally. Their average equity exposure stood at 72 percent in March 2019, its highest since at least late 2017, showed data from Simuwang.com, an industry website. 
(For a graphic on 'Chinese private equity funds hiked their equity exposure levels' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2UyNGYH)
Mutual funds are joining the party too, looking for better returns in stocks. According to the data from China Securities Regulatory Commission, the number of equity mutual funds in China had been steadily increasing in the four quarters of 2018, while their fund shares and net asset value were also on a rising trend. 
(For a graphic on 'Shares of equity mutual funds climbed through Q4 2018' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2FbaGb4)
The cheapness of China's shares, despite the rally, is part of the appeal. The SSEC currently trades at 12.6 times earnings, compared with an earning multiple of roughly 18 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
(For a graphic on 'China stocks low valuations appeal to investors' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2FatCqd)
Foreign investors have splurged hundreds of billions of yuan snapping up A-shares, particularly after China promised more access for them by combining two inbound investment schemes. 
The wall of money rushing in even forced global index provider MSCI to take off a stock from its index. MSCI said it would remove Han's Laser Technology from its China indexes and slash the weighting of Midea Group Co, citing issues triggered by foreign ownership ceilings. 
The ownership limit could become a bigger headache for overseas investors buying Chinese stocks, especially small- and mid-caps.

Even pigs are ""flying"".
Alongside the speculative frenzy that has seen many small cap stocks hitting fresh highs, shares in China's leading pig producers have soared to record levels despite the industry facing one of its worst disease outbreaks in years, as investors bet on tightening pork supplies and strong government support for leading producers. 
As of Tuesday, Wens Foodstuff Group, the biggest start-up firm and mainland China's top hog farmer, had surged more than 60 percent since the end of the Lunar New Year holiday.

Retail borrowing to speculate in stocks is also back with a vengeance as regulators shift their focus back to growth after a lengthy clampdown on riskier types of financing. 
Some investors have even turned to the gray market for financing as they tried to maximize their gains in the rally, although China's securities watchdog is gradually tightening its scrutiny over this form of shadow lending.

Local-currency sales including VAT in the December-February period rose 4 percent from a year earlier, in line with the mean forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
That was the third straight quarter with rising local-currency sales. 
H&M, whose main rival is market leader  Inditex  (MC:ITX), said in a statement net sales excluding VAT were up 10 percent to 51.0 billion crowns ($5.49 billion) versus expectations for an 8.0 percent rise to 49.9 billion. 
H&M, which is due to publish its full first-quarter earnings report on March 29, did not comment on the figures.
H&M has seen profits shrink and inventories bank up in recent years due to slowing footfall at its core brand's stores in the face of a shift online and mounting competition, as well as difficulties in reacting fast enough to demand swings.
H&M is investing heavily in logistics, digital technology and store concepts, and is reviewing its mix of stores and brands, but analysts have not been convinced the company is back on track.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's embattled Jet Airways put photographs of smiling women employees on social media last week for Women's Day, using the tagline ""Standing tall; touching the skies"" but few passengers reacted cheerfully. 
""'Touching the skies' is a good joke at a time when your flights are getting grounded,"" said a respondent on Twitter, while others expressed anger and dismay at cancellations, delays in refunds and long response times to telephone calls.
India's second-largest carrier, grappling with debt of more than $1 billion, Jet has delayed payments to banks, lessors, vendors and staff. Lessors have grounded more than three dozen planes, forcing hundreds of flights to be canceled.
Rising customer frustration could bring further disruption for the 25-year-old airline, as some flyers backed a boycott, while others blamed cancellations for ruining their plans.
""We had to worry about rebooking flights during our wedding, when there is already so much to do,"" said Siddhant Agarwal, a 32-year-old businessman whose flight home from his honeymoon was abruptly canceled just days before his marriage.
Agarwal, who is based in the capital, New Delhi, had to pay nearly twice as much for new tickets, he said. 
""They did not even offer an apology, which is disappointing and unprofessional."" 
The airline, partly owned by Etihad Airways, did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment.
PLANES GROUNDED
Amid talks for a bailout led by state-run banks, lessors have forced the airline to ground at least 37 planes over non-payment of dues and some have also threatened repossession.
It had 556 flights on average in January, down from 641 a year earlier, data from the aviation regulator showed.
(For an interactive graphic on Jet's average daily flights, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2FeFDel)
Jet has planned cancellations of more than 600 flights in March, said one source with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Monday's tally of about 330 flights compared with a daily average of nearly 650 in March 2018, a second source said, adding that short notice about grounded planes triggered many unplanned cancellations.
""The bigger worry is if people stop future bookings, because that will affect cash flows,"" said the source, adding that cancellations in February and March outstripped prior months.
Jet Airways' market share shrank to 14.3 percent in 2018 from 17.2 percent a year earlier, even as India's aviation market grew nearly a fifth.
Some of the hundreds of aggrieved passengers who posted on the airline's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page and Twitter told of delays on the way to wedding and festival celebrations, and several uploaded screenshots showing telephone wait times longer than an hour for a response from the customer call center. 
After a last-minute cancellation, comedian Kenny Sebastian expressed outrage on Twitter, warning his 1.74 million followers to avoid the airline.

""Best part is they made it sound like it was the passengers' fault,"" he said this week.

Retail groups and anti-corruption activists have criticized single operator duty-free concessions, including at the country's main airport Suvarnabhumi, and called for multiple concessions. 
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said the Transport Ministry and state-owned Airports of Thailand (AOT) would work to find a solution. 
""The government has heard the concerns from many sides, especially over the issue of a monopoly, and will have the board and management of AOT review the auction terms,"" said Lt. Gen. Weerachon Sukhontapatipak, the deputy government spokesman. 
The duty-free business is a major beneficiary of Thailand's tourism boom, which saw more than 38 million arrivals in 2018.
AOT's concession revenue was 16.7 billion baht ($535 million) at the end of its fiscal year in 2018, up 13.3 percent from a year earlier. 
AOT on Monday released auction terms for a single duty-free license that included Suvarnabhumi in Bangkok and airports in Chiang Mai, Hat Yai and Phuket. 
A separate license for commercial activity at Suvarnabhumi Airport was also announced by AOT. 
King Power currently holds the sole license for duty-free retail, commercial activity and pick-up counters at all of Thailand's major airports. It expires in 2020.
Rivals, including Central Group, the Mall Group and South Korea's Hotel Shilla are interested in bidding.

AOT did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

UBS, which is appealing the ruling and has said it expects an appeals court to reverse the prior ruling, in its annual report showed total group-wide litigation provisions of $2.83 billion, up from $2.45 billion initially reported for end-2018.
The added litigation provisions reduced the bank's 2018 net profit to $4.5 billion from the $4.9 billion reported in late January.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Macau, the world's largest gambling hub, has extended casino licenses for MGM China and SJM Holdings until 2022, bringing them on par with other operators, authorities in the Chinese territory said on Friday.
The Macau government said the MGM and SJM's licenses, set to expire in 2020, would be extended for another two years with both operators required to pay a one-off fee of 200 million patacas ($25 million).
Shares in MGM jumped 10 percent while those in SJM rose over 5 percent after resuming trading following the announcement.
The license extensions in the only part of China where casinos are allowed will give authorities more time to consider how to diversify the gambling-dependent economy. 
The expiry of the casino licenses had been a major concern for investors, company executives and analysts as the government had provided little information until now.
Macau's other operators, which include Sands China, Wynn Macau, Galaxy Entertainment and Melco Resorts & Entertainment, will need to rebid for their licenses scheduled to expire in June 2022.
With no information on the rebidding process, the license situation will likely hang over the shares of the six operators, said Grant Govertsen, an analyst at Union Gaming in Macau. 
""We believe the extensions have more to do with making the ultimate task of the license rebid situation easier, while at the same time making sure the labor market remains stable,"" he said.
GAMBLING DEPENDENT
Macau's economy is heavily skewed towards casinos with over 80 percent of taxes coming from glitzy gambling halls. China's government has issued strict warnings to the former Portuguese colony that it must diversify away from gambling.
Policy and regulatory changes are in focus with the election this year of a new leader in the special administrative region, who will work with mainland authorities for the next five years.
The two likely contenders are Ho Iat Seng, president of Macau's Legislative Assembly, and Lionel Leong, the secretary for economy and finance, which oversees the gaming industry.
Macau is marking 20 years since its handover from Portuguese rule, with a slowing mainland economy, a weaker yuan and China's trade war with the United States threatening to derail growth.
Casino licenses were first awarded in a complex process in the early 2000s, resulting in a slew of legal battles with some still unresolved. The process remains controversial because little is publicly known about how the winners were chosen. 
Initially concessions were given to Wynn, a Galaxy-Sands team and SJM. After Galaxy and Sands failed to reach an operational agreement, they split up with the government awarding Sands a subconcession license. This paved the way for Melco and MGM to receive subconcessions.
SJM Holdings has multiple third party casino operators under its license which run independent properties.
Many of these local casino operators have been publicly jockeying for a license, with analysts and executives speculating that the government may permit additional licenses to the existing six operators.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 12:12AM ET</span>",Tesla unveils Model Y SUV as electric vehicle competition heats up,"By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc unveiled its Model Y electric sports utility vehicle on Thursday evening in California, promising a much-awaited crossover that will face competition from European car makers rolling out their own electric rivals.
Chief Executive Elon Musk said the compact SUV, built on the same platform as the Model 3, would first debut in a long-range version with a range of 300 miles priced at about $47,000. 
A standard version, to be available sometime in 2021, would cost about $39,000, he said.
Musk unveiled the car at a small event at Tesla's design studio in Hawthorne, outside Los Angeles, that was streamed online. (https://www.tesla.com/modely) 
Small SUVs are the fastest-growing segment in both the United States and China, the world's largest auto market, where Tesla is building a factory, making the Model Y well positioned to tap demand. 
Tesla has enjoyed little competition thus far for its sedans, but competition for electric SUVs is heating up as Tesla tries to master a new set of economics from the luxury line that made its reputation. 
On Thursday, ratings company Fitch warned that, despite Tesla's early lead, ""incumbent carmakers have the ability to catch up ... thanks to their capacity to invest and their robust record in product management.""
Tesla's targeted volume production date of late 2020 would put it behind electric SUV offerings from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG's Audi, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and BMW.
Shares of Tesla are down 24 percent from an August high of $379.57, when Musk tweeted that he was taking Tesla private. 
That plan - later scrapped - ushered in a period of turmoil at the company, from Musk's public battles with regulators, a flurry of securities lawsuits, cost cutting and layoffs.
Tesla, two weeks ago, said it would close most stores and use savings to cut the price of most cars by 6 percent. But last week, Tesla reversed course and said it would leave many stores open and raised prices back by about 3 percent.
Musk has promised an easier production ramp of the Model Y, since it shares about three-quarters of its parts with the Model 3 and would need only half the capital expenditures of the sedan.
The risk is ""quite low"" Musk told analysts in January. Tesla would ""most likely"" build the Model Y at Tesla's battery factory in Nevada, he said. 
Still, the Model Y, like all Tesla's models, has already seen pre-production delays. Suppliers were originally told that production would start in November 2019, sources told Reuters last year. 

In October, Musk said ""significant progress"" had been made on the Model Y and that he had approved the prototype for production in 2020. In January, he said Tesla had ordered the tooling needed to build the car.

Ren Zhengfei, who is Meng's father, also told Canada's CTV that the two had become closer since she was detained in Vancouver on Dec. 1 last year.
The United States wants Meng to be extradited to face charges that she engaged in bank and wire fraud in violation of American sanctions against Iran. She denies wrongdoing.
""One month before that arrest, she wanted to resign and find a job elsewhere. She was not happy working here but after being arrested this matter improved our relationship and now she understands how difficult life can be,"" Ren told CTV.
""In the past she had a smooth path. She couldn't take the setbacks very well ... you have to suffer a lot before becoming a hero and if you don't have scars, you won't have tough skin,"" he added in comments that were translated into English.
Relations between Canada and China deteriorated sharply after Meng's arrest. China has arrested two Canadians on national security grounds and retried another citizen who had already been convicted on drugs charges, this time sentencing him to death.
""Meng Wanzhou has committed no crime. She didn't violate any Canadian rules and I think both Canada and Huawei are victims because this case hurts people in both countries and bilateral relations also suffered setbacks,"" said Ren.
He also said he had previously only communicated infrequently with Meng, given how busy the two were.
""Now, every other day we have phone calls, we shoot the breeze, tell jokes, I tell her some anecdote I read on the internet. The case in Canada made my bonds deeper with my daughter,"" he said.
Huawei is a major manufacturer of equipment for 5G, the latest generation of cellular mobile communications. Canada is studying whether the firm will be able to bid for 5G contracts, given concerns about how secure the technology is.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 09:55PM ET</span>",Ethiopia crash may test Boeing's success in defeating U.S. lawsuits: legal experts,"By Tom Hals, Brendan Pierson and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - The crash of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX 8 passenger jet in Ethiopia raises the chances that families of the 157 victims, even non-U.S. residents, will be able to sue in U.S. courts, where payouts are larger than in other countries, some legal experts said.
Sunday's crash occurred five months after the same model of the plane went down in Indonesia, an accident that prompted a string of U.S. lawsuits against Boeing by families of the 189 victims.
While no lawsuits have yet been filed since the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, some plaintiffs' lawyers said they expect that Boeing will be sued in the United States.
Boeing did not immediately comment. 
The company, which has its corporate headquarters in Chicago, has often convinced U.S. judges to dismiss air crash cases in favor of litigation in the country where the evidence and witnesses are, usually where the crash occurred. 
That allows the company to avoid U.S. juries, which can award hefty punitive damages to accident victims for wrongful death, emotional suffering and economic hardships of surviving family.
Boeing may have a tougher time with that strategy after the Ethiopian crash, some legal experts said.
This is partly because eight U.S. citizens died and because plaintiffs could argue that liability hinges on system design and safety decisions made by Boeing executives since the Lion Air crash in Indonesia.
""Now with two crashes with a brand-new aircraft, what Boeing did in the intervening five months is more relevant, and that all happened in the United States,"" said Daniel Rose, a lawyer with Kreindler & Kreindler, a firm that represents air crash victims and their relatives.
The causes are still unknown, but both involved a relatively new 737 MAX 8 aircraft that crashed within minutes of takeoff and experienced sudden drops in altitude when the aircrafts should have been steadily climbing. 
This has raised fresh questions among regulators about a digital anti-stall system known as Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, designed specifically for the MAX to offset the extra lift from larger engines mounted on its low-slung frame.
In a March 4 court filing in litigation over the Indonesia crash, Boeing asked the judge to limit all discovery in the case to issues of forum, or which country the cased belonged, and said it planned to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
LIABILITY 
While potential plaintiffs may name Ethiopian Airlines as a defendant in any lawsuits, the focus on the 737 MAX 8 anti-stall system makes Boeing a likely target of litigation, some lawyers said. 
Arthur Wolk, an attorney who represents plaintiffs in air crash litigation and said he has been contacted by a potential plaintiff over the Ethiopian Airlines crash, said Boeing would likely face claims for strict liability. That means they could face an allegation of having sold a product that was inherently defective and dangerous. 
Plaintiffs will also claim Boeing failed to exercise reasonable care in designing planes or failed to inform flight crews about how the planes operate, Wolk said.
Rose, the lawyer for passengers, said two accidents so close together will put the focus of any lawsuits on the Ethiopian crash on how Boeing tried to address problems with its MCAS system after the Lion Air crash.
""Were there other efforts by Boeing to essentially minimize the problem or hide the scope of the problem?"" Rose asked. If lawyers can show Boeing management acted recklessly, it could clear the way for substantial punitive damages, he said.
Some lawyers who have worked on the other side of such cases are less sure about Boeing's potential liability.
Kenneth Quinn, a lawyer who represents airlines and manufacturers, said he thought Boeing had a good chance of getting both sets of U.S. cases dismissed on forum grounds.
He said the trend in U.S. courts was in Boeing's favor.
""Increasingly, attempts to litigate foreign crashes involving foreign airlines on foreign soil are being dismissed,"" he said.
In November, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. dismissed a case against Boeing and other defendants stemming from the disappearance of a Malaysian Airlines flight in 2014 because the presumed crash had a stronger connection to Malaysia than the United States.
In 2011, a federal judge in Los Angeles dismissed 116 wrongful death and product liability cases against Boeing over the 2008 crash of a Spanair jet on a domestic flight in Spain, where the judge determined the cases should be heard. 
If the company has to defend U.S. cases, it would likely argue that claims against it are preempted because the FAA had approved the plane's design, said Justin Green, a plaintiffs lawyer.

While manufacturers in the past have enjoyed broad protection under the Federal Aviation Act, a decision by the 3rd U.S. Court of Appeals has called into question whether manufacturers can rely on preemption when they could have easily submitted changes to the FAA for approval.

1067,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 09:49PM ET</span>",U.S. judge rules Qualcomm owes Apple nearly $1 billion rebate payment,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge has issued a preliminary ruling that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc owes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebate payments, though the decision is unlikely to result in Qualcomm writing a check to Apple because of other developments in the dispute.
Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of California on Thursday ruled that Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, was obligated to pay nearly $1 billion in rebate payments to Apple, which for years used Qualcomm's modem chips to connect iPhones to wireless data networks.
The payments were part of a business cooperation agreement between the two companies amid the peculiar patent licensing practices of the consumer electronics industry. 
In general, the contract factories that built Apple's iPhones would pay Qualcomm billions of dollars per year for the use of Qualcomm's patented technology in iPhones, a cost that Apple would reimburse the contract factories for. Separately, Qualcomm and Apple had a cooperation agreement under which Qualcomm would pay Apple a rebate on the iPhone patent payments if Apple agreed not to attack in court or with regulators.
In a lawsuit filed two years ago, Apple sued Qualcomm, alleging that the chip supplier had broken the cooperation agreement by not paying nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates.
Qualcomm in turn alleged that it stopped paying the rebate payments because Apple had broken the agreement by urging other smartphone makers to complain to regulators and making ""false and misleading"" statements to the Korean Fair Trade Commission, which was investigating Qualcomm over antitrust allegations. Apple responded that it was making lawful responses to regulators in an ongoing investigation.
Judge Curiel sided with Apple, ruling that Qualcomm owed the missed rebate payments.
""Qualcomm's illegal business practices are harming Apple and the entire industry,"" Apple said in a statement. 
Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, told Reuters in a statement, “Although the Court today did not view Apple’s conduct as a breach of Apple’s promises to Qualcomm in the 2013 Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement, the exposure of Apple’s role in these events is a welcome development.” 
The decision will not become final until after the trial in the case, which begins next month. And it is unlikely that Qualcomm will make a new payment to Apple. 
Apple's contract factories, which under normal circumstances would pay Qualcomm for patent royalties owed on iPhones, have already withheld the nearly $1 billion in payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm's Rosenberg said those withheld iPhone payments have already been accounted for in Qualcomm's existing financial statements.

“Apple has already offset the payment at issue under the agreement against royalties that were owed to Qualcomm,” Qualcomm's Rosenberg told Reuters.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 09:34PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Uber plans to kick off IPO in April - sources,"By Carl O'Donnell and Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc is planning to kick off its initial public offering in April, putting it close on the heels of smaller rival Lyft Inc, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Next month, Uber will issue its required public disclosure, known as an S-1, and launch its investor roadshow, the people said. Those events will set in motion the Wall Street debut of one of Silicon Valley's most closely watched companies.
The timing for Uber's IPO means it will most likely hit public markets soon after Lyft completes its own public offering, which is expected to happen by the end of March, people familiar with the matter said. Uber declined to comment.
But the close proximity of the two IPOs could test the public market's appetite for ride-sharing investments.
The neck-and-neck race extends a long rivalry between the two loss-making companies, which have battled each other for riders and drivers since their inception.
(GRAPHIC: Uber and Lyft, side-by-side - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VAzDBQ)
Uber's business is much larger and more diverse than Lyft's, and the company has moved relatively swiftly to go public given both firms filed confidential paperwork for an IPO at the same time in December.
Uber, a global logistics and transportation company most recently valued at $76 billion in the private market, is seeking a valuation as high as $120 billion, although some analysts have pegged its value closer to $100 billion based on selected financial figures it has disclosed.
Lyft, a smaller firm which has ride-hailing and bike-renting in the United States and several Canadian cities, is seeking a valuation of $20 billion to $25 billion, up from its $15 billion valuation as a private company.
The two companies are positioned to kick off a string of hotly anticipated public debuts from highly valued tech companies, energizing the IPO market after a quiet start to the year.
Both companies stand to benefit from Lyft joining the public markets first.
Being ahead of its larger rival allows Lyft to take advantage of pent-up investor demand for high-growth tech companies, rather than ceding available investor capital to Uber. And a successful IPO for Lyft would allow Uber to benefit from market euphoria and also demand a high valuation.
However, in going out so close together, the companies risk testing the limits of investors' interest in ride-sharing.
""There is only so much capital investors are willing to put into ride-sharing companies,"" said Kathleen Smith, a principal and manager of IPO ETFs at Renaissance Capital.
""There will be competition for investor capital in the space between the two companies with them going out so close together.""
Uber's revenue last year was $11.3 billion, while its gross bookings from rides were $50 billion. But the company lost $3.3 billion, excluding gains from the sale of its overseas business units in Russia and Southeast Asia. [nL1N20925L]
Lyft's revenue for last year was $2.2 billion, with $8.1 billion in gross ride bookings. The company lost $911 million.
Uber will have the challenge of explaining and selling to investors a business that is more complex and less focused than Lyft's.
Uber's business operates in more than 70 countries and includes not only ride-hailing but also bike- and scooter-rentals, freight hauling, food delivery and an expensive self-driving car division.
SoftBank's Vision Fund and Toyota Motor Corp are part of a consortium of investors in talks to invest $1 billion in Uber's self-driving car unit, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Taking on large investors that will influence a key business is an unusual move for a company so close to an IPO.
Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi will be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the company's culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.

Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas.

1069,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 09:22PM ET</span>",Facebook product chief Cox to exit as focus shifts to messaging,"By Munsif Vengattil and Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's chief product officer and one of its earliest employees, Chris Cox, said on Thursday he is leaving the company just days after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg revealed a plan to transform the world's biggest social network into an encryption-focused messaging company.
Cox, the 36-year-old Zuckerberg lieutenant who would have managed the CEO's vision to bring Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp closer together, said in a blog post that his departure came ""with great sadness."" He had left a graduate program at Stanford University to join Facebook in 2005 as a software engineer and helped developed its original news feed feature.
""As Mark has outlined, we are turning a new page in our product direction, focused on an encrypted, interoperable, messaging network ... This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through,"" Cox said in a Facebook post.
Cox's departure removes a layer of management, bringing Zuckerberg closer to a family of apps that he wants to make compatible, in what technology analysts expect will be a complicated engineering task.
Shares of Facebook were down 1.7 percent in extended trading following the announcement.
Cox informed the company of his intention to resign on Monday, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.
Also departing is WhatsApp Vice President Chris Daniels, adding to a string of recent high-profile exits from Facebook's product and communications teams. The shakeup is the second major management restructuring in as many years as the company also faces numerous government investigations across the world related to user privacy and fake news on its services.
Daniels had informed the company several months ago of his intention to leave and will stay on through a leadership transition, a person familiar with the matter said.
Zuckerberg told Wired magazine on March 6 that ""there will be a bunch of work inside the company to make sure that we have the right folks in the right roles"" to bring Facebook's apps together and introduce more privacy features.
EMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg said that ""whenever there is a shift in strategy, it's not unusual to see some personnel changes.""
NEW STRUCTURE
Will Cathcart, vice president of product management, will now lead WhatsApp, and Head of Video, Games and Monetization Fidji Simo will be the new head of the Facebook app, Zuckerberg said.
Cathcart and Simo worked closely to bring video uploading tools and professional video content to Facebook. And growing viewership and advertising on videos are of growing importance to both the Facebook and WhatsApp apps.
The company does not immediately plan to fill Cox's role, Zuckerberg said, adding that Cathcart, Simo and the heads of Instagram and Messenger will now report directly to him.
Facebook's family of apps strategy has so far been led jointly by Cox and Javier Olivan, vice president of growth.
Zuckerberg said on Thursday that Olivan will now lead the effort to integrate Facebook apps, a key move as the company encrypts conversations on more of its messaging services and makes them compatible.
Cox gained greater oversight of WhatsApp and Instagram following the exits of their founders over the last two years. He also remained a key figure at Facebook, where for years until Monday he spoke at the orientations for new employees.
Daniels, who had worked on Facebook initiatives in developing countries, had moved a year ago to WhatsApp, which is more popular than Facebook in many big emerging markets.
A WhatsApp spokesman declined to comment on Daniels' departure or make him available for comment. 

Zuckerberg still has a number of long-time product and engineering lieutenants. They include hardware Vice President Andrew Bosworth, who joined shortly after Cox, as well as decade-long veterans Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and engineering Vice President Jay Parikh.

1070,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 08:34PM ET</span>",Boeing groundings put U.S.-China trade-linked jet order in limbo,"By Eric M. Johnson, Tim Hepher and Brenda Goh
SEATTLE/PARIS/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's move to ground Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX jetliners following the deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash has cast a shadow over the American planemaker's immediate hopes for a major jet order linked to a U.S.-China trade deal, industry sources said.
Evidence of a major potential order for more than 100 jets worth well over $10 billion at list prices had risen in recent weeks as Washington and Beijing reported some progress in trade talks to resolve a months-long trade war.
Those expectations were fanned by signs of pent-up demand stemming not only from a drop in China's public purchases as the two sides descended into a tariff war, but also because China placed no private orders for Boeing aircraft in 2018, according to trade and industry sources familiar with the matter.
Now, those sources say it is uncertain how quickly China will be willing to give the 737 MAX the expected new endorsement after ordering its own airlines to stop flying the jet - though much could change as Ethiopian investigators assemble clues to the second deadly crash of the brand-new model in five months.
On Wednesday, the United States joined a wave of nations grounding the 737 MAX in the wake of Sunday's crash in Ethiopia, which killed all 157 people onboard. The planes will be grounded for weeks, U.S. lawmakers said on Thursday.
Analysts said the crash has added uncertainty for America's largest exporter over sales to China. 
""It is definitely on their list of concerns because China is Boeing's biggest single export market,"" Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said. 
Even before the 737 MAX crisis, trade tensions had been widely seen as a growing source of risk for Boeing, which relies on China for one of four of the planes it delivers.
China is poised to overtake the United States as the world's largest aviation market in the next decade and is gobbling up planes made by both Boeing and Airbus while it invests in homegrown aircraft businesses. Boeing sees Chinese demand for 7,700 jets over 20 years worth $1.2 trillion.
While the trade frictions have visibly hurt businesses such as U.S. soybean farmers and Chinese manufacturers, their impact on Boeing has been less clear.
China routinely places large, headline-grabbing jet orders to mark significant diplomatic moments, such as a deal for 300 Boeing jets signed during a visit by Trump to Beijing in 2017. 
But analysts say that behind those headlines, such deals contain a mixture of new demand, repeats of older orders and credits against future deals, meaning the impact remains foggy.
The same could apply to any new bout of jet orders announced with a trade peace deal, a former industry negotiator said.
State buyer China Aviation Supplies declined comment. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is confident the United States could forge a trade deal with China, but ruled out making any deal that was not in U.S. interests.
It is possible China could also decide to use a large order of Airbus jets to relieve pent-up demand. Orders of European jets have slowed too, partly because Chinese buyers have been wary of wading into the trade row and because the economy is slowing.
An aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday there were encouraging signs Airbus was closing in on a long-negotiated deal with China for dozens of narrow-body jets.
SPEAKING SOFTLY
Tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economic powers, have slowed the global economy and forced Boeing to walk a geopolitical tightrope for months. 
On the one hand, Boeing has been increasing its industrial footprint in China as it aims to win business and increase its sales lead over Airbus in Asia.
On the other hand, Boeing executives have taken pains to sound measured when publicly discussing trade, in part to avoid clashing with Trump who has repeatedly said the U.S. must take steps to protect American jobs and technology.
One person with knowledge of the matter said before the groundings that Boeing could win a ""massive"" order led by 737s. 
Company data shows Boeing did not win any publicly announced aircraft deals in mainland China last year as the U.S.-Sino trade fight festered into a full-blown trade war.
Just as significantly, trade sources say that for the first time in a number of years, Boeing did not win any new mainland orders of a type that are often booked without either party disclosing the name of the buyer due to complex approvals.
Analysts say any trade or safety ructions are unlikely to disturb a trend that sees China balance aircraft orders over time between Europe and the U.S. to achieve political balance.
But Yang Yingbao, a retired professor from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, warned that if the trade war went unresolved, the dispute may force China's hand. 
""If the U.S. government interferes with the market, and not allow Boeing to smoothly sell planes, this will force China to buy Airbus' planes."" 

Boeing declined to comment for this story. Its shares closed down 1 percent at $373.39.

Australia's fourth-largest bank said it would extend its definition of small businesses to those with aggregate borrowings of less than A$5 million ($3.5 million), up from less than A$3 million.
In its final report last month, the government-mandated inquiry recommended banks be required to broaden the definition of small businesses so that more borrowers would benefit from protections when they experienced hardship. 
NAB acting CEO Philip Chronican said the company had completed or was in the process of implementing 26 of the inquiry's 76 recommendations.

LONDON (Reuters) - Twenty percent of Britain's largest companies have been put on notice by the fund management industry's trade body for failing to have more women represented on their boards.
The Investment Association said it had written to 69 British companies which it said have no women on their boards or just one asking them for explanations following the government-backed Hampton-Alexander Review which set a target of ensuring women make up at least a third of leadership teams by 2020.
""It is totally unacceptable that one in five of the UK’s biggest companies are falling so far short ... Companies must do more than take the tokenistic step of appointing just one woman to their board and consider that job done,"" the association's Chief Executive Chris Cummings said in a statement on Friday.
The letter comes just ahead of the season for most companies' annual general meeting, where investors vote on a range of issues including board membership, and which are set to see increased push-back from investors over poor performers.
The IA's voter information service IVIS, which investors use to help them decide how to vote at AGMs, said in February it would give its highest-level 'red-top' warning about all companies which have just one woman on their board. 
Philip Hampton, Chair of the Hampton-Alexander Review, said while most companies had made good progress, ""a surprising number"" had just one woman and needed to do more. 
Among the biggest of the FTSE 350 companies to receive a letter are wealth manager St James's Place, retailer JD Sports and insurer Just Group.
A spokeswoman for Just Group said it had taken action and would provide a response to the IA shortly and give more detail on its activities in a soon-to-be-published annual report.
St James's Place said in a statement: ""As a key priority, we aim to increase the representation of women in senior positions across our business, including at Board level"", and had signed up to two industry initiatives to do that.

JD Sports did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - TPG Capital senior executive Bill McGlashan on Thursday left the private equity firm after he was charged in connection with a U.S. college fraud scheme that has ensnared Hollywood celebrities and corporate elite.
It is the latest fallout from a U.S. federal case charging wealthy parents, including McGlashan as well as actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, in what authorities say was a $25 million scam to help their children get into elite universities. 
McGlashan, one of TPG's highest-profile figures, helped lead investments in companies such as Uber Technologies Inc and Airbnb Inc, and brought celebrity investors such as Bono into the firm's Rise Fund.
In a statement via a spokesman, McGlashan said he was resigning from the TPG Rise Fund, which he founded and was chief executive, and TPG Growth, where he was managing partner. 
""I will be focused on addressing the allegations that have been presented, and there are aspects of the story that have yet to emerge that I wish I could share,"" he said.
In a separate statement, TPG said it had fired McGlashan.
""We believe the behavior described to be inexcusable and antithetical to the values of our entire organization,"" TPG said in a statement.
Regarding the conflicting statements, a spokeswoman for McGlashan provided an email exchange which she said was between McGlashan, TPG co-CEOs Jon Winkelried and Jim Coulter, and Chairman David Bonderman. The exchange suggests McGlashan resigned around an hour before he was told TPG had terminated his employment.
In the email exchange, Winkelried wrote that the firm was preparing to send McGlashan his notice of termination when he sent his resignation note.
TPG declined to comment further. 
CHANCE TO WITHDRAW
To stem the fallout, TPG has offered investors in its Rise Fund II the chance to withdraw, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. [nL8N21181Y]
TPG made the offer to investors who participated in the first round of fundraising. TPG decided to do this given the change in circumstances this week and not because it was triggered by McGlashan's departure, the source said.
A spokesman for TPG's Rise Fund declined to comment. 
TPG raised $2 billion for the first Rise fund in 2017, a fund focused on impact investing which aims to benefit society while delivering financial returns. 
TPG is aiming to raise up to $3.5 billion for its second Rise Fund, according to documents from the State Investment Council of New Jersey, which has committed up to $125 million in the fund.
The Rise Fund is a small part of the $103 billion in assets that TPG has under management, but it is a high-profile area due to the growing appetite for impact investing.

TPG has said Jim Coulter will take over managing partner responsibilities for TPG Growth and Rise.

SEATTLE/PARIS/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's move to ground Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX jetliners following the deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash has cast a shadow over the American planemaker's immediate hopes for a major jet order linked to a U.S.-China trade deal, industry sources said.
Evidence of a major potential order for more than 100 jets worth well over $10 billion at list prices had risen in recent weeks as Washington and Beijing reported some progress in trade talks to resolve a months-long trade war.
Those expectations were fanned by signs of pent-up demand stemming not only from a drop in China's public purchases as the two sides descended into a tariff war, but also because China placed no private orders for Boeing aircraft in 2018, according to trade and industry sources familiar with the matter.
Now, those sources say it is uncertain how quickly China will be willing to give the 737 MAX the expected new endorsement after ordering its own airlines to stop flying the jet - though much could change as Ethiopian investigators assemble clues to the second deadly crash of the brand-new model in five months.
On Wednesday, the United States joined a wave of nations grounding the 737 MAX in the wake of Sunday's crash in Ethiopia, which killed all 157 people onboard. The planes will be grounded for weeks, U.S. lawmakers said on Thursday.
Analysts said the crash has added uncertainty for America's largest exporter over sales to China. 
""It is definitely on their list of concerns because China is Boeing's biggest single export market,"" Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said. 
Even before the 737 MAX crisis, trade tensions had been widely seen as a growing source of risk for Boeing, which relies on China for one of four of the planes it delivers.
China is poised to overtake the United States as the world's largest aviation market in the next decade and is gobbling up planes made by both Boeing and Airbus while it invests in homegrown aircraft businesses. Boeing sees Chinese demand for 7,700 jets over 20 years worth $1.2 trillion.
While the trade frictions have visibly hurt businesses such as U.S. soybean farmers and Chinese manufacturers, their impact on Boeing has been less clear.
China routinely places large, headline-grabbing jet orders to mark significant diplomatic moments, such as a deal for 300 Boeing jets signed during a visit by Trump to Beijing in 2017. 
But analysts say that behind those headlines, such deals contain a mixture of new demand, repeats of older orders and credits against future deals, meaning the impact remains foggy.
The same could apply to any new bout of jet orders announced with a trade peace deal, a former industry negotiator said.
State buyer China Aviation Supplies declined comment. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is confident the United States could forge a trade deal with China, but ruled out making any deal that was not in U.S. interests.
It is possible China could also decide to use a large order of Airbus jets to relieve pent-up demand. Orders of European jets have slowed too, partly because Chinese buyers have been wary of wading into the trade row and because the economy is slowing.
An aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday there were encouraging signs Airbus was closing in on a long-negotiated deal with China for dozens of narrow-body jets.

(Reuters) - Advantage Lithium Corp said on Thursday it has temporarily replaced Chief Executive David Sidoo as he battles U.S. fraud charges connected to a sweeping college admissions scandal.
The company has named board member Callum Grant, an engineer by training, as interim president and said it would move forward with plans to develop an Argentine lithium deposit.
Sidoo also stepped down as president and CEO of Vancouver-based East West Petroleum on Thursday.
Sidoo, 59, was arrested last Friday and charged with conspiracy to commit fraud for allegedly paying $200,000 to the scam's accused mastermind, William ""Rick"" Singer, to arrange for people to take the SAT admissions test for his two sons, according to U.S. court documents reviewed by Reuters.
Sidoo plans to travel to a Massachusetts court to face the charges, according to his attorney, Richard Schonfeld, who requested that ""people don't rush to judgment in the meantime.""
Lithium is a key ingredient in electric vehicle batteries and a plethora of smaller miners have launched projects in recent years to supply the white metal to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and other automakers.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, the second-largest U.S. automaker, said earlier this week it was considering inking supply deals with a lithium producer. 
Canada-based Advantage Lithium has undertaken a series of engineering studies necessary to move forward on development of its Cauchari lithium deposit, though it has yet to say when the project could come online.
Sidoo had been actively meeting with investors, analysts, regulators and others to promote the company. It was not immediately clear how his exit would affect development plans.
""All plans are the same to put Advantage into production at some point,"" spokesman Max Sali told Reuters on Thursday. 
Orocobre, Advantage Lithium's largest shareholder, acknowledged Sidoo's temporary leave of absence in a statement. 

The company's Argentine project is located near similar projects run by Lithium Americas Corp and Orocobre.

1076,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 07:24PM ET</span>","On Japan Sea coast, small firm shows scars of China's economic woes","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
JOETSU, Japan (Reuters) - In snow country along Japan's northern coast, a small manufacturer of precision moulds is feeling the pain of China's economic slowdown.
Orders have slowed to a trickle at Nagumo Seisakusho Co, which supplies big auto-parts makers such as Denso Corp and Aisin Seiki Co, and the company may keep salaries flat or even reduce them in the coming fiscal year.
Manufacturers across Japan depend heavily on customers in China, the world's second-biggest economy, to buy their products, especially the parts and equipment that reach China's factory floor and fuel its domestic and export growth.
Automotive chipmaker Renesas Electronics Corp last week said it would suspend production at some plants for up to two months as it braces for China's growth to slow further. In recent months, other big companies such as factory-robot makers Yaskawa Electric Corp and Fanuc Corp; Mitsubishi Electric Corp, trading house Mitsui & Co and toilet giant Toto Ltd have blamed China as they cut profit forecasts.
But the impact of China's wobble is worse for manufacturers nearer the start of the supply chain, like tiny Nagumo. It employs 100 people to create precision press moulds other Japanese manufacturers use to make car parts and other products for the China market.
On the nondescript 4,000-square-metre (43,000-square-foot) factory floor in Nagumo's main Sanwa plant, grey-clad workers, some wearing blue surgical masks, busied themselves during a recent day designing moulds by computer, then milling, stamping and assembling dies.
But the normalcy belies tough times for Nagumo, which makes all of its products on demand. 
""Orders have stalled suddenly since January. Many of our clients are car-parts makers, and they have slammed on the brakes for orders recently,"" at least through March, said president Hiroshi Komemasu.
""It is said that when China sneezes, Japan catches a cold,"" Komemasu told Reuters recently on the factory floor. ""I strongly feel that the trade war is affecting even small firms like us.""
RIPPLE EFFECTS
The emptiest section of the facility was the busiest. Nagumo's five sales staff were often out of the office hunting new customers to make up for the drop-off in orders.
The company, founded as a fiber-processing company in the immediate aftermath of World War Two, is based in Joetsu, a quiet city of about 200,000 people 225 kilometers (140 miles) northwest of Tokyo.
Far from the bustle of Japan's biggest cities, Joetsu is known for a festival, a museum and a mascot celebrating an Austro-Hungarian general who taught cross-country skiing to Japan's Imperial Army in the early 1900s.
Sharp slowdowns for upstream manufacturers like Nagumo bode ill for Japan as a whole, as smaller companies employ seven in 10 Japanese workers, and weak demand points to smaller shipments by bigger firms down the road.
Komemasu would not discuss Nagumo's specific customers, but said one had slashed its orders by half.
Unlisted Nagumo managed to stay in the black for the 2018 calendar year, but probably lost money in the fiscal year, which ends this month, Komemasu said. Declining orders threaten its forecast of sales edging up 6 percent this year to 1.9 billion yen ($17 million).
Nagumo executives, worried about sales, have become reluctant to raise wages. After increasing base pay for three years, the company hopes to keep overall pay flat in the coming fiscal year, which starts in April, Komemasu said.
Such constriction could ripple through to other Japanese manufacturers - now in annual wage negotiations - reinforcing concerns that trade friction will hurt salaries and consumer spending nationwide.
Japanese giants such as Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp offered smaller pay increases at annual wage talks on Wednesday, tempering hopes that domestic consumption will offset external risks to growth.
TRADE WAR
Despite signs that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may be nearing a truce in the U.S.-China trade war, the collateral damage for Japan may persist.
""The U.S.-China trade war won't be resolved entirely. Both sides may reach a vague compromise, but that doesn't mean everything will be rosy for China's external demand,"" said Toru Nishihama, emerging-market economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Downward pressure will mount on Japanese exporters and manufacturers as the global economy slows further,"" Nishihama said, adding that as Beijing focuses on supporting the domestic economy, the authorities will tolerate slower demand. 
Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute, sees the China slowdown's impact on Japanese companies lasting for months, countering an expected rebound in car demand late in the year from Beijing's stimulus measures.
""But we need to bear in mind that the effects of trade friction will play out fully in Japanese exports and output in January-March and the following quarter, after the rush in shipments of Chinese goods to the United States seen late last year,"" Takeda said.
""Semiconductors and cars will take a hit in the first half of this year, and other goods related to trade friction will follow suit in the second and third quarters, so the worst will come around April-June for Japanese exporters and manufacturers.""
Last year, about 38 percent of Japan's exports were electronic parts, semiconductor-manufacturing equipment and heavy machinery used to make other goods, while the auto industry accounted for 23 percent, Finance Ministry data show.
Japan's manufacturing supply chain, linking small firms like Nagumo to Japan's industrial giants and consumers worldwide, is the China-reliant core of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plan to lift Japan out of decades of deflation and fitful growth.
A much cheaper yen, driven by unprecedented money-printing from the Bank of Japan, has made the country's exports more competitive globally. This has spurred a long export boom and record corporate profits, promoting hiring, creating the tightest labor market since the 1970s and delivering modest pay raises. 
But domestic consumption has remained tepid and export demand - especially from China - has slumped, threatening to derail what could be Japan's longest postwar expansion.
This year has seen the biggest monthly export drop in two years, with a plunge in China-bound shipments, a big drop in machinery orders signaling weaker capital spending ahead, a weak wage outlook and dampening business sentiment in the Reuters Tankan survey.
The government last month cut its assessment of factory output and profits, and indicators this month suggest the expansion may have halted. 
In Joetsu, Kenichi Watabe, head of Nagumo's general-affairs division, says the company has ""managed to make ends meet as our sales staff dashed here and there trying to attract new customers and secure new orders.""
Nagumo's workforce is now half its peak due to past layoffs, Watabe said.
But company president Komemasu said squeezing too hard would cause lasting damage.
""We, like everyone else, tell employees to turn off the lights and refrain from purchasing unnecessary things in a downturn,"" he said. ""But we won't curb investment in human capital and R&D.""

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",Newell Brands CEO Polk to retire,"(Reuters) - Newell Brands Inc said Chief Executive Officer Michael Polk would retire at the end of the second quarter, ending a tenure during which the U.S. household goods maker was the target of activist investors and launched a turnaround to slim down its brand portfolio.
Polk, 57, who has been at the helm of the company since 2011, engineered Newell's $15 billion acquisition of Coleman products maker Jarden Corp in 2016, adding about 120 brands and more than doubling the company's size.
However, Newell, which owns everything from Elmer's glue, and Crock Pot cooker to Yankee candles, came under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP over the purchase.
Starboard said the company's management had made missteps in integrating and operating Jarden, and along with former Jarden executives made a bid to replace Newell's board and oust Polk. Fellow activist investor Carl Icahn also picked up a stake in the company and sought board representation.
Newell last year settled with Starboard and Icahn, agreeing to give them board seats and to accelerate its turnaround program by raising its asset sales target to about $10 billion from $6 billion.
""With the Accelerated Transformation Plan largely complete and the business beginning to turn, I believe now is the right time to transition to the next generation of leadership,"" Polk said in a statement.
Newell is coming off a year of disappointing sales. In February, the company forecast lower-than-expected sales and profit due for its financial year 2019, blaming a stronger dollar, higher costs and sluggish sales of its Graco baby products in the aftermath of the liquidation of Toys 'R' Us.
The company's shares have lost about 46 percent of their value in the past 12 months.
Newell said on Thursday it has started a search for the next CEO and has hired global executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles to assist in the process.

1078,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",Don’t Let a China Trade Deal Kill the U.S. Campaign Against Huawei,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S.-led campaign against Huawei Technologies Co., China’s telecom giant, has attracted a lot of attention for the indictment of the company’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. On Thursday, Huawei’s lawyers pleaded not guilty in a New York federal court to 13 counts of fraud involving an elaborate scheme to violate U.S. sanctions against Iran.
That case is no doubt important, not only because of the possibility that Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, could face incarceration. It is also a major irritant in U.S.-China trade talks.
That said, the case is a sideshow. Of greater consequence is a renewed U.S. campaign to pressure and persuade America’s allies to keep Huawei technology and equipment out of the next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G. The stakes in this campaign are much bigger than U.S. market share or the effectiveness of Iran sanctions. If Huawei’s chips and routers find their way into this new network, everything from digital privacy to intellectual property could be at risk.
U.S. intelligence agencies, along with those of many of its allies, have concluded that Huawei’s equipment provides China’s military with a backdoor into the telecom systems that use it. “Huawei is a spy agency for the Communist Party of China, thinly veiled as a technology company,” says Senator Ted Cruz in a March 14 letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.
The U.S. intelligence community has been sounding this alarm for years. Only recently, however, have these worries begun to inform policy. Pompeo himself has been the public face of it, warning last month on a tour of Eastern Europe that it would be “difficult” for the U.S. to partner with countries that use Huawei equipment. Meanwhile, I am told, senior military and intelligence officials have been delivering more explicit warnings to U.S. allies in private. The message is particularly effective with Eastern European countries that see a U.S. military presence as a trip wire against Russian aggression.
It’s still early days, but so far the anti-Huawei campaign is not going well. Last month, the United Arab Emirates announced that it would be using Huawei equipment. India, too, has rebuffed U.S. concerns and is reportedly looking for a way to grant some contracts to Huawei.
India and the U.A.E. are important U.S. allies, but for national security they are in a different category from the five English-speaking nations that share intercepts and surveillance data in an arrangement known as the “Five Eyes” security alliance. These countries — Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.S. and the U.K. — have partnered since the aftermath of World War II to share this kind of signal intelligence against common adversaries, such as the former Soviet Union and China. The prospect of a Chinese backdoor into the wireless networks of any of these countries is what stirred Cruz to write his letter.
The danger is real. Cruz’s letter points to reports from last month that the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre has determined that security risks associated with Huawei equipment could be mitigated, paving the way for the country to approve some Huawei technology in its 5G network. Canada and New Zealand have yet to make a determination. Western Australia’s transportation authority, meanwhile, is pursuing a deal that would use Huawei technology in the radio networks of its rail system.
In all of these cases, there is still time for the Five Eyes allies to make the right decision. But the U.S. campaign is facing an uphill fight. To start, the Chinese have pressured other countries to drop what they say are discriminatory policies against Huawei. And because Huawei is heavily subsidized, it can often outbid its competitors. The Chinese have also aggressively pressured international standards-setting bodies to adopt specifications for equipment that would force countries to choose Huawei over its competitors.
The U.S. campaign has also suffered from some confusion of its own. Last month, on the eve of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, President Donald Trump tweeted that he wanted the U.S. to win markets for its technology “through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies.” That tweet earned kudos from Huawei’s rotating chairman, Guo Ping.
U.S. officials tell me that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin opposes the aggressive campaign to ban Huawei. One senior national security official says there is a possibility that the U.S.-China trade negotiations could result in a deal that would relieve the U.S. pressure against Huawei. And while Mnuchin has said there are no discussions with Huawei in regard to the indictment of Meng, “forced technology issues are part of trade discussions.”
For now, America’s Five Eyes partners and other allies will have to wait to see whether the campaign against Huawei survives a U.S.-China trade agreement. In the meantime, Trump should listen to his spies and his generals. No trade deal is worth letting China become the world leader in eavesdropping."
1079,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 06:51PM ET</span>",Boeing 737 MAX jets could be grounded for weeks as black box probe to start on Ethiopia crash,"By David Shepardson, Richard Lough and Aaron Maasho
WASHINGTON/PARIS/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX 8 and 9 planes will be grounded for weeks if not longer until a software upgrade can be tested and installed, U.S. lawmakers said on Thursday, as officials in France prepare to begin analyzing the black boxes from a jet that crashed in Ethiopia.
Boeing said it had paused deliveries of its fastest-selling 737 MAX aircraft built at its factory near Seattle but continues to produce its single-aisle jets at full speed while dealing with the worldwide fleet's grounding.
Investigators in France will be seeking clues into Sunday's deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash after take-off from Addis Ababa killed 157 people from 35 nations in the second such calamity involving Boeing's plane since October. 
Possible links between the accidents have rocked the aviation industry, scared passengers, and left the world's biggest planemaker scrambling to prove the safety of a money-spinning model intended to be the standard for decades.
U.S. Representative Rick Larsen said after a briefing with U.S. aviation officials the software upgrade would take a few weeks to complete, and installing it on all aircraft would take ""at least through April."" He said additional training would also have to take place.
Boeing has said it would roll out the software improvement ""across the 737 MAX fleet in the coming weeks.""
Relatives of the dead stormed out of a meeting with Ethiopian Airlines on Thursday, decrying a lack of transparency, while others made the painful trip to the crash scene.
""I can't find you! Where are you?"" said one Ethiopian woman, draped in traditional white mourning shawl, as she held a framed portrait of her brother in the charred and debris-strewn field.
After an apparent tussle over where the investigation should be held, the flight data and cockpit voice recorders were handed over to France's Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA).
Technical analysis would begin on Friday and the first conclusions could take several days, the BEA said, posting a picture of the partly crumpled, orange-cased box.
Nations around the world, including an initially reluctant United States, have suspended the 371 MAX models in operation, though airlines are largely coping by switching planes.
Nearly 5,000 MAXs are on order, meaning the financial implications are huge for the industry. Moody's rating agency said the fallout from the crash would not immediately affect Boeing's credit rating.
""We continue to build 737 MAX airplanes while assessing how the situation, including potential capacity constraints, will impact our production system,"" Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers said.
Boeing would maintain its production rate of 52 aircraft per month, and its newest version, the MAX, represents the lion's share, although Boeing declined to break out exact numbers.
CONNECTION TO INDONESIA CRASH?
The investigation of Sunday's crash has added urgency since the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday grounded the 737 MAX aircraft, citing satellite data and evidence from the scene that indicated some similarities and ""the possibility of a shared cause"" with October's crash in Indonesia that killed 189 people.
Though it maintains the planes are safe, Boeing has supported the FAA move. Its stock is down about 11 percent since the crash, wiping more than $26 billion off its market value. It fell 1 percent on Thursday.
U.S. and Canadian carriers wrestled with customer calls and flight cancellations and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and American Airlines Group Inc, the largest U.S. operators of the 737 MAX, said they had started flying empty MAX aircraft to be parked elsewhere during the ban.
U.S. President Donald Trump, an aviation enthusiast with deep ties to Boeing, said he hoped the suspensions would be short. ""They have to figure it out fast,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. 
A software fix for the 737 MAX that Boeing has been working on since the Lion Air crash in October in Indonesia will take months to complete, the FAA said on Wednesday.
And in what may presage a raft of claims, Norwegian Air has said it will seek compensation from Boeing for costs and lost revenue after grounding its fleet of 737 MAX. 
Japan became the latest nation to suspend the 737 MAX planes on Thursday. And airline Garuda Indonesia said there was a possibility it would cancel its 20-strong order of 737 MAXs.
WHAT HAPPENED?
Under international rules, Ethiopians are leading the investigation but France's BEA will conduct black box analysis as an adviser. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was also sending three investigators to assist.
Only France and the United States have the experience gleaned from being present at almost every crash involving an Airbus or Boeing respectively. 
The cause of the Indonesian crash is still being investigated. A November preliminary report, before the retrieval of the cockpit voice recorder, focused on maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor, but gave no reason for the crash.

The pilot of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 had reported internal control problems and received permission to return, before the plane came down and burst into a fireball on arid farmland.

(Reuters) - LVMH's Sephora beauty chain ended its partnership with Olivia Jade following a massive college cheating scandal involving her celebrity parents who were charged this week in an alleged scheme to help rich Americans get their children into elite universities.
""After careful review of recent developments, we have made the decision to end the Sephora Collection partnership with Olivia Jade, effective immediately,"" a Sephora spokesperson wrote to Reuters in an email on Thursday. 
Olivia Giannulli, the 19-year-old daughter of ""Full House"" actress Lori Loughlin and designer Mossimo Giannulli, is a social media ""influencer"" who goes by the name Olivia Jade online. 
Products from her makeup collaboration had been removed from Sephora's website by Thursday afternoon. It was not immediately clear whether her products were available in stores.
A representative for Jade could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Jade, who has more than 3 million followers on Instagram and YouTube combined, received backlash online shortly after details of the fraud scheme emerged along with old videos in which she stated that she does not ""care about school.""
Loughlin and Giannulli were accused on Tuesday of paying bribes of $500,000 in a scheme that involved cheating on college entrance exams to help their daughters, Olivia and Isabella Giannulli, get into the University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California, according to court documents.
Loughlin and Giannulli were taken into federal custody and later released on separate $1 million bonds on Wednesday. 
The couple are among 50 people charged on Tuesday with taking part in a scam that steered graduating high school students into elite universities, including Yale, Georgetown and Stanford, by cheating the admissions process. Prosecutors called it the largest such scandal in U.S. history. 

Some of Jade's online videos and photos were paid partnerships with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co.. Representatives from those two companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 05:28PM ET</span>",Nine banks win dismissal of Canadian rate-rigging lawsuit in U.S.,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit by investors that accused nine large banks, including six from Canada, of conspiring to manipulate a Canadian rate benchmark to improve profits from derivatives trading.
U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres rejected racketeering and antitrust claims by the lead plaintiff, the Fire & Police Pension Association of Colorado, against Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia and other banks.
Lawyers for the plaintiff did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The proposed class action concerned the alleged suppression from August 2007 to June 2014 of the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate (CDOR), a rate at which banks would lend to corporate clients using bankers' acceptances, a short-term credit instrument.
CDOR, now called the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, is calculated daily by Thomson Reuters based on rate submissions from banks.
The plaintiff accused banks of manipulating CDOR to reduce interest owed to investors on CDOR-based derivatives transactions in the United States, including swaps and Canadian dollar futures contracts, and boost profit.
But the judge said the alleged wrongful conduct occurred in Canada, which is not covered by the U.S. anti-racketeering law known as RICO, and the plaintiff failed to show that any rigging left it worse off.
Torres also found no proof of a common profit motive among banks to suppress CDOR because they held more CDOR-based derivative contracts, under which they made interest payments, than CDOR-based loans, on which they received interest payments.
Other defendants included Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA).
Canadian regulators updated the CDOR-setting process after the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada in January 2013 identified ""potential"" for manipulation.

The case is Fire & Police Pension Association of Colorado v Bank of Montreal et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 18-00342.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 slipped on Thursday, snapping a three-day streak of gains, as uncertainty over when a trade deal between the United States and China would be reached left investors on edge.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that discussions with China to end a months-long trade war are progressing quickly, though Trump said he could not say whether a final deal would be reached.
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had been expected to hold a summit in Florida this month, but no date has been set. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters there ""were rumblings"" about a possible meeting late next month. 
Bloomberg reported on Thursday that a meeting between the two was more likely to take place in April at the earliest.
Chipmakers, which rely on China for a large portion of their revenue, lost ground, with the Philadelphia SE chip index off 0.6 percent.
""The good news is mildly negative news on China trade doesn't tip the apple cart over anymore,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""But breaking out of the next level of resistance has been a wall to get through. It shows we're probably range-bound 2,750 to 2,800 until we get answers to China trade, Brexit etc.,"" he said, referring to the level of the S&P 500.
In the latest of a series of votes, British lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to seek a delay in Britain's exit from the European Union.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.05 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,709.94, the S&P 500 lost 2.44 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,808.48, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.50 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,630.91.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, slipped 1 percent. The world's largest planemaker had its own troubles this week after its money-spinning 737 MAX jets were grounded globally following a fatal crash in Ethiopia on Sunday.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) shares fell 1.8 percent to $170.17 after the world's largest social network suffered a major outage that frustrated users across the globe for about 24 hours. Facebook said it had restored the service to its main app and Instagram.
After the bell, Facebook's stock was down 1.5 percent after Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said in a blog post that chief product officer Chris Cox will leave the social media network.
Shares of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) were down 2.1 percent in extended trading after the company gave a disappointing revenue forecast for the current quarter as it reported quarterly results.
During the regular session,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) shares rose 2.8 percent to $10.30 after Chief Executive Larry Culp set conservative profit targets for this year and vowed for a better 2020 and beyond.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 1.1 percent to $183.73, extending recent gains, after brokerage Cowen and Co started coverage with an ""outperform"" rating. An Apple-led technology rally has propped up markets recently.
On the economic front, a U.S. Commerce Department report showed sales of new single-family homes fell more than expected in January, suggesting that housing market weakness persisted early in the first quarter.
The PHLX housing index dipped 0.5 percent on the news.
The downbeat housing data followed tame inflation reports this week, which underscored the Federal Reserve's patient stance on future interest rate hikes.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.33-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 46 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.69 billion shares, compared to the 7.37 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Thursday it was pausing deliveries of its 737 MAX aircraft to customers following the grounding of the jetliner around the world, as the world's largest planemaker responds to its worst crises in years.
The 737 MAX has been banned from flying in most countries after an Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday that killed all 157 people on board. This was a second deadly incident involving the relatively new Boeing model in five months. In October, a Lion Air jet crashed in Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board. 
Boeing said it had paused deliveries of its fastest-selling 737 MAX jetliner built at its factory near Seattle because of the temporary grounding order by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, confirming a Reuters report from Wednesday.
""We continue to build 737 MAX airplanes while assessing how the situation, including potential capacity constraints, will impact our production system,"" Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers said.

Boeing said it would continue its production rate of 52 aircraft per month, though its MAX version would not be delivered to airlines or leasing companies.

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Tech makes a comeback as Wall Street's trendy trade,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street's beloved tech trade is back on. 
U.S. technology stocks this week took back their title as the stock market's most profitable bet of the year, and the so-called FANG stocks have regained their shine after investors dumped the high-flying group in December over fears that the decade-old bull market was dying. 
San Francisco's unicorn startups are pouncing on tech's newfound momentum. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc is planning to kick off a long-awaited initial public offering in April, Reuters reported on Thursday.
That puts Uber close on the heels of smaller rival Lyft Inc, which released its filing for an initial public offering at the start of March following two solid months for technology stocks. The Nasdaq index is now on track for its strongest quarter since 2012, rebounding from its worst quarter since 2008.
""There was a lot of forced de-risking by hedge funds in December,"" said Joel Kulina, a trader at Wedbush Securities who specializes in tech stocks. ""Now there's a lot of FOMO,"" or ""fear of missing out,"" he said, a familiar motivation among U.S. investors in recent years. 
The S&P 500 information technology index has surged 3.6 percent so far this week and is up 16.4 percent year to date, edging out a 15.4 percent gain in the industrial index, which led since February but was held back this week by a slump in Boeing (NYSE:BA). 
In another sign of turning sentiment, the FANG stocks - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - each logged year-to-date gains on Monday that were better than the S&P 500, a first in 2019.
Investors dumped technology and FANG stocks late last year due to deepening fears that the Federal Reserve would further raise interest rates and concerns that the China-U.S. trade conflict would escalate further and hurt corporate profits. 
But the Federal Reserve in January signaled that rate hikes were essentially off the table for the time being, removing Wall Street's largest source of anxiety.
Facebook remains 22 percent below its July 2018 record high as it faces ongoing scrutiny of its handling of users' personal data, but the social network's shares have risen 30 percent since December, reflecting a rebuilding of investor confidence. 
Netflix has gained 34 percent in 2019, even after its December-quarter revenue disappointed investors, and as it faces increasing competition from rivals including Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, and potentially Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Many investors are also becoming more confident that Washington and Beijing will resolve their trade dispute, opening the way for technology companies' earnings to grow this year, instead of declining, as currently projected by sell-side analysts.
""We're in a waiting game,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ""Neither side wants this to continue much longer. The Chinese economy is slipping and the president wants a victory. Both sides are motivated to resolve this."" 
EYE ON M&A
After sweeping U.S. corporate tax cuts helped fuel a 24 percent rise in S&P 500 technology sector companies' earnings per share last year, tech companies' earnings are now expected on average to shrink by about 1 percent in 2019, according to Refinitiv's IBES data. 
Analysts based that expected decline on recent guidance from companies feeling the pinch from the trade war, and those outlooks could quickly change if the conflict is resolved, Hogan said.
Chipmaker Nvidia's $6.8 billion acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, announced on Monday, has increased speculation about more technology M&A.
With Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closing the gap on Amazon.com's leadership in cloud computing, and Alphabet far behind, the fast-expanding cloud-computing industry is an obvious place to watch for more deals, Kulina said. 
Underscoring the cloud industry's hyper growth, database seller MongoDB's strong quarterly report sent its shares up 25.6 percent on Thursday to a record high, with other cloud players also rising, including ServiceNow, Twilio and Appian.
The ISE Cloud Computing index is up 18 percent so far in 2019. 

The Philadelphia Semiconductor index has gained 17 percent, even as uncertainly drags on related to a slump in demand, with many investors betting on an eventual resolution of the trade conflict and on a surge in business related to the upcoming rollout of 5G wireless communication technology.

MONTREAL/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. and Canadian carriers wrestled with customer calls and flight cancellations on Thursday after the two countries followed other nations in grounding Boeing's 737 MAX planes because of safety concerns.
Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, the largest operator of the 737 MAX in the world with 34 jets, said it was experiencing unusually high call volumes and had canceled 39 MAX flights. 
The low-cost carrier, a launch customer of the MAX 8 in 2017, said it was servicing those flights with available 737-700s and 737-800s.
Canada and the United States announced on Wednesday they would ground the MAX planes, citing new satellite data and evidence from the scene of an Ethiopian Airlines plane crash on Sunday that killed 157 people.
American Airlines Group Inc, with 24 MAX 8s, planned to cancel around 85 flights per day as a result of the ban, while servicing some of those flights with other aircraft such as the 737-800. 
Air Canada, the country's largest carrier, which operated 24 MAX jets had a message on its customer service line saying that because of ""unforeseen circumstances,"" call volumes temporarily exceeded its capacity to answer or place calls on hold.
Air Canada could not be reached for comment on Thursday. In a statement on Wednesday, the Montreal-based carrier said it operated 75 737MAX flights daily out of a total schedule of approximately 1,600 daily flights system-wide, representing less than six percent of the network's total flying.
WestJet Airlines, Canada's second-largest carrier which operated 13 MAX jets, said it canceled 11 flights on Thursday impacting 1,200 passengers, but would re-book more than three-quarters of them by the end of the day.
According to estimates from the IBA Group, the direct costs to airlines for suspending the MAX would be around $150,000 per day per leased aircraft grounded. Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 8 and 9 planes will remain grounded for ""weeks"" at a minimum until a software upgrade could be tested and installed in all of the planes, U.S. lawmakers said on Thursday.

Southwest and American each said on Thursday they were flying empty MAX aircraft to be parked at different maintenance locations during the ban.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Gazprombank, Russia's third biggest lender by assets, has sold its indirect stake in the Petrozamora joint venture in Venezuela, a source at the bank said on Thursday.
Gazprombank, in a written reply to Reuters questions, confirmed it had quit the Petrozamora joint venture, but gave no further details. The venture's majority owner, Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA, is under U.S. sanctions. 
Gazprombank has a minority stake in a firm called GPB Global Resources which in turn owns 40 percent of Petrozamora, according to the GPB Global Resources website. 
PDVSA owns the remaining 60 percent in Petrozamora, which was set up in 2012 initially to develop two Venezuelan oil fields, the website said. The number of fields has since increased. 
""An indirect minority stake in Petrozamora JV was sold to a group of investors which have no connection to the Gazprombank group,"" the source in the bank said. ""As a result, Gazprombank now has no investment projects in Venezuela.""
The identity of the buyer was unknown. The source said that Gazprombank has sold its stake in GPB GR as well. GBP GR did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for a comment.
In November 2013, Gazprombank, GPB GR, Petrozamora and PDVSA signed an oil prepayment facility of up to $1 billion to finance the investment program and operational activity of Petrozamora JV. 
Russia is a major investor in Venezuela but this poses risks to Russian companies now that the United States has imposed sanctions on PDVSA and other entities linked to it. Some Russian firms are trying to reduce their exposure. 
Gazprombank decided to freeze the accounts of PDVSA and halted transactions with the firm, a Gazprombank source told Reuters last month.
Russia's second biggest bank, VTB, has begun procedures to hand over its stake in a Russian-Venezuelan bank, Evrofinance Mosnarbank, to the Russian state property agency, sources familiar with the deal told Reuters this week.
The United States imposed tough, new financial sanctions on Jan. 28 aimed at blocking Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro's access to the country's oil revenue as its aimed to support Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaido.
Russia's Rosneft, the world's top listed oil company by output which has lent billions of U.S. dollars to Venezuela in the past and has a number of upstream projects in the country, continues its operations and to receive oil from PDVSA.
According to lawyers and traders, the terms of the sanctions mean that Rosneft can continue its oil and oil product operations with PDVSA at least until April 28.

However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week accused Rosneft of providing a financial lifeline to the administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who Washington says is no longer the legitimate head of state.

1096,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 03:20PM ET</span>",A Declawed Fed Is All That Matters to a Lot of Bulls,"(Bloomberg) -- You’ve heard all the warnings. Economic growth is wobbly, earnings estimates are down, the trade war rages on. From a vocal category of investors on Wall Street, a rebuttal: Who cares?
There’s no point worrying about stuff that failed to move stocks for years, when the one thing that has -- Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve -- was beaten into submission. A corps of steadfast bulls has decided the only meaningful thing they’ve seen over the past five months is the triumph of doves at the central bank.
After all, it was only last September that Powell himself framed overheating asset prices as the biggest threat markets were likely to pose to the U.S. economy. Now, after a 10,000-point round-trip in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, asset prices are near where they began. What’s gone is any sense the Fed means what it says when it says it’s getting tough.
“At the end of the day, when push comes to shove, the Fed acquiesces to whatever the market’s view is,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co., which manages about $125 billion. “Which is what happened. The Fed’s economic outlook I don’t believe changed all that much, but the market convinced them that they were wrong.”
Around Wall Street, they’re on board with the rally. Ned Davis Research upgraded U.S. stocks in early February, saying “don’t fight the Fed.” UBS Group AG’s Keith Parker forecasts stocks will reach new highs by June, citing a patient central bank. And Tony Dwyer at Canaccord Genuity expects a sustained market rally, giving significant credit to Powell’s pivot.
To be sure, it’s far from a unanimous view. DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach said this week that stocks are in a bear market and will probably plunge back below last year’s Christmas Eve low at some point in 2019. Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer for First American Trust, shares the opinion.
“We still think we’re looking at a bear market here,” said Braakman, whose firm manages $1.5 billion. “When you look at what’s working in the market versus what’s struggling, we still see a setup where GDP is slowing, inflation is slowing.”
But neither is raging bullishness an outlier on Wall Street, which has shown itself willing to live with sluggish growth for a decade. Among 25 equity strategists tracked by Bloomberg, forecasts for end-of-year S&P 500 range as high as 3,250, roughly a 15 percent increase from now. Seven are at 3,000 or above.
At the crux of the debate is Powell’s willingness to acknowledge the market’s temper in moderating his hawkishness. He had a chance to stand firm in the face of fairly ordinary turbulence, and didn’t. In relenting, some critics warn, he’s diluted his ability to put a brake on upward volatility that will one day create a bubble.
It had been the risk of markets going berserk to the upside that had most visibly worried the Fed chairman prior to the end of last year. When the Fed raised rates for the first time under Powell’s purview, the chairman described “moderate vulnerabilities” by way of elevated asset prices. Back in September, Powell told business leaders equity prices were high, and while he didn’t see “high vulnerabilities,” prudence was warranted.
All that changed in January, when the chairman put new significance on market volatility -- some even designating sanguine stocks as the Fed’s “third mandate.” Various members have expressed comfort with inflation going considerably higher, with Powell saying Friday that “we need to make sure inflation doesn’t keep slipping” toward nothing.
“The message from the Fed -- that they’re going to tolerate an inflation overshoot -- that message will become more clear in the coming months,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). “They’re in the process of reevaluating their framework. That’s a pretty friendly message out of the Fed.”
Equity valuations could expand mightily, some say. According to Nathan Thooft, Manulife Asset Management’s head of global asset allocation, it’s not unrealistic that stocks trade at a price-earnings ratio as high as 20 when financial conditions are this loose. With earnings for companies in the S&P 500 expected to come in at $167.50 a share this year, that results in an S&P 500 at 3,350, up 20 percent from current levels.
And while the stock rally paused last week, it’s back on now. The S&P 500 just saw three straight days of gains, the strongest advance since early February, with technology stocks again leading the way. The Cboe Volatility Index, or the VIX, is also down, touching the lowest levels since the start of October.
“More likely than not in my view the Fed is going to ignore inflation to an extent, and they’ll let it run hot,” Thooft said. “When you have a Fed turning as accomodative as they have, and the market’s perception being even more accommodative than they probably even are given where the Fed pricing is looking out the next 12 months, that typically warrants an environment where you would trade at a higher equity valuation.”
Of course, Powell has pivoted before, and may do it again.
“If we did see a situation where stock prices surged and credit spreads went down to levels that we saw pre-financial crisis, that would play a role in whether they would be open to hiking rates again,” said Ed Campbell, a managing director and portfolio manager for QMA. “We’ve seen with Chairman Powell that he is swayed by what’s happening in asset prices, at least in one direction. We’ll see going forward, if we ever do get a situation where things get bubbly on the upside, whether that plays a role in policy going forward.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The fall in Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares has made the stock's valuation less expensive but that may not make it an obvious buy for investors.
The planemaker's shares have fallen 11 percent this week after a Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday that killed 157 people prompted the grounding of Boeing's global 737 MAX fleet. Boeing shares were down 0.5 percent $375.09 on Thursday afternoon.
The declines come after a run for Boeing shares that saw the price more than double over the past two years, making the company the largest U.S. industrial firm by market value. 
GRAPHIC-Boeing's soaring market value: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Cv0UyP
GRAPHIC-Boeing shares double over 2 years: https://tmsnrt.rs/2CiV8zY
This week's slide means the stock as of Wednesday was trading at about 18.2 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv data. That valuation is in line with its average forward P/E ratio over the past five years and well below the 20.5 times the stock was trading at a week ago.
But whether that means the stock is actually cheap at these levels could depend on the extent of the financial fallout from the crash, which investors and analysts were still assessing.
For example, according to Refinitiv data, the consensus analyst estimate for Boeing's earnings per share this year, which calls for 26 percent growth, has not changed this week amid the evolving fallout for the company.
Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 9 planes will remain grounded for ""weeks"" at a minimum until a software upgrade could be tested and installed in all of the planes, U.S. lawmakers said on Thursday.
Nancy Tengler, chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management in Phoenix, which bought shares more than three years ago and has since seen the stock climb, said she was neither selling nor buying the stock this week.
“It’s fully-valued, based on what we know,"" Tengler said. ""If people start yanking orders ... then the valuation might be a little bit high.""
""This is going to be one of those restarts for the company,"" she added.
GRAPHIC - Boeing valuation: https://tmsnrt.rs/2O6oKWa
Analysts were seeking to determine the bottom-line implications for Boeing, especially since Sunday's was the second such crash involving the planemaker's flagship new model in six months.
The 737 MAX is Boeing's largest contributor of product revenue and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Noah Poponak.
Poponak estimates the MAX jet will account for 45 percent of total Boeing EBIT over the next five years.
""We believe investors were pricing in very limited risk to the 737 ramp-up profile, which now has greater risk within the wide range of possible outcomes following these incidents,"" Poponak said in a research note.
JP Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said the situation could hurt Boeing's cash flow in three ways: compensation of airlines for grounded planes; delays of deliveries of the jet; and any modifications for the aircraft.
""The situation will hopefully move forward sooner rather than later, with a path back into service, though we do not know how long this will take,"" Seifman said in a note.
Even with the latest uncertainty and declines, Boeing shares were up 16 percent in 2019 as of Thursday afternoon.
Through Wednesday, Boeing shares had contributed more to the 10.2-percent gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2019 than any of the other 30 components of the blue-chip index, according to Bespoke Investment Group.
Following Wednesday's decision by U.S. aviation regulators to ground the planes, Boeing shares appeared to be stabilizing, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
""It seems like the worst is over for Boeing, and the fact that the U.S. fleet is grounded means they have time to come up with for a fix for this,"" Ghriskey said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may sue the German automaker over its failure to disclose its diesel emissions scandal to investors.
VW said in its annual report https:// released earlier this week that the SEC probe focuses on the automaker's nondisclosure of ""certain Volkswagen diesel vehicles' noncompliance"" with U.S. emissions rules. 
Volkswagen did not have an immediate comment.
Volkswagen has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States in connection with ""Dieselgate"" for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, and has offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. 
VW admitted in September 2015 to secretly installing software in nearly 500,000 U.S. vehicles to cheat government exhaust emissions tests and pleaded guilty in 2017 to felony charges. In total, 13 people have been charged in the United States, including four Audi managers. 
Regulators and investors have sought penalties and damages from Volkswagen, arguing the carmaker should have informed investors in a more timely fashion about the size and scope of fines related to its diesel emissions cheating scandal. German securities law requires Volkswagen to publish market sensitive news in a timely fashion.
Volkswagen admitted to U.S. regulators to having used an illegal “defeat device” on Sept. 3, 2015 but did not inform investors. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California’s Air Resources Board made VW’s cheating public on Sept. 18, 2015.
Volkswagen has argued that it was not obliged to inform investors earlier because it did not believe it was facing fines in totaling billions of dollars.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 02:53PM ET</span>",Special Report: How Russia sank billions of dollars into Venezuela quicksand,"By Christian Lowe and Rinat Sagdiev
MOSCOW (Reuters) - At the end of 2015, managers at Rosneft, the Russian state-controlled oil firm, sounded the alarm to their bosses about the company's investments in Venezuela. Rosneft's local partner, Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, owed it hundreds of millions of dollars, according to internal documents, and there seemed no prospect things would get better.
""It will be like this for eternity,"" a Rosneft internal auditor wrote in an email to a colleague in November 2015, complaining there was no progress in getting PDVSA to explain a $700 million hole in the balance sheet of a joint venture.
The email was among scores of internal Rosneft communications - including presentations, copies of official letters, memos and spreadsheets – reviewed by Reuters. They cover the firm's operations in Venezuela between 2012 and 2015.
It was a period when other international oil companies had either quit the country or were freezing new onshore investments, worried about the policies of the populist socialist administration. But Rosneft, majority owned by the Russian state, doubled down, increasing its stakes in joint ventures with PDVSA and lending more, the documents show. Rosneft was standing by its Venezuelan partner just as the Kremlin was supporting leader Hugo Chavez and his successor as president, Nicolas Maduro.
Rosneft has poured around $9 billion into Venezuelan projects since 2010 but has yet to break even, Reuters has calculated, based on Rosneft's annual reports, its public disclosures and the internal documents.
The Rosneft documents also reveal:
- The Russians believed they were owed hundreds of millions of dollars from their joint ventures with PDVSA.
- Oil output at the joint ventures was far lower than projected.
- The joint ventures struggled to get hold of basic drilling equipment.
- The Russians believed PDVSA spent millions of dollars from one joint venture on ""social projects"" in a remote area where just a few hundred people lived.
- Managers brought the problems to the attention of Rosneft's chief executive, Igor Sechin, who ordered measures to right the ship.
Since late 2015, the end of the period covered by the documents, some of Rosneft's problems have eased because it has taken greater shareholder and operational control of its interests. But it remains deeply invested in a company and a country that are in crisis.
The reason Rosneft kept doubling down on its bet was political, according to two people close to the firm and two others with links to the Venezuela projects. State-owned Rosneft was expected to help prop up Moscow's allies in Caracas, these sources said.
""From the very beginning it was a purely political project. We all had to contribute,"" said an executive at a Russian oil firm that partnered with Rosneft in Venezuela.
The Russian who oversees this strategic business relationship is one of President Vladimir Putin's closest lieutenants: Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin. The two men have known each other since at least the early 1990s when they worked in the mayor's office of their native St Petersburg. When Putin went to Moscow to become a mid-ranking official in the presidential administration, Sechin went with him.
""I liked him,"" Putin told authors of a book about his life. ""When I moved to Moscow, Sechin asked to come with me. I took him.""
A bust of Hugo Chavez greets visitors to Rosneft's offices in Caracas. Sechin often asks to see messages to Maduro before they are sent and adds the phrase: ""Viva la Revolucion!"" a former Rosneft employee said.
Russia views its relationship with Caracas as a way to project power into Washington's backyard, according to Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at Carnegie Moscow Center, a think tank. Venezuela is a big buyer of Russian weapons. The billions of dollars that Rosneft has invested in Venezuela are an added incentive for Moscow to keep standing by its old ally.
The story of Rosneft's troubled partnership comes at a time of deepening crisis inside Venezuela's giant oil company. The country's fortunes are closely tied to those of PDVSA, which accounts for 90 percent of the nation's export revenues. The Rosneft documents provide fresh evidence of long-term mismanagement at PDVSA, helping explain an economic collapse that has left millions struggling to eat.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on March 11 Rosneft continued to buy crude oil from Venezuela and to ""throw a lifeline to the regime."" But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Rosneft was driven by the interests of its shareholders. He denied the Kremlin applied pressure on the firm to invest in Venezuela.
""First and foremost, Rosneft works as a commercial company in all corners of the world, and it works seeking commercial profit. Therefore this is what they do in Venezuela,"" Peskov said in reply to questions from Reuters. ""Naturally such major projects are planned for the long term. As for assessments of the profitability of the projects, that's for the company itself, it's not a question for us.""
Neither Rosneft nor PDVSA responded to requests for comment for this article.
MISSING PARTS AND MISSED DEADLINES
In September 2012, at a drilling site in the Orinoco basin, Rosneft's Sechin filled a jar with crude oil and lifted it into the air to mark the moment his firm joined the ranks of global oil majors. Rosneft was part of a Russian consortium that had acquired a 40 percent share in Venezuela's Junin-6 oilfield. PDVSA held the other 60 percent.
Rosneft already pumped oil from its home fields in Siberia; now it had an overseas presence too, tapping into some of the world's biggest crude oil reserves on the banks of the Orinoco River. ""Today is indeed an historic day,"" Sechin told Russian state television at the ceremony to mark the start of production. ""Russian companies have now proved their right to be among the leaders of the global oil sector.""
Yet soon after Sechin spoke, Rosneft's foray into the Orinoco basin was running into problems, the documents reviewed by Reuters show.
In November 2012, without asking its Russian partners, PDVSA shut down one of the four drilling rigs at Junin-6 and removed it, a report by the Russian consortium found that year. Local people staged protests that further blocked work. By the end of 2012, just six wells had been drilled, far short of the project's target of 47.
Spare parts for drilling at Junin-6 were procured from a PDVSA unit called Bariven; but getting equipment from Bariven took 10 to 18 months, according to the documents. Drilling rigs were not operating 37 percent of the time. It took on average 49 days to drill a single well, instead of the anticipated 22 days. PDVSA did not respond to questions about the delays.
Junin-6 production forecasts were cut. Rosneft had said in September 2012 that the field would deliver 20,000 barrels per day by the end of the year. In fact, over the whole of 2012 it yielded only 21,400 barrels.
Three years on, there was little sign of improvement. A Rosneft report covering the first three quarters of 2015 cited well construction ""of an unsatisfactory quality"" and ""non-optimal trajectories"" of wells.
By the end of 2015, the forecast for peak oil output from Junin-6 had been slashed from 450,000 barrels per day to 250,000 barrels per day. Rosneft's flagship project had lost its luster.
Problems remain across the Orinoco Basin, according to union leaders who spoke to Reuters. They said that in fields east of Junin, only a handful of the dozens of drilling rigs are working at any one time. Workers complain they don't have basic equipment such as boots, gloves and helmets. The situation in PDVSA offices is no better. Paper is in short supply. In a vain effort to stem a worker exodus, some HR departments display ""No resignation"" signs.
Nor is life in Venezuela easy for Rosneft staff. There is often no mains water in the high-end Caracas district where they live, said a Russian who knows families there. A couple of times a week, a water tanker arrives and fills up containers in each apartment.
Two of Rosneft's Russian partners in Junin-6 dropped out. The smaller Surgutneftegaz decided to quit the project in November 2012. In December 2014, Russia's second biggest oil firm, Lukoil, announced it too was dropping out. ""Looking back, a lot of people at Lukoil breathed a sigh of relief that they didn't have to pile billions into Venezuela,"" said an executive in the Junin-6 consortium.
Surgutneftegaz did not respond to a request for comment. Lukoil declined to comment.
Rosneft bought out the Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil stakes for upward of $300 million, analysts estimated, deepening its exposure to Venezuela. It also acquired a stake belonging to TNK-BP when it purchased the Russian-British firm in a $55 billion deal in 2013. That left Gazpromneft, the oil unit of state-owned gas firm Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), as Rosneft's sole remaining Russian partner in Junin-6. Gazpromneft did not reply to Reuters' questions.
Rosneft also had four smaller oil projects with PDVSA at that time. All were experiencing problems during this period, the Rosneft internal reports show. Two of the projects, Carabobo and Petromonagas, are in the Orinoco basin; Boqueron is in the east near the Atlantic coast; Petroperija is on the Caribbean coast.
Rosneft internal reports from 2015 concluded that crude flow rates envisaged in the contract for the Carabobo fields were ""not achievable."" At Petromonagas, poor quality work caused drilling delays. At Petroperija, production was falling and the joint venture did not have the cash to buy essential pumping equipment. At the Boqueron field, a broken compressor, a device to raise gas pressure, could not be fixed because the joint venture's bank account was empty.
MONEY TROUBLES
If getting oil out of its projects was a struggle for Rosneft, so was extracting revenue, the documents show.
The Russian consortium's report into operations at Junin-6 in 2012 found that PDVSA had taken $12 million from the Junin-6 budget, without Rosneft's agreement, for social spending on local people. Only 350 people lived in the area covered by the concession - some 447 square kilometers of hilly scrubland on the northern bank of the Orinoco River.
In the second half of 2014, Rosneft ordered an audit of the Junin-6 project to check for ""distortion of financial accounting"" and ""unjustified expenditures."" Reuters couldn't determine that audit's conclusions.
Rosneft managers ordered the company's own auditors to investigate money flows between PDVSA and the Petromonagas, Petroperija and Boqueron joint ventures, internal documents relating to the audit show. The audit concluded that PDVSA had understated earnings from Petromonagas oil sales by some $700 million. PDVSA challenged this figure, another document shows, and it was revised to $500 million.
In a document dated April 30, 2015, Sechin, Rosneft's chief executive, approved the findings of the audit, and a plan to protect Rosneft's investments with a series of measures to be implemented by the end of May that year.
The measures included installing metering stations to monitor how much oil was being pumped to customers, and therefore how much money the ventures should be earning. Rosneft wanted an independent assessor to track how the joint ventures spent money. And it wanted PDVSA to stop hiring its own subsidiaries without signing a contract. Reuters couldn't determine whether the measures were put into action. 
A few months later, in October 2015, Rosneft First Vice President Eric Liron reported to Sechin that there was still disagreement with PDVSA on settling accounts with the joint ventures. Liron wrote in a memo to Sechin: ""As of 15.08.2015, PDVSA is in technical default.""
Months of efforts to get the money – in which Rosneft's Venezuela office and senior executives at headquarters engaged in negotiations with PDVSA officials – went nowhere. The Rosneft internal auditor stated in the November 2015 email to his colleague that the problem was ""unresolved because of the poor financial health of our partner"" - a reference to PDVSA.
Discussing a proposal to push the internal deadline for fixing the problem to a later date, the auditor asked sardonically what would be the point. ""Will it (PDVSA) return to health by then, or will it die and the question will no longer be relevant?"" he wrote in the same email.
The auditor left Rosneft in 2016, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. He did not respond to a message seeking comment.
Rosneft was supposed to receive its share of the revenue from oil sales in the form of dividends. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, Rosneft internal presentations showed that the company was owed dividends from three of its joint ventures. The total shortfall was $337 million. The presentations listed among the strategic aims of each of the three projects: ""Receiving unpaid dividends"" from PDVSA.
Since the period covered by the documents, Rosneft has acted to take greater control of its investments, for example by bringing in its own contractors. Rosneft says PDVSA has paid off much of its debt. In a financial report released on Feb. 5, 2019, Rosneft said the loans it extended to PDVSA, which had totaled about $6.5 billion, were now down to $2.3 billion.
But serious challenges remain.
Rosneft's own reports and assessments by energy analysts show the company's projects in Venezuela are today still producing less oil than originally anticipated, with development plans either shelved or behind schedule.

Rosneft's flagship joint venture in Venezuela, the Junin-6 field, is still stuck in the exploration and test production phase, Rosneft wrote in its 2017 annual report. An executive at Russian partner Gazpromneft went further, saying the project is now ""commercially pointless."" The executive did not elaborate. Rosneft did not reply to Reuters questions about the commercial viability of the project.

MADRID (Reuters) - Former BBVA (MC:BBVA) head Francisco Gonzalez said on Thursday he would temporarily step down as honorary chairman to avoid any harm to the Spanish bank's reputation during an inquiry into alleged spying.
Gonzalez announced his decision a day ahead of BBVA's annual shareholders meeting in a letter to the board and addressed to Carlos Torres, his successor as the bank's executive chairman.
The veteran banker, who is known widely in Spanish business circles by his initials ""FG"", also resigned temporarily as honorary head of BBVA's foundation.
""In order to avoid the use of my person to harm the entity, I have decided to temporarily leave my positions in the foundation and the bank while investigations are ongoing"", Gonzalez said in the letter, which was seen by Reuters.
The inquiry is related to contracts with a jailed ex-police chief, Jose Manuel Villarejo, whom news reports said the bank hired to spy on top executives of a potential buyer, construction company Sacyr, in 2004 when Gonzalez was BBVA's executive chairman.
The bank has officially acknowledged that it hired Grupo Cenyt, a security firm owned by Villarejo who was arrested in 2017 as part of a separate investigation and remains in jail. 
Torres, who replaced Gonzalez as executive chairman in January, has said that Cenyt provided various services to BBVA, but that the bank had found no evidence of spying.
In his letter, Gonzalez said he had ordered the internal investigation into BBVA's relationship with Villarejo in June 2018 to ensure that the bank had complied with the law and transparency rules.
Gonzalez said that among the biggest challenges that BBVA faced when he was at the helm was the ""attempt by Sacyr to take over the bank with the inexplicable collaboration of the government, which did not come to the rescue of the institution as it should have done"".
The European Central Bank (ECB) has recently expressed concerns over press reports that BBVA hired Villarejo to investigate executives of Sacyr and senior government officials as part of efforts to stop a takeover bid by the company.
The alleged spying case is not on the agenda of Friday's shareholders meeting, but the Spanish Association of Minority Shareholders (AEMEC), expect investors to voice their concerns over the reputational damage to the bank.
Gonzalez, who began his professional career in 1964 as a programmer, became chairman of Argentaria in 1996 before it merged with BBV in 1999, and has been widely credited as being behind the bank's digital transformation.

His resignation as honorary chairman has to be signed off by BBVA's board ahead of the shareholders meeting.

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 02:46PM ET</span>","General Electric CEO sets low 2019 profit targets, vows better from 2020","By Alwyn Scott and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co Chief Executive Larry Culp on Thursday set conservative profit targets for this year and staked his reputation on hitting them and doing better in 2020 and beyond, igniting a rally in the stock.
Culp's detailed pep talk, which drew praise from Wall Street analysts on a conference call, swiftly reversed an earlier rout in the stock as he stressed GE was serious about its targets after years of missing profit expectations.
The forecast was low largely because GE will be spending $2.5 billion on restructuring this year, Culp said, adding the investment would pay off after a tough 2019.
""This is what constitutes a 'reset,'"" Culp said, using a word many analysts had longed to hear. 
""The market should interpret a high level of conviction (in the forecast) simply because this team, in a public forum, is laying this roadmap out, mindful of the realities of 2019 but I think also optimistic ... about the impact of what we're doing.""
Culp did not soft-pedal the short-term pain. He said 2019 adjusted profit would be 50 cents to 60 cents a share, below analyst estimates of 70 cents, and GE could lose as much as $2 billion in cash from its industrial businesses, putting a number on a warning he issued last week.
The company expects free cash flow at GE Power to remain negative in 2020 before turning positive in 2021. 
Investors are looking closely at GE's cash and earnings after the company lost nearly $23 billion last year.
The outlook is ""arguably better than expected,"" said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. 
The company did not make reference to any potential hit to its jet engine unit from the recent global grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX aircraft. GE and partner  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA make the engine that powers all 737 MAX planes.
GE shares were up 2.9 percent at $10.31 in afternoon trading, after falling 4 percent in premarket activity shortly after the forecast was released. GE bonds also rose slightly.
""While lowered guidance is not a positive, we think GE's plan and progress show it's moving in the right direction,"" said Jim Corridore, analyst at CFRA.
Culp also left considerable wiggle room in the forecast by including an unspecified amount of ""contingency"" money to cover hard-to-predict costs, such as when it will conclude big asset sales and how its power unit will perform.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Stephen Tusa voiced concern that the gap between GE's cash flow and earnings forecasts was the widest he had seen, which likely will mean analysts' profit estimates are too high.

Culp said that although GE was taking ""a safe conservative posture in this reset year ... Rest assured, operationally, we're running hard.""

1102,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 02:43PM ET</span>","Bribing your way to college? Check your math, it may not pay","By Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider
SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Experts agree that college pays off. But at any price? 
More than two dozen wealthy families charged with allegedly cheating or bribing their kids’ way into elite schools are learning the hard way that crime doesn't pay, even when higher education is the prize.
Potential criminal punishments aside, the scheme raises the question: was the premium parents paid worth the anticipated long-term economic gain for their children? 
Take Bruce Isackson, president of a Woodside, California, real estate firm, and his wife Davina, who in July 2015 turned over 2,150 shares worth $251,000 of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) stock to help get their daughter into UCLA as a fake soccer recruit, according to a federal criminal complaint. If they had just held on to those shares, they would have been worth around $373,000 today.
They later allegedly spent another $350,000 to get their younger daughter into the University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California as a bogus rowing recruit.
Manuel Henriquez, a resident of Atherton, California, who until Tuesday was chairman of Silicon Valley finance company Hercules Capital Inc, and his wife Elizabeth were arrested in New York after allegedly shelling out more than $500,000 to cheat on entrance exams and fake their daughter's tennis expertise to get her into Georgetown University.
Just imagine the calculus of the unnamed relatives of a teenaged girl who authorities said paid $1.2 million to get her into Yale University as a soccer recruit, though she did not play competitively. 
And then there are the parents accused by prosecutors of paying $15,000 apiece to cheat on standardized tests to make their kids' applications look better. 
All of these were upfront costs incurred even before the first checks for tuition, room and board and other fees were written. In each case, would the crime have even paid off?

DOING THE MATH
Five years ago, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly – then associate director of the bank’s research department – asserted in a paper that college costs more often than not are worth the expense over the long term. A student in 2014 paying $21,200 a year for a four-year degree, she found, would break even with someone with only a high school diploma by the age of 38 and would have made a cumulative $831,000 more than that individual by retirement.
But what about the Yale student and her family, who paid $1.2 million up front and then presumably were on the hook for full tuition and room and board adding up to more than $70,000 a year? That’s an all-in tab for that degree of $1.48 million.
Using Daly's approach as a guide and inputting updated government data on median incomes for individuals with and without college degrees, a Reuters analysis found a college grad whose $70,000 annual tuition was paid upfront would outearn a high school grad by $1.3 million over a lifetime of work, assuming each earned the median national wage for their demographic inflated over time. 
But the unidentified student’s family paid more than five times the Yale sticker price after the bribe, a cost that would not be fully recovered until the child reaches age 64, assuming 3 percent annual wage growth and a one-time, 10 percent increase at age 34 to reflect higher earnings of older adults.
In many cases involving wealthy parents, future earnings may be less of a draw than the prestige of saying your offspring were at Yale or Stanford, or the lure of potential connections with influential elite-school graduates.
But had some of these parents not been caught, the payoff alone might have been worth it. 
In the case of a less expensive school like UCLA, the $391,000 cost to the Isacksons - the $251,000 bribe plus $140,000 for four years of tuition and fees - would still leave a lifetime earnings surplus for their daughter of a bit over $1.2 million.
Meanwhile, for those parents like ""Desperate Housewives"" actress Felicity Huffman, whose total outlay in the fraudulent enterprise was just $15,000 to improve their childrens' entrance exam scores by cheating, the payoff would have been handsome. Assuming the student graduates, the $22,000 gap in median annual pay between high school and college graduates would easily offset the extra investment.
Lawyers representing the Henriquez couple and Bruce Isackson did not respond to a request for comment. Davina Isackson could not be reached.

INTANGIBLES
There are benefits to a degree from a top college beyond excess earnings over time. Unemployment is lower among college grads and job satisfaction is higher. 
Philip Oreopoulos, an economics professor at the University of Toronto, has even quantified non-work-related benefits of a college education, including lower divorce rates, better health, and more happiness overall, even after accounting for pay differences. 
""It goes way beyond financial gain,"" he says, adding that he in no way endorses parental cheating, which he called ""grossly unfair."" 
The still-unfolding scandal highlights economic inequalities exacerbated by college admissions programs that in some cases legally give preference to children of wealthy parents, even as U.S. students are saddled with a collective $1.56 trillion in loans, Federal Reserve data shows. 
The financial analysis suggests that, in terms of money alone, at least some of the bribes and cheating would have led to a net gain - unless you consider how the money might otherwise have been invested. 
The return on the median fraudulent payment of $250,000, invested at the standard 6 percent yearly return used by many long-term financial planners, after high school and through age 65 would have been $3.9 million, Reuters calculated. 
And for $1.2 million - the maximum shelled out? $18.6 million.

Next time, tell your mom to just give you the money.

1106,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>","Volkswagen's Scania sees China rebound, braces for Brexit hit to UK orders","By Esha Vaish
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volkswagen-owned truckmaker Scania said on Thursday that demand in China had bounced back since the start of this year, but it was bracing for a potentially significant drop in UK orders if Britain leaves the EU under a ""hard"" Brexit.
Scania is part of Volkswagen's Traton truck unit, whose planned initial public offering in April was pulled by VW on Wednesday until market conditions improve.
In November, Scania said demand in China for trucks and buses was down 10 to 15 percent from previous quarters and customers were forecasting fewer vehicle purchases for the next six months. 
However, CEO Henrik Henriksson said on Thursday that conditions had improved and Chinese demand was rebounding to the ""same level"" as before the fourth-quarter slowdown as growing e-commerce has led customers to resume purchasing Scania's high-mileage trucks.
""Requests coming in from our customers especially the big ones, they tended to slow down the pace of renewing their fleet (in the fourth quarter). But it looks like now the market is coming back,"" Henriksson told Reuters by phone.
In Europe, Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union at the end of this month has added headaches for an auto industry already grappling with fallouts from trade wars and the slowdown in the Chinese market.
If Britain leaves the EU without a withdrawal agreement, a so-called ""hard"" Brexit, it would revert to WTO rules and accompanying tariffs, increasing the cost of vehicle imports into Britain.
Henriksson said Scania had seen a spike in UK orders in the fourth quarter of last year due to buying ahead of Brexit and it had rushed to deliver those orders in January and February, anticipating delays at the UK border after the March end exit deadline.
""What we have also done is prepare ourselves if there would be a hard Brexit... but if it would be a hard Brexit, then we expect that the market will drop significantly,"" Henriksson said.
Scania has lengthened the times it needs to bring UK-sourced components to production and has worked out alternative shipping routes for trucks made in Holland and Belgium to be delivered to the UK. 
Within the EU, trucks drive smoothly through border checks. But firms worry that vehicles will be backed up at ports and queued up on feeder roads on both sides of the Channel if a hard Brexit delays each truck at customs by even a few minutes.
""That's why we have the extra buffer,"" Henriksson said.
Rival AB Volvo had triggered its hard Brexit contingency plans in December, building ""safety stock"" in Britain and considering alternative shipping routes.
""We hope that even if there are disturbances, it should be short term when it's in everyone's interest to try and find a solution to make sure that we can continue to trade, whatever the Brexit deal will be,"" Henriksson said.
Regarding the delay to the IPO of Traton - which includes the MAN, Scania and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) trucks and buses businesses - Henriksson said Scania would deliver its strategies ""regardless of the capital structure"".

""We have found a modus operandi of how... we will develop base technology between Scania and MAN, but also how we will differentiate... ourselves in the market. That strategy feels very solid and we will continue to deliver on it,"" he said.

1107,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>",Junk-Bond ETF Takes In $1 Billion as Hunt for Yield Lures Buyers,"(Bloomberg) -- As investors search for higher returns amid falling Treasury yields, they’re pouring billions of dollars into exchange-traded funds that track junk bonds.
The $9.3 billion SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) High Yield Bond ETF, or JNK, has seen seven straight days of inflows -- the longest streak in six months. About $1.1 billion has been injected into the fund since March 5, boosting its assets by 13 percent.
Similarly, the $15.2 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, ticker HYG, has seen three straight days of inflows. Investors piled more than $843 million into the fund through Wednesday.
“The thirst-for-yield trade is back on,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. “Junk bond ETFs had a rough 2018. They’re less appealing if you can get more yield from Treasuries. But when Treasuries are yielding less and less, it’s worth the risk to get it from junk bond ETFs, especially if you feel the Fed won’t raise rates.”
In a dovish pivot earlier this year, the Federal Reserve signaled that it won’t raise interest rates again until inflation accelerates. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds have dropped since then, hovering around 2.6 percent from about 3.2 percent at the end of 2018.
The high-yield market is also absorbing a surge of new issuance, and rebounding from last week’s losses, encouraged by gains in equities.
“Investors are getting equity-like returns but at a lower volatility profile by expressing it through high-yield credit,” said Matthew Bartolini, the head of Americas research for State Street’s ETF business.
The inflows mark a notable turnaround from what junk bond funds saw at the end of 2018, when investors -- amid a market meltdown -- pulled money from U.S.-listed ETFs tracking the high-yield market. But the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate High Yield Total Return Index has gained more than 7 percent since Christmas Eve, while JNK and HYG have each risen around 6 percent in the same period."
1108,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 02:18PM ET</span>",Sandy Hook families can sue gunmaker Remington: Connecticut court,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - The Connecticut Supreme Court on Thursday allowed families who lost loved ones in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre of school children to sue Remington Outdoor Co Inc in a setback to gun makers, which until now have been largely shielded from liability.
The families of nine of the victims and one survivor have said the manufacturer, along with a gun wholesaler and local retailer, are partially responsible for the carnage at the Newtown, Connecticut, school because they marketed the weapon based on its militaristic appeal.
Adam Lanza, 20, used a Remington AR-15 Bushmaster rifle, a semi-automatic civilian version of the U.S. military's M-16, to kill 20 children aged 6 and 7, as well as six adult staff members, at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012. He then killed himself.
Remington on Thursday did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industry's trade association, said it was reviewing the decision and did not have an immediate comment.
Josh Koskoff, one of the lawyers for the victims' families, said in a statement the families were grateful for the court's rejection of the gun industry's bid for complete immunity.
""The families' goal has always been to shed light on Remington's calculated and profit-driven strategy to expand the AR-15 market and court high-risk users, all at the expense of Americans' safety. Today's decision is a critical step toward achieving that goal,"" Koskoff said.
Legal experts have said any appeal of the ruling by the gunmaker would likely be taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court, where it could face steep legal hurdles. 
The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA, has provided the U.S. firearms industry an almost impenetrable defense against lawsuits by victims of mass shootings and gun violence, broadly shielding Remington and others such as American Outdoor Brands Corp, Sturm Ruger & Co and Vista Outdoor Inc from liability stemming from such incidents.
The families had tried to advance the case on a relatively novel argument in gun litigation based on the legal doctrine of negligent entrustment, an argument historically used when someone lends a car to a high-risk driver who then causes an accident.
But the narrowly divided Supreme Court judges rejected that theory in a 4-3 ruling, instead saying the families could bring their claims under a different exemption to the 2005 federal shield law, basing it on a Connecticut consumer protection statute.
The court said PLCAA did not bar wrongful marketing claims and unethical advertising of dangerous products for illegal purposes and that plaintiffs could pursue those claims under state law.
Three dissenting judges rejected that finding, saying the federal gunmaker shield law did not include such exceptions.

The tragedy led then-President Barack Obama to urge federal gun control legislation, but proposals died on Capitol Hill. Since Sandy Hook and subsequent school shootings, most federal efforts at gun control or gun rights expansion have faded and the bulk of firearms legislation has been in state legislatures across the country.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - China made its biggest purchases of U.S. pork in nearly two years last week, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed on Thursday, as Chinese hog prices surged after an outbreak of a deadly swine disease.
Buyers in the world's biggest hog producer and pork consumer struck deals for the meat despite import tariffs of 62 percent imposed by China on U.S. pork as a consequence of the trade war between the two countries. 
The duties had slashed China's imports of U.S. pork from companies such as WH Group Ltd's Smithfield Foods since last summer.
The sale of 23,846 tonnes of U.S pork in the week ended March 7 comes after a months-long outbreak of African swine fever in China that has spread to 111 confirmed cases in 28 provinces and regions across the country since August 2018.
There is no cure and no vaccine for the disease, which does not affect humans but is highly contagious and fatal to pigs. About 1 million pigs have been reportedly culled so far in an effort to try to contain the disease.
""They are going to need pork and lots of it,"" Dennis Smith, a commodity broker for Archer Financial Services in Chicago, said about China. 
The sales were the biggest to China since April 2017 and the third largest since the USDA began tracking pork export sales in 2013. 
The USDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about pork sales to China. Officials have previously said China may be underreporting hog deaths from African swine fever.
China also recently resumed purchases of other U.S. farm products, including soybeans and sorghum, that face retaliatory import tariffs.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States was doing well in trade talks with China, but that he could not say whether a final deal would be reached.
Bob Brown, an independent U.S. livestock analyst, said U.S. pork prices have declined enough to offset Beijing's tariffs.
""If they needed the stuff, we were the cheapest by far,"" he said.
Chicago Mercantile Exchange May hog futures fell to a contract low last month. On Thursday, the contract reached its highest price in more than two months, supported by increasing concerns about African swine fever in China. 
Chinese hog prices reached their highest in 14 months on Monday.

""Certainly there's been a lot of focus on what hog prices are doing in China,"" said Altin Kalo, agricultural economist for New Hampshire-based Steiner Consulting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers said after a briefing with the acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday that Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 8 and 9 planes will remain grounded for ""weeks"" at a minimum, until a software upgrade could be tested and installed in all of the planes.
FAA Administrator Dan Elwell told reporters on Wednesday the software update will be ready within a couple of months after regulators around the world grounded the plane following a second fatal crash in the 737 MAX 8 since October.
The FAA said Monday it planned to require the upgrade it termed ""design changes"" by April. An FAA spokesman confirmed Thursday that the FAA will not unground the airplanes until the software patch is approved and installed.
The software patch may not be enough to allow the planes to be ungrounded depending on the findings from the ongoing investigation into the crash of Ethiopian Airlines 302 that killed 157 people on Sunday.
Boeing declined to comment, but said Monday it would roll out the software improvement ""across the 737 MAX fleet in the coming weeks.""
Representative Rick Larsen said after the briefing the software upgrade would take a few weeks to complete and installing on all aircraft would take ""at least through April."" He said additional training would also have to take place.
Larsen, the top Democrat on an aviation subcommittee, said despite the fact that the FAA was the last major regulator to ground the plane, the ""rest of the world is looking to the FAA to lead the effort on the fix and to make a decision about ungrounding the airplanes.""
Representative Peter DeFazio, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said the software upgrade will result in the airplanes behaving more like older versions of the 737.
The upgrade will revise an automated protection system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS, which come under scrutiny in October's fatal Lion Air crash in Indonesia.
""After the pilot has tried to correct, the MCAS is going to not keep repeating itself, which is what it does now. It keep triggering automatically and the pilot has to do it again,"" DeFazio said, unless it is manually disengaged by the pilot. ""It will essentially shut itself off.""
The upgrade will address if there is a disagreement between censors, DeFazio said. 

Lawmakers noted that there have been no confirmed incidents in 50,000 North America flights with the 737 MAX 8 and questioned if training by carriers abroad was an issue.

The two premium carmakers already have a joint procurement program and recently extended their alliance to include development of advanced driver assistance systems and mobility services.
The talks over whether to cooperate on vehicle platforms could still fall apart, Sueddeutsche and Auto Bild said, without citing sources.
Both companies have acknowledged cooperation talks which include sharing engineering costs for driverless cars, but BMW and Daimler have repeatedly declined to comment on whether their cooperation could include entire vehicle platforms.
BMW's finance chief said in November he was open to deeper collaboration with Daimler but said it was difficult to identify win-win opportunities in the area of shared vehicle platforms.
Auto Bild said Daimler and BMW are in talks over whether to share engineering costs for compact and midsized cars, which are designed to be ""electric first,"" but also have the capability of accommodating conventional powertrains.
BMW and Daimler would save 7 billion euros each, over a period of seven years, Auto Bild said. 
Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the companies are seeking more than 7 billion euros in potential savings, and that if larger vehicles were included in the project, savings could be higher.
BMW and Daimler declined to comment.

DUBAI/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala has suspended new business dealings with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) since its subsidiary filed a lawsuit in November against the U.S. bank and others to recover losses suffered through its dealings with Malaysian state fund 1MDB.
""We have suspended any activities with Goldman Sachs pending outcome of the litigation,"" Brian Lott, spokesman of Mubadala Investment Co, said in response to questions from Reuters.
""The only exceptions are engagements signed prior to the litigation, which will continue as per contractual terms,"" he said.
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Mubadala, which manages over $225 billion in assets, holds stakes in some of Abu Dhabi's biggest companies as well as stakes in global firms such as Spanish energy firm Cepsa and Austria's OMV.
For Goldman Sachs, the suspension of new business with Mubadala comes at a bad time as Abu Dhabi is embarking on a privatization spree that raises the prospect of several big deals in the offering for investment banks. 
Over the last few years, Goldman has ranked among the top banks for takeover advice in Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich capital of the United Arab Emirates.
The suspension of business follows a civil legal action filed by International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC) in New York in November against Goldman and others, alleging they played a role in trying ""to corrupt"" former executives of IPIC and its subsidiary Aabar Investments, and ""mislead"" IPIC and Aabar, aiming to further the business of Goldman and 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB). IPIC merged with Mubadala in 2017,
Goldman Sachs has said that it will contest the claim 'vigorously'.
Three banking sources told Reuters that Goldman Sachs was not being invited to potential advisory business from Mubadala, until the litigation was resolved, with one saying that the state fund had ""imposed an informal boycott"" on the investment bank.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities analyst Mike Mayo said ongoing headline risk is to be expected for Goldman Sachs and the loss of some business is already baked into its models. 
""Does this take a big bite of the franchise? It doesn't look that way right now,"" he said. ""Anyone owning Goldman stock at this point should be prepared for more fall out from 1MDB.""
He estimates losses related to the scandal could be as a high as $5 billion. Goldman has not given hard guidance around how much the scandal could cost but the bank has said it could be underreserved by as much as $1.9 billion. 
Goldman Sachs' business in Abu Dhabi in recent years included advising a government steering committee that oversaw a merger between Aldar Properties and Sorouh Real Estate in 2013. The bank also worked on a merger valuation plan for the Abu Dhabi and Dubai bourses, in 2014, which was shelved as terms could not be agreed.
Abu Dhabi's privatization program has already seen the sale of stakes in its national oil company to international partners, as well as corporate mergers including banks.
Goldman Sachs advised Abu Dhabi National Oil Company on the stake of its refining unit, sources said.
The deal, announced in January saw Italy's Eni and Austria's OMV agree to pay a combined $5.8 billion to take a stake in the refining business and establish a new trading operation owned by the three partners.
Malaysia's 1MDB is the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries.

An estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged.

(Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on Thursday pleaded not guilty to a 13-count indictment filed in a New York federal court against the company, as tensions have ratcheted up between the U.S. and Beijing. 
Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, was charged with bank and wire fraud, violating sanctions against Iran and obstructing justice.
The company's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in December in Canada on charges in the indictment, which was not unsealed until January. She has said she is innocent of the charges and is fighting extradition. 
At the arraignment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, James Cole, a U.S. lawyer for Huawei, entered the plea on behalf of the company and its U.S. subsidiary.
Meng and Huawei are accused of conspiring to defraud HSBC and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei’s relationship with Skycom Tech Co Ltd, a suspected front company that operated in Iran. 
Huawei has said Skycom was a local business partner, while the United States maintains it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei’s Iran business.
Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kessler said at the arraignment that prosecutors were in the process of serving Skycom with the charges, and that the company was not yet scheduled for an arraignment.
U.S. authorities claim Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system.
Reuters exclusively reported last month on how an internal HSBC probe helped lead to the U.S. charges against Huawei and its CFO.
Last week, Reuters also detailed how U.S. authorities secretly tracked Huawei's activities, including by collecting information copied from electronic devices carried by Chinese telecom executives traveling through airports.
The indictment references reporting by Reuters from six years ago that Skycom offered to sell embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile phone operator. The reporting detailed links between Huawei and Skycom, including that Meng had served on Skycom’s board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009. reut.rs/2sUq8RT
Trump told Reuters in December that he would intervene in the case if it would help secure a trade deal with Beijing. Meng's lawyers have expressed concerns that she is a pawn or hostage and that the allegations have ""a political character."" 

The next court date is set for April 4.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 01:23PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Retailer Pier 1 taps debt restructuring lawyers - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Pier 1 Imports Inc has tapped debt restructuring lawyers to navigate potential negotiations with lenders as it struggles with falling sales, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, sending shares of the U.S. home furnishing retail chain sharply lower.
Known for selling wicker chairs and scented candles, Pier 1 has suffered financial losses amid an increasingly competitive retail landscape dominated by the likes of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. 
Pier 1, which has roughly 987 stores in the United States and Canada, has added debt restructuring specialists at Kirkland & Ellis LLP to a roster of advisers counseling the chain as it explores strategic alternatives, the sources said. 
Pier 1 is also taking meetings with investment bankers who have debt restructuring expertise as it weighs options, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the company's deliberations are confidential. As of December, the company had about $200 million in long-term debt. 
Pier 1 shares plunged more than 45 percent in New York Stock Exchange trading to well below $1 after Reuters reported the company's moves, leaving the retailer with a market capitalization of about $50 million. 
A Pier 1 representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a Kirkland spokesman had no immediate comment. As of March 2018, the company employed roughly 18,500 people at its stores. 
The engagement of Kirkland & Ellis restructuring lawyers, who typically work on significant bankruptcies and other financial workouts, marks a new chapter in Pier 1's turnaround efforts after previous initiatives failed to bear fruit. 
However, a bankruptcy filing is not yet on the horizon for Pier 1, which had about $71 million in cash as of December and $400 million available from a revolving credit line, one of the sources said. The company's debt begins coming due in 2021, and it is cutting spending.
The Fort Worth, Texas-based company in December said it hired  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to advise on a ""full range"" of strategic alternatives and that its chief executive had stepped down. The company acknowledged that a transformation plan it had dubbed ""A New Day,"" unveiled last year, failed to deliver results fast enough.
Pier 1's $200 million term loan coming due in 2021 is currently trading at about 50 cents on the dollar, according to data from financial services provider Refinitiv, indicating that investors are concerned about the company's prospects. Lenders holding the debt have organized and tapped their own advisers, the people familiar with the matter said, a move that often presages restructuring negotiations between a company and its creditors.
Moody's Investors Service Inc in December said Pier 1's outlook was negative because of the chain's weak operating performance and uncertainty over whether it would be able to turn around its business. Pier 1's well-known brand may help it, though, the ratings agency said.
The downturn for retailers has led to high-profile bankruptcies including Sears Holdings Corp and Toys ""R"" Us Inc. In the recent rout, furniture chains like Pier 1 have so far been insulated from the upheaval.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge who has been asked to sign off on a government agreement that allowed CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) to buy health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET) ordered a hearing for April 5.
Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued the order on Thursday, saying that he wanted the hearing to discuss which witnesses, if any, should testify before he decides whether to approve the government's deal with the companies.
The $69 billion transaction closed in November.
The Justice Department approved the merger of CVS, a U.S. pharmacy chain and benefits manager, and Aetna in October on condition that Aetna sell its Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc. That deal has also closed.
Judges usually approve merger agreements that the government strikes with companies with little fanfare but Leon has balked. In December, he said he was ""less convinced"" than the government that the asset sale to WellCare would resolve antitrust concerns.
Critics of the deal include the American Medical Association and the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. 
Pending Leon's approval, CVS agreed to temporarily allow Aetna to independently make critical product, pricing and personnel decisions.

Both CVS and the Justice Department declined comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - A long-awaited probe into what Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) executives knew about one of Britain's worst ever banking frauds is now not likely to be completed until next year, a source with knowledge of the review said.
The investigation by retired high court judge Linda Dobbs was launched in 2017 to assess whether Lloyds properly investigated and reported the fraud at HBOS, which it bought in January 2009. Lloyds is paying for the review but has said its conclusions will be independent.
“The independent Dame Linda Dobbs Review will continue to have all the time and resources it needs to complete its important work,” a spokeswoman for Lloyds said.
HBOS was once Britain's biggest mortgage lender, and was rescued in a state-engineered takeover by Lloyds, which has apologized to victims of the fraud and set up a 100 million pounds ($133 million) compensation scheme.
A team of more than 30 lawyers is sifting hundreds of thousands of Lloyds documents, the source said, as well as interviewing victims of the fraud for which six people were jailed for a combined 47 years in 2017.
The inquiry will begin interviewing Lloyds executives from the Autumn, the source said, starting with more junior bankers and likely to include Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio.
The work involves sifting through the documents to build a picture of what Lloyds’ senior executives knew about the fraud, what they did about it and when.
Lloyds has said that while it was aware of misconduct, it could not have known about the criminal nature of the fraud until the trial in 2017.
Britain's influential cross-party Treasury Committee of lawmakers in June 2018 wrote to Dobbs asking when the review would be complete, and Dobbs said at that time it would slip into the second half of 2019, confirming a Reuters story from May that year.
""The delay is totally unacceptable. People want answers, this has been going on for 10 years and we still have not got to the bottom of this issue."" Kevin Hollinrake, chair of the cross-party parliamentary group for fair banking, told Reuters on Thursday about the fresh delay. 
""I'm not questioning Dame Linda Dobbs' integrity at all but it's simply wrong that regulators are not taking the lead on this,"" he said.
Lloyds in November 2018 settled with an ex-employee who accused her former bosses of concealing the fraud. The bank apologized to Sally Masterton, a former senior risk officer at Lloyds, and said that it had agreed to pay her financial compensation.
Masterton alleged HBOS executives knew of the fraud years before the Lloyds takeover and failed to properly disclose it.
The fraud, which took place in the early 2000s, saw the conspirators use their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of struggling business clients, some of which succumbed to insolvency and were stripped of their assets after being advised to borrow unsustainable amounts.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 12:25PM ET</span>","Junior trader files harassment, discrimination lawsuit against UBS","By Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - A former junior trader who accused UBS of mishandling a complaint of rape and sexual assault by senior colleagues against her has filed a claim in the UK for damages against the Swiss lender, legal documents seen by Reuters show.
The claimant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, alleges that she faced gender discrimination and sexual harassment while working at the bank in London. 
She is also seeking damages for alleged victimization suffered after reporting her grievances and alerting managers and regulators to what she described as an ""offensive and humiliating"" work environment.
""While we would never comment on individual claims ahead of formal hearings, back in November an independent investigation into the allegations made by the former UBS employee concluded that UBS made no fundamental errors. Recommendations were made for improvement and we are implementing these changes,"" UBS said in a statement.
The ex-trader alleges she was raped by a senior UBS employee on Sept. 22 2017, an allegation that was reported to the Metropolitan Police and which remains under investigation, a press officer for the police force confirmed to Reuters.
According to the so-called particulars of claim, a legal document in which claimants set out their case, UBS allowed the man accused of rape to work in close proximity to the former trader for at least a fortnight after she reported the allegation. 
The woman also alleges UBS breached its own internal rules by delaying disciplinary action against the employee.
UBS has declined to provide information on the former employee accused of rape. Reuters attempted to contact the individual via social media but was unable to get a response. 
The woman also alleged she was touched inappropriately by a UBS managing director at an evening event in August 2017.
This followed other incidents of alleged workplace discrimination and sexual harassment from the managing director, including unwanted personal attention and requests to perform errands like coffee-making and vacation bookings at the expense of her own duties, according to the claimant.
The managing director did not respond to a request for comment sent to his lawyers on Wednesday. But in an email sent to Reuters in October, his lawyers said he denied the allegations.
""He denies the underlying allegation in the strongest possible terms, and considers such conduct abhorrent,"" law firm Himsworth Scott, said ‪on Oct. 10.
SURVEILLANCE
The former trader also alleges a ""gross violation of privacy"" throughout the bank's investigation of her rape allegation. Law firm Freshfields reviewed UBS's investigation and said in November that it was handled fairly. 
According to the legal documents, a data release she obtained showed UBS staff had examined hundreds of messages sent to the personal mobile phones of her colleagues and tracked her movements to, from and inside UBS' Broadgate offices.
The claimant resigned from UBS in June 2018. She then emailed Andrea Orcel, then head of UBS's investment bank, to share details of her experience.
According to the documents, the claimant was told her concerns and allegations would be investigated as ""whistleblowing"". She was encouraged to assist Freshfields with its review and was assured that the law firm was independent of, and not advising, UBS.

Both UBS and Freshfields have denied the claimant a copy of the review's findings, citing legal privilege. A spokesman for Orcel declined to comment. Freshfields did not respond to a request for comment.

1126,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 12:22PM ET</span>","Toyota investing $749 million in five U.S. plants, adding 586 jobs","By David Shepardson and Nick Carey
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it will invest $749 million in five U.S. plants and add 586 jobs as it boosts engine production capacity and adds new hybrid models to its lineup.
President Donald Trump has prodded Japanese automakers to add more jobs in the United States as the White House has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles, on the grounds of national security.
""All this activity I hope shows that we’re a plus factor to the economic national security of the United States,"" Toyota North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz told reporters on a conference call. ""We believe in America.""
Toyota and other automakers have been lobbying heavily to block any new tariffs on imported vehicles.
Toyota said it will invest $288 million in Alabama to increase annual engine capacity from 670,000 to 900,000 by the end of 2021 and will add new 4-cylinder and V6 engine lines. It will also invest $238 million in a Kentucky plant to build hybrid versions of the Toyota RAV4 and Lexus ES 300h.
Toyota announced last year it would jointly build a new $1.6 billion plant with Mazda Motor Corp in Alabama.
Toyota said it will exceed a 2017 pledge to invest $10 billion over five years with a new commitment to reach nearly $13 billion over the same period, including Thursday's announcement.
Toyota President Akio Toyoda will be in Washington Friday to deliver a speech in which he is expected to tout the new investments.
Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a ""Section 232"" national security report to Trump with recommendations that auto industry officials expect to include at least some tariffs on fully assembled vehicles or on technologies and components related to electric, automated, connected and shared vehicles.
Lentz told reporters the automaker is eager to find out the findings, including for the 137,000 Americans he said design, build or sell Toyota vehicles in the United States.
""They deserve to know if they’re a security threat,"" he said. ""Consumers need to know because they need to understand if their costs for every vehicle they purchase ... is going to go up.""

Lentz said the new trade deal the Trump administration has negotiated to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement had played a role in the new investment decisions, but he did not elaborate on how significant that role was.

Nordea, the Nordic region's largest bank, as well as SEB, Svenska Handelsbanken, and Swedbank had appealed a decision from last July by ESMA to fine each 495,000 euros for issuing credit ratings on research without authorization from the regulator.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 11:35AM ET</span>","Volvo Cars to pay $310 million dividend, second under China's Geely","STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo Cars will pay a dividend of 2.9 billion Swedish crowns ($311 million) after record sales in 2018, the company said on Thursday, with almost all of it slated to boost the coffers of its debt-laden Chinese parent Geely.
The payment comes as carmakers are grappling with the fallout of trade wars, rising costs for developing electric and driverless cars, and an industry downturn that has dented even the most profitable companies.
The trade war caused Volvo to postpone plans for a listing last year and generated additional costs to retool its factories to limit the tariff impact.
Premium rival Daimler cut its dividend in February after its fourth-quarter profit plunged. In the same week Volvo reported a fall in 2018 profit margins and said margins would remain under pressure this year. 
Volvo has a stated goal to spend roughly 5 percent of its annual revenue on building electric and autonomous cars, and a spokeswoman said on Thursday Volvo believed it had enough cash to cover both the dividend and its development costs.
This will be the second time that the Gothenburg-based company has paid a dividend since being bought in 2010 by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, which owns the Chinese car brand of the same name. 
Volvo had paid a dividend of 2.2 billion crowns for 2016. 
The Swedish carmaker said its owner will receive around 2.8 billion crowns of the dividend and Swedish insurance and savings group Folksam and pension fund investor AMF, which hold preference shares, will get around 125 million crowns.
Geely has taken on debt after making recent stake acquisitions in Daimler and truck rival AB Volvo.
Volvo, which did not make a profit for a decade under previous owner Ford, sold a record 642,253 cars last year and recorded an operating profit of 14.2 billion Swedish crowns. It has set a goal of reaching sales of 800,000 cars within the next few years.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 11:30AM ET</span>",EU officials see money-laundering risks from high share of foreign deposits,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A high share of foreign deposits could be an indicator of money-laundering risks and should be reduced in states that fail to properly monitor them, European Union officials said, as the block grapples with a series of financial scandals at its banks.
So-called non-resident deposits were very high in countries like Latvia, Malta or Cyprus that have been most exposed to recent money-laundering allegations. They have gone down after criminal probes began, European Central Bank data show. 
European states should monitor foreign deposit flows, financial services commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said. 
""If those monitoring mechanisms are not strong enough, one of the ways to deal with it is to reduce the share of non-resident deposits, so reduce the money flows,"" Dombrovskis, a former prime minister of Latvia, said.
Latvian authorities were among the most vocal in Europe in singling out the risks posed by foreign deposits, after allegations of having handled illicit transactions of Russian money brought down ABLV, then the Baltic country's third-largest bank, last year.
After the scandal, Riga set a 5 percent threshold for foreign deposits, which had peaked at about half of all deposits in its banks soon after Latvia joined the euro in 2014.
The target was ditched by the new center-right government that took power in January, but foreign deposits had meanwhile fallen to nearly 12 percent of the 16 billion euros in overall deposits. 
Most euro zone states saw their share of foreign deposits fall in the second half of last year, with the trend beginning just after prosecutors opened a probe in July into Danske Bank for alleged money laundering at its Estonian branch -- which is at the center of one of the largest-ever money laundering scandals.
Foreign deposits in euro zone banks were down to 1.1 trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) in December, posting a 12 percent fall from June.
Bucking the trend, in Luxembourg, Ireland, Finland and Portugal foreign deposits have increased. The Grand Duchy has the largest share in the euro zone, with more than 17 percent of deposits at its banks belonging to companies or individuals with residencies outside the bloc -- 63 billion euros in total, about half the amount stored in Germany, the biggest euro zone economy.
NOT ENOUGH
""The level of non-resident deposits can be a useful indictor for anti-money-laundering deficiencies,"" said German conservative lawmaker Markus Ferber, who leads the parliament's largest grouping in the economic committee of the EU assembly. 
He added that foreign deposits also show the attractiveness of a financial center and therefore should be monitored together with other indicators to provide a complete picture of a country's exposure to money-laundering risks. 
This monitoring remains almost completely in the hands of EU states, despite repeated failures of national authorities to tackle cross-border financial crime.
National interests in preserving these sensitive competencies have so far prevailed over calls from the ECB and other supervisors to set up an EU-wide oversight system. 
As a result, the EU has acted against lenders at risk of money laundering, like ABLV and Malta's Pilatus Bank, only after alerts were raised in the United States.
The renewed focus on non-resident deposits could signal a stricter approach by some national authorities, although available data are based on the location of firms and not on the residency of their beneficial owners. 
That is a flaw that could vastly reduce the amount of reported foreign deposits, argued Joshua Kirschenbaum, who worked at the U.S. Treasury on international money laundering and is now senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think-tank.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 10:40AM ET</span>",Russia's top banks plot temporary sanctions workaround: sources,"By Darya Korsunskaya, Elena Fabrichnaya and Tatiana Voronova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Leading Russian banks are working on plans to help each other retain at least short-term access to the global financial system in the event that they are hit by fresh U.S. sanctions, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank and others are examining how they can provide each other with access to U.S. dollars or other major foreign currencies by using so-called correspondent accounts, the sources said.
Banks access financial services in different jurisdictions and provide cross-border payment services to customers in various currencies through correspondent banking relationships.
The new scheme, which banks started to draft with Russia's finance ministry and the central bank last year, would be unlikely to work indefinitely but could help avoid a panic if one or several big banks are cut off from dollar transactions. 
U.S. lawmakers last year drafted a sanctions bill which proposed cutting off some of Russia's top banks from the U.S. dollar system, mentioning Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, Russian Agriculture Bank, Promsvyazbank, VEB and Bank of Moscow.
This did not come into force and recently another was proposed, without mentioning any specific banks. 
But Russian banks still fear they could come under sanctions and so have begun to draft a contingency plan. 
""Each important bank has a step-by step plan on what should be done in a given situation. The first month is set out day by day, if not hour by hour,"" a senior financial official said.
The central bank and Gazprombank declined to comment. The finance ministry, Sberbank, VTB, Promsvyazbank, VEB and Russian Agriculture Bank did not reply to requests for comment. 
The two biggest threats to the banking sector in Russia are being cut off from the SWIFT banking messaging system and losing access to foreign currency, which they usually get from U.S. banks via correspondent accounts.
In the event of being shut out of SWIFT, Russia already has its own system, which it is upgrading. 
And for foreign currencies there are a number of options, said the sources, who include a high-ranking state banker, a well-placed industry official, an executive with a large bank and an individual in a foreign bank.
TEMPORARY FIX 
The main option relies on at least one major Russian bank avoiding sanctions and being able to retain access to foreign currencies via correspondent accounts with major overseas banks. 
Other Russian banks would then set up or upgrade existing correspondent accounts with that bank to shift currency around.
Publicly available documents show VTB has correspondent accounts with Sberbank and VEB, while Russian Agriculture Bank has accounts with VEB, VTB, Gazprombank, Sberbank and a number of other Russian banks.
VEB has such accounts with Sberbank and Gazprombank. 
Sberbank, VTB, VEB, Gazprombank and Russian Agriculture Bank have correspondent accounts with the central bank as well. 
However the bulk of these accounts are denominated in rubles, with only a handful in U.S. dollars and euros. 
""This would (them) allow to move the dollars between themselves bypassing a correspondent account,"" the source at a foreign bank said, adding that in order for the back-up to work one bank in the chain would need to have a U.S. dollar correspondent account with a U.S. bank as there would still be a need to make external settlements, necessitating a bridge.
Correspondent accounts would complicate tracking currency transfers between the banks, making them harder for overseas authorities to spot, a former central bank official said.
Such an arrangement would represent a ""temporary solution"" which might last for three or four months and buy the banks time to find an alternative, while also reassuring customers. 
And a spike in currency transactions by the banks which had not been sanctioned and were dealing with the foreign correspondent bank would likely arouse suspicions.
Other options include the central bank providing forex currency to a 'clean bank' which in turn would then distribute it to peers via correspondent accounts, sources said. 

Alternatively a sanctioned bank could use correspondent accounts directly with the central bank although that would raise the risk of the central bank itself being hit with sanctions and therefore, is unlikely, the sources said.

(Reuters) - Most consumers worldwide would share more personal data with banks and insurers in exchange for cheaper services despite privacy concerns, according to an Accenture (NYSE:ACN) Plc study released on Thursday.
Six in 10 consumers polled by the management consultancy, one of the world's largest, said they would share data such as lifestyle habits if they received benefits ranging from gym membership discounts to offers based on their location.
Among 47,000 consumers surveyed across 28 countries, 81 percent said they would be willing to share more data with banks for faster loan approvals, while 79 percent would provide personal information to their insurer if it would reduce the odds of injury or loss.
While eager to share more, 75 percent of respondents said they were very cautious about privacy. Rising costs were cited as the top reason for leaving a financial institution, followed by data security breaches.
Large financial firms have been seeking to tap into their vast troves of customer data to offer more personalized services, even as technology companies face growing public scrutiny over how they handle such information. But banks have been relatively slow in making headway, partly because they often store the information in various systems.
""That sort of has not allowed banks take advantage of what we think is an enormous potential,"" Accenture Senior Managing Director Bruce Holley said in an interview.
More than 30 percent of respondents trust their bank more than a year ago, partly because of strong industry oversight, Holley said. ""People have been trained that the regulations are looking out for them.""

NAIROBI (Reuters) - There are encouraging signs that European planemaker Airbus is closing in on a long-negotiated deal with China for dozens of new narrow-body jets, an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday.
The official said there were hopes Airbus would nail down the multibillion-dollar order when President Xi Jinping visits Europe later this month, but acknowledged there would unlikely be confirmation until the eleventh hour.
""The talks are ongoing,"" the official said. ""It will be difficult to know for sure until the day before, but the signs are positive.""
China has become a key hunting ground for Airbus and its leading rival Boeing (NYSE:BA), thanks to surging travel demand, but the outlook has been complicated by Beijing's desire to grow its own industrial champions and, more recently for Boeing, the U.S.-China trade war.
Macron unexpectedly failed to clinch the Airbus order during a trip to China in early 2018 and the French government and Airbus have been working since to salvage it. 
Macron said at the time that China would buy 184 A320 narrow-body jets, an order worth $18 billion at list prices.
The Elysee Palace official also said Airbus was discussing a new order with Ethiopian Airlines. The official gave no details on the size of the potential new Ethiopian order but cited the long-range A350, a model which Ethiopian already operates, and the single-aisle A320 jet as aircraft of interest to the airline.
Macron and Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed discussed the negotiations during Macron's visit to Addis Ababa on Tuesday, two days after an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed after taking off, killing all 157 people on board. 

Industry analysts played down a possible link between any current negotiations and Sunday's crash. Ethiopian has been undertaking a major fleet expansion and regularly talks to the market, they said, adding that order talks take time.

AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (Reuters) - ""Warning: Don't do anything stupid!"" reads the sign to the right of Rick Haas' office computer.
It is the same tongue-in-cheek warning affixed to the dashboard of every off-road Mahindra Roxor vehicle that Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd assembles in a suburb north of Detroit.
The motto might also apply to the Indian automaker's latest attempt to enter the U.S. auto market - an effort Haas, a former executive at Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, is leading.
(GRAPHIC: Mahindra eyes U.S. auto market as new car sales are poised to stall - https://tmsnrt.rs/2F5aj1u)
A decade ago, Mahindra tried to break in to the U.S. market with a low-cost pickup truck. The foray ended in failure and a lawsuit from dealers demanding their franchise fees back.
Haas, the automaker's North American chief executive, says this time Mahindra has a more cautious ""pay-as-you-go strategy."" Instead of starting with a truck or passenger car, Mahindra is reintroducing its brand with the Roxor, a vehicle that looks like a vintage Jeep. 
Mahindra has built around 3,000 off-road Roxors and is using the model, which starts at around $15,000, to demonstrate to American consumers and dealers ""acutely aware of our previous experience"" here that the Indian automaker can build a reliable product before it launches mainstream models for use on American roads, Haas told Reuters.
""Getting burned makes you cautious,"" Haas said.
RICH PROSPECTS, BIG RISKS 
Mahindra is one of a handful of European and Asian automakers gearing up to enter the U.S. market in hopes of gaining sales as well as credibility that can boost their brands at home. 
France's PSA and China's Zotye and GAC all have outlined plans for establishing beachheads in the world's second-largest market by sales, which offers rich pickings in segments including pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.
But the United States is a mature market that most industry executives say is heading for a downturn, and it is already crowded with over 40 automotive brands and 300-plus models on sale. 
See graphic on annual U.S. new car sales https://tmsnrt.rs/2F5aj1u
""There's not a line waiting out the front door of every potential newcomer to North America of people saying 'I cannot wait for a new car to show up here today,'"" said Larry Dominique, North American head of PSA, which has also taken a cautious approach to relaunching here. 
PSA announced last month the Peugeot brand will lead its U.S. return - the same brand that crashed out of this market less than three decades ago.
Analysts and auto executives say new entrants must stand out in a crowd to crack the U.S. market, as Tesla Inc has with electric vehicles.
Just offering a cheap car may not be enough, said Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners. The higher quality of used vehicles presents a challenge, while delivering the expensive safety features American consumers and regulators demand. 
""If you fail to deliver on that then you’re a pariah in the market,"" he said.
Prospective U.S. entrants might look to the example of South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co, the last foreign automaker to successfully enter the U.S. car market.
The Korean carmaker launched cheap models in the United States in 1986, as Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd had done before. Hyundai scored early successes, but quality problems set the brand back, and forced a relaunch. Now, it is overhauling its U.S. strategy, shifting from sedans to SUVs.
The problem for prospective entrants is that if they do find an untapped niche, consultants and analysts expect other automakers to rush to fill it themselves.
A NEW STRATEGY 
Mahindra's first foray into the U.S. auto market was a disaster, as plans to launch a low-cost pickup with high fuel efficiency never came to fruition, in part because it failed to meet federal emissions standards. Angry dealers who had signed on to sell the Scorpio pickup sued Mahindra.
Mahindra regrouped. Haas set up Mahindra's U.S. office in 2013 with just a handful of people, and that has risen to 450. 
The company decided not to go into direct competition with major automakers, but to enter the much smaller and less heavily regulated market for off-road recreational vehicles sold mainly in rural America. 
The Roxor stands out because it looks like a World War II Jeep. Mahindra has had a license since the end of that war to make such vehicles in India. Municipalities, mining and construction companies, and many others seeking rugged off-road vehicles have shown interest, Haas said.
The Roxor also has caught the eye of the owner of the Jeep brand, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) NV, a potential competitor whose U.S. headquarters is just up the road from Mahindra's. Last August, FCA asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to block Roxor sales because the model is too similar to its own Jeep. 
The commision has ruled FCA can pursue its intellectual property claims against the Roxor, but on Feb. 21 Mahindra asked the agency to review that ruling.
Mahindra has signed up a network of 390 powersports dealers all over the country to sell the Roxor. Haas said around a third of powersports dealers also own car dealerships so the Roxor allows him to establish the brand, then build relationships with car dealers. 
""I can't say what our plans are, but the smoke is going to clear out of the air in the next year to 18 months,"" Haas said. 
Among the vehicles under consideration for the U.S. market is the new Marazzo, a minivan designed by Mahindra's Michigan engineers for sale in India that has scored well in international crash safety tests and features Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CarPlay.
Instead of low prices, Mahindra plans to focus on its image of building rugged, durable vehicles for India's roads.
""We're India tough,"" Haas said. ""That's a value that resonates with a chunk of the population here."" 
The speed of Mahindra's U.S. rollout will depend not only on retail consumers but the U.S. Postal Service, Haas said. The Postal Service is searching for its next generation of delivery vehicles and Mahindra is one of five finalists for the $6 billion project, which may be decided this year.

1138,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 09:27AM ET</span>","Higher store spending to hit Dollar General 2019 profit, shares fall","(Reuters) -  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG) forecast 2019 profit below analysts' expectations on Thursday as the discount retailer ramps up spending on stores to pull in more customers, sending its shares down more than 7 percent.
As competition heats up in the grocery space with the entry of more online businesses, the company said it would spend about $50 million to improve distribution of fresh and frozen food, shopping convenience and labor productivity.
""Looking ahead, there are some threats on the horizon, rising costs foremost among them,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm GlobalData Retail.
Dollar General also plans to open 975 new stores and remodel 1,000 old ones. Last year, its remodeling focused on adding more refrigeration units and private label brands at its stores, which Saunders said, will drive sales.
""These (initiatives) should help offset the deteriorating cost environment. Even so, we believe profit as a proportion of revenue may slip as sales of lower margin perishables increases,"" he said. 
Dollar General said it expects to earn $6.30 to $6.50 per share in fiscal 2019, below the average analyst estimate of $6.65, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.84 per share in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 1 but missed the average analyst estimate of $1.88, blaming higher transportation cost and lower sales of high-margin products.
However, the company's same-store sales rose 4 percent and beat the 2.6 percent increase analysts had estimated, as its customers, who benefited from an earlier-than-usual distribution of food stamps, spent more on groceries.
Net sales rose 8.5 percent to $6.65 billion and beat analysts' expectations of $6.61 billion.
Shares were trading down at $112 before the opening bell, despite the company raising its quarterly dividend by 10 percent and increasing its share buyback program by $1 billion.
Rival Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) Inc's shares were down 1.31 percent. The company last week reported better-than-expected same-store sales, but wrote down the value of its Family Dollar chain by $2.7 billion after years of stagnating sales.

1141,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",Pimco Really Did Grab Itself an Italian Bargain,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- European bank capital is in better shape this year after a torrid last quarter of 2018, and the clearest illustration is from Italy’s biggest lender UniCredit SpA. It’s startling how much its cost of financing has improved.
The European Central Bank will hope this shows that its recently-announced bank stimulus measures might not be taken up on such a large scale as previously. If some of the most prolific users – Italian banks chief among them – of the ECB’s so-called “targeted longer-term refinancing operations” (known as TLTROs) are in better shape, then maybe it can start to wean the banking system off super-cheap funding.
UniCredit on Tuesday raised with ease 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of Additional Tier 1 hybrid bonds (deeply subordinated perpetual bonds with an issuer call after seven years) with a 7.5 percent yield. It was able to lower the coupon by 50 basis points from the initial price talk and still the order book was five times over-subscribed.
This is a world of difference from late November, when the bank sold $3 billion of notes in a private deal to Pimco. As I wrote at the time, that was a big win for the U.S. bond giant and a very expensive form of funding for UniCredit at a 7.83 percent coupon.
The two bonds are quite different – in currency, maturity and seniority. But both were required to fulfill UniCredit's regulatory funding requirements and each can be bailed-in (that is, the creditor takes a hit) in the event of the bank’s failure. Pimco’s senior dollar bonds would be the last to be affected, though, whereas the new AT1 hybrids would be first to be wiped out as equity capital.
As a rough comparison, the 7.83 percent coupon on the private Pimco placement in November was equivalent at the time to about 5 percent in euros – about twice what UniCredit would have to pay now. The yield on its euro benchmark 2023 bond has halved since November to 2 percent and similarly the credit spread on its subordinated five-year credit default swap has fallen nearly 200 basis points
UniCredit is paying only 250 basis points more now to raise equity-equivalent regulatory capital (which is always much more expensive for the seller than more plain vanilla bonds) than it was for senior debt four months ago. In all likelihood, the bank wouldn’t have been able to raise equity capital late last year, as it probably would have had to offer a ruinous coupon of somewhere around 10 percent to attract investors.
This all shows that investors are much more comfortable now with the bank’s credit risk and Italy’s country risk. The resolution of the budget dispute between the populist coalition and the European Union is paying dividends for the funding costs of the sovereign, and the economic stability of the country. That’s something the ECB and the Brussels will need to weigh up if Italy’s budget demands reappear after May’s European Parliament elections."
1142,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 08:43AM ET</span>",European shares surge after UK parliament votes down no-deal Brexit,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rallied to more than five-month highs on Thursday, boosted by fading risks of a no-deal Brexit and overcoming fears about a possible delay in trade talks between the United States and China.
A pan-European equity index rose as high as 0.8 percent, its highest level since October after Britain's parliament vote on Wednesday removed a key source of uncertainty by rejecting a no-deal Brexit.
European stocks had earlier stumbled after Bloomberg reported that a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to end their trade war was more likely to take place in April at the earliest, later than expected.
The lingering trade spat between the two superpowers has been a cloud hanging over markets and there had been hopes Trump and Xi would hold a summit aimed at finding a breakthrough at the president's Mar-a-Lago property in Florida this month.
The decision by Britain's parliament had lifted British shares 0.8 percent.
The vote paves the way for a delay to Brexit beyond the current March 29 deadline which could lead to an EU divorce deal being agreed or even another referendum.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts told clients the probability of a no-deal Brexit had fallen to 5 percent from 10 percent after Wednesday vote. Despite the vote having no legal force, it carries considerable political force.
World shares trod water, staying off 4-1/2 month highs hit recently. Wall Street was set for a marginally softer open, futures showed.
""Global markets have had a good start to this year but people are now starting to focus on the real issues like will there be a (U.S.-China) trade deal, Brexit and the expectation that the Fed will raise rates possibly once more this year before maybe cutting rates,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum.
U.S. Federal Reserve has signaled that it is pressing pause on rate rises. Some players however reckon it could still raise interest rates one more time before calling time on its tightening campaign.
Lowman noted that despite China's slowing growth -- figures released on Thursday showed the Asian giant's industrial output at 17-year lows and sluggish retail sales -- markets have had an impressive rally this year, with the MSCI index climbing about 10 percent, spurred by the Fed's change of heart.
But many remain skeptical about how much further the share rally can run.
""Before we conclude that this market still has decent legs, we'd like to see equity prices supported by stronger macro data, lifted by better earnings trends, and confirmed by stable-to-rising yields,"" David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis, told clients.
BREXIT 
In currency markets, sterling slipped 0.9 percent after rallying in the wake of Wednesday's vote by more than 1 percent to $1.3380, the highest since June 2018.
The retreat comes as lawmakers prepare to vote again later in the day to delay Brexit until at least the end of June. 
But analysts risks have not been eliminated with parliament still needing to find a way forward and all 27 EU nations needing to agree an extension on Brexit.
""There is gradual optimism being priced in and barring something highly unlikely, the possibility of an actual no-deal is not zero but less than 5 percent,"" said Tim Graf, head of macro strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
But he added: ""There is always the chance the EU won't grant an extension if they are just going to be trying to push this deal through ... that's where the caution comes in.""
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar reacted most to the report about a delayed meeting between China and the United States, falling to its lowest in three days at $0.7049, down 0.6 percent, on the day.
Concern remains that any escalation in the trade conflict will hit hard export-oriented economies such as Australia, whose biggest trading partner is China.
The yuan was relatively stable in the offshore market. It lost half a percent at 6.7353, not far from a one-month low of 6.7372.
News of the potential delayed meeting between the U.S. and Chinese leaders pushed oil prices into reverse, with Brent stumbling 0.1 percent to $67.47.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 07:44AM ET</span>","HK suspends UBS sponsor license, fines it and others $100 million for IPO failures","By Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's securities regulator banned UBS from leading initial public offerings (IPOs) in the city for a year, while fining it and rivals including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) a combined $100 million for due diligence failures on a series of IPOs. 
UBS is the first major bank involved in stock listings to face such a suspension in the city. The $100.2 million in fines are the toughest actions yet taken by the regulator as part of its campaign against what it sees as shoddy listing standards.
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Thursday fined Swiss giant UBS HK$375 million ($48 million). It fined Morgan Stanley HK$224 million, Merrill Lynch HK$128 million and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) (StanChart) HK$59.7, all for failures when sponsoring, or leading, IPOs. 
Helping firms to list is big business in Hong Kong, which was last year's top IPO destination worldwide with $36.3 billion raised, according to Refinitiv data. 
But, in the wake of a slew of scandals among newly traded firms earlier this decade, the SFC has been cracking down on banks not properly carrying out their duties as sponsor. 
Hong Kong IPOs need at least one sponsoring bank, which typically takes the lead in running the IPO and collects a larger proportion of fees than banks listed only as bookrunners. 
Sponsors must conduct due diligence to assess the company being listed, and are responsible for assuring potential investors that its IPO prospectus is accurate.
The IPOs in question were those of China Forestry, sponsored by UBS and Standard Chartered, and Tianhe Chemicals, sponsored by UBS, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. 
UBS was also fined for failing to discharge its duties in a third IPO which the regulator did not name, but which sources have identified as China Metal Recycling (CMR), a now-defunct scrap merchant.
""The outcome of these enforcement actions for sponsor failures ... signify the crucial importance that the SFC places on the high standards of sponsors’ conduct to protect the investing public and maintain the integrity and reputation of Hong Kong’s financial markets,"" said Ashley Alder, chief executive of the SFC, in a statement. 
SCEPTICISM FAILURES
Fines in Hong Kong are based on up to three times the fees or profits made by the regulated group or person, less a discount for cooperation with the investigation. Morgan Stanley was fined more than Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) by the regulator because it took more of the fees from Tianhe for the IPO. 
China Forestry raised $216 million in its 2009 IPO. Just 14 months after listing, trading of its shares was suspended when its auditor discovered irregularities. The company was subsequently liquidated.
Tianhe, engaged in the manufacture and sale of chemical products, listed in 2014 but was soon after targeted by a short seller, who claimed it had inflated profits and presented related groups as customers. The company denied the allegations. 
Trading in its shares has been suspended since 2015. 
Among the failings described by the regulator was one instance where none of the three banks sponsoring Tianhe Chemical’s IPO followed up after interviewing the company’s largest customer as part of their sponsor due diligence. 
The meeting was arranged by Tianhe at its offices and the customer, named only as X, refused to give a business card or provide other identification to the banks’ representatives before storming out of the meeting. 
In the case of China Forestry, the SFC said UBS did not inspect any of the company’s forests after joining StanChart as a co-sponsor of the deal. While StanChart had visited some of the company’s forests, it failed to check the location of those sites against the locations given in the prospectus.
""We've seen this before in the accounting profession with the challenges to auditor scepticism. In some ways this is a similar situation for investment banks. The question now is has the industry moved on sufficiently from these failures,"" said one Hong Kong-based finance expert, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the subject. 
The SFC also on Thursday suspended the license of UBS banker Cen Tian for failing to discharge his duties as sponsor principal in charge of the IPO of China Forestry, it said.
Cen did not respond to an emailed request for comment. 
RESPONSES
""UBS takes note of the findings of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission's (SFC) investigations. We are pleased to have resolved these legacy issues relating to our Hong Kong IPO sponsorship license. We look forward to continuing to service our clients in Hong Kong,"" UBS said in a statement.
Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment. 
“We welcome the opportunity to resolve this case with the SFC, which stems from matters arising over 10 years ago. We note that on 8 January 2015, Standard Chartered Group announced the closure of institutional cash equities, equity research and equity capital markets activities (including IPO sponsor activities),"" StanChart said in a statement.
StanChart closed its equity business in 2015.

1146,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 06:59AM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Consumer Sentiment Expected to Rise
Is the consumer still holding up in the wake of very tepid job growth in February?
The market will get some more insight when the University of Michigan reports on its preliminary measure of March consumer sentiment at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Economists expect that the Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 95.3.
The measure had risen to 93.8 in the previous month as it recovered from 91.2 in January, its lowest level since October 2016.
A strong number would add to evidence that a dismal drop in December retail sales, its worst in nine years, had been an outlier. 
Along with the consumer, the economic calendar has data on how the industrial engine of the U.S. is faring at 9:15 AM.
Economists expect that industrial production rose 0.3%
2. JOLTs Coming, but Look for Quits
Speaking of last month’s employment number, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey (JOLTs) comes out at 10:00 AM ET.
Economists predict that the January JOLTs number fell slightly to 7.31 million last month. 
A drop usually indicates some problems in the labor market, but there are a couple reasons why the market will probably ignore the headline number.
For one, the December number of job openings was a record high. Also, the JOLTs number is for January and that’s a month behind the recent nonfarm payrolls report.
What the market may find intriguing is the quits rate, which came in at 2.9% in December. If the number of people leaving their jobs increases, that could indicate that workers feel they still have a good opportunity of improving their livelihood with a new position, soothing worries about February’s anemic job growth.
3. Earnings Ahead
Buckle (NYSE:BKE), which operates 467 stores offering casual apparel, footwear and accessories aimed at young men and women, is expected to report earnings of 85 cents a share before the market open, say analysts polled by Investing.com. year ago, the company earned 87 cents. Revenue is forecast at $265 million, down 5.7% from a year ago.
Sporting-goods retailer  Hibbett Sports  (NASDAQ:HIBB) reports before the open and is expected to report earnings of 38 cents a share for the fourth quarter. That would be two cents higher than a year ago. Revenue is forecast at $277.4 million, up 2.8%.
Advertising company MDC Partners (NASDAQ:MDCA) is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings of 31 cents a share, up from 20 cents a year ago. Revenue is forecast at $389.35 million, down 3.3% from a year ago. The company has been trying to execute a turnaround. Stagwell Group, founded by Mark Penn, is expected to take a 30% stake in the company, with Mark Penn set to become CEO, according to The Wall Street Journal.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's customs authority has lifted its suspension on imports of Tesla's Model 3, an official in the authority's news department told Reuters on Thursday. 
""We can confirm that the warning notice on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been canceled,"" said the official, who only gave his surname as Tao. 
Tesla declined to comment. Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Thursday that the suspension had been lifted after Tesla made the necessary rectifications. 
China's General Administration of Customs stopped clearing Tesla Model 3 imports last week, saying they did not have the required Chinese language warning signs and had missing or incorrect nameplate labels.
Tesla said at the time that the company had reached a solution with the authorities.

1152,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 05:06AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Brexit Drama Lifts European Markets; FCA Targets Fund Stocks,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are marching higher Thursday, confident that U.K. lawmakers’ decision to vote against a ‘no-deal’ Brexit “at any time” has effectively ended the risk of a disorderly divorce.
At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 was up 20.6 points, or 0.6% at 3,344.05, while Germany's Dax was up 0.4% and France's CAC 40 up 0.7%. The FTSE 100 was lagging, up only 0.3%, after another sharp rise in sterling overnight.
Conventional wisdom is that anything that softens or even cancels Brexit is good for the U.K. and for the European economy, but whether the degree of optimism visible this morning is justified is another question.
European officials are determined to have the whole show wrapped up by May, so that it doesn’t overshadow the European parliament elections. That leaves precious little time for any further maneuvering and leaves the risk of an accidental 'no-deal Brexit' -- which is still the legal default scenario -- very much on the table.
Anyway, the key point this morning is that Prime Minister Theresa May intends to use last night’s vote to bring back her twice-rejected deal for another vote, in the hope that the die-hard Brexiteer lawmakers will finally accept that her deal is the best outcome they can hope for.
Compelling as the drama/farce is, there’s more going on in markets that just Brexit: Chinese industrial production growth slowed sharply in February, adding to fears that its slowdown could extend until the middle of the year.
In Europe, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)is up 0.3% after falling Wednesday as it postponed the IPO of its truck unit Traton. Analysts had hoped the IPO would unlock some value for VW and strengthen its balance sheet as it girds itself for massive investment in electric vehicles. The company also confirmed it’s aiming to cut another 7,000 administrative jobs as part of that restructuring.
Also in the spotlight are U.K. asset managers, who opened lower after the Financial Conduct Authority floated plans that could ban or sharply cut the ‘exit fees’ that they charge to customers. St. James’s Place (LON:SJP) and  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) recovered quickly to be up 1.0% and 0.3% respectively, while  Jupiter Fund Management  (LON:JUP) was down 1.9% and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) fell 0.5%.
Meanwhile, Italy’s Generali (MI:GASI) and defense and engineering group Leonardo (MI:LDOF) have both risen after upbeat earnings statements. Airbus Group SE (PA:AIR) is taking a breather after rising 4% on expectations that it will profit from the troubles of its rival Boeing (DE:BA)."

Richard Francis, Sandoz's boss since 2014, is stepping down, Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan said on Thursday, adding ""Richard has decided that for personal reasons he cannot commit to stay with Sandoz until the transformation is completed"".
Francesco Balestrieri, head of Sandoz's Europe region, will become interim CEO to oversee what Narasimhan called ""a multi-year transformation program"" in which Sandoz re-focuses on biosimilars -- copies of patent-expired biological drugs made by rivals -- and hard-to-make generics like insulin. 
Balestrieri, at Novartis for 25 years, assumes control over a division with nearly $10 billion in annual sales. 
Sandoz last year sold a U.S. pills and dermatology portfolio to India's Aurobindo and embarked on a ""de-integration"" of Francis's division from the rest of Novartis, a process Narasimhan said will stretch into 2020 and clear the way for talks about the business's future.
Narasimhan has been remaking Novartis by buying speciality treatments like nuclear medicine for cancer and gene therapy, while jettisoning an over-the-counter drugs business and eye surgery-and-contact lens division Alcon, due to be spun off as early as next month.
The departure of Francis, a British citizen, does nothing to quiet conjecture about Sandoz's future within Novartis, analysts said.
""We see our assumption confirmed that in the next 12 to 18 months a definitive decision may come about whether the generic unit will remain within Novartis,"" said Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath. 

""Even though the Novartis chairman said recently Sandoz isn't for sale for now, a spin-off like they're doing with Alcon would align with the strategy of becoming a focused, pure-play drugmaker.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - RWE forecast core earnings could fall by a fifth this year, as Germany's largest electricity producer struggles to halt a decline in profitability at its conventional power plants and grapples with Germany's plan to phase out coal.
RWE is in the process of taking over the renewable activities of rival E.ON and subsidiary Innogy, turning it into Europe's No.3 green energy group behind Spain's  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) and Italy's  Enel  (MI:ENEI).
It is also facing margin erosion at its large fleet of coal- and gas-fired power plants, which have also come under pressure following proposals by a government-appointed commission to exit coal as an energy source by 2038.
""The Commission clearly spoke out against forced layoffs and leaving people in the lurch,"" Chief Executive Rolf Martin Schmitz said. ""But we need some more details, as there are still a lot of questions that require answers.""
Finance chief Markus Krebber said it would not be easy to keep profitability at the group's conventional power plants stable.
Shares in the company were down 2.5 percent in early trade.
RWE expects adjusted core earnings of 1.2-1.5 billion euros ($1.4-$1.7 billion) this year after a decline of 29 percent to 1.5 billion euros in 2018. Adjusted net income is seen at 300-600 million euros, compared with 591 million in 2018.
Jefferies analysts said the guidance was 8 percent below consensus, adding it could be partly explained by higher costs for IT and the pending integration of the renewable units of E.ON and Innogy.
""But the driver for the remaining difference is unclear to us, and so it is difficult to say if the 8 percent miss is on an underlying basis or a more conservative stance from the management,"" they wrote.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - French firms signed contracts in Kenya worth some 2 billion euros ($2.26 billion) during a visit on Thursday by President Emmanuel Macron, who wants to deepen France's economic ties with Anglophobe East Africa. 
Macron's visit to Nairobi is the first by a French president since Kenya won independence from Britain in 1963 and follows stopovers in Ethiopia and Djibouti - all countries where China has moved in aggressively and presents stiff competition.
At a ceremony with Kenyan leader Uhuru Kenyatta, a consortium led by Vinci secured a 30-year concession worth 1.6 billion euros to operate a highway linking the Kenyan capital and Mau Summit in western Kenya.
Renewables firm Voltalia sealed a 70 million euro contract for a solar power plant while an Airbus-led consortium won a 200 million euro deal for coastal and maritime surveillance. Total is finalizing terms on a second solar plant.
""In Kenya there is an economic opportunity and it's within the president's strategy in France to look at not just Francophone Africa, but Anglophone Africa too,"" said a French presidential source. 
During a four-day trip to East Africa, Macron has vaunted France's soft power in culture and education and its military know-how to woo deeper partnerships.
Kenya is east Africa's most advanced economy with a liberal business environment and entrepreneurial culture. French businesses however account for just a 1.4 percent market share.
French exports to Kenya in 2017 amounted to between $170 million and $225.80 million, while China, Kenya's number one trading partner, exported goods worth $3.8 billion. 
""France has supported Kenya for several years in development projects ... but we are not sufficiently economically and industrially,"" Macron said on Wednesday night in a news conference with Kenyatta. 
France also faces competition from other European allies, including Britain which is seeking to revive its trade relationship with its former colony as it prepares to leave the European Union.
Kenyatta, who took Macron for a drive around the grounds of State House in a Kenyan-assembled Peugeot car, said he hoped France would become a more important trading partner.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Elliott Management received a potentially fatal blow in its proxy fight to shake up South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group on Thursday when major shareholder the National Pension Service (NPS) said it would vote down the U.S. hedge fund's proposals.
Elliott, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, has been battling to get South Korea's No.2 conglomerate to return excess capital to shareholders and fix governance problems since May last year when it scuppered a restructuring plan. [L4N1RG5BG] 
The fund has demanded 7 trillion won ($6.2 billion) in one-off dividend payments and seats on the boards of group companies Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis, in proposals to be put to a shareholder vote on March 22. Hyundai has rejected the proposals. 
The NPS holds swing votes in the proxy contest because it is the second-biggest shareholder of Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis, with stakes of 8.7 percent and 9.45 percent respectively. 
In a statement it said Elliott's dividend proposals were ""excessive"" and it would oppose the U.S. fund's director nominees because of ""conflicts of interest"".
The NPS vote decision was made at a meeting of its panel of outside experts, after South Korea's leading proxy advisor, KCGS, recommended shareholders vote against Elliott's proposals.
Global proxy advisory firm International Shareholder Services has recommended that Hyundai investors elect some directors nominated by Elliott, while urging votes against the U.S. investor's dividend proposals. 
Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis shares lost ground, falling 4.1 percent and 3.6 percent respectively on Wednesday afternoon while the broader market was flat.
""Chances of higher dividends have gone for now,"" Nomura analyst Angela Hong said.
""As the NPS opposes Elliott plans, there is no way Elliott will be able to push for its proposals."" 
Elliott was not immediately available for comment.
Hyundai Motor Group said the pension fund's decision would ""support our company’s future sustainable growth"". 
The group has said Elliott's call for higher payouts would limit its ability to invest in acquisitions and technology such as autonomous vehicles. 
The U.S. fund however says that even after the payout, Hyundai's net cash level will be in line with industry peers. Elliott has also raised concerns that Hyundai's excess capital will be used to fund non-core projects, citing the group's $10 billion investment in land for its headquarters in 2014. 
Shareholder activism is growing in South Korea after President Moon Jae-in made reform of the country's powerful conglomerates a key election pledge.
Calls for the country's family-run business empires to become more accountable increased in the wake of a corruption scandal involving Moon's impeached predecessor and Samsung (KS:005930) Group.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 02:18AM ET</span>",What General Electric investors want from CEO on Thursday,"By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Portfolio manager Michael Kon began buying  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co shares about a year ago and got more last fall after GE Chief Executive Larry Culp outlined plans to reboot the ailing power-plant unit.
""I wouldn't say that they've got their arms around it,"" Kon, who is also research director at investment firm value-oriented Golub Group LLC, said of the power trouble. 
""But at least they've identified all the issues."" 
Culp has a chance to attract more investors by providing greater clarity on GE's strategy when he and other GE leaders lay out their 2019 financial forecast on Thursday. 
Wall Street analysts expect GE to earn 70 cents a share this year and generate $1.9 billion in free cash flow, on average, according to data from Refinitiv.
GE optimists, spurred by Culp's actions, have fueled a 53 percent rally from the stock's low in December. As the first outsider to head the 127-year-old conglomerate, Culp has cracked open GE's books to more scrutiny, shaken up its board and stationed new leaders in trouble spots like power and insurance.
But Culp still faces many skeptics who dumped the stock as GE racked up staggering losses of more than $30 billion over the last two years and cut its dividend to near zero.
The camps are unusually divided: Of 19 analysts who cover the company, nine rate its stock ""hold"" or ""strong sell"" while 10 rate it ""buy"" or ""strong buy,"" according to Refinitiv. 
MURKY OUTLOOK
Those views did not change much even after GE reported a $22 billion loss in January or told investors last week its industrial businesses will lose cash in 2019.
GE shares are down 15 percent since Culp took over in October, and they are worth less than a third of their value in 2016.
Some analysts count Culp's candor as positive and say the cash flow warning shows serious investment in restructuring.
But others say the changes have clouded GE's outlook and want Culp to paint a credible picture of its future. 
GE's strategy of selling assets to pay off its outsized debt, for example, is ditching some of its most cash-generative businesses, such as rail and biopharma, said John Inch, analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. GE's power unit has cut 12,000 jobs and 30 percent of facility space but plans to spend more on restructuring this year, he added.
""Just exactly what are you doing in power with all that restructuring money?"" Inch asked.
GE's forced asset sales also mean GE is not getting good prices, said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management LLC. 
Investors who buy GE stock thinking it is cheap are ignoring cash outflows, strategy uncertainty and the fact that GE cannot afford to pay a dividend.
""The reality is, it's at $9 for a very good reason,"" said Pursche, who's firm sold when GE cut its dividend in 2017 and won't buy until the dividend returns and the outlook is clear. 

""Until you get a cohesive growth strategy,"" he said, ""there's no compelling reason to invest.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - By day, Yao Yu heads up risk control for an investment firm in the southern metropolis of Shenzhen. By night, he goes on the prowl for his own business, Ratingdog, sniffing out data that could bring clarity to China's notoriously opaque bond market.
Yao and a team of about a dozen part-time analysts scour information from China's exchanges and clearing houses to produce ratings, analyses and pricing models for new bonds. Their findings are then posted to a public WeChat account that bears Ratingdog's logo - a smiling, sunglasses-wearing border collie.
Since Yao founded the service in 2017, Ratingdog's free YY Rating, YY Valuation and YY Pricing products have become widely used points of reference for investors and analysts wary of unreliable credit ratings provided by official agencies in the world's third-largest bond market.
""In China, for fixed income, we need these kinds of services,"" said Shen Yi, chief executive officer of Shanghai ShenYi Investment Co, referring to companies such as Ratingdog. ""There's a lot of space in the market for good information."" 
Two defaults this year highlight the gap between official ratings and the Shenzhen upstart, which investors say is the country's leading provider of free, independent credit research.
(For a graphic on 'China corporate bond defaults' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2ChVjf7)
On Jan. 29, China's state-backed Minsheng Investment Group, a private investment conglomerate, missed a deadline for a maturing 3 billion yuan onshore bond, belying its rock-solid AAA rating from Shanghai Brilliance Credit Rating, one of China's four big agencies.
Ratingdog, however, had flagged Minsheng's heavy debt burden and limited profit potential as early as 2017.
Then on Feb. 22, Qinghai Provincial Investment Group (QPIG), rated AA by three agencies including Dagong Global Credit Rating Co Ltd, became the first state-owned enterprise in decades to miss a deadline for an offshore bond coupon payment.
Ratingdog, however, had warned in 2017 of QPIG's ""very large susceptibility"" to a downturn, giving it a speculative-grade rating of 7 out of 10.
Both Minsheng and QPIG subsequently made delayed payments.
(For a graphic on 'Investors demand more from riskier debt' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2ChWLOB)
IMPLICIT SUPPORT
While quantifying Ratingdog's reach is difficult, Josh Sheng, chief investment officer at Shanghai Tongshengtonghui Asset Management, said a ""large proportion"" of domestic mutual funds and securities companies refer to its ratings and pricing. In contrast, many investors all but ignore official ratings, which rank most issuers as AA or higher, implying little default risk and giving little guidance on pricing.
That is despite efforts by Beijing to improve the quality of ratings and strengthen oversight, including freezing Dagong's core ratings business last August for violating industry rules.
One reason for the preponderance of highly rated firms in China is an implicit assumption of state backing.
Jean-Charles Sambor, deputy head of emerging market debt at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management, said analysis of issuing companies has tended to focus on the likelihood of government support, rather than balance sheets.
""We basically don't use official ratings for our investment decisions, and they're not even very meaningful as a reference,"" said Liu Xiaofang, head of investment research at Shanghai Fengshi Asset Management Ltd.
More than a month after Minsheng Investment's technical default, and with the yield on a Shanghai-traded 4.88 percent Minsheng bond hovering above 13 percent, the company continues to boast an untarnished AAA issuer rating.
Ratingdog has rated Minsheng bonds at 7/10 since December, a level indicating ""many credit issues"" and a recommendation to avoid.
Shanghai Brilliance and Dagong did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
ISSUER-PAY
Drawn in part by the imminent inclusion of Chinese bonds in global indexes, foreign rating agencies have been racing to set up shop in China.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings recently became the first global agency to receive a license to rate Chinese onshore bonds. Fitch Ratings, which has established a domestic entity, and Moody's Investors Service have also applied for licenses.
Some investors hope that the international agencies will encourage greater ratings transparency.
However, S&P Global will follow an ""issuer-pay"" model in China, similar to the one that domestic agencies currently use. Many investors in China have been wary of the practice, whereby ratings are given to issuers enlisting the agency's services.
S&P provides issuer-pay ratings in other markets and says it has measures in place to guard against potential conflicts of interest. Its ratings of some Chinese issuers of both onshore and offshore debt, including QPIG, are notably different from those of domestic agencies.
But, says Ratingdog's Yao: ""There's a problem here, and it's a problem with overseas agencies, too, and that is: In the end, who are you serving? Is it investors or issuers?""
'DIFFERENT ROAD'
While interest is high for Ratingdog's products, monetizing that demand may prove difficult.
Only companies officially licensed to rate securities are permitted to charge for rating services in China.
But Yao plans to press ahead anyway, by introducing investor-paid customised research alongside its free analysis. 
""Charging for services is meant to help speed up our development and expansion, but it's also to understand real market demand,"" he said. ""After all, the only real demand is demand that's willing to pay.""
Ratingdog's growth could pose problems for it in what Hayden Briscoe, head of Asia Pacific fixed income at UBS Asset Management, calls ""a very licensed regime"".
""I would suspect that he wouldn't last for very long unless he had a proper license,"" Briscoe said of Yao.
A senior rating industry source, who follows Ratingdog on WeChat, said that regulatory requirements are ""very strict"", including annual audits with on-site checks conducted by regulators.
""If you give a rating, you also need to bear responsibility for it,"" he said.
Yao said he is following a ""different road"" and not seeking a rating license, but how to operate legally is ""a long-term consideration.""
BOTTOM-UP SHIFT
Ratingdog is not alone in looking to feed the market's hunger for information. Domestic brokerages and investment banks offer sell-side credit research, often bundled for free alongside equity research. 
One bank even uses a Ratingdog-like canine theme for bond analysis in its proprietary app.
BNP's Sambor said the rise of these alternatives indicates a broader shift.
""What policymakers are trying to achieve is to make sure that investors are looking at credit research from a bottom-up perspective rather than a top-down perspective,"" he said.
A ""massive repricing"" of onshore corporate bonds in the past 18 months has followed attempts to introduce more credit risk into the market, encouraging differentiation and better price discovery, Sambor said.
The spread of riskier 5-year AA corporate debt over AAA debt of the same tenor was 101 basis points on March 12, 56 basis points wider than at the end of 2017.
Still, even after 2018 saw a record level of corporate defaults, Chinese issuers remain relatively unlikely to default.
The marginal default rate - the proportion of the value of defaulting bonds to that of total outstanding credit bonds - was just 0.07 percent in December, according to China Central Depository and Clearing Co. 
With defaults comparatively rare, developing reliable ratings will take time, said Yao, noting that global agencies and markets have had more than a century of competition and experience.

Factory output rose 5.3% year-on-year in January and February, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported on Thursday. It was the lowest since 2002. The growth had been expected to slow to 5.5% from December’s 5.7%.
Meanwhile, fixed-asset investment improved slightly compared to the same period in 2018. The growth was 6.1% in the January-February period, marginally higher than the expected 6%.
Retail sales growth in January-February came in at 8.2%, in line with growth in December and just above the 8.1% increase forecast.
The data sent the Shenzhen Component down 2% at 1:51 AM ET (05:51 GMT), while the Shanghai Composite also slid 1.4%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was trading near flat.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.5%. The Nikkei Business Daily reported on Thursday that Japan's government is considering a slight downgrade to its assessment of the economy due to slowing demand from China.
South Korea’s KOSPI was little changed, while Australia’s ASX 200 was up 0.3%.
Although not a directional driver, U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday offered to push back a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping until a final deal on trade is reached.
“We could do it either way,” Trump told reporters Wednesday at the White House. “We can have the deal completed and come and sign or we can get the deal almost completed and negotiate some of the final points. I would prefer that. But it doesn’t matter that much.”
Meanwhile, comments by Gary Cohn, the former head of President Donald Trump’s National Economic Council, received some focus as he said the U.S. is “desperate right now” to sign a trade pact with China.
“The president needs a win,” Cohn said in an interview with the Freakonomics podcast.
“The only big open issue right now that he could claim as a big win that he’d hope would have a big impact on the stock market would be a Chinese resolution,” Cohn said of a trade agreement. “Getting the trade deficit down I will never say is easy, but of the issues on the table, that’s relatively easier.”
In the U.K., Members of Parliament will now vote again later today on whether to seek an extension to Article 50 after rejecting a no-deal Brexit.
Yesterday, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said a “no-deal” scenario remains the default option after her Brexit deal suffered another defeat in the British Parliament.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Utility-scale solar power capacity is expected to grow by double digits globally in 2019 and 2020, driven by expansions in the United States, Europe, Middle East and China, U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said on Thursday.
Solar power is the fastest growing source of electricity generation, taking market share from fossil fuels like thermal coal and natural gas as governments and companies increasingly introduce clean energy targets.
""We expect the combination of lower costs for solar and favorable policy support providing a multi-year runway for utility-scale to drive meaningful upside to the market,"" the U.S. investment bank said in a research note.
Goldman said it expected utility-scale solar installations globally to reach to 108 gigawatts (GW) in 2019, up 12 percent on the previous year, and then grow by another 10 percent in 2020 to 119 GW.
For 2021 and 2022 the bank expected capacity to reach 129 GW and 135 GW.
Utility-scale solar is defined as an installation that is designed solely to feed electricity into a grid, unlike smaller scale residential solar units. 
Including residential installations, most analysts expect global solar power capacity to soon hit 600 GW.
""We anticipate some of the strongest growth to materialize in key regions such as the U.S., Europe, and the Middle East while we see some potential upside emerging in China where demand appears to have stabilized in recent months following a collapse through the latter part of 2018,"" it added.
Solar power has been booming not just because of government and corporate sustainability targets, but also thanks to a sharp drop in panel prices in recent years.
Solar panel costs have plummeted from around $70 per watt of electricity generated in 1980, to $0.36 per watt currently in the United States, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Thanks to the solar boom, Goldman said it was ""selectively constructive"" on solar companies, with First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), Canadian Solar, Vivint Solar, Longi Green Energy Technology and Tongwei expected to perform well.

DUBLIN/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Deliveries of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX jets were effectively frozen on Wednesday, though production continued, after the United States joined a global grounding of the narrowbody model over safety concerns, industry sources said.
The 737 MAX is banned from flying in most countries across the world following an Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday that killed all 157 people on board. It was the second deadly incident for the relatively new Boeing (NYSE:BA) model in five months.
Airlines, aircraft industry experts and financiers said that although the ban would theoretically not prevent some domestic deliveries, most airlines would avoid taking a jet banned from entering service on the wake of two crashes in five months.
""Who is going to take delivery of a plane they can't use,"" said an aviation financier, asking not to be named.
Boeing produces 52 aircraft per month and its newest version, the MAX, represents the lion's share of production, although Boeing declined to break out exact numbers.
Boeing is expected to continue with production of the 737 at its factory outside Seattle, and has been planning to speed up production again in June.
Manufacturers avoid halting and then speeding up production as this disrupts supply chains and can cause industrial snags. But having to hold planes in storage consumes extra cash in increased inventory.
Each month of the grounding could cost Boeing around $1.8 billion to $2.5 billion in delayed revenue, according to analyst estimates, although that could be recouped once the ban is lifted and the planes are delivered.
Boeing in January provided guidance it would report $109.5 billion to $111.5 billion of revenue in 2019.
Asked how the global grounding of the 737 MAX would impact deliveries, a Boeing spokesman said: ""We continue to assess.""
Boeing's main U.S. customers -- Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines -- declined comment. So far they have voiced their confidence in the safety of the MAX.
""Although this MAX crash is clearly 'bad news' for Boeing, we think the company will ultimately battle through,"" Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said in a client note. 
COMPENSATION
Boeing has already been working through supplier delays on engines from CFM International, a joint venture between  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA, and fuselages from Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc that led to dozens of planes being parked outside its Renton, Washington factory last summer. 
This week, at least three freshly built 737s were parked at or near the factory with yellow weights hanging in the place of engines, signs of lingering issues, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
""We are still a few weeks behind the requirement, but have a line of sight to be back on track in the second quarter of this year,"" CFM spokeswoman Jamie Jewell said.
Boeing's 787 Dreamliner was grounded for 123 days in 2013 after its lithium-ion battery packs caught fire. The jet went on to become a popular twin-aisle with a strong safety record.
Aircraft contracts do not typically contain a clause that automatically allows airlines to claim compensation for a regulatory action like a grounding.
However, planemakers do sometimes pay out compensation to cover the cost of financing when an airline is left without a promised airplane, said a senior industry source.
Even then, they generally balk at paying for other indirect costs borne by the airline.
UK-based aviation consultancy IBA estimated the financing cost of a 737 MAX at $360,000 a month or $12,000 a day.
Norwegian Air said on Wednesday it would seek compensation from plane maker Boeing for costs and lost revenue due to the 737 MAX 8 grounding. 
Stallard said it was very difficult to estimate the amount of compensation Boeing would provide customers.

He added it would be impractical for airlines to try to switch their orders to the rival Airbus SE A320 narrowbody because there were no delivery slots available for a few years.

1168,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 12:04AM ET</span>",California jury awards $29 million to woman with cancer who used J&J talc,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A California jury on Wednesday awarded $29 million to a woman who said that asbestos in Johnson & Johnson's talcum-powder-based products caused her cancer. 
The verdict, in California Superior Court in Oakland, marks the latest defeat for the healthcare conglomerate facing more than 13,000 talc-related lawsuits nationwide.
J&J (NYSE:JNJ) said it would appeal, citing ""serious procedural and evidentiary errors"" in the course of the trial, saying lawyers for the woman had fundamentally failed to show its baby powder contains asbestos. The company did not provide further details of the alleged errors during the trial. 
""We respect the legal process and reiterate that jury verdicts are not medical, scientific or regulatory conclusions about a product,"" J&J said in a statement on Wednesday. 
The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown that its talc is safe and asbestos-free. 
The lawsuit was brought by Terry Leavitt, who said she used Johnson's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower - another powder containing talc sold by J&J in the past - in the 1960s and 1970s and was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017. It was the first of more than a dozen J&J talc cases scheduled for trial in 2019. The nine-week trial began on Jan. 7 and included testimony from nearly a dozen experts on both sides.
The jury deliberated for two days before delivering its verdict, which was broadcast online by Courtroom View Network.
Jurors found that J&J's talc-based products used by Leavitt were defective and that the company had failed to warn consumers of the health risks, awarding $29.4 million in damages to Leavitt and her husband. The jury declined to award punitive damages.
""Yet another jury has rejected J&J’s misleading claims that its talc was free of asbestos,"" said Moshe Maimon, a lawyer for Leavitt, in a statement on Wednesday. ""The internal J&J documents that the jury saw, once more laid bare the shocking truth of decades of cover- up, deception and concealment by J&J."" 
Leavitt's was the first talc case to go to trial since Reuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers.
Leavitt's trial originally included J&J's talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, a unit of Imerys SE, as a co-defendant. California Superior Court Judge Brad Seligman, who oversaw the trial, told jurors in February that the company was no longer part of the case after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the weight of the talc litigation, which stayed lawsuits against it.
While earlier talc lawsuits alleged talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiffs' lawyers have more recently focused on arguing asbestos contamination in talc caused ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure.
In 11 cases so far alleging asbestos contamination in talc, three have resulted in wins for plaintiffs, awarding damages as high as $4.69 billion in a July 2018 multi-plaintiff ovarian cancer verdict. J&J won three other cases and another five ended in hung juries.
J&J has appealed all of the plaintiff verdicts, and the company said it is confident the verdicts would be overturned on appeal.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 10:37PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo CEO gets 5 percent pay raise,"By Imani Moise and Pete Schroeder
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co gave Chief Executive Tim Sloan a 5 percent pay raise for 2018, the bank said on Wednesday.
Sloan’s base salary remained flat at $2.4 million, he earned $14 million stock awards and the board awarded him a $2 million bonus based on the bank’s financial performance and other factors, according to a company filing. 
In 2017, Sloan did not receive a bonus and his total compensation was $17.4 million.
Wells Fargo released compensation details one day after Sloan appeared before the House Financial Services Committee to show to lawmakers that the bank has reformed since 2016 revelations that it created millions of unauthorized customer accounts.
At Tuesday’s hearing, Sloan was peppered with bipartisan criticism for four hours but he navigated a hostile committee without a major stumble. [L1N20Z0NY]
His pay rise may draw further scrutiny from lawmakers, including Representative Maxine Waters and progressive firebrand Senator Elizabeth Warren, who have called for Sloan to step down. During the hearing, committee chair Waters criticized regulators including the U.S. Federal Reserve, saying they had not been tough enough on the country’s fourth-largest lender. 
Wells Fargo is currently prohibited from growing in size after the Federal Reserve issued an unprecedented asset cap on it in February, citing “widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns.”
“The Federal Reserve does not approve pay packages. We expect boards of directors to hold management accountable,” said a Fed spokesperson in an emailed statement when asked about Wells Fargo's latest executive compensation numbers. 
The revelation three years ago that Wells Fargo created millions of fake customer accounts prompted regulatory probes into mortgage foreclosures, auto insurance sales and its wealth management businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines.
During 2018, Wells Fargo shares tumbled 22 percent as the bank continued to rack up fines and disclose new issues.
Earlier this year, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) said that CEO Brian Moynihan’s annual compensation rose 15 percent to $27 million,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said CEO James Gorman’s overall pay rose 7 percent to $29 million, and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) said CEO Jamie Dimon’s compensation rose 5 percent to $31 million, according to regulatory filings.

Wells Fargo shares rose 0.5 percent to $49.92 on Wednesday.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 10:06PM ET</span>","SoftBank, Toyota in talks to invest $1 billion in Uber's self-driving unit: sources","By Liana B. Baker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of investors led by SoftBank Group Corp and Toyota Motor Corp is in talks to invest $1 billion or more into Uber Technologies Inc's self-driving vehicle unit, which would value the unit at $5 billion to $10 billion, said two people familiar with the talks.
The investment would provide a cash injection for Uber's self-driving program that is costing the money-losing startup hundreds of millions of dollars without generating revenue.
It could also help underscore Uber's value as the ride-hailing firm prepares for a stock market debut in which its value could top $100 billion.
Uber and SoftBank declined to comment. A Toyota spokesman said the automaker ""constantly reviews and considers various options for investment"" but does not have anything to announce.
News of investment talks was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which said a deal could be reached next month. SoftBank Group shares rose 4 percent in morning Tokyo trade whereas Toyota's stock was flat.
Japan's largest automaker Toyota injected $500 million into Uber last year to work on self-driving cars, where both companies are seen as lagging rivals like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving unit Waymo.
Uber, which last year lost about $3.3 billion, is betting on a transition to self-driving cars to eliminate the need to pay drivers.
The nascent technology came under greater scrutiny last year after one of Uber's self-driving cars struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona last year. Prosecutors last week declined to pursue criminal charges.
The challenge of developing the technology is leading to previously unlikely alliances, with SoftBank and Toyota partnering up in Japan. SoftBank has invested $2.25 billion in General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's self-driving unit Cruise, which has also received funds from Honda Motor Co Ltd.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor is considering asking ex-Toray Industries chief and Japan Inc heavyweight Sadayuki Sakakibara to chair its board meetings while leaving vacant the chairman post previously held by Carlos Ghosn, a source said on Thursday.
Japan's No. 2 automaker is considering nominating Sakakibara, a former head of powerful business lobby Japan Business Federation, to become an external director at the general shareholders' meeting in June, the source, who has direct knowledge of the matter, told Reuters.
The person declined to be identified because the decision is not final.
Nissan has tasked an external committee to help improve corporate governance after the arrest and ouster of Ghosn, who faces charges of financial misconduct including understating his compensation by about $82 million over nearly a decade. Ghosn has denied the charges.
A spokeswoman for the external committee declined to comment on the possible selection of Sakakibara. A Nissan spokesman declined to comment.
Sakakibara is already a co-chair of that committee, which is due to make recommendations this month on corporate governance including procedures for executive appointments and compensation.
Nissan, along with partners  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors, this week announced a major retooling of their alliance through the creation of a three-way board meeting to put themselves on a more equal footing.

BOSTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - ""Full House"" actress Lori Loughlin appeared in federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday to face charges of taking part in a scheme in which dozens of wealthy parents are accused of paying for their children to cheat their way into prestigious U.S. universities.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Steve Kim ordered Loughlin, one of several high-profile figures from entertainment and business caught up in the scandal, released from federal custody on $1 million bond following a brief hearing.
Douglas Hodge, the former chief executive of the investment firm Pimco, and another of the 33 parents charged in the $25 million scam, appeared earlier in the day in a Boston court. He was released on $500,000 secured bond by a federal magistrate who overruled a federal prosecutor's objection to Hodge keeping his passport.
The Los Angeles judge ruled that Loughlin could continue traveling to and from British Columbia for a number of productions she is working on as long as she notifies U.S. authorities in advance of each trip. But the TV star was ordered to relinquish her passport by December. 
Loughlin and Hodge are among 50 people charged with taking part in a scam that steered graduating high school students into elite universities, including Yale, Georgetown and Stanford, by cheating the admissions process. Prosecutors called it the largest such scandal in U.S. history. 
The University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California's interim president, Wanda Austin, issued a statement saying anyone involved who applied for the upcoming academic year will be denied admission, while current students implicated in the scheme will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. USC said Tuesday two employees -- a senior associate athletic director and women's water polo coach -- were fired in connection with the scandal.
Another parent charged in the scheme, Manuel Henriquez, resigned as chief executive officer of the finance company Hercules Capital Inc , the company said early on Wednesday. 
Gordon Caplan, who prosecutors say paid $75,000 last year to have some of his daughter's wrong answers corrected on a college entrance exam, was placed on leave from his post as co-chairman of the global law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, the company said on Wednesday. 
MONTHS OF WIRETAPS 
The mastermind of the scheme, William ""Rick"" Singer, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to racketeering charges. Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in Boston say his company, Edge College & Career Network, made $25 million since embarking on the fraud in 2011, offering what he promised was a ""guarantee"" of admission.
After months of having his calls wiretapped, Singer ended up cooperating with investigators last September, helping them secretly record incriminating conversations he had with parents.
The elaborate scheme involved bribing the administrators of college entrance tests to allow a child's wrong answers to be corrected or for someone else to take the test in their place. Singer also arranged for parents to bribe university coaches to attest to a child being athletically gifted.
In some cases, though not all, Singer ensured the child was oblivious to the cheating.
""They feel good about themselves,"" he told Caplan in a phone call, according to the criminal complaint. ""And they just have no idea that they didn't even get the score that they thought they got."" 
In some instances, Singer even helped doctor photographs to make a child appear athletic.
Parents made their payments to a sham charity Singer ran, prosecutors said, which also allowed them to take a fraudulent tax write-off. The fake charity, Key Worldwide Foundation, purported to help provide an education to ""underprivileged students.""
It was unclear how many children benefited, and investigators said more parents and coaches may yet be charged. In telephone conversations intercepted by investigators, Singer brags of having helped hundreds of students, while in others he reassures parents he has helped more than 20 or 30 other students cheat in recent years.
GIFTED ROWERS
Loughlin is accused of paying Singer $500,000 to help both her daughters cheat their way into USC by bribing an athletics official at the school to pretend the girls were gifted rowers. Her husband, the designer Mossimo Giannulli, is also charged with fraud, and appeared in court in Los Angeles on Tuesday before being released on $1 million bail.
One of the daughters, Olivia Giannulli, has become a prominent ""influencer"" on social media under the name ""Olivia Jade.""
""Officially a college student!"" she captioned an Instagram photograph she posted in September, which showed her in her USC dorm room decorated with items she had ordered from online retailer Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) , which paid her for the post. 
Other notable parents charged by the Boston U.S. attorney's office include actress Felicity Huffman, who starred in ""Desperate Housewives""; and Bill McGlashan Jr., who headed a buyout investment arm of private equity firm TPG Capital, which put him on indefinite leave after he was charged.
Huffman was one of several charged who appeared in court on Tuesday before being released on bonds. 

Representatives of accused parents either declined to comment or did not respond to inquiries. Several of the coaches accused of accepting bribes have been fired, placed on leave or have resigned.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Spotify has filed a complaint with EU antitrust regulators against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), saying the iPhone maker unfairly limits rivals to its own Apple Music streaming service.
Spotify, which launched a year after the 2007 launch of the iPhone, said on Wednesday that Apple's control of its App store deprived consumers of choice and rival providers of audio streaming services to the benefit of Apple Music, which began in 2015. 
Central to Spotify's complaint, filed to the European Commission on Monday, is what it says is a 30 percent fee Apple charges content-based service providers to use Apple's in-app purchase system (IAP).
Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify's general counsel, said the company was pressured into using the billing system in 2014, but then was forced to raise the monthly fee of its premium service from 9.99 to 12.99 euros, just as Apple Music launched at Spotify's initial 9.99 price. 
Spotify then ceased use of Apple's IAP system, meaning Spotify customers could only upgrade to the fee-based package indirectly, such as on a laptop.
Under App store rules, Spotify said, content-based apps could not include buttons or external links to pages with production information, discounts or promotions and faced difficulties fixing bugs. Such restrictions do not apply to Android phones, it said.
""Promotions are essential to our business. This is how we convert our free customers to premium,"" Gutierrez said.
Voice recognition system Siri would not hook iPhone users up to Spotify and Apple declined to let Spotify launch an app on its Apple Watch, Spotify said.
Spotify declined to say what economic damage it believed it had suffered. 

""We feel confident in the economic analysis we have submitted to the Commission that we could have done better than we have done so far,"" Gutierrez said.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday released formal plans to curb the sale of flavored e-cigarettes and slow a surge in teenage use of the popular nicotine devices.
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who has called teenage use an ""epidemic,"" issued the draft guidelines during his final weeks as head of the agency, after a surprise resignation announcement last week.
The proposal would allow traditional retailers such as convenience stores to sell tobacco, mint and menthol e-cigarettes, which the FDA says are more popular among adults than minors. But other flavors could only be sold in stores or online when strong age-verification protocols are in place.
In an interview on Wednesday, Gottlieb said the new guidelines give the agency flexibility to further restrict sales if youth use trends continue.
The agency is paying close attention to ""pod-based"" e-cigarettes such as the ones popularized by Juul Labs Inc, he said. Those devices use pre-filled, flavored nicotine cartridges and have been especially popular among U.S. high school students.
""The FDA did this in a fashion that's going to allow us to put in place additional restrictions if the youth rates continue to grow,"" Gottlieb said. ""It allows us to very quickly adjust our policy further.""
Under the proposal, makers of e-cigarette products would have to submit a formal application to the FDA by August 2021 in order to keep selling them, a year earlier than previously proposed.
Shares of tobacco companies  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc and Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM), which have been pressured by recent news of rising regulatory scrutiny into e-cigarettes, initially fell on the news before edging higher.
Gottlieb had said in November that the agency planned more restrictions on flavored e-cigarettes.
Juul and Altria, which took a 35 percent stake in Juul last December, said on Wednesday they supported the FDA's efforts to combat underage use. Juul announced its own plans in November for stricter age-verification requirements online and in retail stores.
Public health and anti-smoking groups said the agency's plan falls short of what is needed to curb underage e-cigarette use.
""A public health crisis of this magnitude demands faster and more forceful action than the steps announced by the FDA,"" Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement.
Data released in November by the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed a 78 percent increase in high school students who reported using e-cigarettes in the last 30 days, compared with the prior year.

The draft guidelines are expected to be finalized within the next three months, following a public comment period.

1179,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 05:46PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. New Home Sales Forecast to Tick Up
Housing data is on the economic calendar tomorrow, the part of the economy that’s been the most fragile.
The Commerce Department will report on new home sales for January at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that sales of new single-family homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 622,000, a tad higher than the pace of 621,000 from December.
On the labor front, weekly claims for first-time unemployment benefits come before trading at 8:30 AM ET.
Initial jobless claims are forecast to have edged up to 225,000 last week.
Last week saw a very anemic rise in February payrolls of just 20,000. But the jobless rate dipped again and wages grew more than expected, indicating some pricing power for workers as employers try to fill positions.
2. Dollar General, Adobe, Oracle to Report
While the first-quarter earnings season is starting to wind down, Thursday has some big reports.
Before the bell, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) is expected to report fiscal first-quarter earnings of $1.89 a share, up from $1.48 a year ago, analysts polled by Investing.com forecast. Revenue is projected at $6.6 billion, up 7.7% from a year ago.
After the close of trading, Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) weighs in and is estimated to earn $1.62 in the fiscal first quarter, up from $1.55 a year ago. The consensus revenue estimate is $2.55 billion, up 22% from $2.08 billion a year ago.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is forecast to earn $5.23 a share in the fiscal first quarter, up from $5.12 a year ago. The chipmaker is expected to show revenue of $5.83 billion, up 9.6% from a year ago’s $5.33 billion.
Software giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is forecast to earn 84 cents a share in the fiscal-third quarter, up one cent from the year-ago profit of 83 cents. Revenue is projected at $9.59 billion, down 1.9% from a year ago’s $9.78 billion. Nonetheless, shares are up 17.5% this year.
And Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), which operates a national chain of beauty salons and sells cosmetics and related products, is expected to earn $3.55 per share in the fiscal-fourth quarter, according to analysts polled by Investing.com, up from $3.40 a year ago. Revenue is forecast at $2.11 billion, up 8.8% from the same period a year ago.
3. Brexit Can Getting Another Kick?
U.K. lawmakers are set to gather in parliament for a third time this week to vote for a delay to Brexit on March 29.
There's little to suggest lawmakers will spring a surprise as the preceding two votes seen this week have played out as expected. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May saw her revamped Brexit deal rejected on Tuesday and a day later lawmakers also voted against a no-deal Brexit.
Many are expecting lawmakers in Brussels to grant the U.K. a short delay to Brexit, but remain wary the EU could attached strings to an extension.
The length of an extension and the conditionality the EU attaches, if any, will determine the market response, senior economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments said.
Some analysts have warned investors to steer clear of U.K. equities and the pound as the eventual outlook on Brexit remains murky at best.
""(I)nvestors should remain cautious, and avoid chasing short-term rallies in sterling or increasing exposure to U.K. equities,"" UBS investment strategists said in a note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, led by gains in healthcare shares, and Boeing (NYSE:BA) edged upward even as the United States joined other nations in grounding the company's 737 MAX jets.
 Boeing Co  shares ended up 0.5 percent at $377.14, recovering from a more than 3 percent fall in the afternoon, when the United States announced it was grounding Boeing's 737 MAX jets following Sunday's fatal crash in Ethiopia.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cited new satellite data and evidence from the scene of Sunday's crash, the second disaster involving the 737 MAX in less than five months. 
The grounding gives Boeing time to address any problems and not face another potential disaster, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. 
""It seems like the worst is over for Boeing,"" he said. ""The fact that (the stock) appears to be stabilizing means the market appreciates that."" 
Boeing shares are still down about 11 percent since Friday's close. The world's largest planemaker had been the best-performing Dow component this year.
Also helping stocks Wednesday, fresh economic data strengthened the Federal Reserve's patient stance on future interest rate hikes.
Producer prices barely rose in February, resulting in the smallest annual increase in more than 1-1/2 years, yet another indication of benign inflation. 
CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) rose 3.5 percent after Bernstein started coverage of the pharmacy benefit manager with an ""outperform"" rating. The S&P 500 healthcare index rose 1.1 percent. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) shares rose 2.6 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 148.23 points, or 0.58 percent, to 25,702.89, the S&P 500 gained 19.4 points, or 0.69 percent, to 2,810.92 and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.37 points, or 0.69 percent, to 7,643.41.
Energy shares rose as oil prices rallied about 2 percent. The S&P 500 energy index finished up 1.09 percent.
Adding to the upbeat mood was a vote in which British lawmakers rejected leaving the European Union without a deal in any scenario.
Fueling some volatility in afternoon trading, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was in no rush to complete a trade deal with China and insisted that any deal include how it treats U.S. intellectual property.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 61 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 65 new highs and 30 new lows.

About 7.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 7.4 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.58%. The S&P 500 gained 0.69%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.69%.
Energy stocks powered the broader market higher thanks to a rally in oil prices on data showing domestic crude stockpiles unexpectedly fell. That eased concerns somewhat about a glut in global supplies.
Tech stocks were also in favor as traders continued to snap up FAANG stocks. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ended the day higher.
But stocks eased from highs as President Donald Trump downplayed expectations that a U.S.-China trade deal would be announced sooner rather later.
Trump told reporters at the White House that he was in ""no rush"" whatsoever to make deal with China.
""It’s got to be the right deal,"" he said. ""It’s got to be a good deal for us, and, if it’s not, we’re not going to make that deal.”
Boeing (NYSE:BA), meanwhile, was volatile during the day, but eventually closed higher, snapping its 7-day losing streak even as Trump ordered the grounding of all 737 MAX 8 and 9 planes. The president's decision came on the heels of an announcement by Canada closing its airspace to the 737 Max based on data received today.
In other corporate news, streaming video company Roku (ROKU) slumped 14% after Wall Street turned bearish on the stock on concerns about rising competition from blue chip media companies like Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) and AT&T (NYSE:T).
Macquarie downgraded Roku stock to neutral amid fears over a frothy valuation at a time when competition in ad-supported video on demand is heating up.
Cannabis producer Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) rallied after it hired Trian's Nelson Peltz as a strategic adviser to bolster its marketing strategy. And Oaktree Capital (NYSE:OAK) surged 12.3% after Brookfield Asset Management acquired a 62% stake in the company.
On the economic front, traders digested mixed economic data durable goods orders beat expectations, but producer-price inflation missed economists' forecasts.
In geopolitical news, U.K lawmakers voted by 312 to 278 to reject leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement. That sets up another vote Thursday on whether to delay Brexit.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Exxon eyes Israel gas bid in major Middle East shift,"By Ron Bousso
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) is considering exploring for oil and gas in Israel, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, in what would make Exxon the first oil major to operate in the country still technically at war with Gulf Arab states.
A number of large gas discoveries offshore Israel and in nearby eastern Mediterranean waters in the last decade have made Israel a potentially lucrative prospect for big energy firms. The region is emerging as a new hot spot for gas exploration and production.
Until those discoveries, Israel was believed to be sitting on scant oil and gas reserves. There was little reason for energy firms to explore for energy in Israel and risk complicating operations and future investments in nearby Arab countries that hold some of the world's largest energy reserves.
Exxon executives held talks with Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz in Houston this week about bidding for the right to explore and pump oil from offshore blocks in an auction that Israel will hold in June, said the person with direct knowledge.
Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, recently acquired a $50,000 data package from the Israeli energy ministry for the auction, the person said. 
An Exxon team also visited a data center set up by the ministry in Jerusalem, the source said. That center holds detailed information about the geology of the sub-sea rocks, believed to hold up to 75 trillion cubic feet of gas and 6.6 billion barrels of oil, according to estimates.
Exxon declined comment. Israel's energy ministry declined comment.
In February, Exxon announced a major gas discovery in Cyprus together with its partner Qatar Petroleum. That field is near two other huge gas finds in the region: Leviathan off Israel and Zohr off Egypt.
The U.S. major and competitors such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and France's Total have avoided investing in Israel, for fear of souring relationships with the governments of giant regional oil and gas producers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq. Those countries do not recognize Israel.
Exxon is one of the biggest foreign investors in Qatar. It also has refining and petrochemical operations in Saudi Arabia, and produces oil and gas in Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.
President Donald Trump has angered the Arab world and stoked international concern with changes to U.S. policy in the region, including moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.
On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged oil and gas companies to use their clout in world markets to advance the Trump administration's foreign policy agenda. That included helping the administration's efforts to isolate Israel's arch-enemy Iran, and Venezuela.
(GRAPHIC: East Mediterranean gas - https://tmsnrt.rs/2O5muhW) 
MEDITERRANEAN GAS HUB 
The discovery and development of major fields off the coasts of Egypt, Israel and Cyprus have led to the development of the Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum, a partnership created in January between seven countries, including those three, to create a regional gas market.
Steinitz met with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry on Monday on the sidelines of an energy conference in Houston to discuss this partnership. He also held talks with his regional counterparts.
""We are just at the tip of the iceberg... Israel and Cyprus are little countries, but they have a good chance to become exporters in the future,"" Steinitz said during a panel discussion at CERAWeek. ""It's also important that we have the strong backing from the United States of America.""
Israel gas production is dominated today by a handful of local, Greek and U.S. companies. The country became a producer in 2013 with the launch of the Tamar field, operated by U.S. explorer  Noble Energy  Inc (NYSE:NBL). Noble is developing the Leviathan and is scheduled to begin production later this year.
Israel hopes that the coming licensing round will draw significantly larger interest than a previous round when only two companies bid amid skepticism about its ability to sell and export the fuel.
Israel has signed major export deals with Jordan and Egypt over the past two years, opening new markets to companies looking to sell Israeli gas. Egypt also saw rapid growth in natural gas production following the discovery of giant fields in the Mediterranean.

Several other major oil and gas companies are considering bidding in the licensing round, which closes June 17, according to the source.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investors ended their longest buying streak since October by pulling money out of domestic stock mutual fund and exchange-traded funds last week on global concerns about economic growth in Europe, according to Investment Company Institute data released on Wednesday.
Overall, U.S. investors pulled a net $2.64 billion out of domestic stock funds during the week ended March 6, after pumping in a net of $4 billion the week before.
The shift pushed total net outflows from U.S. stock funds to $13.5 billion over the nine full weeks of 2019 so far, despite a broad market rally that has pushed the benchmark S&P 500 index up 12.3 percent for the year to date. 
World stock funds lost a net of $1.13 billion for the week. For the year to date, investors have sent a net of $8.5 billion into stocks outside of the U.S. market. 

Both taxable and municipal bond funds continued to attract net inflows, of $6.05 billion combined, for the week. That was about half of the inflows the week before.

1186,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 04:20PM ET</span>",Parliament Votes Against No-Deal Brexit,"(Bloomberg) -- Britain’s Parliament voted to avoid an economically disastrous no-deal split from the European Union, opening the door to delaying Brexit and radically re-writing the terms of the divorce.
The House of Commons voted 321 to 278 to reject leaving the EU with no deal and is now expected to seek to delay Brexit in the hope of securing a better deal, which markets would welcome.
Speaking in the Commons, May said Parliament must now face up to the consequences of its decisions. She announced that if a deal can be agreed to in the coming days, she would ask the EU for a short “technical” extension to the March 29 exit day deadline. If there’s no deal, the delay will be much longer, she said.
It is almost three years since Britain voted to cancel its 40-year membership of the EU and with just 16 days to go until exit day, Theresa May’s government has failed to get an agreement that can win the support of Parliament.
The prime minister’s preferred deal, which took two years to negotiate, was resoundingly rejected by the Commons for the second time in a vote on Tuesday night. Now, MPs have decided to avoid leaving the bloc without a deal.
The question is, what kind of deal will Parliament vote for, and how much longer do Britain’s politicians need to make up their minds?
On Wednesday, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, warned that postponing Brexit won’t be straightforward.
“It could be a tactical, a political prolongation,” Barnier told Euronews TV. “In that case, I know the answers and the reaction of the EU side, the EU leaders, the EU Parliament: ‘What for? Why do you need a prolongation? Is it for organizing a new referendum, new elections or not?”’"

Mike Ashley, the founder and majority shareholder of Sports Direct, is trying to take charge of Debenhams by seeking to remove most of the board and install himself in an executive role. Sport Direct owns nearly 30 percent of Debenhams.

1193,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 02:06PM ET</span>",UAW leader puts Detroit Three 'on notice' ahead of contract talks,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - The leader of the United Auto Workers union on Wednesday warned that job security and preventing the shift of U.S. jobs to Mexico would be top priorities in contract talks with Detroit's automakers slated for later this year. 
""There will be no more quiet closing of plants, no more shipping jobs to Mexico and abroad without a sound,"" Gary Jones said in a speech to delegates the union's bargaining convention in Detroit. ""They are on notice.""
This year's contract talks between the UAW and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are likely to be contentious, with both sides also focusing on healthcare costs and the use of temporary workers. 
During the convention, the union announced an increase in the amount of money paid to members if they go on strike.
""The stakes are especially high this year,"" Jones said at a press conference, adding the raise in strike pay was necessary ""should the (auto) companies force us to that extreme."" He took no questions from reporters.
The auto industry is expected to hit a downturn after an unprecedented run of strong sales dating to the end of the Great Recession.
The talks follow GM's announcement in November it will close five North American plants producing less-popular sedans.
Just last week, the last Chevrolet Cruze rolled off the line at GM's plant in Lordstown in northeastern Ohio.
The closing has drawn a lawsuit from the United Auto Workers union and significant political blowback, including from Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - Ohio is a key state for his 2020 reelection chances.
The UAW has vowed to fight for GM to reopen Lordstown with a new vehicle. 
Analysts say, however, the chances of a new product being assigned to Lordstown are slim as the facility was one of several money-losing GM plants running well below capacity.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has said the cuts will help the company's long-term financial stability. The automaker predicts they will improve annual free cash flow by $6 billion by the end of 2020 - and fund new electric and self-driving vehicles. 
In the talks with automakers, the union plans to look closely at new technology such as electric vehicles, namely where batteries and other components will be made and whether American workers will produce them.

""Those jobs need to be here,"" UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg told reporters.

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 01:36PM ET</span>",VW halts truck unit IPO until market conditions improve,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Wednesday it would halt preparations for an initial public offering (IPO) of its trucks unit Traton until market conditions improve, stalling what was expected to be Germany's biggest share offering this year. 
The automaker had previously said it could list up to 25 percent of Traton in a deal that was expected to raise 5-6 billion euros ($12 billion).
Volkswagen said it would still aim for an IPO once market conditions improve.
""We regret having to distance ourselves, because of currently weak market conditions, from a stock market listing of Traton SE,"" Volkswagen Group's Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said.
Volkswagen's management board still believes in the rationale of a stock market listing when market conditions improve, Witter said. 
Britain's looming departure from the European Union and a trade dispute between the United States and China have caused uncertainty on stock markets, making investors hesitant. 
Sharp fluctuations on the markets make it difficult to determine the price for an IPO.
In September Volvo Cars and its Chinese owner Geely also postponed plans to list the Swedish carmaker blaming trade tensions and a downturn in the automotive industry. Proceeds from European listings are down 97 percent so far this year, according to Refinitiv data.
Volkswagen's management board unanimously backed plans for listing Traton and had in recent days been considering modifying its plan, including reducing the stake of Traton that it planned to float to 15 percent from 25 percent, people close to the matter said. 
On Tuesday, Volkswagen's Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said the board unanimously backed the idea of listing Traton but warned markets remained volatile. On Monday he had said an IPO of Traton would not come at any price.
J.P Morgan, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Citi had been hired as global coordinators for the listing. 
One of the top bankers involved, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, had said it would be foolish not to do the IPO now because truck markets would be worse off next year. 
Traton includes the MAN, Scania and Volkswagen trucks businesses. Volkswagen had aimed to list it as part of its drive to create a global trucks business.
""VW certainly takes its responsibility to maximise shareholder value seriously, which we think has been the rationale behind pulling the IPO on current valuations. Looks like we should respect this,"" analysts at Evercore ISI wrote.
A company presentation published in late February showed Traton had 2.77 billion euros in bank liabilities and 3.22 billion euros in other loans and liabilities.
A flotation could have given the business the resources to deepen its relationship with Navistar, a U.S. truck maker in which it currently owns a 16.85 percent stake.

A Purdue Pharma spokesman told Reuters that the company was looking at all options, but had not yet made a decision. 
The CEO's comments come a week after Reuters reported that the company was exploring filing for bankruptcy. 
Filing for Chapter 11 protection would halt the lawsuits and allow Purdue to negotiate legal claims with plaintiffs under the supervision of a U.S. bankruptcy judge, sources told Reuters last week.

More than 1,600 lawsuits accusing Purdue and other opioid manufacturers of using deceptive practices to push addictive drugs that led to fatal overdoses are consolidated in an Ohio federal court.

(Reuters) - Brookfield Asset Management Inc said on Wednesday it will buy most of Oaktree Capital Group LLC in a roughly $4.8 billion deal, creating an alternative-asset manager that would rival industry leader Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group in size.
The decision by Oaktree, led by distressed debt investor Howard Marks, to sell a majority stake of itself comes after a sustained period in which its stock has underperformed the broader market. 
Oaktree's stock is down around 13 percent in the last five years, even after a price bump on Wednesday following the deal's announcement. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index is up more than 50 percent over the same time and Blackstone's share price is up 4 percent. 
Brookfield approached Oaktree about the deal sometime during the fall season, a person familiar with the matter said. 
The deal is also a bet by Brookfield, which currently focuses on private equity, real estate, infrastructure and renewable power, on the prospects for investing in debt, which makes up around 70 percent of Oaktree's assets under management. 
""This transaction enables us to broaden our product offering to include one of the finest credit platforms in the world, which has a value-driven, contrarian investment style, consistent with ours,"" Brookfield Chief Executive Bruce Flatt said in a statement. 
The combined businesses will have about $475 billion of assets under management, Brookfield said in a statement.
Industry leader Blackstone had $472 billion in assets under management at the end of 2018. 
Oaktree shareholders can exchange each of their shares for either $49 in cash or 1.0770 Class A shares of Brookfield. However, Brookfield said the total amount will be paid in 50 percent stock and rest in cash.
The offer represents an 11.8 percent premium to Oaktree's Tuesday closing price. The stock was up 11.8 percent in mid-day trading. 
Both companies will continue to operate as independent businesses, while Marks, Oaktree's co-chairman, would join Brookfield's board of directors.
Oaktree shareholders, consisting primarily of its founders, certain members of management and employees, will own the remaining 38 percent of the company.

Starting from 2022, Oaktree's founders, senior management as well as current and former employee shareholders will be able to sell their remaining Oaktree units to Brookfield over time.

General Secretary Mouna Sepehri will move to an advisory position and leave the executive committee, Renault said on Wednesday, as it announced broader top management changes.
Ghosn is facing trial in Japan for failing to disclose some $82 million in income he had arranged to be paid later, as well as transferring personal investment losses to Nissan when he was chief executive. He denies any wrongdoing.
Ghosn's November arrest and dismissal as Nissan chairman, following an internal investigation, inflamed tensions with 43.4 percent-owner Renault that have begun to ease since his forced resignation from the French carmaker in January.
Product and program director Bruno Ancelin will leave Renault, the carmaker said in a statement announcing the appointment of his successor, Ali Kassai. Europe chief Jean-Christophe Kugler is also departing.
Sepehri's move, first reported by Bloomberg, ends her oversight of corporate governance, communications, legal and public affairs at Renault, as well as her influential role as secretary to the board.
Sepehri was among a group of Ghosn loyalists who explored legal ways to pay him undisclosed income via the Dutch Renault-Nissan BV venture, and had herself received extra pay from the subsidiary, Reuters earlier revealed.
New Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard will head an alliance board to include the CEOs of Renault, Nissan and third alliance member Mitsubishi, the companies said this week, pledging a ""new start"" for their partnership.

Nissan also said Arun Bajaj, who served as alliance human resources chief, will exit the company. Mitsubishi announced that Chief Operating Officer Trevor Mann and Vincent Cobee, another manager picked by Ghosn, are to leave, with former alliance commercial vans chief Ashwani Gupta replacing Mann.

JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co are nip and tuck in deposits. Bank of America, in early 2018, had decided to open more than 500 new branches across the United States by 2021.
Chase said it will also hire up to 700 employees in the markets, which include Charlotte, North Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from this summer.
The company will also open some of these branches in the cities of Philadelphia, Boston and the Greater Washington area in the District of Columbia - markets it recently entered into. 
JPMorgan had said last year that it was planning to open 400 new branches, of which 30 percent would cater to low-to-moderate income communities, and hire as many as 3,000 employees in new markets over the next five years. 
In its latest quarterly report, JPMorgan showed that consumer and community banking deposits grew 3 percent to $673.78 billion.
JPM's Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said last month that she expects growth in deposits to slow and the interest it pays for them to rise, reducing profit margins on its loans.

Shares of JPMorgan were up 0.7 percent in noon trading amid a rise in broader markets.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>","Ford says cutting U.S. salaried jobs, doesn't say how many","(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co confirmed on Wednesday it is cutting an unspecified number of U.S. salaried jobs as part of a global reorganization announced last year.
Said Deep, a spokesman for the second largest U.S. automaker, declined to say how many jobs are being slashed but said the company expects the process to be completed by the end of June. He said the restructuring ""has resulted in some separations of salaried employees and the reassignment of others.""
Ford said last year it was working to reorganize its global salaried workforce that will ""result in headcount reduction over time, and this will vary based on team and location.""
Last month, Ford said it would close its oldest factory in Brazil. It also said it would get out of its heavy commercial truck business in South America, a move that could cost more than 2,700 jobs.
Ford has said its global reorganization will involve thousands of jobs and possible plant closures in Europe and result in $11 billion in charges.
In January, Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett told employees that 2018 had been ""mediocre"" and added it was ""time to bury the year (2018) in a deep grave, grieve over what might have been and become super focused on meeting, and, in fact, exceeding this year's plan.""
Automakers are reducing costs amid fears of a slowdown in auto sales.

General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is halting production in five plants in North America and has cut about 8,000 salaried jobs, or 15 percent of its white-collar workforce.

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 10:50AM ET</span>",Philip Morris says Indian partner charges machinery costs; calls it 'business expense',"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) Inc's Indian partner charges machinery-related costs for manufacturing its Marlboro cigarettes in India, the company said on Wednesday, following a Reuters article that showed it may have circumvented foreign direct investment rules.
Philip Morris has for years paid manufacturing costs to Godfrey Phillips, despite a nine-year-old government ban on foreign direct investment in the industry, Reuters reported last week, based on a review of dozens of internal company documents dated between May 2009 and January 2018. (https://reut.rs/2NIlHD8)
Philip Morris and Godfrey have said they comply with Indian rules.
India prohibited foreign direct investment in cigarette manufacturing in 2010. Ahead of the ban, Philip Morris formed a new wholesale trading company with Godfrey in 2009, and the two sides signed a procurement agreement. 
Philip Morris' director for corporate affairs in India, R. Venkatesh, said on Wednesday that under that agreement Godfrey ""manufactures Marlboro cigarettes and recharges any costs related to special machinery for the manufacture"" of those cigarettes to the global tobacco giant's Indian unit.
""This recharge is simply a business expense,"" Venkatesh told Reuters by e-mail, adding that the arrangements were in ""full compliance"" with Indian regulations.
Philip Morris had not commented on the Reuters story after it was published on March 6. On Monday, Godfrey told Indian stock exchanges it was in compliance with Indian laws and any suggestion it had violated foreign investment rules was ""completely misconceived and misplaced"".
After the Reuters report was published, a senior official at India's main financial crime-fighting agency, the Enforcement Directorate, said Philip Morris and Godfrey were being investigated for alleged violations of the country's laws. The scope of the investigation, the source added, was much broader than the issues highlighted in the Reuters story.
Three former officials and one former head of the Enforcement Directorate had reviewed the Philip Morris documents for Reuters and said the dealings should be investigated for potentially breaking the foreign investment rules. 
""We remain available to discuss this matter further with the appropriate regulatory authorities,"" Venkatesh said in his e-mail to Reuters on Wednesday.
Philip Morris paid Godfrey for items ranging from large cigarette-making machines to costs of smaller equipment such as barcode scanners and printers deployed in Godfrey's factories, the Reuters review of documents found.
Six invoices issued by Godfrey showed billing of 45.5 million Indian rupees ($644,200) to Philip Morris between December 2013 and January 2018 for manufacturing-related charges. 
One invoice from January 2018 sent from Godfrey to Philip Morris showed the Indian company had spent 206 million rupees ($3 million) on capital expenditure for Marlboro-related manufacturing activities since 2009, though it was not clear how much of that was paid by Philip Morris.

Other than regular payments, Philip Morris also signed off on one-time expenses and refurbishment costs incurred by Godfrey on at least two occasions in 2013 and 2014. It then accounted those transactions internally under a heading ""Packaging - Research"", the documents showed.

The company has offered Peltz an option to buy about 20 million of its shares at C$10.34 a share, a small discount on the stock's close of C$10.64 on Tuesday. 
The stock option will vest ratably over a four-year period on a quarterly basis, Aurora said.
Aurora will tap into Peltz's extensive experience in the consumer industry and work with him to explore potential partnerships that will expand the company globally.
""We look forward to working with Nelson to further extend our global cannabis industry leadership by aligning Aurora with each of the major market segments cannabis is set to impact,"" said Aurora CEO Terry Booth in a statement.
The appointment comes weeks after rival Canopy Growth Corp appointed lifestyle guru Martha Stewart to help develop and launch a line of pot-based products.
Cannabis firms are also looking beyond recreational marijuana to drive sales, and the passing of the U.S. farm bill last year has opened the door for hemp, a cannabis plant with no or extremely low concentrations of ""high"" inducing THC. 
Hemp can be used in foods, organic body care and clothing, among others.
Cannabis companies in Canada have been pouring cash into their businesses to fend off competition as well as develop new products, after the country approved the use of recreational marijuana in October.
""Canadian licensed producers, and Aurora in particular, are well positioned to lead in the development of the international cannabis industry,"" said Peltz in a statement.

Peltz, who heads investment management firm Trian Fund Management, has waged battles against several consumer conglomerates, including a push for the separation of Kraft into Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) International and Kraft Foods Group (NASDAQ:KHC) in 2012. He won a board seat in Procter & Gamble Co in 2017 after waging what was the largest proxy fight ever.

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 09:25AM ET</span>",Norwegian Air to seek compensation from Boeing for MAX groundings,"By Terje Solsvik and Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air said on Wednesday it will seek compensation from plane maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) for costs and lost revenue after grounding its fleet of 737 MAX 8 aircraft in the wake of the Ethiopian Airlines crash.
""We expect Boeing to take this bill,"" Norwegian said in an emailed statement.
The Oslo-based airline has 18 'MAX' passenger jets in its 163-aircraft fleet. European regulators on Tuesday grounded the aircraft following Sunday's crash of a similar plane in Ethiopia, which killed 157 people and was the second crash involving that type of plane since October.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on Monday that he was confident in the safety of the 737 MAX in an email to employees, which was seen by Reuters.
Industry sources, however, said the planemaker faces big claims after the crash.
Norwegian has bet heavily on the 'MAX' to become its aircraft of choice for short- and medium-range flights in coming years as the low-cost carrier seeks to boost its fuel efficiency and cut the cost of flying.
""What happens next is in the hands of European aviation authorities. But we hope and expect that our MAXes will be airborne soon,"" Norwegian Air's founder and Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos said in a video recording released on social media.
""Many have asked questions about how this affects our financial situation. It's quite obvious that we will not take the cost related to the new aircraft that we have to park temporarily. We will send this bill to those who produce this aircraft,"" he added.
Idle planes will add to pressures on the airline, which is making losses amid intense competition at a time when several smaller European competitors have gone out of business.
The carrier has raised 3 billion Norwegian crowns ($348 million) from shareholders in recent months and said it would cut costs as it tries to regain profitability this year.
""If this situation gets solved within the next fortnight, this will not be very serious for Norwegian,"" said analyst Preben Rasch-Olsen at brokerage Carnegie, adding that seasonally low demand in March likely leaves spare capacity.
""The little extra costs they are incurring, they can probably get that covered by Boeing,"" Rasch-Olsen said.
""But if this situation continues into the Easter holidays, or May and June, then it is a problem. They (will) need to get in new planes. And then comes the costs.""
Europeans tend to book their summer holidays in May, so the grounding may not yet affect bookings for the peak season for the airline industry, the analyst said.
Meanwhile, Norwegian was maintaining its order for more aircraft of the same type from Boeing, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said.
Norwegian is expected to take delivery of dozens more of the 'MAX' in coming years, raising the overall number to more than 70 by year-end 2021, according to recent company announcements.
Shares in the airline have now dropped 10 percent this week as investors worried about the impact of the Ethiopian crash.
They fell by 4.8 percent in early trade on Wednesday but partly recovered to trade down just 0.7 percent by 1008 GMT.
Norwegian canceled some flights on Tuesday, and on Wednesday it canceled at least three dozen departures, its website showed, most of which were due to fly from airports in Oslo, Stockholm and other Nordic cities.
The airline was booking passengers on to other flights and using other types of planes from its fleet to help fill the gaps.
""We are able to accommodate most intra-European passengers by these efforts but are still working on other options for our passengers traveling between Ireland and the U.S.,"" Norwegian said.

MILAN (Reuters) - The top shareholder in EssilorLuxottica sought to ease concerns over governance at the merged Franco-Italian group on Wednesday by saying he would not insist on his right-hand man becoming chief executive of the combined company.
Italy's Luxottica and France's Essilor merged last October to create the world's biggest producer of spectacles and lenses. Analysts say the division of power at the group is unclear and that tensions could undermine the integration process.
The group has just launched the search for a new chief executive, to be appointed by the end of next year. 
Leonardo Del Vecchio, the founder of Luxottica who is now the largest shareholder and the executive chairman of the combined group, had appeared to indicate in November that he wanted his right-hand man Francesco Milleri to get the CEO job - a prospect that has irked the French side.
On Wednesday, a spokesman for Del Vecchio, 83, said his November comments ""shouldn't be interpreted as his desire to appoint Francesco Milleri as CEO of EssilorLuxottica.""
The spokesman added that Del Vecchio, who has 32 percent of EssilorLuxottica, wanted to transfer some operational functions to Milleri, so that he could focus more on strategic matters.
The governance issue came back into focus on Wednesday after a Financial Times report said the French and Italian sides were pushing their own candidates for the top job. 
Milleri started off as an IT consultant to Luxottica and grew closer to Del Vecchio over the years, eventually becoming the billionaire founder's most trusted aide and CEO of the Italian company. 
The spokesman said giving additional powers to Milleri now would not alter the balance of power with the French side of the group and would not affect the search for the new CEO. Under the terms of the merger, Del Vecchio and Essilor CEO Hubert Sagnieres are sharing powers for the first three years.
""(Del Vecchio's holding) Delfin wants to respect all the merger agreements,"" the spokesman said.
EssilorLuxottica declined to comment.
Analysts said the group should urgently define a clear leadership.

""It is essential for the execution of the plan. We think this should be a priority and cannot wait until 2020,"" said analysts at broker Equita in a note.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares ticked up on Wednesday, shrugging off mounting concerns over world growth amid optimism that British lawmakers were set to rule out a no-deal Brexit - hopes that also helped the British pound rally by half a percentage point. 
Britain's parliament is due to vote at 1900 GMT on whether the country should leave the EU on March 29 without a deal. It is widely expected to reject what would be an economically disruptive move, increasing the possibility of a delay in Brexit. 
Bucking a somber mood in Asia, the pan-European benchmark gained 0.3 percent, with British, German and French bourses all rising. Wall Street was also set to open higher, futures show.
Earlier in the day, MSCI's Asia-Pacific equity index had lost 0.3 percent as fresh data reinforced a picture of a slowing world economy. 
Japan's machinery orders fell in January at the fastest pace in four months, pushing the Nikkei down more than 1 percent.
Australia also continued its run of weak numbers, as an index of consumer sentiment slipped in March. U.S. monthly inflation rose, according to Tuesday data, but the gain was the smallest since September 2016.
That has compounded growing concerns over U.S.-China trade talks, with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer saying it was unclear whether gaps between the two sides could be closed. 
""Markets are still hopeful for a U.S.-China trade deal -- my concern is that this is not necessarily going to ride to the rescue of the weak economy ... ,"" said Steve Barrow, G10 strategist at Standard Bank. ""That means riskier financial assets like equities are going to struggle from here."" 
The jitters have kept MSCI's world index off the 4 1/2-month highs it touched when Washington and Beijing appeared close to a trade agreement. The index has failed to make headway in March after two months of gains. 
Britain's political chaos has also weighed on wider sentiment after parliament rejected on Tuesday for a second time Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal.
The pound rose on Wednesday ahead of lawmakers' expected rejection of the no-deal Brexit option, even though that vote will lack legal force.
Sterling touched as high as $1.3290, up from lows of $1.2945. By late morning, it was trading 0.7 percent higher at $1.3150. UK bonds nudged lower.
Still, UBS analysts said that even if lawmakers rejected no-deal Brexit, the eventual outcome was still unclear. It advised clients to ""remain cautious and avoid chasing short-term rallies in sterling or increasing exposure to UK equities"".

The other saga convulsing world markets this week has been Boeing's shares, as more and more countries ground its 737 MAX 8 planes after Sunday's crash in Ethiopia, the model's second fatal recent crash in les than six months.
Boeing's Frankfurt-listed shares lost as much as 2 percent to trade at six-week lows. A 6 percent fall in New York on Tuesday pushed the Dow down 0.4 percent. 
Expectations that the Federal Reserve will remain patient on rates and may sound more dovish at next week's meeting had taken U.S. 10-year bond yields to 10-week lows at 2.596 percent on Tuesday, and pushed the dollar lower for a fourth straight day against a basket of currencies. 
Yields on 10-year German bonds, viewed as one of the safest assets in the world, were a touch higher but within sight of more than two-year lows hit last week. 
The Australian dollars slid 0.5 percent, whacked by Australia's weak consumer confidence figures. That dragged the New Zealand dollar down, too.
The euro was flat against the dollar around $1.129, up from the 20-month lows of $1.1174 it hit after the European Central Bank pushed back its rate-rise schedule and announced a cheap-loans program for banks.
On commodity markets, the dip in the dollar helped gold hit its highest in two weeks at almost $1,307 per ounce.

Brent crude oil futures edged up around 0.3 percent to $66.89 a barrel, buoyed by an official forecast showing slower-than-expected U.S. production, and as U.S. sanctions stall exports from Venezuela.

1217,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Billionaire Nelson Peltz Joins Aurora Cannabis as Strategic Adviser,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire investor Nelson Peltz is joining Aurora Cannabis Inc. as a strategic adviser and is receiving stock options that could make him the pot firm’s second-largest shareholder.
Peltz, whose New York-based Trian Fund Management LP has more than $10 billion under management, will advise Aurora on “potential partnerships with leading corporations,” the company said in a statement Wednesday. Aurora’s shares jumped more than 7 percent in early trading in New York, reaching as high as $8.60 each.
“Nelson is a globally recognized business visionary with a strong track record of constructive engagement to generate accelerated, profitable growth and shareholder value across many verticals of great interest to us,” Aurora Chief Executive Officer Terry Booth said in the statement.
Peltz has been granted 20 million options to purchase Aurora shares at C$10.34 each, slightly below Tuesday’s closing price of $10.64 in Toronto. They will vest on a quarterly basis over four years, or faster if certain conditions are met. If exercised in full, that would make Peltz Aurora’s second-largest shareholder after ETF provider Vanguard Group Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“I believe Aurora has a solid execution track record, is strongly differentiated from its peers, has achieved integration throughout the value chain and is poised to go to the next level,” Peltz said in the statement. “I look forward to helping Terry and the extended Aurora team evaluate its many operational and strategic opportunities, including potential engagement with mature players in consumer and other market segments.”
Aurora, based in Edmonton, Alberta, hasn’t yet secured a major strategic partner along the lines of Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ).’s investment in Canopy Growth Corp. or  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc.’s deal with Cronos Group Inc. Constellation and Altria both have the option of taking majority control of the Canadian cannabis companies in the future.
While the cannabis industry has attracted plenty of high-profile names -- including Martha Stewart, who recently took an advisory role at Canopy, and Kiss singer Gene Simmons, who’s chief evangelist officer at Invictus MD Strategies Corp. -- Peltz is arguably the highest-profile investor to take a job at a pot firm.
Peltz has a long history of agitating for changes in the consumer space, including at Wendy’s Co., where he is chairman. Trian has also pushed for changes at major U.S. corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co., where he sits on the board; PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc.;  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ)., and Family Dollar Stores Inc.
Trian, which Peltz co-founded in 2005, shuns the term activist investor, preferring to be known as a “highly engaged share owner.”

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A growing number of companies trading on China's main over-the-counter (OTC) equity market are defecting to Shanghai's hotly-anticipated Nasdaq-style technology board, as they follow the money. 
Four companies, including Jiangsu Beiren Robot System Co and Jiangxi JDL Environmental Protection Co, have already decided to ditch Beijing's New Third Board, and apply for a listing on Shanghai's Science & Technology Innovation board, expected to be launched in months. 
Late on Tuesday, Certusnet Information and Technology Co became the latest defector, saying its shareholders will vote later this month to jump ship. More companies are expected to follow suit. 
The wave of desertions underscores the potentially disruptive nature of Shanghai's upcoming new tech board, which some see as the boldest reform undertaken so far in China's capital markets.
But as asset managers rush to launch tech board funds, and retail investors scramble to open trading accounts, there are concerns the new capital markets darling would replicate the boom-and-bust cycle experienced by the OTC board.
The New Third Board was launched in early 2013 to help fund innovation start-ups, but after an initial fever, the market has turned lifeless.
""Trading volume is tiny on the New Third Board, and the market offers little help in terms of financing,"" said Wang Qing, vice president of Beiren Robot, which this month decided to prepare for a listing on Shanghai's new tech board. 
Beiren Bobot, which counts Zurich-based industrial giant ABB and Germany's robotics firm Kuka as rivals, needs fresh capital to grow, and the new board is a good destination, Wang said.
Peng Hai, analyst at Lianxun Securities, estimates that 428 out of a total of 10,407 companies currently traded on the New Third Board are qualified for the new tech board. Although the OTC board has a low listing threshold, it is not open to public investors, resulting in a dearth of liquidity.
Shanghai's tech board, announced by President Xi Jinping in November, marks a radical shift from the presently lengthy and cumbersome IPO process. Now, the board's registration-based listing procedure cuts the regulatory red tape and allows start-ups that have yet to turn a profit to list.
""We think this could prove to be the boldest reform undertaken so far in China's capital markets,"" HSBC strategist Steven Sun wrote in a report this month. ""We also think it is one of the most significant moves in China's supply side reform of the financial industry.""
Shanghai's new board also exerts pressure on Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext, which is looking to embrace the registration-based IPO system too amid fiercer competition for listing resources.
For example, DaoCloud, a cloud computing start-up, said it will now aim to list in Shanghai, tearing up its earlier plan for a Shenzhen listing.
But Ronald Shuang, managing director of China-focused private equity firm BeiKai Capital, said the feverish mood around Shanghai's new tech board stirs memories of the once-hot OTC board. ""At first there was a lot of excitement around the New Third Board too...now, no company wants to list there.""

Shuang said one of his portfolio companies is leaving the New Third Board as well, but is aiming to float in Hong Kong, not Shanghai.

Shares in the German sportswear brand, up 22 percent in the last year, initially fell more than 5 percent but pared loses to trade down 3.5 percent by 1040 GMT.
Nike has been regaining ground, helped by a steady stream of new product launches and a strong showing by Nike-sponsored teams at the soccer World Cup, after several years when Adidas ate into its home market of North America. 
Adidas said currency-neutral sales growth would slow to between 5 and 8 percent in 2019, from 8 percent in 2018, with supply issues accounting for a 1-2 percent fall as it struggles to meet strong demand for mid-priced apparel.
In contrast, Nike has forecast sales growth for 2019 approaching low double digits, and German rival Puma a currency-adjusted 10 percent.
""The volume grew quicker than anticipated and we didn't respond quickly enough to that demand signal,"" Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told a news conference, noting that Adidas had doubled its sales in North America in the last three years.
Adidas produces 457 pieces of apparel a year, sourcing most of them from Cambodia, China and Vietnam. Rorsted said the shortages had nothing to do with U.S. trade tensions with China.
The company expects sales growth of just 3-4 percent in the first half of the year, speeding up in the second half as it ramps up supplies by reallocating factory capacity and prioritizing the U.S. market.
""The overall outlook is very solid for 2019, although top line growth will be rather back-end-loaded and this might be a temporary drag on Adidas shares,"" wrote Macquarie analysts.
Rorsted declined to comment on whether the supply chain issues resulted in the removal of Gil Steyaert as global operations head after just over a year in the role, and his replacement with Martin Shankland last month.
REEBOK RECOVERY
Adidas said it should reach an operating profit margin of between 11.3 percent and 11.5 percent in 2019, up from 10.8 percent in 2018, with the return of the Reebok brand to profit helping it hit a target originally set for 2020 a year early.
Adidas confirmed its other targets for 2020 and Rorsted said it would present a new medium-term strategy toward the end of next year. 
Fourth-quarter sales rose by a currency-adjusted 5 percent to 5.234 billion euros ($5.91 billion), ahead of average analyst forecasts for 5.2 billion, while attributable net profit came in at 108 million, versus consensus for 88 million.
Sales rose 13 percent in greater China and 9 percent in North America, but fell 6 percent in Europe.
Adidas said it expected to revive growth in Europe in the course of 2019, forecasting a slight increase in currency-neutral revenues for the region.
Rorsted said that Adidas had relied too much in Europe on a short-term trend for fashion shoes, like its retro Stan Smith and Superstar, with global sales of those models down half a billion euros in 2018 from the previous year.
To recover in Europe, he said it is investing heavily in marketing, including with sponsorship deals like the one it struck with English soccer side Arsenal.

""We will continue to invest heavily in sports. We want to be the best sports company in the world, not the best fashion company,"" Rorsted said.

1220,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 07:02AM ET</span>",Juventus Soars 17% as Champions League Shines Spotlight on Soccer Stocks ,"Investing.com - Shares of Juventus skyrocketed nearly 17% on Wednesday after a stunning comeback against Atlético de Madrid sent the Italian team on its way to the quarter-finals.
The shares' rally is particularly sharp because hopes of a victory for Juventus had been low before the game: the Turin team has lost the first leg of its tie against Atlético 2-0, leaving it with a mountain to climb. The shares had fallen 11% after that setback.
But the decision last summer to invest in Cristiano Ronaldo - reportedly paying an annual salary of over $34 million for the player’s four-year contract - bore its fruits on Tuesday. The Portuguese superstar managed a “hat-trick”, scoring his third goal with a penalty near the end of the match, sending fans wild and sealing Juve’s move into the quarter-finals.
“Maybe that's why Juve signed me, to help them. It was a magical evening,” Ronaldo proclaimed after the game.
Come Wednesday morning, it was investors' turn to celebrate. By 08:10 AM ET (12:10 GMT), after spiking as much as 22%, the shares of Juventus Football Club JUVE) were still up 16.8% at €1.4290. The shares may get another leg up if Juve gets a team seen as an outsider when the draw for the quarter-finals is made on Friday.
The jump in the stock price is based on more than the euphoria of owning a part of a winning team. Champions League quarter finalists receive an extra €10.5 million ($11.9 million) in prize money, while another €31 million ($35 million) is at stake if the team continues to win.
But the share rally has bumped up the club's value by a cool €200 million, far more than it would get in prize money even if its wins the tournament.
That's because success in the Champions League, Europe’s most prestigious football tournament, places the team on a high pedestal with sponsors.
The same effects have been playing out across Europe's stock markets as the Champions League's round of 16 has unfolded over the last two weeks. Shares in AFC Ajax (AS:AJAX) of Amsterdam soared nearly 8% after its stunning 4-1 victory against Real Madrid, champions in four of the last five seasons. Manchester United's (NYSE:MANU) stock gained a more modest 2% after knocking out Paris Saint Germain. And Germany's Borussia Dortmund (DE:BVB) fell over 10% as it crashed out against Tottenham Hotspur.
Expect a similarly spectacular reaction from shares in Olympique Lyonnais Groupe (PA:OLG) if it can somehow engineer a victory against tournament favorite Barcelona tonight."

WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will cut up to 7,000 positions, aim to boost productivity and deliver 5.9 billion euros ($6.7 billion)of annual savings at its core VW brand by 2023, in its latest attempt to raise profitability at its top-selling division. 
The plan, announced on Wednesday, comes a day after the German automaker warned it would cut jobs as it speeds up the rollout of electric cars, which are less complex to build and require fewer workers.
Volkswagen has struggled to raise profitability at the VW brand for years. Last year, the brand's operating margin fell to 3.8 percent, lagging peers such as Peugeot which delivered a margin of 8.4 percent. 
The VW brand is targeting a 6 percent margin in 2022. 
Volkswagen has ruled out compulsory layoffs until 2025, but early retirement of staff working in administrative positions at the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, will help reduce the workforce by 5,000 to 7,000, it said.
The new cost cutting drive is a continuation of Volkswagen's 3 billion euros Zukunftspakt savings plan. So far, VW has realized around 2.4 billion euros of the planned 3 billion annual cost savings by 2020. 
The 5.9 billion euro target for 2023 comes on top of the 2020 target, the company said.
At the same time, VW will create 2,000 new software jobs, as well as electronics positions in technical development, it said.
The company plans to become the world's biggest producer of electric cars by 2025, with the VW brand alone aiming to build more than 20 models on the group's electric vehicles platform.
The first electric car on the platform - the ""ID"" - will hit showrooms in 2020 and VW expects the launch edition to sell out, VW's board member for sales Juergen Stackmann said. VW declined to say how many cars would be produced for the launch edition.
VW will start building the ID at a factory in Zwickau, Germany, which has maximum annual production capacity of 330,000 models. Zwickau will also build electric cars for Volkswagen's Seat and Audi brands.
After Zwickau, Volkswagen will roll out production of electric vehicles to seven other factories worldwide including two plants in China and a factory in Chattanooga, United States, VW said.

1222,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 06:53AM ET</span>","StanChart suffers Asia private banker exits, boosts Mideast staff: sources","By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) PLC has seen the departure of at least four senior Asia-based bankers from its private banking unit in recent months, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said, amid growing earnings pressure at the business.
The unit is, however, adding 15 private bankers in London in the March quarter for serving clients in the Middle East, two separate people with knowledge of the matter said.
StanChart's private banking business caters to wealthy individuals across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe, through booking centers in Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai, India, London and Jersey.
The unit, however, has weighed on the group's earnings in the last couple of years, as competition in Asia, which accounts for bulk of its revenue, has intensified and market volatility has impacted the assets it manages.
Among those who left the London-headquartered bank in the past six months include Teddy Kwong, managing director and market head for Hong Kong, and Peter Lam, managing director and team leader for Hong Kong, said the people.
Both Hong Kong-based Kwong and Lam joined StanChart in the first half of 2017 from the regional private banking unit of  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) PLC. It was not immediately clear where the two are headed.
Ray Li, StanChart private banking managing director and head of relationship management, has also left after having worked at the bank for more than a decade, said the people and according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
The Asia, Africa and Middle East-focused bank has also lost India private banking head Sandeep Das, who joined  Barclays  (LON:BARC) PLC last month as India head of its business that caters to ultra high networth clients, as per a Barclays announcement. 
A StanChart spokeswoman in Singapore declined to comment, but said that the bank continued to invest in and hire for its private banking business in 2019.
""Our Private Bank has completed two years of repositioning and is building a stronger wealth platform that complements the business,"" the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.
The reasons for the departures of Kwong, Lam, Li and Mumbai-based Das were not clear and they could not immediately be reached for comment. The sources were not authorized to speak with media and so declined to be identified.
MIDDLE EAST PUSH
Loss before tax at the private banking business widened to $14 million last year from $1 million in 2017, the bank's annual report showed. Its assets under management also dropped 8 percent last year from nearly $65 billion in 2017.
Chief Executive Bill Winters said at an earnings call last month that the private banking unit had added new relationship managers to serve its wealthy clients, and is investing more to ""fundamentally transform"" the business.
Part of the reason for the sluggish growth in assets is that StanChart has had to stop banking some customers who would not disclose enough information about the source of their wealth, Winters had said.
""We've done a thorough reboot, we've added significantly to our numbers of relationship managers, and income is increasing.""
StanChart is bulking up for a bigger share of the Middle East market at a time when others are also expanding to tap the growing client base that includes wealthy business people, family offices and non-resident Indians.
StanChart declined to comment on the region's hiring plans.
The number of people in the Middle East with individual assets of more than $500 million is projected to grow by 28 percent to 500 in 2022, according to the Knight Frank 2018 Wealth report.

DBS Group Holdings Ltd, Southeast Asia's largest bank, said in November it would almost double its Dubai private banking staff to triple revenue for those operations in the Middle East by 2023.

LONDON (Reuters) - Denmark's Orsted is looking at ways to avoid potential tariffs on imports of components for its multi-billion pound British offshore wind farms in the event of a disorderly Brexit, the company's UK chief told Reuters.
With only 16 days before Britain is due to leave the European Union, there is still no ratified divorce deal, leading business to fear a ""no-deal"" exit that could see World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs applied to some goods.
Analysts at Wood Mackenzie say around two-thirds of the UK offshore wind supply chain is currently sourced from non-UK based firms.
""We have talked about ways of mitigating any potential extra costs a hard Brexit and WTO rules may bring,"" Matthew Wright, Orsted UK managing director said in an interview.
""We obviously have contingency plans as we are in the middle of building what will be the world's largest wind farm,"" he said. ""It may be that components can be imported and warehoused for re-export to avoid duties.""
Offshore wind farms are often so far out to sea that they don't fall within a country's customs territory, meaning they could technically count as export destinations. Goods brought into a country for re-export can avoid import duties. 
However, ""there are certain conditions with this like the length of time the products can be stored and the extent to which they could be assembled before exporting,"" said Ursula Johnston, director of Customs and Trade at international law firm Gowling WLG.
Orsted operates several wind farms off the coast of Britain and is currently building the Hornsea One project with Global Infrastructure Partners, located around 120 kilometers off the north east coast of England. 
With a capacity of 1.2 gigawatts, Hornsea One will be the world's largest offshore wind farm when complete next year.
The Wood Mackenzie analysts say a hard Brexit could see default WTO tariffs averaging 2.7 percent on imports and exports of offshore wind components.
""The tariffs may not be hugely significant, but they would be an unwanted cost,"" Wright said.

Britain said earlier on Wednesday it would eliminate import tariffs on a wide range of goods in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The European Union's decision to include the United Arab Emirates on its blacklist of tax havens was caused by ""lack of communication"" between the EU and the UAE government, the head of the UAE Banks Federation said.
European Union governments updated a blacklist of tax havens this week, adding the United Arab Emirates and nine other jurisdictions, tripling the number of listed jurisdictions. 
The list was created in 2017 after revelations of widespread tax avoidance schemes used by corporations and wealthy individuals to lower their tax bills. 
""We need to reach out. I understand the reasons, and I’m sure the UAE will want to play as a global citizen,"" Abdulaziz al-Ghurair, the banking group's chairman, told reporters during a banking conference in Dubai. ""I’m sure in the near future this will be solved.""
Blacklisted states face stricter controls on transactions with the EU, although no sanctions have yet been agreed by EU states.
""Because we have chosen to be an international financial center, we have to comply with the world's regulations ..."" Al-Ghurair said. ""We had issues like this in the past and they've been solved.""
On Wednesday the UAE government said in a statement that it was committed to all international tax agreements and that it was working with its international partners, ""especially the European Union, to achieve compliance with these charters.""
""We are confident that the European Union will lift the United Arab Emirates' name from its list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes,"" said Younis Haji Al Khoori, undersecretary of the ministry of finance. 
UAE BANKS
Al-Ghurair said local banks need to be ""practical"" in dealing with a downturn in Dubai's real estate market, which has been a major drag on the local economy over the past few years. He called on banks to be proactive by giving customers extensions on loans, to reflect the drop in property prices.
""This is protecting the economy, the customer, and the banking system,"" he said.
The UAE has 50 commercial banks, a number considered too high in a country of about 9.5 million people. After two of the UAE's biggest banks merged in 2017 to become First Abu Dhabi Bank, three more are in talks to combine, led by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.
Mergers so far have only happened in single emirates, but Al-Ghurair said cross-emirates mergers would be a ""good sign.""
Analysts expect mergers to accelerate given a slowing economy, slide in house prices, robust accounting standards and tougher competition.
Al-Ghurair is also the chief executive of Dubai's Mashreqbank, the largest privately owned bank in the United Arab Emirates.

Mashreq will close half its branches this year, he said. About 25 will be converted to ""total digital branches,"" as part of a digital transformation plan that will see it spend half a billion dirhams over the next five years.

Edmond de Rothschild Holding SA is set to offer 17,945 Swiss francs ($17,836) in cash for each publicly traded bearer share of the private bank and asset manager, or 15,500 francs after deducting the proposed dividend, it said. 
The stock, which closed on Tuesday at 16,400 francs, rose more than 8 percent to a high of 17,800 in early trading before paring gains to trade up 6.7 percent by 0930 GMT. 
Founded in 1953, the Edmond de Rothschild Group has more than 170 billion francs in assets under management and 1.1 billion francs in revenue, it said.
The Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) banking unit alone had client assets of 128 billion francs at the end of 2018, down 7 percent from a year earlier as adverse markets and currency conditions weighed. It saw an outflow of 2.5 billion francs in assets under management last year.
The buyout offer follows settlement last year of a dispute among Rothschild cousins over the commercial use of the banking dynasty's historic family name. 
It involves unwinding cross-holdings and buying back shares in a transaction that will cost nearly 100 million francs to give complete control of the bank to the family that already owns a majority stake.
""By taking it private, we are demonstrating our commitment to our banking group and our ambitions for growth, both organic and through acquisitions,"" said Benjamin de Rothschild, chairman of Edmond de Rothschild Holding SA's board of directors.
A spokeswoman said the Swiss bank was not for sale.

OSLO (Reuters) - The ethics watchdog for Norway's $1-trillion wealth fund will focus this year on shipbreaking on India's beaches, which endangers workers and pollutes the sea and sand, and will also look into pollution caused by pharmaceutical companies.
The world's largest sovereign wealth fund, created from the proceeds of Norway's oil industry, operates under ethical guidelines set by parliament.
The fund's Council of Ethics checks that companies the fund invests in meet these ethical standards. It set out its latest priorities in its annual report published on Wednesday. 
Johan H. Andresen, chair of the Council on Ethics, said the watchdog would turn its attention to shipbreaking in India.
More than 80 percent of aging commercial ships are broken up on the beaches of Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. 
Norway's fund already excluded four firms in 2018 because they scrap ships on beaches in Bangladesh and Pakistan.
""First you establish a practice and then you open up to new countries, because we don't have the capacity to look everywhere at the same time,"" Andresen told Reuters ahead of the publication the annual report.
""We look at whether there is a systemic, or gross, violation of human rights or damage to the environment."" 
ETHICAL AMBITIONS
The fund owns shares in 9,158 companies, 1.4 percent of the world's listed equity, so decisions to drop or reinstate companies from its investments carry considerable weight among investors.
It is forbidden by law from investing in companies that produce nuclear weapons or landmines, or are involved in human rights violations, among other criteria.
Some 71 companies are presently excluded on recommendations by the Council on Ethics, on various grounds. Another 69 companies are excluded directly by the central bank based on their dependence on thermal coal.
The fund makes recommendations, either to exclude a company from the fund or to put it on a watch list, to the board of the Norwegian central bank, which then makes the final call. The board often, but not always, follows the recommendations.
The fund gradually sells shares in any company it wishes to drop, before any announcement is made. The main aim is to remove the ethical risk.
ANTIBIOTICS POLLUTION
This year the Council on Ethics will also look for the first time into the pollution, particularly from antibiotic production, caused by pharmaceutical companies. 
""In 2019, the council will contact the companies and may commission its own study of the problem,"" the annual report said. 
Another new focus will be economic activity that could endanger UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Andresen's advice on this issue was clear. 
""Besides don't do it, be especially diligent on everything, from the local partners you pick, to making risk assessments, and be especially careful about the corruption risk,"" he said.
The 57-year-old Norwegian, who also owns private investment vehicle Ferd, said there would probably be less than 20 recommendations made this year, stressing the number could vary depending on the progress of the various studies the council conducts.
One recommendation could involve a company breaching the human rights of its workers in the Gulf states, he said. 
""We have been in dialogue with one company for quite some time. A recommendation may be made before the summer, unless the company makes some major changes to its business practice,"" Andresen said. 

Another recommendation could involve a company involved in the building of a large infrastructure project in the Americas that contribute to breaches of human rights of indigenous peoples. He did not name the company.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Big Japanese firms offered smaller pay increases at annual wage talks on Wednesday as the economy sputters, tempering hopes that domestic consumption will offset external risks to growth.
Major firms are set to raise wages for a sixth straight year as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe kept up the pressure on businesses to boost pay in an effort to beat deflation that has dogged Japan for nearly two decades.
But as economic growth slows, firms have grown wary about offering big pay increases because that commits them to higher fixed costs at a time of uncertainty as company profits are leveling off.
Caught between the fear of a profit squeeze and the need to raise pay scales for low-paid part-timers and those employed at small firms to address the country's labor shortages, Japanese firms cannot afford to hike wages much for full-time workers, analysts say. 
""Momentum towards wage hikes may weaken as underlying inflation remains weak,"" said Hisashi Yamada, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
""Uncertainty is high on the external outlook such as the U.S.-China trade war and Europe's unstable politics. On top of that, a national sales tax is scheduled to increase in October. Without enough wage hikes, it's difficult to defeat deflation.""
The results of the ""shunto"" talks between management and unions - announced by major companies in sectors such as cars and electronics - set the tone for full-time employees' wages across the nation, which have implications for consumer spending and inflation.
GLOBAL UNCERTAINTIES
A slowdown in the global economy, the Sino-U.S. trade war and trepidation over the final shape of a deal to seal Britain's exit from the European Union have sharply increased strains on businesses worldwide. 
Faced with the heightened uncertainty about the growth outlook, cautious Japanese firms focus more on the annual total sum payment including bonuses than monthly base pay, which will determine retirement payment and pension benefits.
Bellwether Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Japan's largest automaker, offered on Wednesday a pay raise of 10,700 yen ($96.21) on average, down 1,000 yen from last year.
""We made the decision as the sales tax rises in autumn, while taking into account the need to raise productivity, competitiveness and respond to unionists' motivations,"" Tatsuro Ueda, chief officer at Toyota's general administration and human resources group, told reporters.
Honda Motor Co (T:7267) offered a base salary increase of 1,400 yen, down 300 yen from 2018, while Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) came up with a rise of 3,000 yen, unchanged from last year.
Electronics giants such as Panasonic Corp (T:6752), Hitachi Ltd (T:6501) and Mitsubishi Electric Corp (T:6503) all offered a base pay raise of 1,000 yen, down 500 yen from last year.
""The trend of wage hikes remains intact. I hope wage growth will continue to boost the economy's virtuous cycle,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. 
A survey by the Institute of Labour Administration, a think tank, predicted wage growth will slow to 2.15 percent this year, pulling away from last year's 2.26 percent and the 17-year peak of 2.38 percent in 2015, despite hefty corporate cash piles.
A Reuters Corporate Survey last month found a slim majority - 51 percent of firms polled - saw wages rising around 1.5-2 percent this year.
But while companies are conservative with pay raises, many have directed their large cash piles toward share buybacks to ensure better returns for their investors.
PAY HIKE OR WORK-STYLE REFORM
In the coming fiscal year from April 1, Abe's government will start to implement work-style reform to curb Japan's notoriously long work hours.
The reform also includes ""equal pay for equal work"" aimed at narrowing the pay gap between full-time employees and contract workers or part-timers, and raising the retirement age to cope with the ageing population.
The move has shifted focus away from pay hikes with both unions and management, dashing policymakers' hopes of stoking a virtuous cycle of a tight job market boosting wages to stimulate consumption and spur inflation to the BOJ's 2 percent target.
Japan's unions tend not to be so aggressive in pressing their demands as those in the West because they attach greater importance to job security and retain a sense of company loyalty.
The dwindling union membership has deprived unionists of bargaining powers, with companies hiring more non-unionized part-timers and nonregular employees, who represent nearly 40 percent of workers.
""At this year's shunto, both companies and unions don't seem to put greater emphasis on wage hikes than before,"" said Kiichi Murashima, economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Japan.
""Instead, they are considering a wider range of issues like pay disparity, labor productivity and work-life balance.""

1230,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 04:54AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Inditex, Adidas Struggle as Brexit Drama Grinds On","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were mixed after early trading on Wednesday, unwilling to read too much into another devastating defeat for the U.K. government’s plan for leaving the European Union and weighed on by disappointing updates from two of the continent’s biggest names in apparel.
 Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of fashion chains Zara and Massimo Dutti, fell 4.7% after posting fourth-quarter results that were a little below expectations. However, the shortfall was largely due to foreign exchange factors, and the company both raised its dividend and predicted sales growth would accelerate this year.
As such, the picture is not quite the routine doom-and-gloom that investors have come to expect from retail names – especially since the European Central Bank is now clearly onside when it comes to addressing the currency headwinds.
It’s harder to put a positive spin on Adidas' (DE:ADSGN) results. The German sportswear company fell 4.7% after saying it will miss its sales target this year due to supply chain constraints, particularly in the key U.S. market where it has staged an impressive comeback in recent years.
German fintech Wirecard (DE:WDIG) is also down 2.9% after news that it has suspended one of its managers pending an investigation into allegations of fraudulent accounting. It said earlier this week it had ‘lost contact’ with Edo Kurniawan, the executive at the heart of the allegations. Five other managers are suspected of “arrestable offences” by the Singapore prosecutors, according to the Financial Times.
If only Cristiano Ronaldo could do for the market in general what he did for Juventus (MI:JUVE).
The Italian soccer club’s shares rose 16% in response to a dramatic and unlikely 3-0 victory over Atletico de Madrid last night, in which Ronaldo scored all three goals. That keeps the club in the lucrative Champions League for another round."

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down 0.05 percent by 0816 GMT, after closing 0.06 percent down on Tuesday as it became clear British Prime Minister Theresa May would lose a key vote in Parliament on her plans for an orderly Brexit.
London's FTSE was also little changed, down 0.1 percent as the pound recouped some of its losses from the previous session.
Among individual stocks, shares in Germany's Adidas (DE:ADSGn) posted the worst performance, losing 5.5 percent after announcing that supply chain issues would hit its sales growth in the first half of 2019, particularly in North America.
Another big loser was cash-rich Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) which was down 4.7 percent after it published annual earnings slightly below analysts' expectations.

Wirecard (DE:WDIG) was the third-biggest faller, with a 4.3 percent hit after it suspended an accounting employee in Singapore amid allegations of fraud and creative accounting.

Australia’s dollar slid with bond yields after weak consumer confidence data reinforced a deteriorating outlook for the economy. The dollar ticked higher and the yuan dipped.

Sterling is on the back foot again after U.K. lawmakers Tuesday rejected the government’s latest deal to leave the European Union, raising the prospect that the divorce will be delayed or even reversed. Parliament will now probably vote to postpone Brexit this week, and lawmakers -- including some of May’s own Cabinet -- will likely try to maneuver to force the government to rip up its Brexit plans and start again.
Alongside Brexit developments, investors have a slew of economic data to digest.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE (HK:0763) Corp's controlling shareholder plans to reduce its stake by as much as 3 percent after the stock more than doubled in value since surviving a U.S. sanction last year, showed regulatory filings late on Tuesday. 
The stock slumped as much as 7.6 percent in Shenzhen on Wednesday following the news. Its Hong Kong-listed shares dropped as much as 5.6 percent.
The Chinese firm was crippled early last year after breaking U.S. sanctions and was only able to resume business in July after paying $1.4 billion in penalties to lift a U.S. supplier ban. The stock has since risen around 150 percent in Shenzhen.

ZTE in the filings said state-owned controlling shareholder Zhongxingxin Telecom plans to sell up to 2 percent in ZTE A-shares via block trades within 90 days. Zhongxingxin has also proposed to use not more than 41.9 million ZTE A-shares, or 1 percent of the company's total share capital, to subscribe for units in the ICBCCS SHSZ 300 exchange-traded fund.

(Reuters) - Ride-hailing startup Uber Technologies Inc has hired a string of investment banks to its syndicate of initial public offering underwriters, as it ramps up preparations for a stock market debut, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Smaller rival Lyft Inc is racing to list in the stock market at the end of March. While Uber will not beat Lyft to an IPO, the preparations are aimed at giving it the flexibility to go public as early as the first half of 2019, the sources said.
Uber has added more than half a dozen investment banks, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), Allen & Company,  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and JMP Securities, to its IPO underwriting lineup, the sources said. 
These banks will support  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), which Uber hired late last year to lead its public offering, the sources added. Uber will make additional bank hires in the coming weeks to complete the IPO syndicate, the sources said.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Representatives for Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup and JMP Securities declined to comment. Uber, Allen & Company and Deutsche Bank did not immediately return requests for comment. 
Several investment banks held off pitching Lyft for an IPO role in order to be hired by Uber, a more lucrative and high-profile assignment given its size and status. However, JMP Securities managed to get on both Uber and Lyft's IPO syndicates, showing that such overlap is possible, albeit mainly with more junior underwriting roles. 
Lending relationships between the companies and the banks have also proved important in winning IPO roles. 
Lyft's top-tier of seven underwriters was responsible for around a quarter of capital raised through last year, compared to more than 40 percent for the six top-tier banks that Uber has hired so far, according to Dealogic. 
Like Lyft, Uber filed confidentially for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December. Its bankers have indicated it could be valued at as much as $120 billion, though some analysts have pegged its value closer to $100 billion based on the earning figures it discloses. 
Lyft could be valued close to $25 billion in its IPO, according to the sources.

Earlier on Tuesday, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle a lawsuit brought nearly six years ago by drivers who claimed they are employees, not independent contractors. Uber still faces thousands of arbitration claims from drivers who are not covered by the settlement.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 10:00PM ET</span>",Airlines keep calm and carry on after Boeing jet groundings,"By Jamie Freed and Alexander Cornwell
SINGAPORE/DUBAI (Reuters) - Groundings of brand-new Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX 8 jets have sent shockwaves through global aviation after a crash in Ethiopia, but many airlines are managing to keep to schedule with other jets while economic woes mean some may be grateful for a pause.
The 737 Max 8 upgrade to Boeing's best-selling jet only entered service in 2017, meaning there are not many in the skies compared with other more established work horses.
""If you had a grounding of something like the 737-800, wow what an impact. But with the MAX, there are fewer than 400 of these flying globally,"" one aviation analyst said, adding that most airlines could ""backfill most of the capacity"".
The Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people on Sunday was the second 737 MAX crash in less than six months, with 189 others killed when a Lion Air jet went down in Indonesia in October.
There were 371 of the 737 MAX family jets in operation before this week's groundings, led by China, according to Flightglobal. Around two-thirds of the fleet is now grounded, based on Reuters calculations.
That compares to more than 6,000 of the previous model, the 737 NG series, giving airlines the ability to use other jets in their fleets as a replacement for at least some of the flights.
""At present the impact of any groundings is contained by the relatively small global fleet currently in service,"" aviation consultant John Strickland told Reuters.
The time of year and signs of concerns about a peak in global aviation growth and a slowdown in the economy means cutting capacity is not necessarily negative for airlines. 
""It is off-season so it is an easier gesture to make, and some airlines are more worried about having too much capacity,"" a Western aviation official said.
For others who are able to make do without the 737 MAX 8 for a period, doing so is likely to come at a cost.
""It is a headache for airlines to take aircraft out of service with flights likely to be canceled and an impact on revenues,"" Strickland added.
Although March is not a peak season for flights, some have been hit, with Chinese aviation data firm Variflight on Monday saying at least 29 international and domestic flights had been canceled.
However, airlines had swapped for other planes on 256 other flights that had been scheduled to use the 737 MAX 8.
Singapore's Changi Airport said on Tuesday that one planned 737 MAX flight by Shandong Airlines to and from Jinan had been canceled, but others had gone ahead with different aircraft.
Singapore Airlines Ltd, Indonesia's Lion Air and Garuda Indonesia and state-backed carriers Air China Ltd, China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd and China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines Co Ltd all have large fleets of jets other than the MAX to draw on, the analyst said.
The bigger impact from the Ethiopian crash could be on future deliveries, since other carriers including Korean Air Lines Co Ltd have placed relatively large orders for 737 MAX 8 jets, said Um Kyung-a, a senior analyst at Shinyoung Securities. 
""It might turn into a big headache for them if Boeing fails to nail down the causes of the recent crashes,"" Um said. ""If that turned out to be the case, they need to come up with different plans to replace their 737 MAX 8 orders.""
Brazil's largest airline, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, has 100 Boeing 737 Max 8 jets on order. It currently operates seven such planes, which it decided to ground late on Monday. 
Gol operates Boeing 737 models exclusively and announced in December that it was accelerating its transition to the newer MAX 8 planes by leasing 11 more from the second half of this year. 
Flydubai, which has 13 737 MAX jets, said it was adjusting its schedule to minimize disruption to passengers, including switching flights to older 737s. Fiji Airways said it would use other 737s and Airbus SE A330s to cover for the grounding of two 737 MAXs.
Lion Air, which suffered a 737 MAX crash in October, has refused to take delivery of some of the jets but analysts say it is suffering from overcapacity and may benefit from a slowdown. 
It threatened in November to cancel Boeing orders in a row over the crash but has yet to do so, industry sources said. Airbus is another supplier and is seen in talks to sell more. 
Malaysian officials said on Monday they had asked national carrier Malaysia Airlines to revisit its order for 25 737 MAX jets.
""I feel there are other factors apart from safety, including finance and politics, for that move,"" said Shukor Yusof, the head of Malaysia-based aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics. 

""I doubt there will be outright cancellations for orders already placed by other carriers because there are still many unanswered questions.""

Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.5% after data showed the country’s machinery orders fell in January at the fastest pace in four months.
Meanwhile, South Korea’s KOSPI traded 0.8% lower. Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 lost 0.5%.
Fresh Brexit uncertainties were cited as headwinds for Asian stocks today after U.K. lawmakers rejected the terms of May’s Brexit deal to withdraw from the European Union (EU).
Parliament rejected the deal in a 391 to 242 vote."" A “no deal” scenario remains the default option, May said. However, the route forward is uncertain as the Prime Minister said there would be two more votes for the U.K. Parliament this week to decide whether the U.K. should leave the 28-member bloc with no deal or request a delay to its original departure date, due March 29.
“I continue to believe that by far the best outcome is that the U.K. leaves the EU in an orderly fashion with a deal, and that the deal we have negotiated is the best and indeed the only deal available,” she told lawmakers.
Meanwhile, Donald Tusk, a spokesman for the European Council President, said the EU “regrets the outcome” and that they would consider an extension to reach an agreement should there be a “reasoned request.”
The news came one day after May’s deputy David Lidington said that the Prime Minister has secured “legally binding changes” that “strengthen and improve” the nation’s divorce deal from the EU.

Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and also run large mail-order pharmacies. Drugmakers say they are under pressure to provide rebates to the handful of PBMs dominating the market to get their products included on preferred coverage lists. 
PBMs have come under increased scrutiny both by President Donald Trump's administration and lawmakers who say there needs to be more transparency about how drug prices get so high. The effect of rebates to PBMs are of particular concern.

The Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) said because the combined audiovisual content of the two in the field of ""factual"" programming on pay TV would be worth more than 40 percent of the market, steps would need to be taken.
That meant ensuring a separation of licensing and provision between Fox's National Geographic and Nat Geo Wild channels, and the A&E, History, H2 and Lifetime networks of Disney, the IFT said.
""As the accumulation (of market power) is considerable, the finding was that measures of conduct would not be enough, so structural measures were chosen, as occurred in other parts of the world,"" the IFT said in a statement.
As a result, the IFT said it had ordered the ""divestiture or sale"" of the Fox Sports channels and all the assets of that business as a condition to approve the deal.
Disney won a bidding war last year against cable company Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to acquire Fox's assets.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain needs to overhaul its competition rules to tackle the dominance of tech giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and increase consumer choice, a government review said on Wednesday.
A new competition unit with expertise in the sector should be set up, the independent review said, and innovation should be encouraged by giving people control over their own data so they could switch between rival services and platforms easily.
Smaller companies should also have access to the data that social media platforms hold on their users, it recommended.
Big tech has been criticized by politicians in the United States and in Europe in recent years over issues ranging from Facebook losing track of users' data to how Google ranks the results of searches.
France, Italy, Britain and Spain have also proposed new digital taxes to narrow loopholes that allow large multinational firms to cut tax bills.
Harvard professor Jason Furman, who chaired the British government review, said the digital sector had created substantial benefits but they had come at the cost of the increasing dominance of a few companies.
""My panel is outlining a balanced proposal to give people more control over their data, give small businesses more of a chance to enter and thrive, and create more predictability for the large digital companies,"" he said on Wednesday. 
""These recommendations will deliver an economic boost driven by UK tech start-ups and innovation that will give consumers greater choice and protection.""
UK finance minister Philip Hammond, who will deliver a half-yearly update on the budget later on Wednesday, said he would set out government measures to ensure digital markets are competitive later this year.
TechUK, which represents more than 900 tech companies that collectively employ 700,000 people, said the report contained some positive suggestions, but it needed further detail on what any proposed code of conduct for big tech might look like.
It also said there had to be a full assessment of the risks and benefits of opening up data sets.
""Bad regulation can be as big a barrier to competition and innovation as monopolistic activities,"" TechUK CEO Julian David said. 
""The UK must remain a welcoming place for digital business from around the world, and ensure that the UK competition and wider regulatory framework is not in conflict with the other leading digital economies with which we must compete.""

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is one of the only major regulators not to suspend 737 MAX flights after Britain and the European Union joined a wave of other suspensions on Tuesday in the aftermath of two disasters involving the same plane within months.

Andrea Call (@andi_call) tweeted to Southwest that she was traveling with her daughter in May. ""I don't want to be on a Boeing Max 8,"" she said. The airline responded that it was focused on safety, adding, ""Our fleet of Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft are operating as planned today and we plan to operate those aircraft going forward."" Southwest told Call to contact it 24 hours before her flight to find out what aircraft would be used.
Twitter user Sandy (@nycsandygirl) tweeted that she had called American Airlines to change her flight but was told waivers were unavailable for nonrefundable fares.
""It is well within my right to request a change in aircraft without a change fee when safety concerns have been raised about a particular aircraft. China, Indonesia, Ethiopian Airlines & Cayman Airways have all grounded these aircraft so obviously there is a concern,"" the Twitter user posted.
Unions that represent American Airlines' flight attendants and mechanics urged American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker to consider grounding the planes pending a thorough investigation. Flight attendants said their contract allows them not to work if they feel unsafe. 
A separate union representing United Airlines flight attendants also urged the FAA to ground the jets and conduct an investigation into the 737 MAX.
Pilot unions so far have not joined such requests.
A pilot union, United Master Executive Council, said it has analyzed thousands of safety data points in its 737 MAX 9 operation since May and did not find any performance or mechanical deficiencies. 
U.S. Senators Mitt Romney and Elizabeth Warren were the latest politicians to call for the FAA to act. Warren is running for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Senator Richard Blumenthal wrote letters to Parker and the chief executives of Southwest and United urging them to voluntarily ground their 737 MAX aircraft, which includes the MAX 9 as well as the MAX 8.
The FAA and Boeing have said the planes are safe to fly.
With 34 737 MAX 8 jets, Southwest is the largest operator of the aircraft, which it said produces thousands of data points during each flight that are constantly monitored.
""To date, we have operated more than 41,000 flights and have corresponding aircraft data that indicates the effectiveness of our operating standards, procedures, and training,"" spokeswoman Michelle Agnew said in a statement.
Southwest's pilot association said on Tuesday it supported the airline's decision to continue to fly the aircraft, as well as the FAA's findings to date.
WAITING FOR BLACK BOXES
American Airlines said Tuesday the company continues to ""believe the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft is safe and that our pilots are well-trained and well-equipped to operate it.""
The airline is waiting for findings from the black boxes from Ethiopian Airlines that ""will provide a better understanding of the cause of this recent accident."" The airline has said extensive flight data collected from its fleet gave it confidence in the safe operation of all its aircraft, including the 737 MAX 8.
American, with 24 MAX 8 planes, said it has been sharing its data with the FAA, in coordination with the Allied Pilots Association, a union that represents American's pilots. 
United Airlines, which does not fly the MAX 8 but operates another model in the series, the MAX 9, also reiterated its confidence in its pilots' ""ability to fly the aircraft safely.""

""(...) we continue to believe the planes will be found to be safe and the impact on Boeing's long term operations, backlog, book of business and order flow will prove to be limited,"" said Jim Corridore, an analyst at investment research firm CFRA who kept his ""strong buy"" opinion on Boeing.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 07:31PM ET</span>","U.S. lawmakers at T-Mobile, Sprint hearing spar over stay at Trump hotel","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers questioning the chief executives of T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp over their planned merger sparred with each other on Tuesday over T-Mobile's executives staying at President Donald Trump's hotel where they spent $195,000 while in Washington. 
T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere defended the $26 billion deal before a House subcommittee, saying the company would be better and faster at building 5G, the next generation of wireless, to compete with industry leaders AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and would create jobs while prices would not rise.
But Representative Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia, asked instead about Legere taking a group of executives to stay at the Trump International Hotel the day after the merger was announced last year. The hotel stay had been previously reported. 
Legere acknowledged staying at the hotel, telling the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee: ""I'm a longtime Trump hotel stayer."" 
""You see how that looks?"" Johnson pressed on. ""You understand the optics of that? What it looks like? It looks like what's happening is that T-Mobile is trying to curry favor with the White House."" 
Legere said that he was unaware of any contacts between the White House and the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission who were reviewing the deal.
Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat, agreed with Johnson's concerns. ""It appears that you were trying to influence the merger,"" she told Legere.
Republicans on the committee disagreed.
Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican, said that where the T-Mobile executives stayed was irrelevant. ""I'm kind of embarrassed sitting here listening to the line of questioning of the gentleman from Georgia,"" he said, referring to Johnson.
Representatives Matt Gaetz and Ken Buck, both Republicans, mocked the hotel issue. ""I had dinner at the Trump hotel three weeks ago,"" Buck said. ""I wonder if I have a conflict of interest?""
Legere said on Twitter on Sunday that on this trip to Washington he stayed at a different hotel.
MERGER CONCERNS 
Two key House Democrats expressed concern about the agreement to combine the No. 3 and No. 4 U.S. wireless carriers, which was struck in April.
Representative David Cicilline, chair of the antitrust panel, noted that both companies had competed hard against their bigger rivals. ""I am deeply skeptical that consolidation is the path forward to lowering prices, increasing opportunity, or unleashing competition,"" he added.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, chair of the full committee, said he was concerned about the companies' dominance of prepaid plans, usually used by people who are poorer or have bad credit.
""Because the proposed transaction would also consolidate the market for these services, it may have disproportionately negative effects on low-income households,"" he said.
To win support for the deal, T-Mobile previously said it would not increase prices for three years. Sprint said it hopes to complete the regulatory approval process by the end of June.

Last month at a congressional hearing, House Democrats raised worries about the deal because the U.S. wireless market has just four main carriers.

Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based Rite Aid said the layoffs will affect more than 20 percent of corporate positions located at the company's headquarters and across field operations.
The company expects annual savings of about $55 million from the restructuring, of which about $42 million will be realized within fiscal year 2020. 
It also expects to incur a one-time charge of about $38 million related to the restructuring.
John Standley, CEO since 2010, will remain in the post until the appointment of his successor, the company said.
It also said Chief Financial Officer Darren Karst and Chief Operating Officer Kermit Crawford would also leave the company.
The company named Chief Accounting Officer Matt Schroeder as the new CFO and Bryan Everett as the COO. Everett is currently the COO of Rite Aid Stores.
Almost the entire executive management team is moving on leaving the company in the hands of Rite Aid veterans who created the challenges and making it tough to recruit a new CEO, Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said in a note.
Rite Aid, which sold more than 1,900 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc in 2017, has reported losses in three out of last four quarters. 
The company and U.S. grocer Albertsons Companies Inc had terminated a $24 billion merger in August last year after Rite Aid's shareholders opposed the deal. 
""All-in given the elevated leverage levels and likely declining profit line we think the outlook here is pretty dire. We see no real scenario long term whereby (the company) plays a meaningful role in the (drug) Supply Chain,"" Muken said.

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 07:14PM ET</span>",Party on: Real estate booms in cradle of China's Communist revolution,"By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
YANAN, China (Reuters) - Staring at an array of floor plans in a showroom packed with models of apartment blocks set to go up in the northwestern city of Yanan, the young couple was faced with a tough decision.
Even as housing prices in places like Beijing and Shanghai have shown signs of cooling, they remain red hot in many small cities like Yanan, putting pressure on prospective buyers like Jia Luyu, 30, and her husband, to get in now – or be priced out of the market.
After a long deliberation on a recent afternoon, the couple decided to pour their life savings into a 1.1 million yuan ($163,653.95) three-bedroom apartment in a new district carved out of the loess hills that surround Yanan.
""Prices are rising too quickly here,"" said Jia, a police department clerk, as she signed the contract. It was important to lock in a place as the couple plans for their first child, she said. Jia's husband declined to give his name.
While the central government has tamped down property prices in bigger cities across China in an effort to control the longest real estate boom in over a decade, more fragile economies like Yanan have been left alone.
Worried by the effects of a slowing Chinese economy, which has been exacerbated by a bruising trade war with the United States, the government is allowing prices to rise quickly in Yanan and hundreds of other cities across the country.
Easy credit policies and official intervention in property markets are fuelling those price surges, raising fears that local governments may be creating the sorts of housing bubbles and debt burdens that Beijing has vowed to crack down on.
Real estate prices in more than 200 Chinese cities out of 336 tracked by the China Real Estate Association, mostly smaller provincial cities, have been growing at double digit rates in the past year, with Yanan's rising more than 15 percent year-on-year in December, according to a Reuters analysis of the data.
A dozen home buyers and agents in Yanan interviewed by Reuters said prices had almost doubled for some new projects in 2018.
The building boom has transformed Yanan in recent years from a small town famed as the epicenter of China's communist revolution in the 1930s into a bustling city of 2 million people.
But Yanan, located more than 800 kilometers from China's prosperous coastal regions, remains heavily reliant on crude oil production, which has been hit by faltering prices, and local authorities see property as a key to growth.
The city government has intervened in the market by freeing up credit and reducing housing stock by demolishing aging homes to spur sales of new units.
It has also invested heavily in developments like the Yanan New Zone, where Jia and her husband bought their flat, lured by the new schools and hospitals being constructed there. Her office was also moved to the zone from Yanan's old town, along with a slew of government agencies.
""It's ironic to think few had wanted to buy in this area not too long ago when prices were less than half of where they are now,"" she said.
Much of that soaring demand stems from Yanan's embrace of a national slum redevelopment program, mainly financed by policy banks such as the China Development Bank (CDB). That has led to the demolition over 90,000 homes in Yanan in the past two years.
Those whose homes were demolished were paid off, with cash compensations ranging from hundreds of thousands of yuan to the millions, according to interviews with half a dozen Yanan residents and government proposals made public online. 
Li Xing, a 32-year-old taxi driver, said his mud house behind a vegetable market will be demolished this year and that he plans to use the compensation for a down payment on a new apartment.
Yanan's housing stock has fallen to ""nearly nothing"", said an official at the housing bureau who asked to be identified only as Wang. The official said the city would stick with its current housing policies. 
China's leaders signaled in December that more policy easing at the city level would be tolerated this year as downside risks in the real estate market were increasing. Cities would be given responsibility for ""stabilizing"" their respective real estate markets based on local conditions, they said.
Still, Yanan authorities appear to be trying to keep the city's boom under the radar.
Yanan's housing bureau stopped publishing monthly home price data in September. That followed a report in the official People's Daily that the city's price growth was the most robust in Shaanxi province. The housing bureau declined to comment.
'UP TO THE GOVERNMENT'
As prices soar, developers have flocked to projects like the Yanan New Zone. Yango Group is constructing a residential project in the zone that is about the size of 70 football fields, with homes averaging 8,600 yuan per square meter.
Big-name developers such as Sunac and Future Land are also aggressively bidding for land in the zone, with hundreds of apartments planned.
Zhang Ning, who manages a 24-people sales team at Future Land in Yanan, said he was optimistic despite a slightly slower pace of sales since October. 
""I'm hoping we can sell out by the end of this year,"" Zhang said, adding that the developer had about 800 apartments planned. He said residential land prices in the Yanan New Zone have soared almost five fold since 2015.
Approving large numbers of new home sales has had a clear impact on the local economy, the authorities say. Real estate spurred Yanan's economic growth by 0.4 percentage points in 2017, with an ""obvious positive impact"" on other related industries, the local Statistics Bureau said.
Property investment doubled in 2018 from a year earlier. Land sales totaled 2.8 billion yuan from January to November, up more than 450 percent from a year earlier, Reuters calculated from data from the China Index Academy. 
""Whether the market will keep booming depends on whether the government is short of money or not,"" Zhang said. ""Take a look around, and just imagine how much debt the government has taken on in building this new zone.""
""And I think they will definitely seek to maintain the stability in the real estate market if there are signs of a sharp cooling,"" he added. 
The local government did not respond to a request for comment.
RISKS IN THE SYSTEM
Sheng Songcheng, a People's Bank of China adviser, told a forum in January he was concerned about the risks in smaller cities. China's housing bubble is bigger than Japan's when it burst in the 1990s, judging by the income-to-price ratio, he said.
""There are indeed some overshooting risks,"" said Wang Yifeng, director of the Financial Center of Minsheng Bank's Research Institute in Beijing.
An official close to the People's Bank of China told Reuters the central bank would keep property risks in check, although he conceded that local governments would always find ways to let buyers bypass curbs and keep supporting high prices.
However, Liu Yong, CDB's chief economist, dismissed concerns about a property slowdown dampening local economic growth, saying that the policy bank's branches were monitoring conditions to evaluate projects and adjust policy accordingly.
""It won't be a one-size-fits-all approach,"" he told Reuters.
Even with the risks, many in Yanan feel the city's role in Communist Party lore – President Xi Jinping also spent nearly a decade of his youth working in a village in the region – will insulate it from any downturn.
Yang Quan, who manages two apartments on Airbnb in Yanan, said he planned to buy a new home in the city this year.
""As long as President Xi Jinping is in power, Yanan's property prices will keep rising,"" he said.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 06:52PM ET</span>",Bayer Roundup cancer trial goes to jury after closing arguments,"By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A trial in which a California man alleged his use of Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's glyphosate-based Roundup weed killer caused his cancer went to a federal U.S. jury after lawyers for both sides delivered their closing arguments on Tuesday.
The closely-watched case brought by plaintiff Edward Hardeman is only the second of some 11,200 Roundup lawsuits to go to trial in the United States. Another California man was awarded $289 million in August after a state court jury in August found Roundup caused his cancer, sending Bayer shares plunging. 
Hardeman's case has proceeded differently from the earlier trial, with an initial phase exclusively focused on scientific facts while omitting evidence of alleged corporate misconduct by company representatives. 
Following the first phase, the six jurors in San Francisco federal court were asked by U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria to decide whether Roundup was a ""substantial factor"" in causing Hardeman's cancer.
If the jury finds Roundup to have caused Hardeman's cancer, the trial will proceed into a second stage, where his lawyers can present evidence allegedly showing the company's efforts to influence scientists, regulators and the public about the safety of its products.
Hardeman's lawyer, Aimee Wagstaff, during her closing arguments on Tuesday said Hardeman had ""extreme"" exposure to Roundup, spraying the chemical more than 300 times over 26 years.
""The dose makes the poison. The more you use, the higher the risk,"" Wagstaff said. She urged jurors to consider all studies, including of rodents and cells, which she said showed an elevated cancer risk.
Bayer, which acquired  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion, denies allegations that Roundup, or glyphosate, cause cancer. It says decades of studies and regulatory evaluations, primarily of real-world human exposure data, have shown the weed killer to be safe for human use regardless of exposure levels.
Wagstaff criticized the epidemiological studies as flawed.
Brian Stekloff, a lawyer for Bayer, in his closing statement said the cause of Hardeman's cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma generally, was not known. 
""No one can tell you the cause,"" Stekloff said, adding that Hardeman had some risk factors, such as old age and a history of hepatitis.
Chhabria decided in January to split Hardeman's case into two phases. He called evidence of alleged corporate misconduct ""a distraction"" from the scientific question of whether glyphosate causes cancer. 
Hardeman's trial is a test case for some 760 cases nationwide consolidated before Chhabria in federal court.
Evidence of corporate misconduct was seen as playing a key role in the earlier state court case. The verdict in that case was later reduced to $78 million and is on appeal. 

Plaintiff lawyers called Chhabria's decision to exclude similar evidence from the first phase of Hardeman's case ""unfair,"" saying their scientific evidence was inextricably linked to Monsanto's alleged attempts to manipulate, misrepresent and intimidate scientists.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 06:19PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo CEO avoids major stumble at heated congressional hearing,"By Imani Moise and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic and Republican lawmakers on Tuesday pressed  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co Chief Executive Tim Sloan for proof the bank has put a string of consumer abuse scandals behind it at a tense congressional hearing that saw Sloan firmly on the defensive.
While Sloan struggled to convince skeptical lawmakers that Wells Fargo has transformed its culture, he managed to navigate a hostile committee without a major stumble that would have compounded doubts about his leadership. 
One of the harshest blows was dealt after the hearing by a key regulator, which said in a statement it was ""disappointed"" Wells Fargo had not made more progress fixing its corporate governance and risk management.
Sloan was the first bank executive to be grilled by the House Financial Services Committee since it was taken over by Democrats following the 2018 congressional election. A nervous Wall Street has been keen to see how the panel will treat the industry. 
The CEOs of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are expected to appear before the panel next month.
The committee, led by bank critic Maxine Waters, has several freshmen Democrats who took swipes at Sloan including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a leading voice of her party's progressive wing, and Ayanna Pressley, who likewise bashed corporate America during her campaign. 
But those queries on Wells Fargo's financing of private prisons and oil pipelines, businesses the bank has previously said it would pull back from, failed to land a major blow. 
Democrats and Republicans took a broadly tough line, quizzing Sloan on the bank's remediation efforts, personnel changes, risk management, culture and whether it should be broken up. 
Opening the packed hearing, Waters recounted Wells Fargo's missteps, saying the bank had failed to prove it had abandoned harmful policies. 
""Wells Fargo's ongoing lawlessness and the failure to right the ship, suggests the bank … is simply too big to manage,"" she added, saying later in the hearing that Sloan should step down.
The committee's ranking Republican Patrick McHenry made it clear that his party would not go soft on the country's fourth-largest bank.
""You will hear bipartisan criticism of the actions you have taken and the failures that you have overseen under your watch,"" he said.
Still, some Republicans later in the hearing acknowledged the bank's efforts to change, with Representative Sean Duffy saying his colleagues had been too harsh on Sloan. 
BETTER BANK?
The stakes had been high heading into the hearing for Sloan, a 31-year Wells Fargo veteran who was appointed CEO when John Stumpf retired soon after the sales practices scandal erupted in 2016. 
The CEO has faced calls to step down from investors and politicians, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 Democratic presidential contender.
Sloan's prepared remarks emphasized changes the bank has made to culture, sales practices and risk management, as well as efforts to repay wronged customers. 
""Wells Fargo is a better bank than it was three years ago, and we are working every day to become even better,"" Sloan, 58, read from his written testimony.
At times Sloan expressed remorse over the bank's scandals, noting he felt ""terrible"" that some servicemen and women had been harmed.
Sloan remained calm under pressure and rebuffed Waters' claims that Wells Fargo should be broken up. He also said the bank had paid back all customers hit by improper mortgage rate-lock fees and gave a similar answer about auto insurance remediation. 
But the CEO struggled to make the case that Wells Fargo is now a good corporate citizen amid repeated interruptions and aggressive, sometimes hectoring questioning from representatives including Democrats Brad Sherman and Stephen Lynch.
Sloan also appeared to frustrate some lawmakers by declining to disclose confidential information on the progress of some remediation efforts, and by failing to say categorically that Wells Fargo would never suffer another scandal. 
If lawmakers are unhappy with what they heard, they could pressure the Federal Reserve to maintain restrictions imposed on the bank's growth until governance and risk management improve. 
Waters in her testimony said the Fed's punishment had not changed the bank, adding that ""regulators seem unwilling to take forceful actions."" 
After the hearing, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which last year fined Wells Fargo $1 billion for faulty mortgage and insurance products, echoed comments made by its head in October that the bank still had much work to do to. 
""We continue to be disappointed with Wells Fargo Bank N.A.’s performance ... and its inability to execute effective corporate governance and a successful risk management program,"" said OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard.

The 2016 revelation that Wells Fargo created millions of fake customer accounts prompted regulatory probes into mortgage foreclosures, auto insurance sales and its wealth management businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines.

1252,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 05:58PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. PPI, Core PPI Expected to Rise 0.2%
Following today’s cooler-than-expected retail inflation numbers, the market will get the latest wholesale inflation figures before the bell tomorrow.
The Labor Department will issue the February producer price index (PPI) at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
On average economists expect that the PPI rose 0.2% last month with the core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also rising 0.2%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That would bring year-over-year PPI growth to 1.9% and core PPI growth up 2.6%.
The PPI is considered a leading indicator, measuring the input prices for goods sold at a retail level.
With tame inflation the Federal Reserve has lots of leeway to remain at its current stance of being patient and keeping interest rates steady.
Fed fund futures reflect no expectations for a rate hike this year and indicate a more-than-10% probability that the next move will, in fact, be a cut.
2. Core Durable Goods Orders Seen Climbing
Durable goods numbers for January also arrive at 8:30 AM ET.
The Commerce Department is expected to report the orders for goods lasting three or more year fell 0.5% in January. Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are forecast to have risen 0.1%.
Orders for non-defense goods excluding aircraft are also expected to post a 0.1% rise.
At 10:00 AM ET, there January data for construction spending will arrive. Economists, on average, are predicting a 0.4% rise.
3. Crude Inventories on Tap
A fresh batch of petroleum data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show a rise in U.S. crude stockpiles for the week ended March. 8.
Analysts forecast that crude inventories rose by about 2.7 million barrels last week.
Crude production will be also be in the spotlight after the EIA reported output remained at a record 12.1 million barrels a day in its previous report.
The data comes as the American Petroleum Institute reported Tuesday weekly crude stockpiles fell by 2.6 million barrels last week, compared with a build of 7.30 million barrels in the prior week.
Crude oil futures rose 0.1% to settle at $56.87 as a slump in Venezuela crude exports amid a power outage and Saudi Arabia's pledge to keep oil supply tight continued to support sentiment."

Its gross profit margins are still right around 62%, where they've been for years. Its quarterly dividend, first instituted at 6 cents in 2011, has just been boosted to 35 cents a share.
It has $40 billion in cash and short-term investments available to deploy. In fiscal 2018, it bought back some $17 billion in shares. In the last quarter it bought back $5 billion more and boosted its buyback authorization to $24 billion.
Meanwhile, China's Huawei, one of Cisco's biggest competitors in networking, is accused of being an arm of the Chinese government in alleged efforts to spy on U.S. companies and the government. The Trump administration doesn't want domestic customers to buy Huawei products and even threatened to withhold classified intelligence from Germany unless it halted plans to buy Huawei equipment for its 5G network.
What could go wrong for Cisco?
Right now, not much. In fact, the government shutdown had little impact on Cisco's business, CEO Chuck Robbins said on the Feb. 13 earnings call. Most analysts have price targets on the stock in the mid-$50s. Based on earnings growth and a price-to-earnings ratio above 18x, a case could be made for the stock to reach $60.
Technical measures tracked by Investing.com rate the stock a buy.
One short-term issue is geopolitics, especially the ongoing trade disputes with China. Cisco has a small presence in China and would like to expand it.
A second issue is irrational exuberance.
The shares have doubled since the end of 2014 with gains accelerating since mid-2017. Part of the gains are due to Cisco's results and an improving economy. Some of the gains are because of the 2017 tax law.
And don't forget all the share buybacks, which have cut the number of shares outstanding by 11% since mid-2015.
That's a far cry from the 1990s when Cisco split its stock eight times."
1256,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>",Treasury Yields Veer Toward 2019 Lows,"(Bloomberg) -- A trifecta of events drove a Treasuries rally Tuesday, pushing the 10-year yield below the range it’s held for almost all of 2019.
Treasuries were influenced by more setbacks for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit strategy and a weaker-than-anticipated U.S. consumer price index. A strong auction of 10-year notes at a yield of 2.615 percent, below what had been the session’s low point, also spurred the market.
“All three have very strong signaling for rates,” said BMO rates strategist Jon Hill.
The benchmark rate slid as much as 5 basis points to 2.59 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 4, before recovering slightly to around 2.60 percent as of 4:13 p.m. in New York. Since the first week of January, the yield had ranged between 2.61 percent and 2.80 percent. The year-to-date low of 2.54 percent is the next key threshold, according to BMO’s Hill.
The moves came as inflation data once again disappointed in the U.S., with year-on-year consumer price gains running at just 1.5 percent, according to the latest official reading released Tuesday.
The 10-year yield dipped in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. morning release and extended its decline through the day as pressures mounted from the auction at 1 p.m. New York time. The British parliament’s rejection of May’s latest Brexit deal added to the downward pressure. Meanwhile, the gap between 2-year and 10-year yields narrowed to a level unseen since Feb. 21, while U.S. rate volatility has continued to crater.

1260,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 04:02PM ET</span>","U.S. working on steel, aluminum tariff relief for Mexico, Canada: trade chief","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is working on a plan to lift tariffs from Mexican and Canadian steel and aluminum but preserve the gains that domestic producers have received from the duties so far, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Tuesday. 
""What I'm trying to do is a have a practical solution to a real problem ... get rid of tariffs on these two, let them maintain their historic access to the U.S. market which I think will allow us to still maintain the benefit of the steel and aluminum program,"" he told the U.S. Senate Finance Committee at a hearing about the World Trade Organization.
The United States imposed the ""Section 232"" tariffs on steel and aluminum nearly a year ago to protect domestic producers on national security grounds. A plan to lift tariffs on the metals from Canada and Mexico was once linked to the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement but ultimately was excluded from that deal.
Since then, a number of U.S. lawmakers have said they did not believe the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) could win approval in Congress if the metals tariffs -- along with and retaliatory duties on U.S. farm and other products -- were left in place.
Members of the New Democrat Coalition in the House of Representatives echoed a similar message in a meeting with Lighthizer later on Tuesday.
""Some of us impressed the need to resolve 232 before we have a chance to move forward"" on consideration of USMCA, said Representative Ron Kind, a pro-trade Democrat from Wisconsin.
Kind added that Lighthizer expected to meet with Mexican and Canadian counterparts on the issue this week.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office declined to comment, saying there were no scheduling announcements on the 232 issue.
The United States has sought quotas on steel and aluminum in lieu of tariffs, but Canada and Mexico have resisted such restrictions, arguing that they pose no threat to U.S. national security.
A Mexican official said talks were continuing.
""Our position is that we should not have tariffs or quotas. We have to help the U.S. construct the narrative of why exclusion for Mexico is valid,"" added the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and requested anonymity. 
Kind cautioned that the Trump administration would need to submit the USMCA enabling legislation soon to Congress so it could be considered before the August recess. After that, it could become caught up in another border wall funding fight in the fall and later the 2020 presidential election campaign, which would diminish its approval chances. 

""There's a lot of work and the clock's ticking,"" Kind added.

1261,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 03:50PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo CEO Draws Bipartisan Rebuke at Tough House Hearing,"(Bloomberg) -- More than two years after  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. erupted into scandals, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan returned to Capitol Hill to lay out his efforts to clean up the mess. The bank has apparently made little progress in winning over lawmakers.
Democrats and Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee took turns grilling Sloan for more than four hours Tuesday, with several expressing doubts that the three-decade insider should be running the firm. Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters was joined by some colleagues in her call to go further, raising the specter of a breakup by describing the bank as “too big to manage.”
“You have not been able to keep Wells Fargo out of trouble,” said Waters, a Democrat from the company’s home state of California. “Why should Wells Fargo continue to be the size that it is?”
The confrontation with lawmakers underscored how far Wells Fargo has yet to go to win back the public 30 months after it was fined for opening millions of bogus accounts for consumers. The bank has been working to address widespread abuses that have made it a target for both major parties and President Donald Trump, dragging on its stock and prompting the Federal Reserve to impose an unprecedented ban on growth.
Regulator ‘Disappointed’
During the hearing, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a statement, saying it continues to be “disappointed” with the bank and “its inability to execute effective corporate governance and a successful risk management program.”
Meanwhile, lawmakers suggested regulators and other authorities should be harder on the firm, potentially forcing out more executives or bringing criminal charges. They demanded the company do more to make customers whole and advocated stiffer rules for the entire industry. Brad Sherman, another California Democrat, yelled at Sloan to end forced arbitration and support overdraft-protection legislation.
Tensions also flared as Democrats including Carolyn Maloney of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts demanded Wells Fargo stop providing financial services to the National Rifle Association and firearms companies.
“Why does Wells Fargo continue to put companies over people?” Maloney asked, saying the gun industry is “literally killing” children.
“We don’t put profits over people,” Sloan responded. He said it isn’t up to banks to enforce legislation that doesn’t exist.
Criticism of Wells Fargo came from so many that Kentucky Republican Andy Barr opened his questions by expressing surprise: “I’m shocked that you’re not in an orange suit and little jail cell today.” That drew gasps in the room before he went on to argue against dissolving the bank, instead giving executives a chance to fix problems.
“The issue within the institution was not a matter of size, it was a matter of culture,” Barr said.
Sloan, who took the helm weeks after first scandal emerged in September 2016, remained calm as he fielded questions. He argued the San Francisco-based lender isn’t too big to manage and categorically denied assertions in a New York Times article over the weekend. That report cited Wells Fargo employees who said its culture hasn’t changed and that misaligned sales incentives still exist. The assertions “are just wrong,” Sloan said.
“It’s my job as CEO to make sure things change and they are changing,” Sloan said. He said repeatedly that, although he can’t promise perfection, he’s the right person to lead the company and that it’s getting better.
The board has credited him for rooting out and fixing past problems, addressing regulators’ concerns, tightening internal oversight and taking other steps to improve earnings.
More Hearings
Sloan is the first head of a major U.S. bank to appear before the House committee since Democrats assumed control of the chamber in January. They’re planning a series of sessions this year to examine big banks and may call in other CEOs in coming months.
Wells Fargo’s scandals have been wide-ranging and costly. Following the revelation that employees opened millions of accounts without customers’ permission to meet sales goals, issues have emerged in consumer-lending, wholesale and wealth-management units. The company forced unnecessary insurance policies on auto-lending customers, charged borrowers improper fees to lock in mortgage rates and foreclosed on struggling home buyers who could have had debts modified.
Last year, the bank paid $1 billion to federal regulators to settle allegations it mistreated consumers. In December, it settled with 50 states and the District of Columbia for $575 million. The abuses led the Fed to bar the bank from growing total assets beyond their level at the end of 2017 until lapses are fully addressed.
Unknown Damage
Waters ended the session with a promise to reintroduce legislation aimed at holding big banks accountable, which would, among other things, give regulators the authority to break up lenders that abuse consumers.
Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the committee, acknowledged that Sloan has made some progress, but expressed concern that Fed and the OCC still don’t seem comfortable with measures taken so far.
“We don’t know with certainty how many consumers were affected,” McHenry said. Nor do we know “the full extent of the damage.”

The two London flights were from Halifax, Nova Scotia and from St. John’s, Newfoundland, a spokesman for the Montreal-based airline said in an email. Air Canada said it remains confident in the fleet’s safety.
The cancellations show the crisis over the 737 Max is deepening, with some carriers and aviation authorities around the world suspending flights of the new jet after two crashes in less then five months.
WestJet and Air Canada shares fell Tuesday as Canada’s government said it’s considering all options on the operation of the 737 Max planes. WestJet fell 1.9 percent to C$20.19 at 1:54 p.m. in Toronto. Air Canada dropped 2.7 percent to C$32.46.
Transport Minister Marc Garneau said the government is considering options on Boeing ahead of a meeting with the country’s aviation panel.
“I’ve canceled all my meetings and public events today in order to meet with my Civil Aviation Expert Panel,” Garneau tweeted. “All evidence is being evaluated in real time and we’re considering all potential actions.”

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 02:31PM ET</span>",OECD seeing less corporate opposition to digital era tax revamp,"PARIS (Reuters) - A global effort to revamp international tax rules for the digital era is receiving less corporate push-back than past attempts, the OECD's head of tax policy said on Tuesday.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is sounding out businesses and interest groups on Wednesday and Thursday at a public consultation before it begins drafting much-anticipated reform proposals.
Corporate interests have in the past leaned hard against efforts to update international tax rules, which currently allow digital firms to keep tax bills lower than other more traditional companies.
However, OECD head of tax policy Pascal Saint-Amans said there was a change of tone judging from more than 200 comments the Paris-based policy forum received in a first call for input from businesses, accounting firms, tax justice NGOs and academics. 
""We have a significant group of business people saying it's probably time to do something,"" Saint-Amans told Reuters ahead of the start of the public hearing.
The emergence of internet giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has pushed international tax rules to the limit because they are able to book profits in low-tax countries rather than where they customer is located.
Global reform of the rules had been debated for years with little progress until January when nearly 130 countries and territories agreed to tackle some of the most vexing issues, like when a country has the right to tax international transactions.
The OECD reform proposals will tackle on the one hand how to determine when a country should get the right to tax companies and on the other a minimum level of corporate taxation.
In the absence of reform, a growing number of countries are planning their own national taxes targeting mostly U.S.-based digital companies.
While opposed to unilateral national taxes, Washington is a relatively recent convert in favor of a wide-ranging international overhaul, although it wants a solution with a broader focus than just digital companies.
""Bargain will have to be made and ... the more extreme proposals will not attract consensus,"" the U.S. Treasury's top international tax official, Chip Harter, told journalists in Paris ahead of the hearing.

He added that the aim was to have the broad outlines of an agreement from the OECD in June, so that G20 finance ministers could give a mandate to thrash out the numerous technical details before a formal deal is signed in 2020.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc has agreed to pay $20 million to settle a lawsuit brought by drivers nearly six years ago, according to court filings, resolving one of its many legal battles with drivers ahead of a hotly anticipated initial public offering this year. 
Drivers for the ride-hailing company argued in the lawsuit that they are employees, not independent contractors, as Uber has classified them, and therefore entitled to certain wage protections and reimbursement for their expenses. 
The settlement amount is one-fifth of the settlement offer Uber proposed in 2016 to resolve the case, valued at up to $100 million, which U.S. District Judge Edward Chen at the time rejected as inadequate. 
The new settlement, which still must be approved by Chen, was filed in federal court in San Francisco late on Monday night.
The lawsuit is central to a widely held debate over so-called gig-economy workers, the workforce relied on by technology platforms such as food-delivery and ride-hailing services. Gig-economy workers have often argued they should receive better pay and benefits, and be treated as employees. 
A California Supreme Court ruling last year made it much more difficult for companies like Uber to argue that their drivers are independent contractors, a decision that poses a threat to Uber's business model.
In a statement, a company spokesman said ""Uber has changed a lot since 2013,"" and highlighted new programs and technology improvements to help drivers.
""We're pleased to reach a settlement on this matter and we'll continue working hard to improve the quality, security and dignity of independent work,"" the spokesman said.
The settlement covers drivers in California and Massachusetts who drove for Uber from August 2009 through February of this year, according to the filing. The class is much smaller than in 2016 when the initial settlement offer was made -- about 13,600 drivers between the two states compared to roughly 385,000 drivers covered by the original class-action lawsuit. 
Following Chen's rejection of the $100 million settlement offer, Uber won an appeals court ruling that upheld the company's arbitration agreements as largely valid and enforceable. That forced most drivers into arbitration, and reduced the class size to those drivers who had opted out of the agreements or otherwise were not bound by them.
According to the court filing, drivers will individually walk away with more money under the proposed settlement offer than they would have under the 2016 settlement offer. Chen had called the offer of up to $100 million for the larger class neither fair nor adequate; some drivers would have made as little as $12.
THOUSANDS OF ARBITRATION CLAIMS 
Uber in December filed confidentially for an initial public offering, and is seeking a valuation of up to $120 billion when it lists shares later this year. It is trying to resolve a long list of lawsuits, disputes, investigations and other legal risks before starting the process of trying to woo prospective investors. 
However, Uber still faces thousands of arbitration claims from drivers who are not covered by this settlement. Uber has been accused of refusing to pay the legal fees required to initiate settlement of those claims, and attorneys for one group of drivers have asked a judge to compel Uber to pay those fees.
In an effort to resolve the disputes more quickly, the company in January offered some drivers with arbitration claims a settlement of 11 cents for each mile they drove for the ride-hailing app, which could result in a payout of a few thousand dollars for individual drivers. 

But this is a fraction of what other drivers have been reimbursed in earlier claims. One driver was reimbursed at 64 cents per mile in early 2018, according to settlement documents shared with Reuters.

Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.07 per share, down from $1.22 a year earlier, on revenue of $2.49 billion, down from $2.66 billion a year earlier.
That beat estimates from Investing.com for earnings of $1.06 a share on revenue of $2.48 billion, but shares fell 10% as the retailer delivered a dour outlook for 2019 same-store sales growth.
Dick's guided 2019 earnings per share in the range of $3.15 to $3.35 and same-store sales flat to up 2%.
Analysts also highlighted narrower gross margins as a pain point for the stock, but said margin growth would improve. Dick's said it would remove the hunt category from an additional 125 stores in 2019 after removing it from 10 stores late in the third quarter of last year.
""Gross margin narrowed 120 basis points to 27.9%, missing consensus,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider. ""That said, we see headwinds from phasing to meaningfully abate and be a long-term positive for margins in FY 21.""
""The decision, in our view, gives DKS the opportunity to optimize assortment and floor space to higher-margin categories, such as private labels,"" CFRA said."
1274,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",Lopez Obrador rebuts finance ministry over $2.5 billion Mexico refinery funding,"By Anthony Esposito
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday denied any delay to a flagship refinery project in his home state after the deputy finance minister was quoted as saying $2.5 billion for its construction will be moved to state oil firm Pemex.
The planned investment for the Dos Bocas refinery ""can go to exploration and production"" for Pemex, Arturo Herrera told the Financial Times in an interview during a trip to London for meetings with investors.
However, Lopez Obrador stood by his plan to build the refinery within three years, saying the tender could be unveiled next week. In answer to a question about whether the $2.5 billion would be spent this year on the refinery, said ""Yes.""
The president's plans to fast-track construction of the new refinery in Tabasco, his home state, have concerned investors that it would take away much-needed resources from Pemex, which is creaking under $106 billion of debt.
His energy minister, Rocio Nahle, said she understood Herrera's budget concerns but said the project was on track. 
""The faster we do this project, the cheaper it will be,"" she said on Mexican radio. 
The conflicting statements appeared to confuse investors. Mexico's benchmark stock index reversed gains and weakened 0.7 percent after Lopez Obrador's rebuttal of Herrera's comments, while the peso pared gains.
""Contradictions within the federal government do not help financial markets,"" said James Salazar, an economist at bank CI Banco.
The government is under growing pressure to dispel doubts Pemex can successfully manage more than $16 billion of debt payments due by the end of next year, halt the firm's extended oil output slide and avert a threatened credit rating downgrade to ""junk.""
Finance minister Carlos Urzua said last week the government would announce new measures to support the ailing company, after unveiling a $3.9 billion bailout in February that failed to impress ratings agencies.
Herrera said the government was in talks with the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral organizations about structuring a fresh capital injection for Pemex, though he noted that those discussions were technical and no borrowing was involved, according to the Financial Times.
Lopez Obrador said it was very likely the government would make an announcement about tenders for the refinery on March 18, a national holiday that celebrates the 1938 nationalization of Mexico's oil industry. 
He also predicted Pemex would reverse its output decline by next year, with ""new wells"" coming on line by December under a production plan that allows Pemex to hire service companies to help explore mature fields. 
He repeated that the refinery would cost between $6 billion and $8 billion, and said that work for now was focused on preparing the ground at the refinery site and readying the framework for the tender. 
The refinery has already hit obstacles after the proposed construction site was cleared of protected mangrove without the correct environmental permits. The government has yet to present an environmental impact assessment for the wildlife-rich site.
Herrera said the tender framework was being prepared, but said the finance ministry needed to see a solid financial plan before releasing funds.
""We will not authorize (construction) until we have a final figure that is not very different from the original $8 billion,"" said Herrera.

The settlements announced by the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday came four years after Lumber Liquidators was alleged to be selling products with illegally high levels of formaldehyde, a known carcinogen.
The Justice Department settlement includes a deferred prosecution agreement, under which the government agreed not to prosecute Lumber Liquidators for securities fraud so long as the company upgrades oversight and cooperates with its ongoing probe for three years.
The hardwood flooring retailer knew that products made by its largest Chinese supplier had failed third-party formaldehyde emissions testing, but the company had misled investors, regulators said.
""The relief obtained today, along with the criminal fine imposed by the Department of Justice, ensures that the company will forfeit all profit and pay a heavy price for the false assurances it provided to the market,"" Marc Berger, Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office, said.
The amount the company will pay represents Lumber Liquidator's net profits from the sale of 100 percent of its Chinese laminate from January through May 2015, U.S Attorney's office said.
As part of the settlement, the company has also agreed to implement rigorous internal controls and cooperate fully with the Department of Justice's ongoing investigation, including its investigation of individuals, the attorney's office added.
Lumber Liquidators Chief Executive Officer Dennis Knowles said in a statement the company was ""pleased"" with the settlement.

Shares in Lumber Liquidators fell 2.5 percent after the news. The stock has lost nearly 80 percent of its value since a CBS ""60 Minutes"" report questioning the safety of Lumber Liquidators' products aired in March 2015.

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 01:17PM ET</span>",Shell urges Trump White House to tighten methane leak rules,"By Ron Bousso
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) urged U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday to tighten restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas production, instead of weakening them as planned.
Breaking from a decades-old tradition of avoiding criticism of U.S. government policies, Shell's U.S. Country Chair Gretchen Watkins called on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to tighten rules to plug methane leaks, a potent greenhouse gas.
""It is a big part of the climate problem and frankly we can do more,"" Watkins said in an interview with Reuters at IHS Markit's CERAWeek conference in Houston. 
""We don't usually tell governments how to do their job but we're ready to break with that and say, 'Actually, we want to tell you how to do your job.'""
She urged the EPA ""to put in a regulatory framework that will both regulate existing methane emissions by also future methane emissions.""
The Trump administration in September proposed weakening requirements for repairing leaks of the greenhouse gas in drilling operations in a step to roll back an Obama-era policy intended to combat climate change.
Methane, the primary component of natural gas, leaks from oil and gas wells during drilling. It accounts for 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions but has more than 80 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere. 
Shell has internally set targets to maintain its methane emissions by 2025 to below 0.2 percent of production, far exceeding current EPA regulations.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission set out a 10-point plan on Tuesday for more balanced economic relations with China, urging EU leaders to back its ideas to curb Chinese state-owned enterprises and increase their guard against cybersecurity threats.
The action plan marks a shift in the bloc's stance toward its top trading partner and will be put to EU leaders to discuss at their next regular summit meeting in Brussels on March 21-22 -- before an EU-China summit on April 9.
The Commission, the EU's executive, said the European Union should cooperate more with China in areas such as climate change and peace, but should also push for a more reciprocal economic relationship and take steps to protect its industry.
The European Union shares many of the United States' concerns over Chinese market distortions, overcapacity and technology transfer. But it has avoided taking sides in a multi-billion dollar trade war between Washington and Beijing.
Europe has also been increasingly frustrated by what it sees as the slowness of China's opening of its economy, a surge of Chinese takeovers in critical EU sectors and U.S. pressure to shun China, and notably telecoms equipment maker Huawei [HWT.UL], over espionage concerns.
Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen told a news conference that Chinese state financing and state-owned enterprises distorted EU markets. For example, EU rules limited subsidies EU governments could give to European companies, but did not apply to foreign companies, he said.
A German EU diplomat described the paper as a ""comprehensive and courageous"" stocktaking of relations with Beijing, highlighting a lack of reciprocity and growing protectionism and also broaching difficult issues, such as human rights.
If backed by EU leaders, the European Union would urge China to agree to reforms of World Trade Organization rules, notably regarding subsidies and forced technology transfer, and conclude a deal with the EU on investment rules by 2020.
The Commission urged EU nations to revive a stalled proposal known as the International Procurement Instrument that would require foreign countries to open up their public tenders in return for access to Europe.
The EU executive believes Chinese bidders for EU public contracts should meet high labor and environmental standards and wants to adapt EU law to limit the state-owned enterprises and state subsidies in the EU market.
It also believes EU countries should find a common line on the security of planned high-speed 5G telecoms networks.
China is the EU's biggest source of imports and its second-biggest export market after the United States, with trade between the two worth more than $1 billion per day. China's trade surplus in goods with the European Union was 177.7 billion euros ($200.4 billion) in 2017.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 12:17PM ET</span>","Ford chairman praises CEO, mulls lithium venture","By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford said on Tuesday that he is very confident in Chief Executive James Hackett's leadership and that the automaker is considering striking supply deals with a lithium producer.
Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, is in the midst of a restructuring of global operations and is spending $11 billion to bring 40 electrified vehicles to the market by 2022, part a move by the company to take part in the electrification trend sweeping the automotive industry.
Michigan-based Ford has also announced a commercial vehicle alliance with Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, with plans to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles. 
Still, attempts to ramp up electric vehicle production have been uneven. Ford's 2018 profit disappointed many investors and analysts, sparking questions about Hackett's tenure. 
Hackett, a former executive with furniture maker Steelcase Inc , has been in his role for nearly two years and replaced Mark Fields, who was in his job for less than three years.
Bill Ford, whose family founded and controls the eponymous automaker, said he fully supports Hackett's plans to expand the electric fleet, including development of an electric F-150 truck, the best-selling American vehicle for decades.
""I think the ability to hold the now, the near and the far all together at one time is something you don't always see in executives. And Jim (Hackett) has that,"" Ford told Reuters on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston.
""We're changing a lot. And change is difficult.""
As the company seeks electrification growth, it is considering forging supply deals with lithium producers, Ford said. Lithium is a key ingredient to make lithium-ion batteries, which power electric vehicles. 
Ford rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has a lithium supply deal with Australia's Kidman Resources Ltd .
""We are looking at the entire supply chain and where we want to play,"" Ford said, without mentioning a specific company. Albemarle Corp and SQM are the world's largest lithium producers. 
Ford also said he was unaware of any conversations between Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo self-driving vehicle unit and Volkswagen.
""I know nothing about any discussions with Waymo and VW,"" Ford said. ""But our plans don't change at all. We have very clear ideas of where we want to go"" with the VW partnership. 

Media reports in recent weeks suggested Waymo was eyeing a deal with Volkswagen, which could have imperiled Ford's partnership with the German automaker. Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess denied those reports earlier on Tuesday.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 12:15PM ET</span>","Saudi seals six private sector deals worth $3.5 billion, plans many more","By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has completed six public-private partnership deals in the past two months worth around $3.5 billion, and plans at least 23 more by 2022 despite some delays in its plan to engage the private sector, the head of its privatization body said. 
The government's aim to attract investment into everything from education to sports, a cornerstone of its effort to trim dependence on oil revenues, has been mired by some holdups and fallout from the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
""It's better for the process to take a little bit longer to ensure it is done properly,"" said Turki al-Hokail, CEO of the National Centre for Privatisation and Public-Private Partnership (NCP), which is overseeing the process, told Reuters after a visit to London to meet prospective investors. 
""We are gearing up for a lot of transactions either in the process or in the pipeline and we want to make sure the process is done correctly,"" he said. ""The privatization program has so far awarded six projects in two months and is committed to its timetable and initiatives as per the delivery plan.""
The six projects just completed include four water projects, one in healthcare and one in transport. Under such public-private partnership arrangements, private investors build infrastructure and are paid to operate it for a period before it reverts to the state.
Twenty-three more such deals are planned for the water sector by 2022, among more than 40 public-private partnership deals and privatizations that are in the pipeline.
Khashoggi's killing by Saudi agents in October tested Riyadh's relations with Western allies.
Without commenting on the impact of Khashoggi's death on foreign investment, Hokail said 50-70 percent of the companies involved in each of the six deals so far were foreign. Foreign banks had loaned 70-80 percent of the financing for each deal.
He did not identify the foreign or domestic investors in the deals or provide a breakdown of their stakes. Companies from France, Spain, China, Japan, the United States, Scandinavia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were among those involved.
Riyadh previously set a goal of aiming to generate 35 billion to 40 billion riyals ($9.3 billion to $10.0 billion) of non-oil state revenues from its privatization program by 2020. Some of that money would come from asset sales, while the rest would come from public-private partnerships.
But that drive has had some false-starts. The most high-profile was the shelving of proposals to float shares in oil giant Aramco, although officials said the sale would happen by early 2021.
Still, plans to sell flour mills, one of the first big privatizations, are moving ahead.
The request for proposals should be launched in several months, with companies from the United States, India, the Netherlands, Spain and other European countries among the more than 10 consortia that have pre-qualified, he said.
A significant plank in laying out how partnerships between the government and the private sector will work is the public sector participation law, which was expected to be approved during the second half of 2019, he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Tuesday it would recall 1.2 million Honda and Acura vehicles in North America to replace defective Takata airbags on the driver's side.
The company said https://hondanews.com/channels/corporate-recalls/releases/statement-by-american-honda-regarding-recall-of-takata-desiccated-replacement-driver-front-airbag-inflators it was aware of one injury linked to the defect, which may have caused the airbag to rupture when it was deployed in a crash.
Of the 23 total deaths worldwide linked to faulty Takata airbags, 21 have occurred in Honda vehicles. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the recall covers 1.1 million U.S. vehicles and is to replace inflators received ""either as a permanent Takata airbag inflator recall replacement or as a service part installed following a crash or problem with the airbag itself.""
Another 100,000 vehicles are being recalled in Canada, Mexico and Central America, Honda said.
The Honda models being recalled include 2001-2007 and 2009 Honda Accord, 2001-2005 Honda Civic, 2002-2007 and 2010-2011 Honda CR-V, 2003-2011 Honda Element, 2007 Honda Fit, 2002-2004 Honda Odyssey, 2003-2008 Honda Pilot, and 2006-2014 Honda Ridgeline.
The Acura models include 2003 Acura 3.2CL, 2013-2016 Acura ILX, 2003-2006 Acura MDX, 2002-2003 Acura 3.2TL, 2004-2006 and 2009-2014 Acura TL, 2007-2016 Acura RDX, and 2010-2013 Acura ZDX.
More than 290 injuries worldwide have been linked to Takata inflators that could explode, spraying metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. In total, 19 automakers are recalling more than 100 million potentially faulty inflators worldwide.
Repairs of the recalled Hondas and Acuras will begin immediately in the United States with replacement parts made by alternate suppliers, Honda said.
Honda became aware of the issue after a Honda Odyssey crash, where the front airbag deployed and injured the driver's arm. 
An investigation later showed that manufacturing issues at Takata's Mexico facility introduced excessive moisture into the inflator during assembly, leading to the problem.
The total number of recalled inflators is now about 21 million in about 12.9 million Honda and Acura vehicles that have been subject to recall for replacing Takata front airbag inflators in the United States, the company said.

Automakers in the United States repaired more than 7.2 million defective Takata air bag inflators in 2018, as companies have ramped up efforts to track down parts in need of replacement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Tuesday it had sanctioned two former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) bankers for their roles in a money-laundering scandal involving 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), Malaysia's state-owned investment fund.
Tim Leissner and Roger Ng have been barred from the banking industry for their involvement in ""a scheme that illegally diverts billions of dollars from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund,"" the Fed said.
Leissner, a former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, did not admit or deny the charge, but agreed to a $1.42 million fine, according to a settlement order issued by the Fed.
A lawyer for Leissner declined to comment. 
A lawyer for Ng could not be immediately reached for comment. Ng may request a hearing about his ban, the Fed said.
U.S prosecutors last year charged the two former Goldman bankers over the theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB. Leissner pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
""Given the Department of Justice’s charges, this development is hardly surprising,"" Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael Duvally said in an emailed statement about the Federal Reserve's action against the ex-bankers.
Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB had lied to it about bond sale proceeds.
In January, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer David Solomon apologized to the Malaysian people for Leissner’s role in the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund scandal, but said the bank had conducted due diligence before every transaction.
Ng has been detained in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, since Nov. 1. 

In February, a Malaysian court ruled for Ng to be extradited to the United States, but first wanted to complete the Malaysian case against him.

Leissner and Ng coordinated bond offerings that allowed funds to be stolen from 1MDB, the Fed said in a Tuesday statement. Some of the money was used to bribe government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi, and criminals also used proceeds to pay for lavish lifestyles, according to regulator.
Leissner, who agreed to the Fed’s permanent ban, was fined $1.42 million, according to the statement. He has already pleaded guilty to charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department, including conspiring to launder money.
Ng, Leissner’s deputy at Goldman Sachs, was indicted on similar charges in October. Last month, Malaysia said it will extradite Ng to the U.S. after he has completed legal proceedings in local courts.
The Fed has ramped up an investigation into how Goldman Sachs bankers dodged the firm’s internal controls to raise billions for 1MDB that later went missing, Bloomberg News reported in November, citing people familiar with the matter.
The Fed accused Leissner of participating in a scheme with Malaysian businessman Low Taek Jho and others to divert money from “several” 1MDB transactions, including three bond offerings underwritten by Goldman Sachs in 2012 and 2013, according to an order dated March 11. Low, a controversial financier, has been accused of embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars from the Malaysian fund and using some of it to buy gifts for famous models and film actors.
Leissner in August pleaded guilty to U.S. charges that he conspired to launder money and violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. As part of the charges, he agreed to forfeit $43.7 million and admitted to bribing officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates to get bond deals for Goldman Sachs.
Leissner said he and others arranged the 1MDB fundraising as debt offerings because it would generate higher fees for the bank. He has said said his behavior was in line with the “culture of Goldman Sachs to conceal facts from certain compliance and legal employees.”

1293,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 10:50AM ET</span>",Drug-price-comparison site GoodRx has quietly started listing startups that prescribe and ship pills alongside CVS and Walmart,"GoodRx, one of the oldest websites that lets people compare prices for prescription drugs, is adding in online upstarts to its list of prices. 
Alongside options to pick up prescriptions at pharmacies like CVS, Walgreens and Walmart, people shopping around for lower cash prices for their medications via GoodRx may have started to see an option to get their prescription delivered by mail.
GoodRx CEO Doug Hirsch told Business Insider that the reason it added online options is to help consumer get a better picture of all the ways they can get their medicine.
""We spend a lot of time trying to decrease the cost of healthcare,"" Hirsch said. ""But if someone can make available more convenient and affordable ways to get prescriptions, that’s music to our ears.""
GoodRx is best known for its work pulling together cash prices for medications at different pharmacies so those who don't have insurance or have to pay high prices out of pocket can have a cheaper alternative. Three years ago, it started reaching out to some of the startups that are prescribing medications online to see if they could work together. As more startups have entered the market, the number of partnerships has grown. 
GoodRx's move to include online, mail-order pharmacies happening at a time when consumers are getting more and more used to shopping online for everyday items like groceries and clothes. In 2018, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquired  online pharmacy PillPack, cementing itself in the market. At the same time, seemingly overnight  a crop of companies have sprung up that can prescribe and mail you medications like birth control and Viagra, creating a market for people looking to get a particular medication without going to an in-person doctor's visit.

Displayed alongside retail pharmacy prices, GoodRx users might see ""mail order"" options. For instance, a search for the generic form of Viagra in New York turns up three options at different price points, denoting which services can connect users to a doctor for a prescription. The idea is to present options side by side in a marketplace so consumers can make their own choices.
Hirsch said GoodRx has been working with companies like Lemonaid,  Nurx,  Hims,  Roman, HealthWarehouse, mailmyprescriptions.com, and  Truepill.

In some cases, the outside companies are able to prescribe medications by connecting patients to doctors, while in the cases of Truepill and mailmyprescriptions.com, a prescription from an outside doctor is required. Truepill is the pharmacy that also powers many of the on-demand healthcare startups like Hims and Nurx.
While the program is still in the experimental phase, Hirsch said it's been catching on. 
""It's been very popular,"" Hirsch said. ""We're driving traffic to each of these players now."""

Synutra had spent 170 million euros ($191.73 million) building the factory at Carhaix in Brittany which opened in 2016 with Sodiaal acting as its milk supplier.
The factory was one of a series of Chinese investments in Europe which followed a baby milk contamination scandal in China.
However Synutra entered into talks with Sodiaal last year about acquiring part of the site, amid reports that Synutra had failed to secure expected sales in China.
Sodiaal said it had taken over most of the factory, including production as of Tuesday under an agreement that will see Synutra continue to oversee packaging.
Financial terms were not disclosed.
The deal will allow Sodiaal to ramp up output of infant formula, one of the most lucrative segments in the dairy industry, said Damien Lacombe, the cooperative's president.
""We are going to be able to double our production rapidly,"" he said by telephone. ""We had a project to build a new infant formula factory, so we're going to save ourselves three years.""
Sodiaal will supply half of its production at Carhaix to Synutra, with the other half being marketed to other clients, including in China, Lacombe said.
Depending on types of formula, Carhaix can produce between 65,000 and 80,000 tonnes per year, compared with Sodiaal's current infant formula output of around 30,000 tonnes, he added.
Synutra had struggled with ramping up production, he said, declining to comment on reports of disputes between the Chinese firm and staff and suppliers.
Sodiaal will keep 180 staff at the Carhaix site, with the rest of the workforce of more than 300 to be retained by Synutra France, Lacombe said.
Sodiaal is France's largest farmer-owned dairy cooperative, generating sales of 5.1 billion euros in 2017 and collecting 4.7 billion liters of milk.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stash, a New York-based startup that allows consumers to save small sums of money and make micro-investments through its mobile app, has raised $65 million in funding, it said on Tuesday.
The funding round was provided by existing investors, including Union Square (NYSE:SQ) Ventures and Breyer Capital, and led by a private institutional investor, the company said. It did not disclose the name of the private institutional investor.
Stash, which also offers a debit account service connected to a card, said it had launched a new rewards program through which users can receive fractional shares of stock of companies when they make certain purchases.
Customers using Stash's debit card to shop on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) or buy food at Chipotle, for example, will receive a fraction of each company's publicly traded stock. For purchases at private companies, such as local stores or restaurants, customers will earn ""stock-back"" in an exchange traded fund.
The share purchases will be funded by Stash, which will make money through debit card interchange fees, Ed Robinson, co-founder and president of Stash, said in an interview. The program had been previously tested with a restricted number of customers.
""During the testing period, we saw an overwhelmingly positive response from users as they pay ordinary bills like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and in return received Netflix stock as well as access to dividends, educational resources and financial advice,"" Robinson said in a statement.
Like Stash, other financial technology companies have been expanding their offering to include banking-like services. Many are seeking to lure customers through rewards or by paying higher interest.
Student lender SocialFinance offers a checking account with a 2.25 percent interest rate, while digital wealth management startup Wealthfront last month launched a cash account with a rate of 2.24 percent.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 09:25AM ET</span>",Germany's Verdi union opposed to Deutsche-Commerzbank merger,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Verdi labor union on Tuesday objected strongly to a possible merger between  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), arguing that the merged group would be a more attractive target for a hostile foreign takeover.
The union also said in a statement to Reuters that Deutsche's problem investment bank, would not be helped by a tie-up with Commerzbank. A merger would put at least 10,000 jobs at risk, it added. 
""We reject a merger,"" said Jan Duscheck, head of Verdi's banking division.
It wouldn't create a truly big bank in the European market, and the new entity would be ""considerably more attractive for a hostile takeover, for example, by France,"" he said.
""The merger would not result in a 'national champion',"" he added.
The union's reaction follows news over the weekend that Deutsche Bank's chief executive Christian Sewing had agreed to hold tentative talks with rival Commerzbank. 
Berlin, which has been worried about Deutsche's health, has pushed for a merger as Deutsche has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis.
On Monday, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz confirmed that the banks were exploring a possible merger after weeks of media speculation. 
Both banks declined to comment.
Verdi is among Germany's largest unions, representing 2 million workers across a range of industries. The union is calling for a 6 percent wage increase for 200,000 workers that it represents in state and publicly-listed banks.
The union has two seats on Deutsche's supervisory board and two seats on Commerzbank's board. Duscheck sits on Deutsche's board.
Verdi had already flagged its opposition to a possible merger.
Some major shareholders are also worried about a tie-up, doubting that such a combination would guarantee higher returns, people familiar with the matter said. 
Otto Fricke, a member of German parliament and the business-friendly FDP party, on Tuesday criticized Scholz for feeding merger speculation and increasing pressure on the two banks unnecessarily.
Fricke, speaking to Reuters, said the decision should be left ""to the companies as it should be in a social market economy.""
Shares of both banks rose sharply on Monday but lost ground on Tuesday, with Deutsche down 2.6 percent and Commerzbank 2.5 percent by early afternoon.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 08:36AM ET</span>",Nissan's Infiniti to exit western Europe early next year,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co's premium brand Infiniti said on Friday it will exit western Europe early next year, as it restructures its global operations and turns its attention to sales in the world's top two auto markets.
Infiniti said it will discontinue the Q30 sedan and the QX30 sport-utility vehicle (SUV) and cease their production by the middle of 2019 at Nissan's manufacturing factory in Sunderland. Both models are sold globally but produced only in Britain.
The move comes as Infiniti seeks to divert its resources to markets with bigger opportunities, such as China and the United States, from a region where non-European premium brands are struggling to compete against local players such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
Nissan also recently scrapped plans to build its new X-Trail SUV in Britain amid the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, saying it had taken the decision to optimize its investments by building the next generation model in Japan. 
""Western Europe remains the most challenging and competitive region for premium cars,"" Infiniti's chief spokesman, Trevor Hale, told Reuters. Infiniti's sales in western Europe almost halved last year to 5,800 vehicles. 
In addition to the tough competition, the Japanese premium brand, headquartered in Hong Kong since 2012, has struggled to effectively meet emissions and other regulatory requirements in the region, Hale said, referring to stringent Euro 6 emissions requirements and other regulatory challenges.
""The commercial reality for Infiniti in western Europe is that there is simply no visibility of a viable and sustainable business, especially given the regulatory challenges,"" he said.
Infiniti said an exit from western Europe will allow it to focus on its initiative to ""electrify"" a good portion of its product portfolio from 2021 and discontinue diesel offerings. 
The brand plans to focus more on its SUV lineup in North America, bring five new or significantly-redesigned vehicles to China over the next five years, improve quality of sales and residual value and realize more synergies with Nissan. 
""This is all part of Infiniti's vision to become a top challenger brand in the premium segment,"" it said.
As it prepares to withdraw from western Europe, Infiniti said it is working to find alternative opportunities for employees who would be affected, consulting with employee representatives where necessary and identifying opportunities for transition and training support where appropriate.

Infiniti has 51 employees in its western Europe operations. There are 55 Infiniti retail stores in western Europe.

1304,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Markets Turn Against May's Deal as Cox's Codpiece Kills Optimism,"(Bloomberg) -- Just as all market omens were pointing to renewed optimism over Prime Minister Theresa May’s latest Brexit deal, her Attorney General Geoffrey Cox dashed hopes with his declaration that the accord’s legal risk remains “unchanged” after the revisions.
The pound instantly slid, European stocks fell in the red while U.K. domestic shares pared gains and large caps reversed losses.
Cox’s opinion -- or his so-called codpiece -- raises the odds that May’s deal will be defeated in Parliament Tuesday night, once again. If that happens, all eyes will be on two subsequent votes: one against a no-deal divorce and another to delay Britain’s departure.
“It was his opinion which matters the most,” Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, wrote in an email, referring to Cox. “Another historic defeat is strongly on the cards for Mrs. May and all options are on the table with respect to another election or no Brexit at all.”
To be clear, Cox also said that the new deal lowers the risk of the U.K. being locked in the Irish backstop, the provision that has stoked the ire of pro-Brexit politicians.
Brexit-sensitive U.K. stocks from Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc to homebuilder  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW) Plc immediately pared their advance. The mid-cap FTSE 250 Index was up 0.6 percent as of 11:37 a.m. in London, while the FTSE 100 reversed a decline of as much as 0.7 percent to rise 0.5 percent as the pound slid 0.9 percent.
The Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 0.2 percent. U.S. equity futures erased gains to trade little changed.
If the latest deal is defeated and the vote on delaying Brexit passes, the terms of the extension will be key to the market. A three-month delay hardly lifts fears of a “cliff edge,” while a 21-month one will be much more heartening to local British stocks, and, conversely, negative for U.K.-listed multinationals, said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald Asset Management in London.
Disappointment could be exacerbated because, judging by the few tentative green shoots in the U.K. market, investor expectations are now higher: Exchange-traded funds targeting British stocks have seen $1.6 billion of inflows this year, compared to $5.5 billion of outflows for European shares more broadly. U.K. domestic stocks have recovered this year as strategists from various banks turned bullish.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Yum China Holdings is partnering with China's two biggest state oil giants to open franchise fast-food outlets at gas stations in the country, in a bid to tap new growth areas as the domestic economy slows. 
More than 100 outlets, likely KFC restaurants, will be opened at gas stations owned by Sinopec Corp and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) over the next three years, Yum China said on Tuesday, without giving any financial details. The two Chinese oil firms collectively operate over 50,000 gas stations in the country. 
""It's something quite new for both of us, we're going to open some stores and figure out the economics, once we figure out the economics then we can be more specific on the financials,"" Yum China' Chief Executive Joey Wat told Reuters in an interview after an investor day it held in Shanghai. 
""We only have a very modest goal in the coming three years,""
The New York-listed firm, spun off from Yum Brands Inc in 2016, owns Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell in China and is the largest fast-food operator there with more than 8,400 outlets, which it intends to expand to 10,000 by 2021. 
Wat said the company was adapting to changes in China's economy, whose growth has slowed to a 28-year-low. For example, the company was rolling out more value promotions to meet demand from customers who were seeking more value-for-money deals. 
These promotions and other factors could put pressure on KFC's restaurant margin in the first half, Yum China said, though it added that it had the capacity to return $1.5 billion to shareholders over the next three years. The company had flagged both the margin pressure and how much it could return to shareholders last month with its quarterly results.
TOUGH SHIP TO TURN
While sales at its KFC chain have largely stabilized after a period of weakness, thanks to upgraded stores and a big push on delivery, Yum China has been trying to revive performance at Pizza Hut, which has posted just three quarters of positive same store sales growth in China since the start of 2014. 
In February, Yum China, reported a 6 percent year-on-year rise in total system sales for the fourth quarter, led by KFC, but sales at Pizza Hut dipped 2 percent during that period.
Wat said in 2017 that a turnaround could take up to two years to bear fruit. Towards that goal, the firm has so far rolled out a new store design and a series of promotions. It will introduce a new menu with 15 percent fewer items next week.
She said on Tuesday that while same store sales had yet to recover, the business had hit a milestone in the fourth quarter when traffic growth turned positive. 
""When we are turning the ship, when we work hard to get the momentum to turn, it's not easy, there are many forces at work, but we certainly feel like we are on the right track and doing all the right initiatives,"" she said. 

""At the time we set out a very aggressive time frame...but management does not have a crystal ball either,"" she added. ""We still have a little bit of time.""

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 07:05AM ET</span>",Futures slightly higher ahead of inflation data,"By Amy Caren Daniel
(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures inched higher on Tuesday, taking cues from global stocks which rose after last-minute tweaks to Britain's deal to leave the European Union that eased some fears of a no-deal Brexit, and as investors waited for inflation data.
European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said he agreed to an updated Brexit deal with British Prime Minister Theresa May to make the agreement more palatable to UK lawmakers but warned they would not get a third chance to endorse it.
The S&P 500 index has risen nearly 19 percent off its December lows, when markets were roiled by concerns of Sino-U.S. trade frictions, slowing economic growth and uncertainty about Brexit.
A reduced likelihood of crashing out of the EU with no Brexit deal helped inject some appetite for riskier assets, potentially eliminating one of the three major concerns of global investors.
British lawmakers who rejected May's withdrawal agreement in January are due to vote on the Brexit deal again at around 3:00 p.m. ET (1900 GMT).
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co fell 2.1 percent, extending a fall from the previous session after many airlines grounded the company's best-selling line of jets after a second fatal crash in just five months.
Boeing as well as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co's fall in pre-market trading pressured the Dow futures.
The world's largest planemaker, which is the best performing Dow component this year by a wide margin, fell as much as 13.4 percent on Monday and weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial average.
However the blue-chip Dow pared losses, and all three indexes ended Monday higher boosted by a tech-led rally. Wall Street had posted five straight sessions of declines in the previous week, their biggest fall since 2018-end.
At 6:38 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 29 points, or 0.11 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.75 points, or 0.06 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 12 points, or 0.17 percent.
Coca-Cola dipped 0.3 percent after HSBC downgraded the soda maker's stock.
On the economic front, the Labor Department is expected to show that the seasonally adjusted consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2 percent in February, after remaining unchanged for a third straight month in January.

Core CPI is seen increasing 2.2 percent year-on-year, unchanged from January. The report is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.

1308,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>",Shell Says It Can Be World's Top Power Producer and Profit,"(Bloomberg) -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc plans to become the world’s biggest power company within 15 years, a move that suggests it sees climate change as a bigger threat to its business than electricity’s historically weak returns.
The world’s No. 2 oil explorer by market value is spending as much as $2 billion a year on its new-energies division, mainly to grow in a power sector it sees delivering 8 to 12 percent annual returns, according to Maarten Wetselaar, director of Shell’s integrated gas and new-energies unit.
“We believe we can be the largest electricity power company in the world in the early 2030s,” Wetselaar said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday. “We are not interested in the power business because we like what we saw in the last 20 years; we are interested because we think we like what we see in the next 20 years.”
Investors are putting pressure on companies to protect their business from a shift to lower-carbon fuels, driven by new laws and consumer choices. That pressure is especially acute in Europe, where Norway’s Finance Ministry last week instructed its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund to divest some oil and gas companies to shield it from a “permanent decline” in crude prices.
{0{|BP}},  Total 
The region’s biggest oil majors, such as Shell,  BP  Plc (LON:BP) and Total SA (PA:TOTF), were spared in the decision, partly because they’re bolstering their investments in renewables. Besides Shell’s move toward power, BP has purchased the U.K.’s biggest car-charging company, while Total has bought electricity provider Direct Energie. They’ve also invested in solar and wind-power production.
For Shell, the electricity business is still in an experimental phase. Last month, the vice president of its new-energies unit, Mark Gainsborough, declined to estimate when it’ll achieve higher returns, but indicated it will introduce new combinations of power products that are more profitable than those from a traditional utility.
“Being smarter with its molecules across the value chain is important,” said Christyan Malek, head of European, Middle East and African oil and gas research at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). “But generating a return as good as its oil and gas business will be the key challenge.”
Shell’s acquisitions in power so far include U.K. electricity provider First Utility, car-charging operator NewMotion and a stake in U.S. solar company Silicon Ranch Corp. It has also announced it’s bidding for Dutch utility Eneco, which provides low-carbon power to industrial users and offers apps and other technology to manage electricity consumption.
Even with those purchases, achieving its targets around power will probably require a “major overhaul” of its investment priorities, according to Will Hares, an energy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Half of Shell’s capital is allocated to its upstream business, which finds and pumps oil and gas, with only about 5 percent dedicated to new energies.
The company remains cautious about making big spending changes, according to Wetselaar, who said “we want to prove to ourselves that the hypothesis works before we scale it beyond our current commitments.”
European majors are increasingly setting themselves apart from their American counterparts such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) due to pressure from regulators and investors.
BP, Shell, Total and Equinor ASA have all made specific statements and investments around low-carbon fuels. At International Petroleum Week in late February, Total’s upstream oil and gas boss said oil may only make up 30 percent of the company’s portfolio in 2040, with cleaner natural gas making up 50 percent and renewables and power accounting for the rest.
Meanwhile, Exxon and Chevron have been slower to make changes. Both were later than their European peers to join a key industry-wide climate investment initiative, while each has doubled down on oil production in shale. Both have said they’re committed to helping de-carbonize energy but have doubted the wisdom of altering their business model.
The subject was addressed this week at the CERAWeek by IHS Markit conference, which brings together oil executives from across the world in Houston. Equinor Chief Executive Officer Eldar Saetre took a moment on the main stage to say the fossil-fuel business is increasingly problematic.
“Collectively we’re not doing enough on climate change,” he said. “Not taking action is unsustainable.”

Dow futures fell 76 points or 0.3% by 7:35AM ET (11:35GMT), while Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell another 2% in premarket trading after closing down 5.33% on Monday.
Elsewhere, the S&P 500 futures fell 2.6 points or 0.1% while and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures gave up a 0.1% gain to trade essentially flat.
Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said that tweaks to the language of the withdrawal agreement hammered out by May and EU negotiators over two years weren't enough to guarantee that the U.K. wouldn't be locked into a customs union with the EU after Brexit. As a result, the Brexiteers in May's Conservative Party are almost certain to vote against the deal in a parliamentary vote later Tuesday, ensuring it will fail.
""Now the deal will fail this evening by probably 100+ votes,"" Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) portfolio manager Rupert Harrison in London said via Twitter. 


The margin is important because some had hoped that a narrow defeat would have allowed May to carry on pressing for concessions from the EU in the hope of getting a deal over the line.
Futures had been tending higher before the announcement, with the exception of the Dow, which was dragged down for the second consecutive day by index heavy-weight Boeing, after its 737 Max 8 airplanes were grounded by more international aviation regulators.
Nearly 40% of the 737 Max around the world are parked, after Australia, Singapore and several Latin American authorities joined China and Indonesia in raising concerns about one of the airline’s biggest money-makers. The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has said it has no plans to ground the jet, creating an unusual situation in which the aircraft’s home regulator, in this case, the FAA, is lagging its international peers.
Boeing is the Dow’s heaviest-weighted component, which means any big movement in the plane manufacturer can cause steep declines on the index.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 06:18AM ET</span>","Nissan, Renault break up almighty chairmanship in wake of Ghosn's ouster","By Sam Nussey and Maki Shiraki
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Japan's Nissan Motor and France's  Renault  said they would retool the world's top car-making alliance to put themselves on more equal footing, breaking up the all-powerful chairmanship previously wielded by ousted boss Carlos Ghosn.
The removal of Ghosn, credited for rescuing Nissan from near-bankruptcy in 1999, had caused much uncertainty about the future of the alliance and some speculation the partnership could even unravel.
The companies, together with junior ally Mitsubishi Motors, on Tuesday said the chairman of Renault would serve as the head of the alliance but - in a critical sign of the rebalancing - not as chairman of Nissan. 
Nissan has said that Ghosn wielded too much power, creating a lack of oversight and corporate governance. It was not clear who would become Nissan's chairman, vacant since Ghosn was arrested in Japan in November.
But the automakers gave no indication of any immediate change in their cross-shareholding agreement, one which has given smaller Renault SA (PA:RENA) more sway over Nissan. 
The so-called Restated Alliance Master Agreement that has bound them together so far remains intact, they said.
""We are fostering a new start of the alliance. There is nothing to do with the shareholdings and the cross-shareholdings that are still there and still in place,"" Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said at a news conference. 
""Our future lies in the efficiency of this alliance,"" he told reporters at Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama.
Senard also said he would not seek to be chairman of Nissan, but instead was a ""natural candidate"" to be vice-chairman.
Former Nissan chairman Ghosn was released on a $9 million bail last week after spending more than 100 days in a Tokyo detention center. He faces charges of under-reporting his salary at the Japanese automaker by about $82 million over nearly a decade - charges he has called ""meritless"". 
Ghosn, who has not spoken to media since his release, put in a request with a Tokyo court on Monday to attend Nissan's board meeting the next day, but he was not given permission. 
Under the terms of his bail, he would have needed the court's nod to attend.
BOARD MEETING
Ghosn will not hold a highly anticipated news conference until next week at the earliest and is not planning to attend Nissan's shareholder meeting next month, his lawyer said. 
""Mr Ghosn wants to have some time to mull over what he's going to say,"" Junichiro Hironaka told reporters outside his Tokyo office after meeting with Ghosn throughout the day.
Ghosn left his lawyer's office in the evening without taking questions from reporters.
In the wake of the scandal, Renault has started its own review of payments to Ghosn. French prosecutors have opened a preliminary inquiry into how he financed his 2016 wedding at the Chateau de Versailles, French media have reported.
His dramatic arrest and the detention exposed tensions between Nissan and top shareholder Renault, complicating the outlook for a partnership that is the world's largest maker of automobiles, excluding heavy trucks.
Some at Nissan had been unhappy with Ghosn's push for a deeper tie-up with Renault, which was seen as possibly including a full merger. Smaller Renault bought 43 percent of Nissan ahead of the 1999 rescue.

Nissan holds a 15 percent, non-voting stake in Renault, whose top shareholder is the French government.

The insurer also said that existing members would have the choice of adopting this plan during contract renewal.
In recent years, insurers have tried to guide patients toward less expensive treatments by making them pay a higher portion of a drug's costs.
Drugmakers have responded by dramatically raising the financial aid by increasingly offering the so-called 'copay assistance' cards, similar to a debit card, that consumers can use at the pharmacy counter to reduce their out-of-pocket costs.
UnitedHealth's move builds on the existing discount programs that were announced a year ago, which the company said will serve more than 9 million consumers this year.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>","Stocks, pound rally as tweaked Brexit deal soothes investor worries","By Andrew Galbraith and Josephine Mason
SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Last-minute tweaks to Britain's deal to leave the European Union triggered gains across global stocks and propelled sterling higher on Tuesday, soothing investor worries about a possible no-deal exit that has unnerved financial markets in recent months.
Gains in Asian equities extended to Europe, where the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.2 percent, after Brussels agreed to additional changes to an updated Brexit deal with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday.
Wall Street futures were also higher in early European trade. 
The Dublin stock exchange, a barometer for sentiment around the UK's departure from the bloc, rose 0.9 percent, outperforming its European peers, while the UK's blue chip FTSE 100 dropped 0.1 percent. 
With 70 percent of its income coming from abroad, the blue chip index is often pressured by a stronger pound.
Sterling, which had already risen ahead of the talks on changes, rallied on hopes the assurance may be enough to sway rebellious British lawmakers who have threatened to vote down May's plan again on Tuesday.
A reduced likelihood of crashing out of the EU with no Brexit deal helped inject some appetite for riskier assets, potentially eliminating one of the three major concerns of global investors, alongside trade and slowing global growth. 
But it was not clear if the changes would be enough to secure parliamentary support when lawmakers vote around 1900 GMT, having voted down May's original deal by a record 230 votes in January. 
The pound was up 0.5 percent, buying $1.3218 and taking its gains over two days to 2.6 percent.
""This additional agreement to the existing contract does slightly increase the probability that by tonight the deal will go through, but only slightly increases it,"" said Britt Weidenbach, head of European equities at DWS.
""The market will probably only react to this in a more positive way once we know what the outcome is going to be. This might not be after tonight, it may be after Wednesday when we have a ruling on No-Deal and prolongation.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed up 1 percent, while Chinese blue chips ended up 0.7 percent, extending the previous day's rally.
Despite slowing domestic economic growth and uncertainty about the outlook for trade negotiations between China and the United States, Chinese markets have been buoyed this year by investors' expectations of more stimulus to cushion any downturn.
The CSI300 index has risen more than 28 percent this year.
Japan's Nikkei stock index closed 1.8 percent higher, but Australian shares erased earlier gains to end down 0.1 percent.
Before the latest Brexit developments, risk sentiment was already well supported after global equity indexes climbed overnight on gains in technology stocks and expectations of more stimulus from China.
U.S. shares rebounded from a week-long losing streak, with news that U.S. chip supplier Nvidia Corp has agreed to buy Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies Ltd for $6.8 billion helping to boost tech shares.
A nearly 7 percent gain in Nvidia shares helped to propel the Nasdaq Composite 2.02 percent higher.
RISING YIELDS
The turn toward riskier assets lifted yields of higher-rated euro-zone government bonds. 
Germany's benchmark 10-year government bond yield rose 2.5 basis points to 0.09 percent -- moving away from more than two-year lows hit last week in the wake of a dovish European Central Bank meeting.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields were at 2.6573 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.641 percent on Monday. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, shed 0.3 percent. But rising risk appetite weighed on the safe-haven yen, pushing the dollar up 0.2 percent.
The euro was up 0.3 percent on the day.
In commodity markets, oil prices rose on a combination of strong demand and supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
A political and economic crisis in OPEC-member Venezuela is also expected to lift crude prices.
U.S. crude was up 0.4 percent at $57.21 a barrel and Brent crude was 0.5 percent higher at $67.06 per barrel. 
Spot gold was up 0.1 percent to $1,295.4 per ounce.

Investing.com -- European stocks are flying Tuesday morning after U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May claimed a major breakthrough in talks over Brexit with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker late Monday.
They’re also getting a big tailwind from a change in sentiment regarding U.S. tech stocks, and a fresh shot of optimism about an end to the U.S.-China trade war, after reports overnight about a telephone call between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and his Chinese counterpart Liu He.
At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 3.58 points, or 1.0% at 374.16.
The big outlier among European markets is, of course, the U.K., where the FTSE 100 is down 0.3% because of the sharp rise in sterling on the Brexit news. That hits the big resource companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa). But the more U.K.-focused stocks, such as house-builders  Persimmon  (LON:PSN),  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW),  Barratt Developments  (LON:BDEV) and Berkeley Group (LON:BKGH), are all outperforming. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index, which has less international exposure than the blue-chip index, is up 0.4%.
It’s still not clear whether the progress announced by May last night will be enough to get her withdrawal agreement through parliament in a key vote scheduled for later Tuesday. The deal was voted down by a margin of 230 in January and those who opposed still haven’t said whether they will back the tweaked version.
In non-Brexit news, payments company  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN), the most successful European IPO of last year, is down over 5% after early shareholders placed sold an 8.5% stake, worth some 1.5 billion euros, through an accelerated bookbuild. And Germany’s Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) has surged another 7.0% after Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (whose government owns some 15% of the bank) confirmed informal discussions about a merger with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). In contrast to yesterday, Deutsche is no longer rising on the news, partly due to a New York Times report saying that the New York attorney general's office subpoenaed it late Monday in relation to its dealings with U.S. President Donald Trump."

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 02:26AM ET</span>",Worried about next downturn? U.S. credit funds may offer early clues,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - It seemed like an opportunity a lender would not want to miss.
The loan paid 10.25 percent interest which would go up if a benchmark rose. The borrower was Trident USA Health Services, a growing company which provided bedside medical testing in nursing and assisted living centers.
Trident was buying similar companies across the country targeting cost savings from consolidation. Trident filed for bankruptcy last month. It had taken on too much debt to cope with reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments, equipment upgrades and other issues. A new billing system for the expanded company failed and it never collected millions of dollars. Trident's lenders face estimated losses of 50 to 100 percent. ""We were wrong,"" Michael Mauer, chief executive of CM Finance Inc, (O:CMFN) one of the lenders, said in a Feb. 7 call with stock analysts.
After the Great Recession, regulators squeezed much of the risk out of U.S. banks. But risk has not gone away. Much of it now resides in non-bank financial entities, including commercial loan companies, such as CM Finance, private credit funds, and structured finance vehicles, many of which have yet to be tested by a broad recession after a nearly decade-long expansion.
The borrowers include mid-sized, speculative-grade companies that have loaded up on debt to fund their expansion. Sometimes one setback can push them over the edge, as happened with Trident's botched billing system roll out.
“We think credit losses will rise,” said Matt Carroll, a credit analyst at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings. His reasons: A lot of money has flowed into private credit, pushing down lending standards in a benign economy.
Some $900 billion in non-bank loans to mid-sized companies sit alongside another $1.1 trillion of speculative-grade loans that have been made by bank syndicates to larger companies and mostly resold to institutional investors. These amounts are dwarfed by the $11 trillion in outstanding U.S. home mortgage loans and probably are not enough to drag down the financial system, as mortgages did during the 2007-2009 crisis.
However, rising non-bank debt has fueled concerns it could make a recession worse because loan losses could cripple many non-bank lenders, leaving companies most in need without access to credit. ""When you have a real recession, the lender will not be there. So, a lot of these borrowers will be stranded,"" JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) chief Jamie Dimon told analysts in January.
SPECIAL STATUS
The publicly listed funds that lent to Trident are among several dozen known as business development companies. BDCassets have quadrupled since the crisis to $100 billion, according to data from  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysts. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2V2ZCSl) Those funds attracted investors by offering yields topping 10 percent because they were making loans that were riskier than those banks were allowed to make.
BDCs hold special status under a 1980s federal law designed to support small business. The law limits their leverage. They are allowed to bypass taxes by paying out 90 percent of profits to shareholders. Unlike most non-bank lenders, business development corporations must disclose estimated values for each loan and say which ones are going bad. Their reports give analysts looking for signs of trouble in commercial lending a glimpse into a bigger pool of an estimated additional $800 billion in unlisted funds and private accounts managed by many of the same firms.
""You can learn a lot by looking at the BDCs for what they might mean for other private credit,"" said Carroll of S&P Global Ratings. 
In 2013, for example, one such investor called  THL Credit Inc  (O:TCRD) made loans, starting at 9 percent, for Charming Charlie, a retailer of women's fashion accessories arranged by color in as many as 26 different hues. The founder used the loans to buy shares of the business from a private equity firm and add more stores, according to S&P Global. But the company went too far in stocking the stores with items of different colors and got stuck with unsold merchandise. Constrained by its debt, the company ran short of cash to properly stock the stores and filed for bankruptcy in December 2017. THL declined to comment for this story, but in a March 7 call its executives told investors they have diversified their portfolio to include 42 companies and reduce the risk of losses like those on Charming Charlie. 
These days some BDCs are doing better than others. Six of 39 BDCs tracked by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods recently traded at premiums of more than 10 percent to net asset value, a sign of good lending records. Eight, however, traded for less than 75 cents for each dollar of net asset value - suggesting they had enough problems with loans to make investors doubt the values shown will hold up.
As BDCs doubled in size since 2013, Refinitiv data shows levels of debt relative to profits have risen to 4.75 times from 4.2 times for mid-sized companies that borrowed to finance buyouts, according to Refinitiv data. That, combined with some lenders willingness to dial up the risk to boost returns, could spell more trouble ahead.
""It has become harder for BDCs to deliver compelling returns without taking more risk,"" Finian O'Shea, a BDC analyst at Wells Fargo, said. 

CM Finance, for example, in the last half of 2018 acquired loans coming due within two years and issued by low-rated Techniplas, a supplier of highly engineered plastic parts to the auto industry. The appeal of the loans? A 14 percent yield. Yet, last month Standard & Poor’s put a negative outlook on the loans because of the risk that company will not be able to refinance them in time.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 02:24AM ET</span>",U.S. to mandate design changes on Boeing 737 MAX 8 after crashes,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will mandate that Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co implement design changes by April that have been in the works for months for the 737 MAX 8 fleet after a fatal crash in October but said the plane was airworthy and did not need to be grounded after a second crash on Sunday.
An Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 bound for Nairobi crashed minutes after take-off on Sunday, killing all 157 aboard and raising questions about the safety of the new variant of the industry workhorse, one of which also crashed in Indonesia in October, killing 189 people.
Boeing confirmed the Federal Aviation Administration's announcement late Monday that it will deploy a software upgrade across the 737 MAX 8 fleet ""in the coming weeks"" as pressure mounted. Two U.S. senators called the fleet's immediate grounding and a rising number of airlines said they would voluntarily ground their fleets.
The company confirmed it had for several months ""been developing a flight control software enhancement for the 737 MAX, designed to make an already safe aircraft even safer.""
Boeing did not reference Sunday's Ethiopian Airlines crash in connection to the software upgrade. The statement did express the company's condolences to the relatives of the 157 people who died, however. 
The FAA said the changes will ""provide reduced reliance on procedures associated with required pilot memory items.""
The FAA also said Boeing will ""update training requirements and flight crew manuals to go with the design change"" to an automated protection system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS. The changes also include MCAS activation and angle of attack signal enhancements.
The FAA said in the notice made public that external reports are drawing similarities between the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. ""However, this investigation has just begun and to date we have not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions,"" according to the Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community for Boeing 737 MAX 8 operators.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told reporters regulators would not hesitate to act if they find a safety issue.
""If the FAA identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action,"" Chao told reporters. ""I want people to be assured that we take these incidents, these accidents very seriously.""
Boeing's top executive told employees on Monday he was confident in the safety of the U.S. manufacturer's top-selling 737 MAX aircraft. The company added that it was ""still early"" in the Ethiopian Airlines investigation.
Reuters and other media outlets have reported that Boeing has for months planned design changes after the Lion Air crash in Indonesia but the FAA notice was the first public confirmation.
Canada's transport minister also said he will not hesitate to act once the cause of the crash is known. 
Two Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein and Richard Blumenthal called for the immediate grounding of the aircraft, as did Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org and a member of the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee.
Blumenthal said the planes ""should be grounded until the FAA can assure American travelers that these planes are safe.""
Sara Nelson, the president of Association of Flight Attendants union, wrote the FAA on Monday asking it to conduct a comprehensive review and ""take steps immediately to address concerns and ensure the safety of the 737 MAX fleet.""
The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA are both at the crash site in Ethiopia, Chao said.
Boeing's shares fell as much as 10 percent on the prospect that two such crashes in such a short time could reveal flaws in its new plane. Boeing, whose shares closed down 5.3 percent at $400.01 in the heaviest trading trade since July 2013.
The 737 line, which has flown for more than 50 years, is the world's best-selling modern passenger aircraft and viewed as one of the industry's most reliable.
China ordered its airlines to ground the jet, a move followed by Indonesia and Ethiopia. Other airlines, from North America to the Middle East, kept flying the 737 MAX 8 on Monday after Boeing said it was safe.
Boeing’s 737 MAX is the newest version of a jet that has been a fixture of passenger travel for decades and the cash cow of the world’s largest aircraft maker, competing against Airbus SE’s A320neo family of single-aisle jetliners. The 737 family is considered one of the industry’s most reliable aircraft.
The MAX has a bigger and more efficient engine compared with earlier 737 models.

Boeing rolled out the fuel-efficient MAX 8 in 2017 as an update to the already redesigned 50-year-old 737, and had delivered 350 MAX jets out of the total order tally of 5,011 aircraft by the end of January.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 01:25AM ET</span>",The Small Short: Investors bet against 2nd-tier Australian banks after inquiry spares majors,"By Paulina Duran and Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Investors are shorting second-tier Australian banks while the majors enjoy their biggest rally in three years, as the market weighs up the long-term impact of a public inquiry that exposed widespread misconduct in the financial sector last year.
The capital shift shows investors believe higher regulatory costs will hurt smaller lenders more than the big four market leaders, whose business models - if not their reputations - emerged largely unscathed from the year-long inquiry. 
Short bets on regional lenders Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (AX:BEN) and Bank of Queensland (AX:BOQ) spiked over a fifth in the weeks since the inquiry delivered its final report on Feb. 1, Refinitiv data shows. Their shares had already fallen about 15 percent in the same period. 
Investors are instead putting money on the larger banks' ability to safeguard profitability in an environment of record low mortgage growth and falling house prices.
""The regional banks will struggle to compete with the major banks,"" said Azib Khan, from stockbroker Morgans Financial Ltd.
As the government-backed independent inquiry known as a Royal Commission continued through most of 2018, analysts feared it would result in anything from enforced divestments to strict controls over how much a bank could lend. But its final recommendations focused mostly on cultural changes, sparing the big lenders the prospect of tougher laws.
The inquiry wiped A$72 billion ($51 billion) from the combined valuation of the top four banks - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) - from its February 2018 start to the last trading week of 2018, amid constant headlines about fee-gouging, cavalier sales tactics and poor governance.
Since then, their shares have clawed back A$50 billion. The country's biggest lender, Commonwealth Bank, is now only 4 percent below its pre-inquiry level. ANZ's shares have risen 12 percent in the four weeks since the inquiry delivered its final report last month, their biggest one-month leap since March 2016 and within 5 percentage points of full recovery.
While the inquiry found the smaller lenders generally had behaved better than their bigger rivals, they have suffered sharper falls in lending growth and profitability in the wake of the Royal Commission.
""It's harder for them to absorb the extra regulatory costs, and they have a lower credit rating than the majors and that means that they've got a higher cost of funding,"" Khan said.
Recent updates from Bank of Queensland and Bendigo included the banks' expectations of higher regulatory costs, highlighting the disadvantages of the smaller lenders.
With home loan growth of just 1 percent during the first half of the financial year, Bendigo reported below-expectation profit and flagged higher regulatory spending in the second half. Bank of Queensland also flagged lower half-yearly earnings and warned the second half of the year would be challenging.
""The increase in compliance costs and expensive funding will affect the smaller banks more than the larger banks,"" said Sean Sequeira, chief investment officer at Alleron Investment Management.
Sequeira said that while his fund did not hold short positions in the banks, he agreed with the short call on Bendigo. 
""They have a portfolio of reverse mortgages that leaves them with a larger exposure to property than banks with standard loan portfolios, which concerns us given the current weakness in housing.""

""We will nevertheless be studying and investigating as to whether we should shut it down or we should sell it off or we should refinance it. All these things are open for the government to decide.""
The airline has been trying to transform its operations and return to profitability by 2019 as it recovers from two disasters in 2014, when flight MH370 disappeared in what remains a mystery and flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine.
Sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd, which took MAB private in 2014, said the government needed to decide on its investment in, and level of support for, the struggling airline.

The fund also said that it was waiting for MAB to present a review of its business strategy.

1323,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 11:10PM ET</span>",Fear of Trump Walking on Xi Haunts China as Trade Talks Near End,"(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump regularly touts the strength of his personal relationship with Xi Jinping, talking about the Chinese leader in the sort of warm terms U.S. presidents normally reserve for longstanding allies.
Yet as the world’s two largest economies inch towards a trade agreement designed to define and reorder their economic relationship for years to come, one question looms large: Does Xi trust Trump enough to get on a plane and seal the deal?
Trump and his aides have for weeks been pushing for Xi to agree to a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, the president’s club and resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to finalize a deal as soon as this month to end a dispute that has cast a shadow over the global economy. Trump himself has said that it’s only when the two leaders meet that the final details can be ironed out.
Chinese officials, however, have long been wary of putting Xi in a position where he might be embarrassed by an unpredictable Trump or forced into last-minute concessions.
“That is the real conundrum for Xi,’’ said Eswar Prasad, an expert on the Chinese economy at Cornell University who regularly meets with senior officials in Beijing. “The concern about being snookered by Trump at the negotiating table is a real risk for Xi.’’
China’s worries are flipping the U.S. script on its head. As he claims to be the first American president to stand up to Beijing, his aides have built a possible deal on a foundation of distrust. In their view, a China that has for decades lied and cheated its way to economic success cannot be trusted to live up to any commitments unless a deal has teeth.
“That’s the fundamental question,’’ Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, told Congress on Feb. 27. “What the president wants is an agreement that number one is enforceable.’’
Officials in Beijing insist they’ve played by international rules and just want to be sure Trump won’t again kill an agreement at the last minute. Trump has rejected at least two deals brought to him since he first hosted Xi at Mar-a-Lago in April 2017: One struck by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for China to cut steel overcapacity, and another negotiated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last year. Both would’ve averted the trade deal.
The latter one was particularly jarring for Xi, who faces pressure in China to avoid giving up too much in a deal with Trump. Vice Premier Liu He came to Washington as Xi’s special representative, and declared to China’s state-run media that a trade war had been averted. After Trump backtracked, talks stalled for months until the two leaders met in December at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina.
Last month, Trump’s decision to walk away from his Hanoi summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un without a deal only reinforced China’s concerns about the president’s unpredictability.
Former Commerce Vice Minister Wei Jianguo argues that because the U.S. and China are great powers Trump would never walk away from Xi as he did Kim. The consequences would be too great. “It is important to boost confidence in a slowing global economy,” Wei said.
There are parallels for the Chinese.
In 1999, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji faced a nationalist backlash after a last-minute change of course by the Clinton administration threw a deal for China’s accession to the World Trade Organization into doubt.
Erin Ennis, who tracks the negotiations for the U.S.-China Business Council, said a Trump snub of Xi this time around would be an order of magnitude greater than any previously. Then again, she said, “I don’t think the Chinese are the only government in the world that is not entirely sure what they are getting when they send their head of state into a meeting with the president of the United States.’’
Daily Talks
Trump has for months pushed to sign a deal, and that has fundamentally changed the dynamics of negotiations. In recent days both sides have held daily conference calls. China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday that Liu, Lighthizer and Mnuchin decided on arrangements for the next stage of trade talks, without providing more details.
China last week revised an offer on intellectual-property protection, one focal point of the negotiations, according to people briefed on the offer. It has also pledged to increase purchases of American goods by $1.2 trillion over six years and to open its market in some key sectors, raising hopes that it might finally allow U.S. firms to compete in forbidden areas such as cloud computing.
As a deal gets closer, Chinese officials also want the U.S. to agree that any commitments go both ways, particularly on enforcement.
The U.S. wants China to agree not to retaliate against any punitive measures Washington might apply if Beijing doesn’t meet its commitments. But Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen over the weekend countered any enforcement mechanism would have to be “two-way, fair and equal.”
‘Judge, Jury’
“I’m not sure if China would ever allow the United States to be the judge, jury and sheriff on these issues and that seems to be the core of what the U.S. is asking for,’’ said Wendy Cutler, a former senior U.S. trade negotiator who heads the Asia Society Policy Institute.
Trump could see political benefits from walking away from a deal. He’s already facing questions about the quality of the agreement and whether the trade war he started -- and the economic damage it has brought in farm states in particular -- will prove to have been worth it. Some hawks inside his administration also fear Trump is being led into a bad deal with a China that will remain a growing strategic threat.
Still, both presidents have their reasons to settle their differences.
Trump is under pressure to prove his “America First’’ trade policies can deliver, the evidence for which is mixed so far. Since 2016 the U.S. trade deficit -- Trump’s own favorite metric -- has blown out by almost $120 billion, or more than 20 percent.
Meanwhile, a successful summit in Mar-a-Lago would enable Xi to silence his own domestic critics, said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London. ""If he cannot get some kind of a ‘decent’ deal with Trump and the economy continues to slide, the pressure on Xi will build up,"" he said.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 10:40PM ET</span>",Elon Musk shoots down U.S. regulator's complaint about his Tesla tweet,"By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk shot back against U.S. securities regulators on Monday, arguing in a filing that his recent tweet about the electric vehicle maker's production volume did not violate his fraud settlement and he cannot be held in contempt.
Musk's ""single, immaterial"" tweet to his more than 24 million Twitter followers claiming the electric vehicle-maker would produce around 500,000 cars in 2019 also complied with company's communication policy for senior executives, a condition of the settlement, lawyers for the Tesla chief wrote in a filing in federal court in Manhattan. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had asked the court to hold Musk in contempt, saying his Feb. 19 tweet violated a September fraud settlement barring him from sharing material information about Tesla on social media without the company's pre-approval.
""This contempt action, following Musk's sincerely-held criticism of the SEC on 60 Minutes, also reflects concerning and unprecedented overreach on the part of the SEC,"" the filing said.
In December, Musk said in a ""60 Minutes"" interview that: ""I do not have respect for the SEC.""
The settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC resolved an SEC lawsuit over claims Musk made on Twitter in August that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The SEC called those tweets ""false and misleading"" and a go-private deal never materialized.
As part of that settlement, Musk stepped down as the company's chairman and he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million each in fines.
The renewed public battle between Tesla's chief executive and the top U.S. securities regulator adds pressure on Musk, the public face of Tesla, who is struggling to make the company profitable after cutting the price of its Model 3 sedan to $35,000.
Tesla has backed off a plan to close all its U.S. stores and said it will instead raise prices of its higher-end vehicles by about 3 percent on average. 
In the filing, Musk's lawyers said his tweet was a ""proud and optimistic restatement of publicly disclosed information.""
Musk corrected his tweet four hours later to say that the ""annualized production rate"" at year-end 2019 would probably be about 500,000, with deliveries expected to be about 400,000.
Moreover, Musk has exhibited self-censorship in dramatically reducing the volume of tweets since the settlement, they wrote, adding that the SEC's request, if granted, would raise free speech issues. 
""This self-censorship is reflective of his commitment to adhering to the Order and avoiding unnecessary disputes with the SEC,"" they wrote in the filing. 
Musk called the regulator the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission"" on Twitter after the settlement, and tweeted that ""something is broken with SEC oversight"" just one day after the agency started pursuing the contempt order. 
Legal experts have said the SEC could now pursue multiple avenues, including a higher fine, imposing further restrictions on Musk's activities or removing him from Tesla's board or helm. 
Tesla published a new communications policy in December for senior executives as part of the settlement. It called for Tesla's general counsel and a newly designated in-house securities law attorney to pre-approve any written statements about Tesla that could be material. 

A disclosure controls committee, made up of board members Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and James Murdoch, was tasked with overseeing compliance with the new policy.

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 07:50PM ET</span>",Satellites and shoe-leather: How investors get beyond China's dubious data,"By Daniel Leussink, Swati Pandey and Trevor Hunnicutt
TOKYO/SYDNEY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When TAL Education Group, a mid-sized tutoring services firm in China, reported a three-fold increase in its 2018 third-quarter net income earlier this year, few people made much of it.
Rather, investors fretted over a weak performance in China from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) - a classic yardstick for measuring demand and the health of the world's second-largest economy.
For Brendan Ahern, the New York-based chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors, TAL's results showed that, while China may be showing signs of pain from a long-running U.S.-Sino trade war, parts of its economy are still doing well.
""With some study of China, you can get results that are very contrary to this view of China as one entity,"" said Ahern. 
Ahern is not alone. Foreign investors keen to get a grasp of China's economy have for years distrusted official data. 
Many have models built on inputs such as auto sales or air traffic and even indicators such as commentary from food and beauty firms.
""Many people look for alternative data sources in China as proxies for growth, rather than the just the official figures,"" said Ross Hutchison, a fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh. ""I find it helpful to consider 'micro' stories, where you can get a better sense of actual activity.""
In 2018, even as the trade war sapped exports and investment at home, China's official GDP growth was 6.6 percent - as always, unerringly within official targets. 
That was a 28-year low for China, but still almost double the global average of 3.7 percent.
""There are always questions about it and there are always doubts raised about it,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
""U.S. investors for the most part put a little haircut on it. If the number is X, they suspect the real number is X minus something, and then it is more about trying to identify the trend of numbers rather than the absolute levels."" 
What's more, for an economy that exceeds $10 trillion and a population of nearly 1.4 billion, analysts says China's economic statistics are released too swiftly for investors to have faith in their accuracy, leading them to read the economic tea leaves elsewhere.
China's National Bureau of Statistics did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
FAKES, FILTERS 
Around the same time that Apple's disappointing iPhone sales were making investors nervous about China, Aberdeen's Hutchison was looking at athletic apparel firm  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) Inc's estimate-beating results and double-digit sales growth in China.
""To me, it suggests that the worries around Apple are not a canary in the coalmine for faltering Chinese growth, but that increasingly expensive iPhones just aren't as cool as they used to be,"" said Hutchison.
Peter Bye, a portfolio manager on the U.S. equity team at UBS Asset Management, agrees some filtering of data is needed. 
Bye cites the example of the 2013 crackdown by Chinese authorities on gift-giving by officials, which skewed demand for luxury brands.
""Therefore, China growth numbers out of some high-end brands again weren't that indicative of China consumer health.""
His discretionary list of data points includes travel commentary from booking platforms as well as commentary from beauty and food companies around the region pandering to Chinese travelers and customers.
For U.S. hedge fund manager Teddy Vallee, founder of Pervalle Global, the correlations between China's credit growth and other markets such as global crude and copper are material, so he looks at China's base money or M1 growth.
""The issue today is we haven't seen M1 turn higher, so it's quite difficult to be constructive until this turns,"" Vallee said. 
(GRAPHIC: Proxy economic indicators for China - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ch1a4i) 
BIRD'S EYE VIEW 
The Economist magazine's Li Keqiang index was inspired by comments from the Chinese premier a decade or so ago that the official GDP was 'man-made'. Li based his preferred measures of economic growth on bank loans, rail freight and electricity consumption.
But as China weans its economy off a reliance on manufacturing and heavy industry, analysts have found the Li Keqiang index needs additional measures. 
Unfortunately, China's modern economy, more represented by internet payment platforms and sales systems such as WeChat and Alipay, isn't yet openly sharing data on online traffic. 
Jian Shi Cortesi, an Asian equities portfolio manager at GAM Investment Management in Zurich, tracks a China Satellite Manufacturing Index, developed by San Francisco-based SpaceKnow. 
It analyses industrial facilities in China using imagery from space and algorithms measuring the level of manufacturing activity.
Qinwei Wang, a London-based senior economist at European asset manager Amundi, uses in-house models incorporating freight and passenger traffic data, floor space under construction and electricity consumption.
""These data are more independent from official GDP and headline data, of high frequency, difficult to manipulate by officials, and cover the relatively broad economy,"" said Wang.
For many analysts like Sarah Shaw, a Sydney-based global portfolio manager at 4D Infrastructure, nothing beats boots on the ground.

""If you're wandering around in Beijing and you can't get into a restaurant or you can't get on a train because they are all full, that's an indication that things are still relatively okay.""

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 07:50PM ET</span>",Olympus whistleblower Woodford wins London pensions lawsuit,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - The former CEO of Olympus, who blew the whistle on a $1.7 billion accounting scandal at the Japanese medical equipment maker in 2011, has won a London court battle over alleged wrongdoing linked to his 64-million-pound ($85-million) pension.
Olympus's British subsidiary KeyMed sued Michael Woodford and former company director Paul Hillman in 2016, alleging they breached their duties as directors and trustees of a defined benefit pension plan and conspired to maximize their pension benefits by unlawful means.
London High Court Judge Marcus Smith said on Monday he saw no evidence of dishonest or improper conduct by the company veterans and said any failings identified by KeyMed could be attributable to ""an innocent failure of process"" in a busy company.
""In these circumstances, I find that the defendants acted honestly and did not breach the duties ... dishonestly or at all,"" he said in a judgment.
Woodford, who joined KeyMed as a 20-year-old salesman in 1981 and rose through the ranks to become Olympus's first foreign chief executive in 2011, was fired two weeks into the top job after persistently querying unexplained payments. He then alerted global authorities and the media.
Olympus initially said Woodford was fired for failing to understand its management style and Japanese culture. But the company later admitted it had used improper accounting to conceal investment losses and restated years of financial results. In September 2012, the company and three former executives pleaded guilty in Japan to cover-up charges.
Woodford and Hillman, described in the judgment as Woodford's ""right-hand man"" who also left the company in 2011 after a 33-year career, said in a joint statement that they felt completely vindicated.
KeyMed, a surgical products maker in southern England, said it was disappointed and considering its legal options.
""When KeyMed discovered that Mr Woodford was entitled to a pension transfer of over 64 million pounds, we had a duty to our stakeholders to investigate the circumstances in which such a large entitlement had arisen,"" it said in a statement. 
Woodford has said his annual pension benefit rose to 993,000 pounds at the end of his 30-year Olympus career. This was converted into a capital sum of 64.5 million pounds and transferred to a Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP), a UK government-approved scheme, with Olympus's approval in 2014.
Olympus’s European headquarters in Germany did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment sent after hours.

Brazil's government will auction 12 licenses to operate regional airports. The first block involves six airports in the northeastern region. The second one has two airports in the southeastern region and the third four licenses to operate airports in the center-west region. 
""We expect competition for all the three blocks,"" Vasconcelos said. The most attractive block is in the northeastern region, for the airports in tourist destinations Recife, Maceio, Joao Pessoa, Aracaju, Campina Grande and Juazeiro do Norte, which receive around 12 million passengers a year.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 06:34PM ET</span>","Boeing shares, vanguard of the Dow, hit hard after second 737 MAX crash","By Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co shares tumbled more than 5 percent on Monday after China, Indonesia and Ethiopia ordered airlines to ground the aircraft maker's best-selling line of jets after the second deadly crash of one of the planes in just five months.
While the slide lopped off $12.7 billion in the market value of one of the 10-year bull market's powerhouse stocks, the one-day loss was far more limited by the closing bell than earlier in the session as some investors bet long-term risks were limited.
Dropping in the early moments of trading by the most since Wall Street reopened after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, the stock recouped nearly two-thirds of its losses on the heaviest trading volume in nearly six years.
""Despite the immense tragedy we think the company will fix what we believe is largely a software and training issue,"" said Nancy Tengler, chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management, which counts Boeing among its largest holdings.
The volatility followed Sunday's crash of a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines just minutes after takeoff from the country's capital Addis Ababa, killing all 157 on board. The same model, flown by Lion Air, crashed off the coast of Indonesia in October, killing all 189 on board.
The single-aisle 737, the world's most-sold commercial aircraft, is central to Boeing's future. The MAX line is the fastest-selling jetliner in the company's history with more than 5,000 orders booked and a backlog valued at nearly $500 billion at list prices.
The 5.3 percent drop in share price on Monday wiped nearly $13 billion off Boeing's market value - an abrupt reversal for a stock that had been the runaway top performer so far this year on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
With a stock price of about $400 a share, it was by far the largest drag on the price-weighted, blue-chip index on Monday, shaving more than 150 points off the Dow's advance.
It was unclear whether the accident would pose a long-term risk to a stock that has delivered the richest total return among the 30 stocks in the Dow over the 10 years of the current bull market. 
Since U.S. stocks began rebounding from the 2007-09 financial crisis in March 2009, Boeing shares have delivered a total return - including reinvested dividends - of nearly 1,600 percent, or four times the performance of the full index.
Boeing's shares shed 12 percent in the weeks following the Lion Air crash last year, but have since more than recouped those declines. 
(GRAPHIC: Boeing shares hit after Ethiopia jet crash - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ca96E7) 
Spreads on Boeing's bonds, a measure of the added compensation investors demand for owning its debt, were also broadly wider, data from Refinitiv showed. Its credit default swaps, a form of insurance against a Boeing default, rose sharply in price, according to IHS Markit. 
The company has about $13.8 billion of bonds issued. 
Boeing said on Monday the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash is in its early stages and there was no need to issue new guidance to operators of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft based on the information it has so far. 
In an email seen by Reuters, Boeing's chief executive told employees on Monday he was confident in the safety of the U.S. manufacturer's 737 MAX aircraft in the wake of two deadly crashes since October.
Wall Street has been overwhelmingly bullish on Boeing - 19 of the 24 brokerages covering the stock rate it ""buy"" or higher, while five have a ""hold"" rating. No brokerage has had a sell rating on the stock since July 2017.
Even with Monday's drop, it remained the Dow's best performer so far this year with a gain of 24 percent compared with 10 percent for the full index. 
BUYING OPPORTUNITY
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani said there would be concerns about safety, production, groundings and costs, but that those should all be manageable longer term.
He said the bank's positive ""overweight"" recommendation on Boeing shares was not changing, and that any corrective action the jetmaker has to take on its best-selling passenger plane will likely prove a longer-term buying opportunity.
Investigators have found the black box from the fatal crash with both the cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data, Ethiopian state TV reported on Monday, which should shed light on the cause of the crash.
Earlier in the day, China's aviation regulator grounded nearly 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by its airlines after the crash.
Shares of Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co - the biggest operator of the MAX 8 - fell 0.3 percent, while American Airlines Group Inc, which has 24 MAX 8 jets, gained 0.4 percent.
Southwest and American said overnight they remained fully confident in the aircraft and were closely monitoring the investigation.
The 737 MAX 8 uses LEAP-1B engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA. Safran shares fell 1.7 percent on Monday, but GE rose 3.3 percent.
Boeing delivered 806 aircraft last year, missing its target by four jets, but still retaining the title of the world's biggest planemaker for the seventh straight year. European rival Airbus SE delivered 800 planes in 2018.
Shares of Boeing's European rival Airbus rose 1.3 percent in Paris.

The potential sales from a television service have become a focus of investors after Apple in January reported the first-ever dip in iPhone sales during the key holiday shopping period and said it would lower iPhone prices in some markets to account for foreign exchange rates. 
Apple is also in discussions with HBO, part of AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc-owned WarnerMedia, to become part of the service and it could yet make it in time for the launch, according to a person familiar with the matter.
While there is a chance Apple will update its iPads or Apple TV devices later this month, the event is likely to be Apple's first major media event in which hardware is not the primary focus, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies.
That is a big shift for Apple, which earlier this year moved to make its Apple Music services work on smart speakers from rivals such as Amazon and partnered with Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd to let Samsung television owners watch video purchased from Apple on Samsung sets.

""I don't look at that as saying Apple has given up on the (Apple smart speaker) HomePod or the Apple TV - those will be the products where Apple Music or an Apple movie experience work the best,"" Bajarin said. ""But Apple is smart to not limit the places people can consume their services.""

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 05:55PM ET</span>",Amazon domain battle rages on as internet overseer postpones decision,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil on Monday thanked the global body that oversees Internet addresses for extending until April a deadline for Amazon basin nations to reach a deal with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in their seven-year battle over the .amazon domain name.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) meeting this week in Kobe, Japan, decided to put off a decision that was expected to favor use of the domain by the world's largest online retailer.
Amazon basin countries Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname have fought the domain request since it was made in 2012, arguing that the name refers to their geographic region and thus belongs to them.
ICANN has agreed to put off a decision until after April 21, Brazil's foreign ministry said in a statement that insisted that Amazon nations remain ""firmly opposed"" to allowing the company to have exclusive use of the domain name.
""In our view, due to its inseparable semantic link to Amazonia, this domain should by no means become the monopoly of one company,"" the ministry said.
The statement said Brazil and its seven Amazon partners will continue to negotiate in good faith with Amazon.com to try to reach a ""mutually acceptable solution"" to the domain dispute. 
Amazon.com declined to comment.
ICANN placed Amazon.com's request on a ""Will not proceed"" footing in 2013, but an independent review process sought by the company faulted that decision and ICANN then told the Amazon basin nations they had to reach an agreement with the company.
In October, with little progress toward any agreement, ICANN said it would take a decision at this week's meeting in Japan, which was widely expected to favor Amazon.com.
The Amazon nations have so far not agreed to the company's offers, which have reportedly included millions of dollars in free Kindles and hosting by Amazon web services.
Amazon nations should be able to share in the management and use of the domain, to defend the region's cultural heritage, foster economic growth and the digital inclusion of the people who live in the region, Brazil's statement said.

Brazil hopes Amazon.com will ""show a high sense of public responsibility and political and cultural sensibility,"" it said.

1336,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 05:54PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. CPI, core CPI Expected to Rise 0.2%
Retail inflation data headlines the economic calendar tomorrow.
The Labor Department will release the consumer price index (CPI) for February at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that the CPI rose 0.2% last month and that the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices also rose 0.2%.
That would bring the CPI to a 1.6% gain year over year, with the core CPI’s annual gain at 2.2%, hotter than the Fed’s 2% inflation target.
2. Dick’s Sporting Goods Headlines Earnings
Sporting goods retailer Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) reports ahead of trading tomorrow and is expected to report earnings of $1.06 a share for the fourth quarter, according to analysts polled by Investing.com, down from $1.22 a year ago. Revenue is forecast at $2.48 billion, down from $2.66 billion in 2918.
Northern Oil & Gas (NYSE:NOG) is forecast to earn $0.14 a share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $156.9 million. A year ago, earnings were 1 cent a share on revenue of $72.48 million.
Tidewater (NYSE:TDW), the offshore boat company that ferries supplies to and from offshore platforms and drilling rigs, is expected to earn 22 cents a share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $134.5 million. That would be from a loss of 20 cents on revenue of $104.45 million a year ago.
Quorum Health (NYSE:QHC) is expected to report a loss of 28 cents a share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $474.27 million. A year ago, the operator of hospitals and outpatient clinics reported 4 cents a share in earning while revenue was $518.08 million.
And Pacific Ethanol (NASDAQ:PEIX) is expected to report a loss of 33 cents a share on revenue of $372.74 million. A year ago, the operator of eight ethanol production plants in the Midwest and West lost 32 cents a share on revenue of $395.27 million.
3. API Inventories Coming
The weekly petroleum update from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday, is expected to be closely watched after data last week showed a surge in crude inventories.
The API reported crude oil stockpiles rose by 7.290 million barrels for the week ended March 1.
Crude oil futures gained 1.3% to settle at $56.59 a barrel today as Saudi Arabia reportedly signaled its intention to deepen production cuts to avert a glut in global supplies.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the country was unlikely to halt output cuts before June. The upbeat remarks arrived after Bloomberg reported that an official said the Kingdom would extend output cuts into April.
Geopolitics has been ""casting a shadow"" over oil markets, a trend that may continue for several years, said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston.
The U.S. shale revolution saw U.S. oil demand surge to 500,000 bpd, the highest of all countries, Birol added. This should be a ""heads up"" warning for other global oil exporters that “now is very much the time for them to diversify their economic base.”"
1337,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 05:36PM ET</span>",Insurers face large claims after second Boeing 737 MAX crash,"By Noor Zainab Hussain, Carolyn Cohn and Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's insurers face big claims from families of the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, coming less than six months after the crash of the same type of Boeing aircraft in Indonesia, insurance and aviation sources said.
An Ethiopian Airlines passenger jet bound for Nairobi crashed minutes after take-off on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board, raising questions about the safety of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, a new model that also crashed in Indonesia in October.
While the initial insurance payments will be made by Ethiopian Airlines' insurers, they may look to recoup their money from Boeing's insurers if they can prove that the aircraft was faulty, the sources said.
Initial payments to the passengers' families are bound by the Warsaw and Montreal conventions, but those payouts could be much higher if families pursue legal claims, particularly through U.S. courts, said Clive Garner, head of law firm Irwin Mitchell's travel litigation group in London. 
""If there were to be anything defective in terms of the plane or any of its components, then it would be possible to bring a claim against the manufacturer as well as the airline,"" he added.
Insurers typically form a consortium to share the risks of large claims, with the lead insurer taking a larger proportion of the risk. The insured value of the plane itself was likely around $50 million, according to industry sources.
Willis Towers Watson was the insurance broker for Ethiopian Airlines, while Chubb (NYSE:CB) was the lead insurer, a Willis spokeswoman said on Monday. A Chubb spokesman declined to comment. 
Britain's Global Aerospace was the lead insurer for Boeing and also for Lion Air, which operated the plane that crashed in October, said Global Aerospace Chief Executive Nick Brown.
Marsh was Boeing's insurance broker, two sources told Reuters. None of the sources gave financial details of the policies. 
Boeing shares fell 5.6 percent on Monday.
U.S. LAWSUITS POSSIBLE 
Boeing self-insures an initial layer of coverage before the Global Aerospace coverage kicks in, said Justin Green, a New York-based aviation lawyer who has represented families in cases against Boeing. Boeing declined comment on its insurance cover. 
It is not uncommon for the planemaker, which is headquartered in Chicago, to face lawsuits in the United States, where legal compensation payments for the crash victims could run around $2 million to $3 million per person, depending on the law applied, compared to about $200,000 in Ethiopia, said Green.
U.S. courts often throw out such lawsuits, given the difficulty of finding witnesses overseas, but the fact that eight U.S. citizens were killed in the Ethiopian Airlines crash increases the likelihood that litigation on behalf of all victims' families could be heard by a U.S. court, Green said.
Initial compensation costs for all 157 passengers who died on the flight could be around $25 million, according to Reuters calculations based on the terms of the Montreal convention.

The Montreal convention provides for a maximum of 113,100 special drawing rights, currently worth $1.39, for death or injury of each passenger, although not all countries are joined up to the convention.

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 05:10PM ET</span>",French prosecutors probing ex-Renault boss Ghosn's wedding costs: reports,"PARIS (Reuters) - French prosecutors have opened a preliminary inquiry into how former  Renault  (PA:RENA) chief Carlos Ghosn financed his 2016 wedding, the Figaro newspaper and Agence France-Presse said on Monday.
The French carmaker said last month it had found evidence, following an internal probe, that it had footed some of the bill. It established in its own investigation that a 2016 Renault sponsorship deal with the Chateau de Versailles outside Paris included a 50,000 euro ($56,000) personal benefit to Ghosn, and said it would alert prosecutors. 
The prosecutor's office in Nanterre near Paris, which the reports said was handling the investigation, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Ghosn was ousted as the head of Nissan and later removed as Renault CEO after his arrest in Japan last November over allegations of financial misconduct linked to his salary. He was released on a $9 million bail only last week.
In the wake of the scandal, Renault began its own review of payments to Ghosn. 
The former executive has denied any wrongdoing associated with the wedding. 
""The event space at Versailles was made available to him without charge, and Mr Ghosn was unaware that the use of the space would be charged against Renault's allotted usage,"" his French-based lawyer Jean-Yves Leborgne said in February when the allegations came to light, adding that Ghosn had paid for all of his wedding expenses. 
Renault declined to comment on Monday. 
The carmaker had agreed before the wedding to sponsor 2.3 million euros of renovations at the historic Versailles palace in return for a credit granting it services from the chateau worth 25 percent of that amount, or 575,000 euros, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
The rental fee was deducted from Renault's credit for use of the Grand Trianon building at Versailles on Oct. 8, 2016, when Ghosn and his second wife, Carole, hosted their wedding reception, the source said. 
The event had already attracted public attention for its opulence and Marie Antoinette-themed costumes.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.79%. The S&P 500 added 1.47%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.02%.
The Dow fell more than 242 points early in Monday's trading, then reversed itself in a swing of more than 400 points to finish ahead by 201 points. Tech stocks rallied, led by a rise in Facebook and Apple as analysts upgraded their outlooks on both companies.
Bank of America upgraded its rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $180, arguing expectations for a decline in the tech giant's hardware sales are somewhat overly negative. Apple's share price rose 3.5%.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) closed 1.5% higher after Nomura Instinet upgraded its rating on the social media stock to buy from neutral and raised its price target to $215 from $172.
The firm said its concerns over engagement trends at core Facebook have ""eased,"" as users were transitioning to the company’s Stories feature faster than it had anticipated.
The broader tech market was also supported by a rally in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after the chipmaker agreed to buy Isreal's Mellanox Technologies (NASDAQ:MLNX) for $6.9 billion.
The deal requires Chinese regulatory approval as the country accounted for 24% of Mellanox’s $1.1 billion of revenue in 2018. If the deal is approved, it could pave the way for more deals in the semiconductor industry as companies have held back after China failed to approve Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) planned $44 billion purchase of  NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ:NXPI).
In industrials, Boeing (NYSE:BA) pared steep early losses to end the day down 5.3%. It had been down more than 11% intraday.  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) clawed back some losses from last week.
Boeing came under pressure in early trade after several airlines grounded the company's new 737 Max 8 passenger jet following a deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash. It was the second crash in five months involving a Boeing 737 Max 8.
GE rose 3.3% after analysts at Citigroup delivered an upbeat assessment of the company's turnaround program.
""(R)ecent actions (including the close of the sale of GE Transportation to Wabtec and the announced agreement to sell GE Healthcare's BioPharma unit to DHR for $21.4 billion) buy GE some time to execute its turnaround in a deliberate/orderly manner,"" Citi said in a note.
On the trade front, meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said a date for a trade summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping has not been set and negotiations are ongoing.
In other corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose 2.4% after the company walked back plans, announced in late February, to close nearly all of its retail stores and sell its cars online only. The company said it would reduce its 378 stores by about 50%.
On the economic front, investors digested mixed U.S. retail sales data showing an unexpected rise in January, but a downward revision to December's already sharp decline.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Monday as the technology sector led a broad-based rebound following five straight sessions of losses, but a fall in Boeing's shares limited the Dow's advance after a deadly airline crash in Ethiopia.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, the world's largest planemaker and best-performing Dow component this year by a wide margin, ended down 5.3 percent at $400.01, registering its biggest one-day percentage drop since Oct. 29, after many airlines grounded the company's new 737 MAX 8 passenger jet following the second fatal crash involving the aircraft in just five months.
The stock had its highest daily trading volume since July 2013 and ended well off its session low of $365.55, but it kept a lid on the Dow, which managed only about half the gains of the S&P 500. 
All the major S&P sectors rose, led by gains in the technology sector, which was up 2.2 percent. The industrial sector reversed early losses to end up 0.9 percent.
""After the weakness in the markets last week, things have gotten a little bit oversold,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""It was incredibly impressive when you look at what we're doing today, even with the move in Boeing,"" he said, adding that tech's rally is ""a sign of overall enthusiasm for equities and the continued bullish tone we've been in since the beginning of the year, last week notwithstanding."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 200.64 points, or 0.79 percent, to 25,650.88, the S&P 500 gained 40.23 points, or 1.47 percent, to 2,783.3 and the Nasdaq Composite added 149.92 points, or 2.02 percent, to 7,558.06.
The S&P 500 last week registered its biggest decline since the end of 2018 after tepid job and other economic data, but the index is up about 11 percent for the year so far.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 3.5 percent after Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) upgraded the iPhone maker's shares to ""buy."" Also, Apple invited media to a March 25 event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, California. 
Sources previously told Reuters that Apple is targeting April for the launch of a streaming television service that will likely include subscription TV service.
Chipmaker Nvidia Corp jumped after entering a $6.8 billion deal to buy Mellanox Technologies Ltd. The Israeli chip designer also rose.
In Washington, President Donald Trump told Congress to slash funding for foreign aid and the State Department and increase spending for the military and the wall he wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border in his 2020 budget, the opening move in his next funding fight with Congress.
Defense companies General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD), United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) and  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) rose on the news.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 34 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Monday it had reached a settlement with 79 investment advisers on charges of the improper sale of mutual fund shares, returning more than $125 million to clients.
The settlements are the result of an SEC initiative, created in February, encouraging advisers to self-report violations in cases where they did not adequately disclose conflicts of interest on certain mutual fund investments. Specifically, the SEC said the advisers charged had sold clients on higher-cost mutual funds when lower-cost options of the same fund were available, while receiving fees from those funds.
""An adviser’s failure to disclose these types of financial conflicts of interest harms retail investors by unfairly exposing them to fees that chip away at the value of their investments,"" Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement.
None of the firms involved in the settlements admitted or denied the SEC's findings. Under the terms of the initiative, the firms avoided financial penalties by self-reporting, so long as they agreed to compensate harmed clients and fixed their disclosures.

(Reuters) - Britain will create a new regulator to police accountants who check the books of companies in response to collapses at construction firm Carillion and retailer BHS that triggered calls for root-and-branch reform of the audit sector its supervision.
Business minister Greg Clark said on Monday a new, more powerful regulator would replace the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), criticized by lawmakers for being ""timid"" in its handling of accountants and too close to the ""Big Four"" accounting firms that dominate auditing - PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY.
""This new body will build on our status as a great place to do business and will form an important part of strengthened public trust in business and the regulations that govern them,"" Clark said in a statement.
He was responding to recommendations from an independent review by John Kingman to scrap what it called the ""creaky"" FRC and create a new Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA).
Clark, who published a consultation paper on implementing the Kingman review on Monday, said the setting up of new leadership at the top of the FRC, which will transition into the new authority, would begin shortly with the recruitment process for chair and deputy chair.
The new watchdog will for the first time have powers to make direct changes to accounts rather than apply to a court to do so. It will have duties to protect the interests of customers and the public, and regulate the biggest audit firms directly.
There will also be tougher sanctions in cases of corporate failure, including powers to require ""rapid explanations"" from companies and in the most serious cases, publish a report about the company's conduct and management.
The Investment Association, which represents asset manager that invest in companies, said it was vital the new regulator was established as soon as possible and properly reflected the voice of investors.
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed shaking up the audit market by requiring the top 350 listed companies in Britain to have two auditors, one of them not from among the Big Four, in order to improve standards. 

Legislation will be needed to implement some of the Kingman and CMA reforms, and Clark is due to be quizzed by lawmakers on Wednesday on when he proposes bringing a draft law before a parliament clogged with business related to Britain's departure from the European Union.

During a speech marking the first 100 days of his administration, Lopez Obrador conceded that economic expansion remains slow but reiterated his goal of reaching 4 percent growth. 
""The economy is coming along, fortunately, though growth has been modest,"" he said. ""But there is no hint of a recession.""
Mexican economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter of 2018 as manufacturing, mining and construction shrank, and growth for the full year clocked in at 2 percent, according to data published by the national statistics agency in January.
Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, said the administration is making progress on its infrastructure projects. In April, the government will publish a call for tenders for the Maya Train project in southern Mexico, he said. 
He stressed that all of the projects the government is launching, which include airport renovations and a new refinery, will be completed by the end of his term.

Lopez Obrador roiled markets last year with his decision to cancel a new airport for the capital, one of the signature projects of his predecessor, former president Enrique Pena Nieto. Lopez Obrador stressed canceling the airport project was the ""best decision,"" despite the costs.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 02:12PM ET</span>",Euronext extends Oslo Bors takeover offer on same terms,"By Inti Landauro and Gwladys Fouche
PARIS/OSLO (Reuters) - European exchange group Euronext on Monday extended its offer for Oslo Bors, while keeping the terms unchanged, as its battle with Nasdaq for control of Norway's stock market operator escalates.
Euronext's offer, due to expire on March 11, is now open until April 1 at 6 pm, Central European time. The terms remain at 158 Norwegian crowns per Oslo Bors share, the price Euronext offered when it raised its bid last month.
New York-based stock market operator Nasdaq had matched Euronext's price last week. Both offers value Oslo Bors at around 6.8 billion Norwegian crowns ($782.9 million). 
The bid battle for Oslo Bors, one of the last independent stock market operators, began in December, when Euronext, which operates stock markets in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Dublin, made the first move.
The Norwegian bourse's board's response was to seek new bidders and it encouraged U.S.-based Nasdaq to make a rival offer, which was then supported by the Oslo Bors board and its largest shareholder Norwegian bank DNB. 
Paris-based Euronext had initially said it had secured the backing of slightly more than half of Oslo Bors shareholders, who had committed to sell ""irrevocably"", even in the case of a rival offer.
Oslo Bors's board continues to back Nasdaq, an Oslo Bors spokesman said on Monday. ""The extension of the offer does not change the situation. It is the same offer,"" he said.
DNB, which holds a 20 percent stake in Oslo Bors, is sticking with the Nasdaq offer, a spokesman for DNB said.
Mutual insurance group KLP, Oslo Bors' second-largest shareholder with a 10-percent stake, is also sticking with Nasdaq's offer, a spokeswoman said. 
The acquisition of Oslo Bors would diversify Euronext's revenue from shares and derivative trading into seafood derivatives as well as oil services and shipping.
Euronext plans to appoint Oslo Bors's CEO to its managing board, with responsibility for all commodities operations. It said it would also invite a leading figure from the Norwegian financial community to its board.
It has also said it would concentrate all its commodities businesses in Oslo. 
Euronext has been looking to expand but remaining opportunities are scarce as market operators either already belong to large groups or want to remain independent.
Large-scale mergers have also met opposition from competition regulators, who have blocked a planned tie-up between Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) and the London Stock Exchange.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 01:23PM ET</span>","Barrick Gold ends hostile Newmont bid, signs Nevada joint venture","By Nichola Saminather and Debroop Roy
(Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp on Monday pulled its $18 billion offer for  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM) and agreed to form a joint venture in Nevada with its rival, ending a hostile takeover bid that sought to unite the world's two largest gold producers.
By combining their operations in the southwestern U.S. state, which is home to one of the world's largest gold-producing areas, Barrick and Newmont hope to save more than $5 billion over the next 20 years. 
Toronto-based Barrick will control 61.5 percent of the venture, giving it slightly less oversight than it initially wanted even as it gains full operational control over mines that produce more than 4 million ounces of gold annually. 
The agreement comes amid a pickup in deals across the gold industry, which has struggled with a loss of investor confidence and financing constraints in recent years.
""This is one of those rare transactions that really does create demonstrable value for everyone involved,"" Barrick Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow told Reuters on Monday. ""It shows that people, if you put your mind to it, can deliver transactions in a very short while.""
Shares of Barrick were up about 0.9 percent at $13.05 on the New York Stock Exchange and up 1.1 percent at C$17.53 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading. Newmont shares were down 2.3 percent to $32.92 in New York. 
Colorado-based Newmont rejected Barrick's all-stock zero-premium hostile takeover, which was launched last month, and proposed instead the Nevada joint venture, which both companies have tried to form for years.
The deal seems to wash away, for now, vestiges of a long-simmering feud between the companies. Bristow, on the same day Barrick launched its bid, called Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg a ""loser"" in a Reuters interview. 
Goldberg, for his part, had told Reuters that Bristow's ""credibility and experience"" and performance at Randgold (LON:RRS), which Bristow had led until two months ago when it was acquired by Barrick, was ""anemic.""
Yet both men flew to Nevada on Monday to announce the deal, a step designed to underscore collaboration. Even the companies' social media accounts played nice: Barrick's Twitter profile ""liked"" Newmont's announcement of the Nevada JV.
As part of Monday's agreement, Barrick will also withdraw several shareholder proposals for Newmont's annual meeting later this year.
""Through this joint venture, the whole is going to be worth a lot more than the sum of its parts,"" said Newmont Chief Operating Officer Tom Palmer, who will take over as CEO when Goldberg retires at the end of 2019. 
Newmont and Barrick share many investors, and some had been unenthusiastic about the hostile takeover bid.
The VanEck International Investors Gold Fund, the largest Barrick shareholder and one of the top three in Newmont, urged the companies last week to focus on the Nevada venture and expressed skepticism about a full takeover of Newmont.
BACK TO THE TABLE 
Newmont can now move forward on its own planned takeover of Canada's Goldcorp Inc, a deal that will help it leapfrog Barrick to become the world's largest gold producer. 
Barrick and Newmont had discussed a 50-50 joint venture in Nevada late last year but could not agree on who would control it, according to sources familiar with the matter. Newmont then turned its attention to the Goldcorp deal, and in the eyes of Barrick executives, put off the Nevada talks for months, sources said.
    Barrick's hostile offer brought Newmont executives back to the table. The joint venture Newmont proposed early this month, in which it would control 45 percent and Barrick 55 percent, was a starting point for renewed talks that were serious for the first time in decades. Bristow responded in press interviews that he wanted closer to 66 percent control. 
Now focused on the joint venture, Goldberg and Bristow met in New York last Tuesday, and again in Toronto two days later, sources said. The companies' boards agreed to the deal over the weekend, and both management teams traveled to Elko, Nevada, for Monday's announcement. 

The deal will lead to cuts at the oversight level but not in operations, although the number of reductions is yet to be determined, Bristow said.

1356,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",Trump Budget Sees $1 Trillion Deficits for Next Four Years,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s newest budget forecasts the U.S. fiscal deficit surpassing $1 trillion this year and staying above that level until 2022.
The fiscal 2020 proposal sees the deficit expanding to $1.1 trillion for 2019 and 2020, when Trump will run for re-election. The shortfall is seen narrowing slightly to $1.07 trillion in 2021 and $1.05 trillion in 2022, before shrinking every year through 2029.
The budget deficit has already climbed 77 percent in the first four months of the current fiscal year through September, according to Treasury Department data.
Growing budget deficits would run contrary to the narrative put forth by the Trump administration that a package of tax cuts that took force last year will pay for themselves through faster economic growth. The White House budget blueprint is sure to hit a wall of opposition from Democrats and encounter resistance from Republicans as well.
The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan arm of Congress, in January pushed out its projections for the deficit to top $1 trillion until 2022 from an earlier expectation of 2020 amid lower disaster relief spending. That report projected muted economic gains in coming years, partly because of the fading impact of tax cuts and higher spending.
Trump’s first budget blueprint shortly after he took office envisioned far less red ink. That budget saw the deficit dropping to $442 billion in fiscal 2022.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 01:18PM ET</span>",Levi Strauss looks to deepen pockets with IPO,"By Diptendu Lahiri
(Reuters) - Levi Strauss & Co hopes to sell $587 million worth of shares in an upcoming return to the stock market after three decades, which would value the inventor of blue jeans at $6.17 billion and give it a potful of cash to invest in broadening its product range.
The company, which has 385.5 million shares outstanding, said it expects to offer 36.7 million shares priced between $14 and $16 per share in an initial public offering. 
""The valuation is fair and as expected. It is also a good time for Levi's to go public due to the resurgence of 80s' blue jeans fashion,"" said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of California-based private equity firm Patriarch Organization.
Schiffer, who picks up stakes in new ventures, said he was interested in grabbing a share of Levi's when it goes public.
Demand for denim is surging, driven by new styles such as high-waist and pinstriped jeans. Smaller rivals  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) and Abercrombie & Fitch last week posted strong results, boosted by robust denim sales.
The 165-year-old company, however, aims to evolve into a full-fledged global lifestyle leader for both men and women.
To attract young customers, Levi's also plans to expand its tailor shop and print bar that allow consumers to customize and put their own designs on the company's branded jeans and T-shirts.
Levi Strauss, which also sells footwear, belts and wallets, reported annual net revenue of $5.6 billion in 2018.
The descendants of founder Levi Strauss, the Hass family, will retain 80 percent of voting control in the company following the IPO, the filing showed.
Levi Strauss joins a list of high-profile firms filing to go public this year, such as ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies and Lyft, photo-posting app Pinterest and home-renting service provider Airbnb. (https://reut.rs/2HiQaaP)
Compared to tech unicorns such as Uber and Airbnb, investors see Levi Strauss as more of a short-term play due to frequently changing trends in the fashion industry, Schiffer said. 
Levi Strauss intends to list as ""LEVI"" on the New York Stock Exchange, according to the filing.
The company said it plans to use the proceeds for future deals that will enhance its portfolio of brands, but has no immediate plans of any acquisitions.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), J.P.Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are part of a 12-member underwriting team handling the IPO.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 01:07PM ET</span>","After Ethiopia crash horror, some nations ground Boeing 737 MAX 8s","By Aaron Maasho and Duncan Miriri
GARA-BOKKA, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Investigators in Ethiopia found two black box recorders on Monday that will help piece together the final moments of an Ethiopian Airlines plane before it plunged, trailing smoke and debris, and crashed killing 157 people.
China and Indonesia grounded their fleets of Boeing's 737 MAX 8 aircraft on Monday, although most major airlines continued to fly the plane.
The disaster came just months after a jet of the same model came down in Indonesia killing 189 people, and prompted a global aviation safety scare.
The Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 plunged into farmland minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa for Nairobi on Sunday.
""The plane was very close to the ground and it made a turn. We looked and saw papers falling off the plane,"" Malka Galato, the farmer whose land the plane crashed on, told Reuters.
""Cows that were grazing in the fields ran in panic ... There was smoke and sparks coming from the back of the plane.""
The plane tried to climb but failed, then swerved sharply trailing white smoke and objects including clothes before crashing, said farmer Tamirat Abera.
The victims came from more than 30 countries, and the United Nations said they included 21 members of its staff. The UN had earlier said 22 of its staff were on board.
Investigators seeking to find the cause of the crash discovered the black box with both the cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data on Monday, Ethiopian state TV said.
Boeing's share price dropped 10 percent in early trading on Monday at the prospect that two such crashes in such a short time could reveal flaws in its new plane. 
The 737 line, which has flown for more than 50 years, is the world's best selling modern passenger aircraft and viewed as one of the industry's most reliable.
The new MAX 8 variant, with bigger engines designed to use less fuel, entered service in 2017. By the end of January this year, Boeing (NYSE:BA) had delivered 350 of the new jets to customers, with another 4,661 on order, and they could become the workhorses for airlines around the globe for decades.
Boeing's stock price fall, if maintained through normal trading hours, would be its biggest in nearly two decades, halting a surge that has seen it triple in value in just over three years to a record high of $446 last week.
INTERNATIONAL ALERT 
Various worried nations took swift action after the crash.
Ethiopian Airlines, which has four other 737 MAX 8 jets, said it was grounding them as a precaution. China also ordered its airlines to suspend their 737 MAX 8 jets by 6 p.m. 
Noting that the accidents involving newly delivered planes had both taken place shortly after take-off, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said it would notify airlines when they could resume flying the jets, after contacting Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
China has been asserting its independence as a safety regulator as it negotiates mutual safety standard recognition with regulators in the United States and Europe, Western industry sources say. 
The crash may scupper a potential commitment by China to buy more Boeing-made aircraft as part of a deal being negotiated to end a months-long trade war between China and the United States. 
Indonesia, where a Lion Air 737 MAX 8 went down in October, said it would temporarily ground the model for inspection.
Cayman Airways grounded both of its new 737 MAX 8 jets temporarily, while India announced a safety review. South Africa's Comair also grounded its 737 MAX 8.
MOURNING
At the crash site, local villagers watched men in Red Cross jackets and masks picked through a large crater, stacking clothes in a heap and wrapping corpses in white body bags.
The smell of jet fuel mixed with burned flesh hung in the air. Another heap contained twisted green-and-yellow metal from the fuselage. A lone engine with dents around the edges and several damaged tires lay nearby.
The dead included aid workers, doctors, professors of literature and botany, a law student, a newly wed woman, a father soon expecting a child, and a couple who just had a baby.
In Nairobi, a major hub for aid workers and diplomats, a summit opened with a moment of silence and tears for the U.N. members killed. In New York, the 15-member U.N. Security Council also stood to remember the dead.
""Our colleagues were women and men - junior professionals and seasoned officials - hailing from all corners of the globe,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. ""They all had one thing in common - a spirit to serve the people of the world.""
Ethiopian Airlines said its pilot Yared Getachew, a dual Ethiopian-Kenyan national, had a ""commendable record"" and more than 8,000 hours of flying experience.
The airplane, received in November 2018, had flown more than 1,200 hours, and it had returned from Johannesburg earlier on Sunday, Chief Executive Tewolde GebreMariam said.
The flight had unstable vertical speed after take-off, the flight tracking website Flightradar24 tweeted. The Sweden-based service said the jet climbed almost 1,000 feet after taking off from Addis Ababa, a hot and high-altitude airport whose thinner air requires extra effort from an aircraft's engines.

It dipped about 450 feet before rapidly climbing another 900 feet until the point where satellite tracking data was lost.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co Chief Executive Tim Sloan will tout the scandal-plagued bank's progress in repaying wrongly charged customers and highlight changes to its risk management in testimony to U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday, according to prepared remarks. 
Since 2016, Wells Fargo has reviewed 165 million accounts, contacted more than 40 million customers and payed out millions in compensation stemming from sales practices issues, Sloan said in an opening statement to the House Financial Services Committee that was posted on the bank's website on Monday. 
The remarks detailed other steps the bank has taken to improve its culture and interactions with customers in order to move past a series of sales practices scandals. 
But Sloan will likely face tough questions on Tuesday from House Democrats like U.S. Representatives Maxine Waters and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are seeking to ramp up oversight of big banks.
Wells Fargo's remediation efforts have also faced scrutiny from U.S. regulators who say the plans were not thorough enough. 
The bank has improved risk management controls by centralizing oversight and restructuring its board in order to prevent new problems from developing, the remarks said.
Last year, the Federal Reserve imposed a consent order on the bank, preventing it from growing its balance sheet until it proves it has improved its risk management controls. 
Sloan said the bank has thousands of employees working to satisfy the Fed's requirements and that Wells Fargo executives and board members have been meeting regularly with U.S. banking regulators to address their concerns and seek input. 

Earlier this year the bank said it expects to operate under the asset cap until the end of 2019, pushing back prior guidance by six months.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>",Foreign deposits fall in euro zone banks after money-laundering scandals,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Foreign deposits dropped in most euro zone states in the second half of 2018, after banks were hit by money-laundering scandals, European Central Bank data showed, a trend that could expose one of the bloc's weak spots in tackling financial crime.
Large holdings of foreign deposits and outsized cross-border financial flows are common features of lenders embroiled in money laundering cases, like Latvia's defunct ABLV bank and the Estonian branches of Denmark's Danske Bank and Sweden's Swedbank. All have been accused of having handled money from Russia that may be the proceeds of crime, corruption or tax evasion.
The fall in foreign deposits began in the second half of last year, the data show. That coincided with prosecutors opening a probe in July into Danske Bank for alleged money laundering at its Estonian branch, in what soon emerged as one of the biggest illicit financial operations in Europe.
Deposits in euro zone lenders from companies and individuals outside the 19-country currency bloc dwindled by more than 12 percent to 1.1 trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) in the last six months of 2018, according to the latest ECB data analyzed by Reuters, shedding more than 150 billion euros.
The fall was visible in most countries in the bloc, with some exceptions, like Luxembourg, Ireland, Finland and Portugal, where foreign deposits have increased.
While attracting funds from wealthy foreign individuals and firms is a legitimate business, anti-money laundering experts point to higher risks linked to so-called non-resident deposits because their oversight is trickier - especially when foreign funds amount to a large share of total deposits.
""A high share of non-resident deposits is an indicator of higher money-laundering risks,"" Laure Brillaud of anti-corruption group Transparency International said.
Nicolas Veron, financial affairs' expert at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank, said such a situation would warrant specific attention from supervisors.
In a bid to clean up the country's reputation after its third-largest bank, ABLV, collapsed in 2018 over money-laundering allegations, the former Latvian government last year set a 5 percent threshold for foreign deposits - which had peaked at about half of the total soon after the Baltic state joined the euro in 2014.
LUXEMBOURG 
In what seems to be an acknowledgment of these risks - or the result of a flight of suspect money in the face of greater scrutiny - the amount of foreign deposits has recently gone down in most euro zone states and accounted for 8 percent of the bloc's total deposits in December, from nearly 9 percent six months earlier.
But the situation varies widely across the euro zone. 
In the Baltic countries that have been most in the spotlight in recent months, foreign deposits are falling both in absolute terms and as a share of total deposits.
In Latvia, where the new center-right government sworn in in January has ditched the 5 percent hard threshold set by the previous administration, foreign deposits have been falling for years and now represent nearly 12 percent of the 16 billion euros in overall deposits. 
In Estonia they are also falling and amount to less than 3 percent of the total.
In Finland, where top lender Nordea faces money-laundering allegations for transactions with shell companies in the British Virgin Islands and Panama, foreign funds are instead growing and account for 7 percent of all deposits.
The country with the largest national share of foreign deposits is Luxembourg, where more than 17 percent of deposits stored at banks belong to companies or individuals with residencies outside the euro zone, giving a total of 63 billion euros, about half the amount stored in Germany, the bloc's largest economy.
In Germany and Italy, foreign deposits are well below 4 percent of the total. In France and the Netherlands their share is at 16 percent.

Those in favor of a merger say a tie-up would create a bank with an equity market value of more than 24 billion euros ($27.00 billion), based on Friday's closing share prices, and a 20 percent share of the German retail banking market.
But two of Deutsche's top shareholders are not convinced.
A merger would cost time and money, and it would in no way guarantee better returns, a person close to a top-10 Deutsche Bank shareholder said on Monday. 
""We're still against such a merger and in principle don't consider it a good idea,"" the person said.
Before a decision is made on any merger, Deutsche must present a comprehensive plan for the future of the combined entity, a person familiar with the thinking of another top-10 investor said on Sunday.
""We continue to be skeptical that a merger would make sense,"" this person said.
Deutsche and Commerzbank declined to comment on Monday.
The two banks will make a decision about whether to pursue a merger within weeks, a separate source has said.
The views of the two major investors contrast with those of U.S. investor Cerberus Capital Management, a major shareholder in both banks. A person familiar with the matter said last month that Cerberus was open to a merger, increasing the chances of a tie-up.
Shares in Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank traded higher on Monday as German business warmed to the prospect of a merger between the country's two largest banks. 
Deutsche Bank shares were 3.3 percent higher, while Commerzbank shares were up 5.6 percent higher early afternoon in Frankfurt, outperforming Germany's blue-chip DAX index which was 0.24 percent higher at 1301 GMT.
Berlin based BGA, the Federation of German wholesale, foreign trade and services, which represents large and mid-sized export businesses said a merger could make sense if it resulted in one German player surviving in the longer run.
Tougher rules and low interest rates have made it more difficult to find banks willing to provide German companies with export finance.
""It is getting harder for companies to find a partner who can provide funding,"" BGA President Holger Bingmann said.
""The business model of banks has come under pressure, and we would be glad if in the long run, to have at least one global player as a partner for our international business.""

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 09:34AM ET</span>","Tesla backtracks on store closures, plans top-end price rise","(Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc backed off its plan to close all of its U.S. stores in a blog post https://www.tesla.com/en_NZ/blog/update-tesla-stores-and-pricing?redirect=no and instead will raise prices of its high-end vehicles by about 3 percent on average, as it strives for profitability.
The company said late Sunday that it would now be closing only about half as many stores than initially planned in a widely criticized move earlier this month to cut overhead and shift its whole distribution network online.
""Over the past two weeks we have been closely evaluating every single Tesla retail location, and we have decided to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced,"" the electric carmaker said.
""As a result Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide.""
Separately, Chief Executive Officer Musk has until the end of the day on Monday to explain why he should not be held in contempt for recent tweets that U.S. securities regulators say violated a September fraud settlement.
The case is the latest major challenge by authorities to Musk's leadership as Tesla seeks to make good on his promises to Wall Street that it will soon by consistently profitable and will not need more capital.
The three percent increase on its top-end cars would be the first hike in prices after a series of cuts over the past year aimed at offsetting a reduction in green tax credits and the impact of rising tariffs overseas.
Tesla said the worldwide price increases would apply to the more expensive versions of the Model 3, Model S and Model X, and that there will be no price increase to the $35,000 Model 3.
""The 3 percent price increase announcement still indicates ... strong demand,"" said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst with Tigress Financial Partners.
The carmaker said potential buyers can place orders until March 18 at the old prices. Currently, the Model S and Model X models are priced starting at $79,000 and $88,000 before savings, respectively.
Shares of the company, among Wall Street's most volatile in recent months, were roughly flat in early trading on Monday.
Cost savings from store closing will be only about half the expected amount as the company will close only half the number of stores planned, it said. A few stores in high-visibility locations that were closed because of low throughput would be reopened with a smaller Tesla crew and would carry fewer cars in inventory.
Separately, Bloomberg reported on Monday that Tesla is in discussions with Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd on a deal for the production of rechargeable batteries for the Model 3.
In January, sources told Reuters that Tesla had signed a preliminary agreement with China's Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for its new Shanghai car factory.
The talks come as Tesla looks to localize battery cell production and push forward with the 500,000-vehicle-capacity Shanghai plant, expected to be completed in May.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",Bad loan build-up clouds emerging share market picture,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Emerging equities markets have soared this year as investor sentiment toward them rebounds, but for some the enthusiasm is being tempered by worries about surging bad loans at many banks.
Non-performing loans have shot up to a global high of close to 10 percent of gross credit exposures in India, and they are expected to edge up this year in China, Mexico, Indonesia, Russia, Turkey and Argentina, say analysts.
A gloomy outlook on the final two issued by Standard & Poor's undercuts the assumption that fallout from currency crises last year in both countries was already priced in.
For an interactive version of the below graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2EQt5cM.
As well as holding back financial sector growth and national economies, hefty levels of soured debt pose a particular risk for foreign investors, who have long favored retail lenders as picks for getting exposure to rising middle classes in emerging markets. 
EM bank lending swelled to an average of 128 percent of GDP among the BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - in 2017, from 98 percent in 2007, according to World Bank data.
But such activity is vulnerable to swings in the credit cycle, and some fund managers are growing more cautious.
Asset manager Ashmore Group is negative on banks in seven emerging countries - China, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Mexico and Russia - and positive on just Indonesia, India and Peru, said emerging markets equity portfolio manager Edward Evans.
There have been signs of policy softening by some emerging market central banks, and some commercial lenders have been cutting foreign exchange exposure and slashing risk on their balance sheet.
But broad financial conditions are tighter at the start of 2019 than they were a year ago after several interest rate rises in the United States and concerns about weaker global growth. 
Asked which banking sectors he was bearish on,  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance emerging markets corporate strategist Akbar Causer cited risks if China's economic slowdown continued.
The outlook for lenders in Turkey and Argentina was also ""not so strong"", he added.
Turkey's banks are vulnerable as the lira's depreciation and its lurch into recession - data on Monday showed the economy slumped 3.0 percent year on year at the end of 2018 - hampers borrowers' ability to meet debt obligations
S&P, in a note last month, said it expected Turkish NPLs to swell to around 6 percent this year, roughly double its earlier forecast. Official data showed it at 4 percent at the end of January.

FX DEBT RISK
High dependence on external funding is a source of risk in Turkey, South Africa, Indonesia and Mexico, said Tan Nguyen, senior research analyst at OppenheimerFunds.
Their combined external debt stands at around $1.37 trillion. That and heightened financial stress among companies based there could lead to difficulties for them repaying their debt, pushing up non-performing loans, Nguyen warned.
S&P this month took ratings action on 22 Mexican financial institutions, cutting the outlook on several to ""negative"" from ""stable"". They included  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) subsidiary Citibanamex and Banco Inbursa, controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim.
S&P added, however, that cautious lending practices would help Mexican banks avoid a sharp rise in NPLs.
Others see more immediate risks, particularly in Turkey, where the central bank last week held its base interest rate at an above-inflation 24 percent.
""The fact we have higher interest rates and a weaker currency means there's a rising probability of corporate defaults and non-performing loans,"" said Jon Harrison, managing director, emerging markets macro strategy at TS Lombard.
Even Garanti Bank, Turkey's second-largest private bank and considered one of the best-run lenders across emerging markets, had a non-performing loan rate of 5.2 percent last year, above its forecast.
In India, banks had been under pressure to clean up a $190 billion pile of soured loans. But that pressure has eased since Shaktikanta Das - seen as closely aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government - took over as central bank governor in December. 
""What that means is they avoid a short-term potential crisis by enabling banks to avoid recognizing the problem, but at the cost of slower long-term credit growth,"" said Harrison.

LONDON (Reuters) - Talk of more stimulus from China helped world share markets regain some ground on Monday after a slew of disappointing economic data and growth warnings from central banks triggered their worst weekly performance so far this year.
China's main bourses made back almost half the 4 percent they lost in Friday's mauling as the central bank chief pledged more support, but not everywhere was so spritely.
Wall Street was expected to bounce only modestly after falling every day last week and Europe managed only a 0.2 percent gain as an unexpected drop in German industrial data also kept the euro pinned near a 20-month low and Bund yields inching back towards zero. 
London's FTSE made 0.8 percent but that was partly the flip side of a near three-week low of $1.2950 for the pound as the chances of Prime Minister Theresa securing support for her Brexit deal at home this week looked increasingly dim
Britain is due to leave the EU in 18 days. Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg, said a delay to Brexit, which UK lawmakers can push for if May's deal fails this week, would be modestly positive for sterling as it would cut the near-term risk of Britain leaving without a transition period in place to minimise economic disruption.
""However, it would not completely eliminate the hard Brexit risk which could still come at the end of a delay or as a result of a second referendum,"" he added.
Norway's crown was an FX gainer after strong inflation data raised expectations that its central bank will increase interest rates again soon.
With market volatility low, investors have rushed to buy currencies where central banks are still raising rates or economic data has pointed to a brighter economic outlook.
""This makes (a) March rate hike from Norges Bank a complete done deal, which is a positive for the currency,"" Nordea strategists said.
Optimism over Norway's outlook contrasted with caution over the broader European economy after the European Central Bank last week slashed its growth forecasts and postponed its likely first rate hike.
Short euro bets, already near a 2-1/2 year high according to latest futures positioning data, are likely to receive a further boost, investors said.
The single currency shuffled sideways at $1.1247 after falling 1.2 percent last week, its biggest weekly loss in more than six months. 
BOEING DOWN 
The dollar was flat and Wall Street futures pointed to a fractionally higher restart for U.S. markets after 2019's worst week to date 
Boeing (NYSE:BA), however, tumbled nearly 10 percent in premarket trading after a host of airlines grounded the world's biggest planemaker's new 737 MAX 8 passenger jet following the second deadly crash in just five months.
Overnight, MSCI's broadest Asia-Pacific index had climbed 0.4 percent, paring a quarter of Friday's 1.6 percent fall. Japan's Nikkei gained 0.5 percent too after four consecutive sessions in the red. 
China's blue-chip CSI300 index jumped 1.9 percent after slumping 4 percent on Friday after a mix of poor trade data and a rare ""sell"" rating on a major insurer rattled some local traders. 
China's central bank on Sunday pledged further support by spurring loans and lowering borrowing costs. It came as data showed new bank loans fell a bit more than expected in February, while money supply growth also missed forecasts.
Bond markets were still trading last week's ECB change of tack and Friday's news that the U.S. economy created only 20,000 jobs in February, the weakest reading since September 2017. 
German Bund yields inched backed toward zero and the 10-year U.S. Treasury last yielded 2.64 percent, having hit a two-month low of 2.607 percent. 
At 2.47 percent, the two-year U.S. yield was close to the Fed funds rate of around 2.40 percent. Fed funds futures are now pricing in a more than 20 percent chance of a rate cut this year.
""The headline (payrolls) reading was so weak that the market could have reacted more aggressively. I would say markets reacted relatively calmly because there were elements that suggest weakness is temporary,"" said Tomoaki Shishido, fixed income strategist at Nomura Securities.
Retail sales figures for January due at 1230 GMT will be the next key focus given December's surprisingly weak reading. 
Oil was the main focus for commodity markets after Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih indicated that an end to OPEC-led supply cuts was unlikely before June. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 0.5 percent to $56.35 per barrel. Brent futures went up 0.4 percent to $62.98 a barrel. 
Gold eased about 0.1 percent to $1,296.62 per ounce, after briefly breaching $1,300 for the first time since March 1 in the previous session.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 08:41AM ET</span>",British lenders launch joint branches after closure backlash,"LONDON (Reuters) - Three of Britain's biggest banks have agreed to open jointly-owned branches offering basic services to businesses, following a public backlash to deep cuts to their own branch networks.
Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS), Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said they would pilot six so-called 'Business Banking Hubs' for their customers across the country.
The hubs will offer extended opening hours but much more limited services - specifically the ability to pay in large volumes of coins, notes and checks and exchange cash - than their regular branches.
Banks have faced criticism over branch closures with the Banking Standards Board saying in November they were damaging small businesses, while campaigners say they disadvantage vulnerable people less able to use online banking services.
A spokesman for NatWest, the biggest unit of RBS, said the joint branches would be staffed during the initial pilot to ensure self-service units were operating correctly, before a final decision is made on the project.
The initiative is unusual as ownership is split three ways and the branches will not carry the brands of any of the three banks. They will be run by cash management vendors  G4S  (CO:G4S) and Vaultex.
The modest initial roll-out of business hubs is dwarfed by the number of bank branches closed in Britain in recent years, which has prompted widespread criticism of big banks by lawmakers, businesses and consumer groups. 
Britain has lost nearly two thirds of its bank and building society branches over 30 years, with the number falling to just over 7,500 last year, down from 20,500 in 1988, according to research by consumer campaign group Which? in November.
The first Business Banking Hub opened on Monday in Birmingham, with further hubs to open in Manchester, Crosby, London, Leicestershire and Bristol in the coming weeks.
""These business banking hubs mark a welcome step forward, and hopefully are a sign of things to come,"" said Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses. 
""While the initial raft are largely being opened in urban locations, we look forward to working with lenders on how such hubs can be set-up in the rural areas that need them most.""
Previously major banks tried to plug the gap by offering banking services through Post Office branches or via mobile banking vans.
""We have listened to what our business customers really want from our cash services... we are creating an infrastructure that allows small business owners and entrepreneurs to do what they do best - run their business,"" said Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest.

1381,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>","In fresh blow to Monsanto, India cuts GM cotton seed royalty","By Mayank Bhardwaj
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has cut the royalties that local seed companies pay to German drugmaker Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit for the third time in four years. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has decided to reduce royalties paid by Indian seed companies to Monsanto for its genetically modified (GM) cotton by 49 percent to 20 rupees for a packet of 450 grams, according to a farm ministry order. Before it was 39 rupees.
The decision could prompt Monsanto and other foreign seed companies to further scale back investment in the sector, said Ram Kaundinya, director general of the Federation of Seed Industry of India.
The decision comes at a time when India's cotton output is falling and needs a breakthrough to help maintain its leading position in the global cotton market, said Kaundinya.
New Delhi's cotton output is likely to fall to 32.8 million bales of 170 kg each in the year to September 2019 - the lowest in nine years, triggering higher imports of the fiber, according to industry group Cotton Association of India.
""The order is most disappointing,"" said Shivendra Bajaj, executive director of the alliance for Agri Innovation, an advocacy group.
Other than cutting Monsanto's royalties, the government raised the prices of GM cotton seeds by 1.43 percent to 710 rupees ($10.16) a packet.
New Delhi approved Monsanto's GM cotton seed trait, the only lab-altered crop allowed in India, in 2003 and an upgraded variety in 2006, helping transform the country into the world's top producer and second-largest exporter of the fiber.
Monsanto's GM cotton seed technology went on to dominate 90 percent of India's cotton acreage.
However, Monsanto became embroiled in a dispute with Indian seed company Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd (NSL), which argued that India's Patent Act did not allow Monsanto any patent cover for its GM cotton. Monsanto and NSL are engaged in a maze of arbitration proceedings and legal cases.
Last month Reuters reported that Monsanto has won proceedings against NSL in a royalty dispute.
The farm ministry first cut Monsanto's royalties in 2016, triggering a long-running feud that prompted the U.S. ambassador to India at the time, Richard Verma, to approach Modi's office.
Hindu nationalist groups close to Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party have opposed both Monsanto and GM technology in India's agriculture. (https://reut.rs/2p7eIrE)

LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has appointed James Robertson and Peter Luck as co-heads of UK investment banking as part of its push to win business from large corporate clients in Britain.
These latest appointments show the U.S. bank's commitment to build up its business in the country despite Brexit. 
The newly created roles, detailed in a memo seen by Reuters, follow departures from the bank in the past few months, including that of Bank of America's head of global investment banking Diego De Giorgi and his boss Christian Meissner.
The Wall Street bank appointed Matthew Koder last year to succeed Meissner and revitalize its corporate and investment banking business after a slide in fees.
De Giorgi was replaced by Jack MacDonald and Thomas Sheehan who are co-heads of global investment banking out of the United States.
Robertson is joining Bank of America from UBS after a 22-year career at the Swiss bank where he recently headed its UK advisory business.
Luck worked closely with Robertson at UBS where he spent 13 years before moving to Bank of America to help to build its corporate broking franchise in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. 
He is currently heading the bank's corporate broking business and will retain these responsibilities in addition to his new role.
The two bankers also served in the same British Army regiment - the Royal Dragoon Guards - in the mid 1990s, before starting their respective careers in investment banking.
They will report to Matt Cannon and Richard King who are co-heads of UK & Ireland Corporate and Investment Banking and Luigi Rizzo, head of EMEA Investment Banking.
Bank of America has won some lucrative business recently from some of Britain's biggest companies, including  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) where the bank led a 3.4 billion pound mandatory convertible bond - the largest ever UK equity-linked offering and largest ever European mandatory convertible bond.
It also advised drugs group GSK on its $4.9 billion acquisition of Tesaro and helped  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) with its $4.6 billion purchase of Horlicks India from GSK.
Bank of America has also been expanding its team in Paris ahead of Brexit and transferring London-based executives, including Rizzo to the French capital. On Feb. 8, it named Sanaz Zaimi as head of its new Paris-based European Union broker-dealer unit BofA Securities Europe.

TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - A Tokyo court rejected ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn's request to attend a board meeting this week, denying him a seat at the table even as the carmaker looks set to bolster an alliance he built over two decades.
Prosecutors submitted a document to the Tokyo District Court from Nissan stating its opposition to Ghosn attending Tuesday's board meeting, Ghosn's lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters.
""Nissan's strong opposition to Ghosn's attendance is very regrettable,"" Hironaka said outside his law office. The defense team still had time to appeal the decision, he added, and the lawyers later duly filed an appeal, according to Kyodo News. 
Ghosn was released on a $9 million bail only last week after more than 100 days in detention. He faces charges of under-reporting his salary at Nissan by about $82 million over nearly a decade - charges he has called ""meritless"".
The Tokyo District Court on Monday declined to temporarily suspend a condition of Ghosn's bail that stops him from meeting people linked to his case, blocking what would have been a dramatic face off between the once-feted executive and the colleagues he has accused of fomenting a coup.
The court did not give a reason for its ruling. 
Nissan could not be reached immediately for a comment outside business hours.
The court's decision came as French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), Nissan's top shareholder, confirmed it was in talks with Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors about setting up a new alliance body to improve their collaboration.
Ghosn's dramatic arrest in November has caused concerns about the future of the three-way alliance, the world's largest maker of automobiles excluding heavy trucks.
""The proposed arrangement will have no impact on the existence of the (alliance agreement) and the cross-shareholding structure, which will both remain in place,"" Renault said.
JOINT BOARD MEETING
Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi plan to set up a joint board meeting structure under which Renault's new chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard, is likely to take the chair, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
That would replace Dutch-based companies currently linking Nissan and Renault and, separately, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, the people said. 
The heads of the partners will hold a press briefing at Nissan's Yokohama headquarters on Tuesday, Nissan said.
Hironaka said Ghosn would meet the press at an ""opportune time"", but that it would not be on Tuesday.
Some at Nissan had been unhappy with Ghosn's push for a deeper tie-up, including possibly a full merger.
One of the world's best-known auto executives, Ghosn was sacked as chairman of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, and resigned as chief executive of Renault after his arrest.
However, he remains on the boards of all three, given a shareholder vote is required to remove a board member.
If his request to attend the board meeting had been approved, he would have been expected to dial into the meeting via teleconference, given the conditions of his bail, according to a person familiar with Nissan's thinking.

Hironaka said Ghosn had received an invitation to the meeting with details of a time and location, and that there had been no discussion on whether he would attend in person or not.

1385,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Wall Street’s Got It All Wrong When It Comes to the U.S. Bond Market,"(Bloomberg) -- What, exactly, is the bond market telling us?
It’s an age-old question on Wall Street, but one that’s gained newfound urgency as the topsy-turvy markets leave everyone wondering where the U.S. economy is headed. Yet to a small but growing number of analysts, academics and former policy makers, the standard answers may not apply.
The debate centers around the term premium, a notoriously hard-to-understand feature of the U.S. Treasury market. Recently, it’s fallen toward historic levels, setting off alarms among prognosticators who say it is an ominous sign the slowdown in U.S. growth won’t merely be a fleeting event -- and that investors who have poured into risk assets are living in a fantasyland.
The reality may be far less dire. To Jeremy Stein and William Dudley, two former Federal Reserve officials, the drop-off has more to due with a subdued inflation environment and the fact that long-term Treasuries are a natural hedge for investors who have seen their stock portfolios surge in value.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) point to hiccups in how the term premium is measured, which may overstate its actual decline. And one of the creators of the most widely followed model says the Fed’s crisis-era bond investments have changed the way the term premium should be understood.
Fancy Terminology
“Term premium is a fancy way for sort of saying, ‘This is the part of the 10-year yield we don’t really understand,”’ said Stein, who is now a professor at Harvard University. That said, historically, the predominant shocks came “from the inflation side. So (you had) a very high term premium. Right now, long-term bonds are seen as a good hedge for stocks.”
Before going further though, a quick primer. Because it’s not directly observable, the term premium has always been somewhat nebulous. Strictly speaking, it’s the extra compensation that buyers need to hold longer-maturity debt instead of successive short-term securities year after year. It’s generally seen as protection against unforeseen and unforeseeable risks -- think inflation and supply-demand shocks.
That margin of safety is one of three components that make up the yield of any given bond, according to former Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. (The other two are the market’s expectations for interest-rate risk and inflation.)
Premium to Discount
As the name implies, the term premium should normally be positive and has been for almost all of the past 50 years. But in recent years, it’s turned into a discount. Last month, it reached minus 0.72 percentage point for 10-year Treasuries, just above the all-time low set in July 2016. The most recent leg down occurred after the Fed shifted to a more dovish stance in January and acknowledged the market’s growing concern over the economy.
And all other things being equal, a lower term premium means lower bond yields. The benchmark note ended at 2.63 percent last week, down from a seven-year high of 3.26 percent in October.
More than a few forecasters see that trend as a worrying sign the U.S. economy and corporate earnings aren’t strong enough to justify S&P 500 index’s 17 percent rebound from its December low. Richard Kelly, Toronto-Dominion Bank’s head of global strategy, said it’s “one of the signs that we still aren’t out of the woods.” Evercore ISI’s Dennis Debusschere suggested the deeply negative term premium reflects pessimism about nominal growth.
Indeed, the S&P 500 just capped its worst week of the year after China dialed back its goal for economic expansion, the European Central Bank downgraded its euro-area outlook and a report showed American hiring slumped.
Long View
Dudley, former head of New York Fed, is inclined to take the long view. The long, steady decline of the term premium, which has brought down U.S. borrowing costs, ultimately has more to do with the Fed breaking the back of inflation. Technological advances, not to mention the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) effect, have also made everything cheaper for Americans over the years. Among consumers, the inflation outlook over the next five to 10 years has fallen to 2.3 percent, according to University of Michigan, matching a record low.
As a result, the most pessimistic take isn’t necessarily the right one, he said.
“As long as this inflation regime holds, and we remain in a world where people aren’t worried about budget deficits, then bond risk premiums will probably stay low,” said Dudley, who is now a professor at Princeton University. (He’s also a contributor to Bloomberg Opinion.)
Dudley added that it probably means a recession is unlikely in the near future, even if long-term bond yields fall below short-term rates, a phenomenon that’s historically preceded contractions.
Goldman’s Praveen Korapaty and Binky Chadha of Deutsche Bank say the term premium might not even be as low as some models suggest. While many incorporate an average short-term rate that’s over 3 percent, Fed officials say the current 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent target rate is already close to the lower end of their range of estimates for neutral -- the level that neither slows nor spurs growth. Goldman’s model puts the term premium at minus 0.3 percentage point, roughly half as low as the New York Fed’s popular ACM model.
Model Hiccups
“These models have the view that the very long-run neutral rate is constant,” said Jonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University and co-creator of ACM’s predecessor, the Fed’s Kim-Wright model. “Since the crisis, there has been a lot of evidence that the neutral rate has fallen.”
Then, there’s the Fed’s $2.18 trillion of Treasury holdings. A legacy of quantitative easing, the purchases of U.S. government debt are estimated to have reduced the term premium by a full percentage point. While the Fed is now steadily paring its holdings, the opposite hasn’t happened. That’s raised some eyebrows. And since January, Fed officials have started to put the market on notice that the unwind will likely end later this year.
Tobias Adrian, the International Monetary Fund’s financial stability chief and a former New York Fed researcher, says the reason may be structural in nature.
Structural Distortion
“Markets are very liquid now as opposed to when QE first took place,” said Adrian, who created the ACM model with Richard Crump and Emanuel Moench. It’s not clear the term premium drop-off will be “symmetrically undone with balance-sheet tapering. There is also the issue of how large the balance sheet will be, and its composition, which have implications” for the term premium.
All that leaves Deutsche Bank’s Chadha feeling good about the economy and risk assets, particularly if, as he expects, U.S.-China trade tensions ease. He sees the S&P 500 reaching 3,250 by year-end.
“Maybe the bond market is distorted,” he mused, “because the Fed has done things they have never done before.”

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian cigarette manufacturer Godfrey Phillips on Monday said it was in compliance with the country's foreign direct investment (FDI) rules, following a Reuters article that alleged it circumvented the laws.
Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) has for years paid manufacturing costs to Godfrey Phillips to make its Marlboro cigarettes, circumventing a nine-year-old government ban on foreign direct investment in the industry, Reuters reported last week based on a review of dozens of internal company documents, which were dated between May 2009 and January 2018. (https://reut.rs/2NIlHD8)
After the story was published, a senior official at India's main financial crime-fighting agency said Philip Morris and Godfrey were being probed for alleged violation of the country's laws. The scope of the investigation, the source added, was much broader than the alleged law violations highlighted in the Reuters story.
On Monday, Godfrey told India's National Stock Exchange ""the suggestion of alleged violation of the FDI laws of India is completely misconceived and misplaced"".
Godfrey's stock rose as much as 10 percent from Friday's close.
India in 2010 prohibited FDI in cigarette manufacturing, saying this would enhance efforts to curb smoking.
Ahead of the ban, Philip Morris formed a new wholesale trading company with Godfrey. Since then, Godfrey has acted as a contract manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes in India, while Philip Morris's local unit acts as a wholesale trading company and promotes the brand.
Godfrey told the stock exchange on Monday it had entered into a commercial arrangement with Philip Morris' local unit to manufacture Marlboro cigarettes in May 2009, a year before the May 2010 FDI ban.
""The commercial arrangement referred to above is in complete compliance with the extant regulations governing the FDI laws in India,"" the company said.
Dozens of internal company documents reviewed by Reuters showed Philip Morris has been indirectly paying costs related to Marlboro cigarette manufacturing in India in a phased manner.
Three former officials and one former head of India’s Enforcement Directorate had reviewed the Philip Morris documents for Reuters and said the dealings should be investigated for circumventing India’s foreign investment rules.

Ryanair announced last year it would have to restrict the rights if UK shareholders ceased to qualify as European Union nationals to ensure it remained majority EU-owned to comply with its licensing and flight rights.
Its board passed a number of resolutions on Friday which will become effective on the date British nationals become non-EU nationals, Europe's biggest low cost airline said in a statement.
At that point, shareholders will be issued with restricted share notices, specifying that they will not be entitled to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the company for as long as those shares are treated as restricted shares.
""These resolutions will remain in place until the board determines that the ownership and control of the company is no longer such that there is any risk to the airline licenses held by the company's subsidiaries pursuant to EU Regulation 1008/2008,"" Ryanair said.
Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorohan said last month that while the airline was 55 percent EU-owned, Britain-based shareholders controlled 20 percent of its stock. He told Reuters he expected half of those to redomicile to the EU in a no-deal or ""hard"" Brexit. 

Chief Executive Michael O'Leary also said last month that the carrier might look to buy back shares in the event of a no-deal Brexit to use it as an opportunity for British shareholders to dispose stock due to the planned restrictions.

The management board of Deutsche has agreed to hold talks with Commerzbank on the feasibility of a merger, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Saturday. 
On Friday, a German magazine said the CEOs of the two banks had been in intense talks for some days.
Berenberg's equity sales team said a merger between the two could make sense, given the overlap in their businesses, even though Deutsche has repeatedly said it needs to focus on increasing its own profitability.
Nevertheless, ""failure to deliver on the ROTE (Return on tangible equity) target could force Deutsche to consider a more radical shift in strategy, possibly including a merger,"" they added.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 05:14AM ET</span>","Chinese carriers, Ethiopian Airlines halt use of Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft after crash","By Stella Qiu and Josh Horwitz
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's aviation regulator on Monday grounded nearly 100 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by its airlines, more than a quarter of the global fleet of the jets, after a deadly crash of one of the planes in Ethiopia.
However, a U.S. official said it was unclear what information the Chinese regulator was acting on because the investigation of Sunday's crash, the second involving the latest version of the narrowbody jet, was in the early stages.
Speaking on condition of anonymity as the topic is sensitive, the U.S. official said there were no plans to follow suit, as the jet had a stellar safety record in the United States and there was a lack of information on what caused the Ethiopian crash.
Boeing, whose shares dropped 9 percent in U.S. pre-market trade, said the investigation remained in its early stages and it had no basis to issue new guidance to operators.
It was unusual to ground a plane type unless a specific mechanical issue or component failure had been identified and could be inspected, said Andrew Herdman, director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.
""In this case it is not clear what the action item is, having done the suspension,"" he said. ""What is lacking now is what happened in this case.
""That means finding the black boxes and piecing together other circumstantial evidence from air traffic control recordings and so on.""
Most other Boeing 737 MAX operators globally told Reuters their planes would keep flying and they had no plans to cancel orders.
Sunday's crash, minutes after take-off, of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 bound for Nairobi, killed all 157 on board and prompted the carrier to ground the rest of its 737 MAX jets.
In October, a 737 MAX 8 operated by Indonesian budget carrier Lion Air crashed 13 minutes after take-off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on a domestic flight, killing all 189 on board. The 737 MAX 8 first entered service in 2017.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said it would notify airlines when they could resume flying the jets, after contacting Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure flight safety.
""Given that two accidents both involved newly delivered Boeing 737-8 planes and happened during take-off phase, they have some degree of similarity,"" the CAAC said, adding the step was in line with its principle of zero tolerance of safety hazards. The 737 MAX 8 is sometimes referred to as the 737-8.
The grounding was due to safety concerns and not related to trade friction between the United States and China, Li Jian, the deputy head of the Chinese regulator, told reporters, the Yangcheng Evening News said.
""These are two separate issues,"" the newspaper, which is backed by the government of the southern province of Guangdong, quoted Li as saying on the sidelines of a parliament meeting in Beijing.
CHINA'S FLEET
Chinese airlines have 96 737 MAX 8 jets in service, the state company regulator said on Twitter-like Weibo, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines and Hainan Airlines.
Chinese aviation data firm Variflight said at least 29 international and domestic flights on Monday had been canceled and that airlines had swapped out the plane on 256 other flights that had been scheduled to use it.
China Eastern's chairman, Liu Shaoyong, told financial publication Caixin on the sidelines of the Beijing meeting that it would only consider resuming 737 MAX 8 flights once Boeing issued a safety commitment for the jets and proved there was no aircraft design link between the two crashes.
The cause of the Indonesian crash is still being investigated.
A November preliminary report, before the retrieval of the cockpit voice recorder, focused on airline maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor but gave no reason for the crash.
Ethiopian Airlines said it had grounded its 737 MAX 8 fleet until further notice as an ""extra safety precaution"" even though it did not know the cause of Sunday's crash.
The airline has a remaining fleet of four of the aircraft, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 says.
Cayman Airways said it had grounded both of its new 737 MAX 8 jets until it got more information.
But no other airlines with 737 MAX 8s in their fleets or on order, or their regulators, told Reuters they were grounding the aircraft or cancelling orders.
By January-end, Boeing had delivered 350 of the 737 MAX family jets to customers, with 4,661 more on order.
Western industry sources say China has been at pains in recent years to assert its independence as a safety regulator as it negotiates mutual safety standard recognition with regulators in the United States and Europe.
In 2017, it signed a mutual recognition deal with the FAA, but industry sources say it has struggled to gain approval from the FAA that would allow it to sell its self-developed C919 airliner to Western airlines.

The grounding was ""reasonable and justified"", said Chinese aviation expert Li Xiaojin but added that he did not anticipate a major problem, as Chinese airlines operated fewer than 100 of the aircraft, among a combined fleet of more than 2,000 planes.

At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.6 points, or 0.2% at 371.18. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 was up 0.6% while Germany's Dax was up 0.2%.
With no one story dominating the news, banks are leading the way higher after a torrid last week.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) was up 2.8% and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) up 4.8% after reports at the weekend said Deutsche’s executive board has given CEO Christian Sewing a mandate to pursue a merger with its smaller rival. To make the math work, Sewing is insisting on much sharper cost cuts than current agreements with the two banks’ labor unions would permit, according to German newspaper Handelsblatt.
Analysts are still skeptical that the combination of two banks with chronically low profits will actually make a stronger one.
“Is this the type of stuff that people in 15 years’ time will say ‘it sounded good at the time’?” Stefan Gerlach, chief economist with EFG Bank in Zurich, said via Twitter.
The market earlier shrugged off a surprise drop in German industrial production in January, which were offset by more upbeat trade data – a rare instance of German ‘hard’ data beating expectations in recent weeks.
Elsewhere, Boeing (DE:BA) depositary receipts in Frankfurt fell over 7% on the news that China had grounded its 737 MAX airliners after a second fatal crash involving the 737 MAX at the weekend. France’s  Safran  (PA:SAF), which supplies engines for the airliner, fell 1.6%.
Meanwhile, oil and gas stocks were broadly higher after reports saying Saudi Arabia would continue through April to pump less oil than it is allowed to under an OPEC-led supply restraint deal. The reports suggest the kingdom is stepping up its efforts to support prices which remain under pressure as U.S. supply continues to grow faster than global demand. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) is 0.7%, while  BP  (LON:BP) is up 0.5% and France’s Total up 0.6%. Europe’s majors are also benefiting from the fact that Norway’s government recommended on Friday to leave them off a list of stocks that its sovereign wealth fund should divest from."

The technology and disruptive commerce industry group will be lead by James Millar and Alton McDowell and will focus on promising start-ups that specialize in software, semiconductors, food, health and wellness, lifestyle and pet products.
Dozens of young businesses in these consumer and service segments have become overnight successes in the last decade. 
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, will use this group to sell these small to mid-market companies everything from handling their treasury, payments, credit and financing, to mergers and acquisitions advice.
""In today's economy, startups are growing at a faster clip and basic banking needs can quickly turn complex,"" Melissa Smith, head of specialized industries for the bank's middle-market group, said in a statement.

Millar previously ran the middle market banking technology team out of New York, and McDowell led the emerging growth group in Houston, Texas.

The Beijing-based firm, which is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd, has launched its signature orange bikes in markets including Australia, Europe and the United States. 
The company said it will layoff at least 10 staff as part of its restructuring plan. 
""We are currently seeking to optimize our international business. On that principle, Mobike will close in some countries in Asia ... At the same time, we will continue to evaluate other countries and regions,"" the company said. 
TechCrunch earlier reported that Mobike laid off its Asia Pacific operations team, including staff and contractors in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, India and Australia. 
The move comes as China's bike-sharing industry - which once included multiple firms valued at over $1 billion each - is experiencing a sharp downturn, forcing several closures and acquisitions after years of breakneck growth.
Mobike was acquired by Beijing-based on-demand services company Meituan Dianping for $2.7 billion last April.

 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd-backed Ofo, once Mobike's top competitor, announced last year that it would consider applying for bankruptcy, leaving millions of customers demanding the return of their deposits.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd will take a 14 percent stake in STO Express Co Ltd through a $693 million deal, the e-commerce giant's fourth significant investment in a Chinese courier company. 
Shares in STO Express shot up when trading opened and immediately hit the upper 10 percent limit on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, according to Refinitiv data.
STO Express said in a statement on Monday its controlling shareholder planned to set up a new subsidiary that will own a 29.9 percent stake in the courier firm. 
Alibaba will in turn invest 4.66 billion yuan ($693.44 million) for a 49 percent stake in the new subsidiary, and by extension hold more than 14 percent of STO Express, the statement said. 
Alibaba, in a separate statement, confirmed its investment in ""one of the top five express delivery companies in China"".
""We will deepen our existing collaboration with STO in technology, last-mile delivery across China and New Retail logistics,"" it said.
""This investment is a step forward in our pursuit of the goal of 24-hour-delivery anywhere in China and 72 hours globally,"" Alibaba added.
STO Express is Alibaba's fourth investment in the Chinese courier sector after it acquired minority stakes in YTO Express Group Co Ltd, Best Inc and ZTO Express (Cayman) Inc. 
STO Express is one of several companies that works with Alibaba under Cainiao, its logistics division launched in 2013.
Cainiao provides software and shares data with warehouses, carriers and other logistics companies that help deliver packages to shoppers on Tmall and Taobao, Alibaba's largest e-commerce sites. 
Cainiao works with a number of logistics companies to ensure packages are delivered and vendors paid, but relationships between Cainiao and its partners have at times been uneasy. 

In 2017, Cainiao temporarily barred Chinese courier SF Express from taking deliveries from Alibaba's e-commerce vendors in a dispute over the ownership of customer data.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - UBS Group AG and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) PLC have agreed to settle a case of alleged misconduct related to a 2009 IPO in Hong Kong, in a move expected to end uncertainty about the Swiss bank's ability to lead stock listings in the city.
While StanChart closed its equity business in 2015, UBS was expected to appeal an unprecedented 18-month ban on sponsoring initial public offerings (IPOs) in the Asian financial hub, which was imposed, sources say, because of its role in the listing of a firm that subsequently collapsed.
StanChart and UBS banker Cen Tian were scheduled to also appeal against disciplinary action by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) over alleged misconduct during the listing of a now defunct Chinese timber company, which the two banks led.
But the banks reached a settlement ahead of the appeals, a counsel for SFC, Jat Sew-Tong, told a three-member Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal on Monday, adding that details of the settlement would be released at a later date.
The high-profile case, one of many being investigated by the SFC, is seen as a test of mounting scrutiny of IPO practices in a city where helping firms list is big business for banks.
""The settlement is good news for UBS, as at least now it knows what its capabilities are,"" said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of consultancy Quinlan & Associates.
A ban on leading IPOs, if implemented, would begin once the appeals process has been exhausted, but the uncertainty around whether or when it might come into effect has already hurt UBS' ability to pitch for sponsor work in Hong Kong.
Last year, UBS, which was also fighting a HK$119 million ($15 million) fine from the 2009 IPO case, sponsored just one IPO, according to Dealogic, though it advised on ten in total.
UBS and Standard Chartered in Hong Kong declined to comment on news of the settlement. An SFC spokesman said the regulator had nothing more to add.
While UBS has not identified the IPO in question and the SFC has not confirmed it, people with knowledge of the matter have said it was that of China Forestry.
The timber merchant raised $216 million in its IPO, but 14 months after listing, trading of its shares was suspended when its auditor, KPMG, discovered irregularities.
The company was subsequently liquidated.
REGULATORY ACTION
In the wake of a slew of scandals among newly traded firms earlier this decade, the SFC has been cracking down on banks not properly carrying out their duties as sponsor.
In October, the SFC said it had issued nine IPO sponsors with ""decision notices"" informing them of intended enforcement measures.
Hong Kong IPOs need at least one sponsoring bank, which typically takes the lead in running the IPO and collects a larger proportion of fees than banks listed only as bookrunners.
Sponsors must conduct due diligence to assess the company being listed, and are responsible for assuring potential investors that its IPO prospectus is accurate.
Last year, the SFC imposed a $7 million fine on  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) for due diligence failures during its sponsorship of Real Gold Mining's 2009 IPO and $3 million on China Construction Bank International over its sponsorship of the failed 2014 IPO of seafood company Fujian Dongya Aquatic.
""We expect to see a number of the SFC's sponsor actions reach a conclusion during the course of 2019,"" law firm Freshfields said in a recent report.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's board is set to meet this week in Saudi Arabia where it will approve a bond issuance plan that will likely help finance a potential acquisition of a strategic stake in Saudi petrochemicals maker SABIC, industry sources said.
Aramco, the world's top oil producer, plans to issue its first international bonds in the second quarter of 2019 and the planned issuance will probably be around $10 billion, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has said.
The company's representatives are expected to meet fixed-income investors in a bond ""roadshow"" in April, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The deal is expected to involve the purchase of all or nearly all of the 70 percent stake in SABIC held by the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s top sovereign wealth fund. That implies a deal value of roughly $70 billion, though the acquisition price has not been made public yet.
The Aramco board of director, which plans to meet on Monday, according to two sources, will also approve the 2018 financial results for the company, which is likely be included in the bond prospectus along with the firm's oil and gas reserves.
""The board will approve the bonds. SABIC (deal) is progressing but any project of this size takes a long time,"" said one of the sources.
Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Senior Aramco officials have traveled to the United States and Britain in recent weeks to gauge investor appetite for the planned bond, the sources said.
Aramco had already picked a group of banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Citi, HSBC and Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank to help arrange the planned bonds.
When Aramco approached banks formally for the bonds sale earlier this year, it asked them to submit proposals for the bonds and potential commitments for bank debt financing, banking sources said.
The sources said the acquisition payment is likely to be staggered, allowing Aramco to tap debt investors in various phases - a move which would avoid straining banks that are not ready to commit large sums through a single loan facility.
Banks have pitched hard over the past months for this high-profile bond mandate, hoping to be rewarded by Aramco with future mandates for capital markets transactions and other banking business.

JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, along with other banks, were working on the planned stock market listing of Aramco before the move was put on hold due to the SABIC acquisition. The new planned listing date is 2021, Saudi officials said.

The license agreement between MSCI and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX), which will launch the new product, comes less than two weeks after MSCI announced it would quadruple the weighting of Chinese shares in its global benchmarks later this year. 
HKEX Chief Executive Charles Li said the agreement with MSCI provides ""a key risk management tool for international investors who need to manage their A-share equity exposure"".
The new product is among a host of other derivatives launched by global exchanges in recent years to help manage exposure to mainland Chinese markets.
Singapore Exchange Ltd's A50 Index Futures contract, for example, allows offshore investors to track 50 Chinese A-shares directly.
Li said on a conference call on Monday the new HKEX futures contract will track the entire 421 large- and mid-cap A-shares included in the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
HKEX said in a statement it was yet to determine a launch date and that the product remains subject to regulatory approval and market conditions.
China has also been opening up its domestic derivatives market as A-shares enter global indexes.
Draft rules in late January said foreign institutions will have access to onshore derivatives, including financial futures, under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme and its yuan-denominated equivalent, RQFII.
Fang Xinghai, deputy head of China's securities regulator, predicted in January that foreign capital inflows to Chinese stocks this year will double to about 600 billion yuan ($89.76 billion) from last year.
Last week, Fang told local media that regulators were studying measures to further open the index futures market.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said it had been supervising the four biggest banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and National Australia Bank Ltd - plus investment bank Macquarie Group Ltd and wealth manager AMP Ltd, as they reviewed the systems which led to wrongful fee charging.
But the regulator said those companies had taken too long to identify systemic failures.
""These reviews have been unreasonably delayed,"" said ASIC commissioner Danielle Press.
The reviews were large, involving up to 10 years of operations, six institutions and more than 7,000 advisers, but ""the institutions have failed to sufficiently prioritise and resource their reviews, particularly as ASIC advised them to commence the reviews in mid-2015 or early 2016"", Press added. 
The four retail banks and AMP had paid or offered a total of about A$350 million ($246 million) in compensation for wrongfully charged fees by January 2019, and allowed for further payments totally another A$800 million, ASIC said, but noted that those amounts were incomplete.
The causes of the delays included the companies taking a ""legalistic approach"", their poor recording keeping, and their failure to set up effective methods to identify and compensate wronged customers, ASIC added.
The regulator said it was also planning enforcement action against an unspecified number of entities for taking customer fees for services not rendered.
A Royal Commission inquiry in misconduct in the financial services sector during the past year, has put banks and investment companies under pressure to clean up processes that had resulted in customers being automatically billed for wealth management advice that they had not received.
It had recommended that 24 cases be referred to regulators for possible prosecution, without giving details, though analysts expected most of those case would relate to charging fees for no service.
The commission had questioned the retail banks and AMP over charging fees for services not provided. 
AMP's chairwoman, CEO and some of its board left the company following allegations they interfered with a supposedly independent report to ASIC on the topic.
Macquarie, which was not accused at the inquiry of any current instances of charging fees for no service, declined to comment. Representatives of the four retail banks and AMP were not immediately available for comment.

(Reuters) - U.S. construction and building materials supplier GCP Applied Technologies Inc is nearing a deal over the composition of its board with activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The agreement would come after Starboard amassed a 4.6 percent stake in GCP and put forward five nominees to stand for election to the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company's nine-member board of directors.
GCP has agreed to appoint at least two of Starboard's nominees to its board, the sources said. If the negotiations are concluded successfully, the agreement could be announced this week, the sources added.
GCP has said it is exploring strategic alternatives, a move that Starboard, which would like to see the company sell itself, supports, the sources said.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. GCP and Starboard declined to comment.
GCP, which was spun off W.R. Grace & Co in 2016, is a provider of specialty construction chemicals, focusing on concrete admixtures and cement additives, as well as specialty building materials that protect structures from water, air and fire damage. It has a market capitalization of $2.1 billion.
In July 2017, GCP sold its Darex packaging business to Germany's Henkel AG & Co KgaA for about $1.1 billion. GCP's shares are now valued almost as much as they were two years ago, as the company has faced intensifying competition from larger rivals, including RPM International Inc, BASF SE (DE:BASFN) and Sika AG.
GCP told its shareholders in an open letter last month it had taken ""decisive steps"" to make its business more efficient, and announced a restructuring plan focused on its supply chain strategy, including its manufacturing, purchasing, logistics, and warehousing operations.
Starboard is one of the most prominent and prolific activist hedge funds. It is currently seeking to break up drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co's $74 billion deal to buy  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG). It is also pushing for changes at discount retailer  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR), and has put forward nominees to challenge the board of healthcare plan and pharmacy benefits manager Magellan Health Inc.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The latest version of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's best-selling 737 family - a global industry workhorse - has again been thrust into the spotlight after a fatal crash in Ethiopia, months after a deadly crash involving an identical brand-new jet in Indonesia.
A Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed minutes after takeoff from Addis Adaba, killing all 157 on board. The same model flown by Lion Air crashed off the coast of Indonesia in October, killing all 189 on board.
There are still unanswered questions about the causes of the Lion Air crash, and officials and safety experts said it was too soon to draw links with the Ethiopian incident.
Boeing did not respond to questions about the 737 MAX 8 on Sunday but said in a statement it would send a technical team to the crash site to provide assistance.
Boeing's shares lost 12 percent in the weeks following the Lion Air crash, but have more than recouped those declines, closing on Friday at $422.54, 18 percent higher than before the Oct. 29 incident in Indonesia.
Boeing's 737 MAX is the newest version of a jet that has been a fixture of passenger travel for decades and the cash cow of the world's largest aircraft maker, competing against Airbus SE's A320neo family of single-aisle jetliners.
The decades-old 737 family is considered one of the industry's most reliable aircraft.
Boeing rolled out the fuel-efficient MAX 8 in 2017 as an update to the already redesigned 50-year-old 737, and had delivered 350 MAX jets out of the total order tally of 5,011 aircraft by the end of January.
Former NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said the catastrophic crashes of two new airplanes soon after the 737 MAX 8 was introduced were ""highly unusual"" and both had broad similarities in that they went down soon after takeoff.
While it is unclear if there is a direct link, “this is now an extraordinary issue” for aviation safety officials to grapple with and will prompt a sweeping investigation to determine if there are common issues, Rosenker said.
Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co is the biggest operator of the MAX 8, with 31 aircraft, followed by American Airlines Group Inc and Air Canada with 24 each.
Southwest and American said on Sunday they remained fully confident in the aircraft and were closely monitoring the investigation. 
Aviation analyst Scott Hamilton cautioned against drawing comparisons between the two crashes, especially before the black box recorders are recovered. Ethiopian has a strong reputation and good safety record, he said in a blog post.
Still, the crash puts fresh pressure on Boeing just days before it had planned an event to debut another aircraft. 
Late Sunday, Boeing said it would postpone the planned ceremonial debut of its 777x widebody aircraft that had been set for Wednesday in Seattle and was to be livestreamed. 
The company said it is focused on ""supporting"" Ethiopian Airlines and ""will look for an opportunity to mark the new plane with the world in the near future.""
INVESTIGATION AND LITIGATION
Following the Lion Air crash, Boeing faced criticism from some U.S. pilot unions for not having detailed in its flight manual a change in the way that software on the MAX reacts in a stall compared with a previous version.
Boeing has insisted that cockpit procedures were already in place to deal with problems that the Lion Air jet experienced.
A preliminary report into the Lion Air crash focused on airline maintenance and training, as well as the technical response of the anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor, but did not give a reason for the crash. Since then, the cockpit voice recorder was recovered and a final report is due later this year.
Boeing was expected to introduce a software patch to help address the scenario faced by the Lion Air crew in late March or April, government and industry officials told Reuters in recent weeks.
Boeing is already facing a string of lawsuits in the United States by families of the Lion Air crash victims, including five cases in U.S. federal court in Illinois where Boeing has its Chicago headquarters.

The 737 MAX 8 uses LEAP-1B engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.3% and 0.7% at 9:55 PM ET (1:55 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.2%.
Chinese retail sales, investment, credit and industrial production data for January and February are all scheduled for release this week.
Sino-U.S. trade developments remained in focus after Yi Gang, People’s Bank of China Governor, said the two sides have reached consensus on many “crucial” issues.
“The two sides discussed issues surrounding the yuan including the need to abide by previous commitments made by Group of 20 nations not to engage in competitive depreciation and to communicate closely on currency issues,” Yi said at a press conference in Beijing on Sunday during the annual National People’s Congress.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 0.2% higher. The Bank of Japan will meet to decide on its monetary policy later this week but no change in the stimulus package is expected.
Down under, Australia’s ASX fell 0.3%, as oil stocks retreated. Shares of Santos Ltd (AX:STO) was down 2.3%, Oil Search Ltd (AX:OSH) lost 2.4% and Woodside Petroleum Ltd (AX:WPL) also slid about 2%.
On Sunday, Powell told CBS in an interview that the current interest rates are at an “appropriate level.”
""The financial crisis did a great deal of damage to many people's lives. And, of course, not all of them will be made whole,"" Powell said. But ""our system is vastly more resilient and strong than it was before the financial crisis.""
His comments came after important data in the U.S. and China came below expectations last week.
The U.S. added just 20,000 jobs in February, compared to an expected gain of 180,000, marking the weakest month of jobs creation since September 2017.
Meanwhile, China’s exports for February tumbled 20.7% year-on-year, much worse than market expectations of a 4.8% drop. It also reversed January gains of 9.1%.
Imports were also down 5.2%, while the market estimated a decline of just 1.4% decline."

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2019 07:25PM ET</span>","SoftBank's Son finds more love for early-stage investing, new fund planned","By Hyunjoo Jin and Sam Nussey
SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp has expanded its appetite for early-stage startups, with a venture capital unit set to launch its biggest fund for early investments as it opens new offices in Asia.
The global fund from newly rebranded Seoul-based SoftBank Ventures Asia will be worth as much as $500 million and could launch next month, its CEO JP Lee told Reuters in an interview. 
By contrast, the average size of similar funds raised last year was just over $100 million, according to data provider Preqin. 
SoftBank, South Korea's National Pension Service as well as other companies and asset management firms will provide funding, Lee said, declining to provide further details on investors.
""It's an important signal within the SoftBank Group that SoftBank thinks early-stage investments are important and will make continued efforts on them,"" said Lee.
The move comes as SoftBank rapidly transforms beyond telecoms into a tech investing giant.
In addition to the $100 billion Saudi-backed SoftBank Vision Fund that has made big investments in firms like Uber, SoftBank said on Thursday it was launching a $5 billion fund focused on Latin America.
The bigger remit for SoftBank Ventures Asia, which describes itself as the group's global arm for early-stage investing, came after a successful presentation to SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son last October, Lee said.
Tasked by Son to explain why the SoftBank should keep investing in early-stage startups, Lee on a visit to the group's Tokyo offices invoked the words of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Chairman Jack Ma: ""small guys become big guys"".
In doing so, he harkened back to Son's most spectacular startup jackpot - his 2000 investment of $20 million in the Chinese e-commerce firm. SoftBank's current Alibaba stake is worth around $130 billion.
Three months later, SoftBank Ventures Korea was relaunched as SoftBank Ventures Asia and it now plans to open offices and hire investment managers in Singapore and Shanghai. It currently has teams in Seoul, Beijing, San Francisco, and Tel Aviv. 
Son provides guidance while individual investment decisions are made by Lee and his team, Lee said. The unit declined to comment on how many new people may be hired.
The unit was born in 2000 at a boom time for South Korean startups, expanding its focus beyond that country in 2011. Around half of its investments have been early stage.
SoftBank Group and its portfolio companies also make early-stage investments. Many of these are not disclosed by SoftBank and lack of clarity on their valuations complicate investors' efforts to quantify SoftBank's worth, said Dan Baker, an analyst at Morningstar.
The new fund, called the SoftBank Acceleration Fund, follows the launch of a $300 million China-focused fund in September. The unit, which has $1.1 billion under management, had until then focused on funds worth under $200 million.
To date, the unit has taken stakes in over 250 companies across 10 countries, including South Korean gaming company Nexon Co, which listed in Japan in 2011, and Indonesian e-commerce firm Tokopedia.
It currently concentrates on firms involved in artificial intelligence, connected devices and robotics. 
In keeping with Son's practice of promoting ties between portfolio companies to boost their growth, Lee said Singapore-based used car trading platform Carro, which the unit has a stake in, had been introduced to SoftBank portfolio company Grab for potential collaboration.
And another company it has invested in, camera app operator Snow China, is using technology from artificial intelligence firm SenseTime. 
SoftBank and its Vision Fund have invested more than $600 million in SenseTime, valuing it in the most recent round at $7.6 billion, a source familiar with the matter said, declining to be identified because the information is not public. SenseTime declined to comment.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2019 05:41PM ET</span>",Berlin backs Deutsche Bank merger despite risk of shortfall: sources,"By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Berlin is so worried about the health of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) that it pushed for a merger with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) even though it could open up a huge financial shortfall, a German official told Reuters.
Deutsche Bank's management board has agreed to hold talks with Commerzbank about the feasibility of a merger. The state owns a 15 percent stake of Commerzbank and is expected to be a shareholder in the new group. 
The German official said that any tie-up would likely result in a multi-billion-euro hole because a switch in bank ownership legally triggers a revaluation of assets such as government bonds. 
They would be revalued at a market price which is typically lower than the one registered on the accounts. A second source, who is familiar with the talks, said they also expected a shortfall after the potential merger.
Rating agency Moody's has said that a takeover could result in a ""downward valuation adjustment for parts of Commerzbank's asset base"".
A second German official said Deutsche's future was in question because high costs left it with little profit. Asked about a merger between the two banks, a third official said one was urgently needed to reduce the number of branches in an overcrowded market. 
Both said a buoyant jobs market in Germany made it easier to make staff cuts without prompting large protests because those employees would be easily able to find other work. 
Spokespeople for both banks, the German finance ministry and the economy ministry declined to comment for this story. 
Deutsche Bank has said it is stable. Last month, as it announced a return to profit in 2018, its chief executive Christian Sewing said it was ""on the right track"" for growth and lower costs.
The banks will make a decision about whether to pursue a merger within weeks, a fifth source said. 
""In 2016 ... Deutsche went to the brink,"" said the first official. ""They haven't really got out of that hole...It's legitimate to ask:... how dangerous is that with systematic relevance?"" 
While having the government of Europe's largest economy as a shareholder would give the group some weight, it would also be humbling for Deutsche Bank, once a symbol of German strength on Wall Street and London. 
Its share price has tumbled after a string of scandals and fines including a $7 billion plus penalty in 2016 for selling U.S. home loans that unraveled in the financial crash.
A key measure of its default risk, a form of insurance known as credit default swaps, has risen. 
Deutsche's significance was underscored by the International Monetary Fund in 2016 when it said the bank's links to the world's largest lenders made it a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank.
Berlin has been examining options for Deutsche for many months. Senior German officials even participated in informal, exploratory discussions in recent months with Switzerland's UBS about a merger with Deutsche, two more sources said.
But there was little appetite in Switzerland for making UBS bigger or for merging with a weaker Deutsche, so German officials reverted to Commerzbank, those people said. A UBS spokesman declined to comment.
CONFIDENCE SHAKEN 
The sources said it was not clear how any shortfall would be filled or even what size it would be.
The first source said that capital shortfall would be in the order of billions of euros although he noted that some people said there would be no need for fresh capital. 
The new group could get financial support from a new fund that will be set up to support strategic industries in the face of competition from China.
German officials have identified Deutsche Bank as a national ""champion"" and the fund is expected to provide state backing or guarantees that would help companies raise cash from pension funds or insurers. 
""I would get in private capital,"" said a fourth German official. ""An international bank is strategic."" It is not clear how big the fund will be. 
Officials also see the potential merger as a way to protect Commerzbank from being snapped up by a foreign rival, which could make Deutsche's problems worse. 
Some experts are skeptical, however. Jan Krahnen, a member of the academic advisory board of the German finance ministry, said he had ""strong reservations"" because building such a ""national champion...is blatantly against the spirit of Europe.""
Achim Wambach, president of influential German think tank ZEW research institute, said it was unclear whether such a tie-up would improve financial stability.
Klaus Adam, a professor of economics at the University of Oxford and also a member of the advisory panel to the finance ministry, said Deutsche Bank's ""reputation problems"" could rub off on Commerzbank.
Customers' and peers' faith in Deutsche was shaken after the 2016 fines. A raid on the bank by police in November as part of an investigation into money laundering and two other scandals further shook confidence and hurt revenues. 

Such matters ""of course...were not helpful in the fourth quarter of 2018,"" the bank's co-deputy CEO Karl von Rohr said.

Citing multiple sources involved in the matter, the broadcaster said the heads of the three automakers - Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, Mitsubishi Motors Chairman Osamu Masuko, and Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard - are preparing to announce the plan for the joint meeting soon.
If approved at Nissan's scheduled board meeting on Tuesday, the three companies' top executives will unveil the plan for the joint meeting, TV Tokyo said.

The alliance between Renault and Nissan was first set up in 1999 and expanded in 2016 to include Mitsubishi. 
Carlos Ghosn, who served as chairman at all three companies, before his arrest in November, had been pushing for a deeper tie-up between Nissan and Renault, including possiby a full merger, despite Nissan reservations.
The future of the three-way partnership has been thrown into doubt after Ghosn's arrest for alleged financial misconduct.
Ghosn, released on $9 million bail last week, faces charges of aggravated breach of trust and under-reporting his salary by about $82 million at Nissan for nearly a decade. He denies the charges.
The new board meeting structure, to be called ""New Alliance Board"", would effectively replace two separate Dutch-based companies - one between Nissan and Renault, and the other between Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors - that were set up to explore synergies and handle other alliance matters, TV Tokyo reported.

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2019 11:33AM ET</span>","Deutsche, Commerzbank tentatively talk about merger after months of speculation: source","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The management board of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has agreed to hold talks with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) on the feasibility of a merger, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Saturday.
First unofficial contacts took place within a very small group and the mandate from Deutsche's board was given more than a week ago, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Talks were at a very early stage and could fall apart, the person added, confirming information reported earlier by the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank and a spokeswoman for Commerzbank both declined to comment.
Speculation about a possible merger between Germany's two largest listed lenders has been rife for months, heightening under the tenure of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who has emphasized the importance of strong banks. 
Proponents of a merger say that a tie-up would give a combined entity -- which would have an equity market value of more than 24 billion euros ($27 billion) based on Friday's closing share prices -- a 20 percent share of the German retail banking market. 
That would allow it to potentially charge higher prices in a country where banking services have been free or low cost.
Welt am Sonntag reported that both banks were reacting to pressure from the government, which expects a decision on the merger in the coming weeks. 
A spokesman for the finance ministry declined to comment on the report.
The two lenders, which flirted with a merger in 2016 before focusing on restructuring, have struggled to return to sustainable profitability since the global financial crisis. 
The government holds a stake of more than 15 percent in Commerzbank following a bailout and Deutsche Bank's shares have fallen 73 percent over the past five years.
Founded in 1870 to help companies with overseas trade, Deutsche is currently regarded as one of the most important banks in the global financial system, having expanded rapidly in the 1990s to become an investment banking giant.
However, its market share has dwindled since the financial crisis and it has been plagued by three years of losses, ratings downgrades, failed stress tests and money laundering scandals. 
Its chief executive, Christian Sewing, has said publicly in recent months he was focused on restoring profitability before taking on a complicated merger project.
Sewing is expected to report back to the board before the bank takes further steps, the source said. 
Commerzbank's chief, Martin Zielke, has been more open to the idea of a tie-up, a person with knowledge of his thinking said. Last month, he said speculation about a merger was ""understandable"".
A person familiar with the matter said in February that U.S. investor Cerberus Capital Management, a major shareholder in both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, was open to a merger, increasing the chances of a tie-up.
However, some of Deutsche Bank's other key shareholders are opposed, stressing the need for patience to allow the bank to regain its footing. 
Ratings agencies, which have cut Deutsche Bank's credit ratings to the lowest among its major competitors, have warned that a merger would be risky and difficult to execute. 
Labor unions have also voiced opposition fearing large job losses.
German officials have been worried about Deutsche since 2016 when the bank was negotiating a hefty fine with the U.S. Department of Justice for its role in the mortgage crisis.
At the time, Deutsche and the government publicly played down speculation that it could need state support. Behind the scenes, however, tensions were running high.
Over the past year, Deutsche has undergone an abrupt management change that installed Sewing as CEO. The bank has trimmed its international operations to focus more on retail banking and its home market.
Negative headlines about the lender have, however, continued.
In November, police searched the offices of all the members of Deutsche Bank's board as part of an investigation into money laundering allegations linked to the Panama Papers.
Deutsche said in January that it had received requests for information from regulators and law enforcement agencies that are investigating a money laundering scheme involving Danske Bank.
In the U.S., Congress is also investigating money laundering allegations and the bank's connections to the U.S. president, who owes the bank at least $130 million dollars.

Deutsche Bank has more than 20 million personal and business customers and Commerzbank around 18 million.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2019 11:32AM ET</span>",Wall Street's oldest-ever bull market turns 10 years old,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - A savvy investor who managed to time the start of Wall Street's bull market a decade ago - and hold on since then - would now be sitting on a handsome windfall. 
Born in the ashes of the financial crisis, Wall Street's oldest-ever bull market turns 10 years old on Saturday, with the S&P 500 tripling in value and amply rewarding investors who have owned funds tracking the index for that period.
The S&P 500's post-crisis low close was 676.53 points on March 9, 2009. During the previous session on March 6, it touched an intraday low of 666.79, which came to be know as the ""devil's low."" 
On Friday, the benchmark index closed at 2,743.07, down 2 percent for the week.
Extraordinary efforts by the U.S. Federal Reserve to foster an economic recovery from the financial crisis through asset purchases and rock-bottom interest rates have provided essential support for the market during its bull run. Sweeping corporate tax cuts passed by President Donald Trump fueled market gains for much of 2018, before a steep sell-off starting in September that raised fears the bull run was coming to the end. 
GRAPHIC-Wall Street's bull turns 10: https://tmsnrt.rs/2NOg2f3
Investors who bought and kept shares in cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty on March 9, 2009, would have seen their investment gain nearly 7,000 percent during that time, more than any other stock on the S&P 500. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the second biggest performer over the past decade, up over 6,000 percent.
At the other extreme, telecommunications company  CenturyLink  (NYSE:CTL) has slumped almost 50 percent since the start of the bull run, more than any other stock still in the S&P 500. 
The S&P 500 has turned in a handsome annualized return of 15 percent during the bull market, with the consumer discretionary and information technology indexes each up about 20 percent annually. 
But timing is everything. An investor who bought the S&P 500 a year before the bull market began would have had to weather steep losses, trimming the S&P 500's annualized return since then to 7 percent and narrowing the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors' annualized gains to 12 percent.
GRAPHIC-Annualized growth: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ca4i1y
With analysts slashing estimates for U.S. banks and other multinationals, the S&P 500 traded at a low-point of 10.6 times expected earnings in December 2008, before Wall Street's bear market ended and turned the corner. It is now trading at 16.5 times expected earnings, according to Refinitiv.
After dropping 19.8 percent from its record high close on Sept. 20 through Dec. 24, the S&P 500 has slowly recovered and is now just 7 percent short of regaining that high.

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - A Saudi court has approved an application by detained and indebted billionaire Maan al-Sanea and his company, Saad, to have their case resolved through the kingdom's new bankruptcy law, the company's financial adviser and two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The ruling in February could provide a resolution to one of the kingdom's longest-running debt sagas.
Saad, with interests from banking to healthcare, defaulted together with another conglomerate, Ahmad Hamad al-Gosaibi and Brothers (AHAB), in 2009, leaving banks with unpaid debts of about $22 billion
Creditors have spent the past 10 years pursuing Saad, which is based in the city of Khobar in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, for claims that some observers familiar with the case last year estimated at between $11 billion and $16 billion.
""This is a landmark step for all stakeholders since 2009,"" said Ahmed Ismail, the chief executive of Reemas Consultants, which was appointed as Saad's financial adviser in late 2017 to find a settlement with creditors.
""The regional and international creditors represent more than 85 percent of total debt, some of whom advised filing under the new bankruptcy law,"" he said.
""Given that it is more or less aligned with regional and international commercial law practices, the probability of its success is much higher.""
A commercial court in Dammam last month approved an application for financial reorganization under the terms of the Saudi bankruptcy law and appointed an independent trustee to oversee the process. Such decisions are not made public.
The trustee, Saleh A. Al-Naim, sent a notice to creditors - seen by Reuters - announcing the beginning of the financial reorganization proceedings, and asked them to submit their claims within 90 days.
Saad's filing is among the first to be accepted under Saudi Arabia's bankruptcy law, which came into effect last August and is part of the Saudi government's efforts to make the Arab world's largest economy more attractive to investors.
Until last year the main options for debt defaults were liquidation or cash injections. The law provides more options and regulates procedures such as settlements and liquidation.
Sanea, ranked by Forbes in 2007 as one of the world's 100 richest people, was detained in Khobar in 2017 for unpaid debts dating back to 2009 when Saad Group defaulted.
In late 2017 a three-judge tribunal established to resolve Saad's debt dispute appointed a consortium called Etqaan Alliance to liquidate assets owned by the billionaire by auctions in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, Riyadh and Jeddah.
Etqaan Alliance has already held three auctions for Sanea's vehicles, warehouses and real estate assets. Sources told Reuters last month the auctions raised around 350 million riyals ($93.34 million).
""In addition to strengthening investors' confidence with the local market, the new law will raise the value of the debtors' assets, since they will not be obliged to sell for low prices through an enforced liquidation,"" Ismail said.
""The realized value of the last three auctions was at 30 percent of market value in a normal buyer-and-seller market, which would have significantly jeopardized the recovery ratio for all creditors.""
AHAB, the other defaulted conglomerate, applied to begin a ""protective settlement procedure"" under the bankruptcy law, but in January the Dammam commercial court rejected the filing saying the company had not provided all the information needed as part of the law and its regulations. 

AHAB said last month it filed additional information with the commercial court of appeal at Dammam's commercial court, effectively appealing against its decision.

1431,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 09, 2019 03:47AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Norway Ditches Oil & Gas, Sort Of
Independent oil and gas producers across the world have a problem, but the big global majors can breathe easy. The equities desks of many an investment bank, meanwhile, can rub their hands in anticipation.
A long-awaited report by Norway’s government recommended its sovereign wealth fund sell out of its holdings in 150 oil and gas producing companies, in what it’s styling as a reduction in the country’s exposure to oil prices.
The government avoided an unholy battle with its counterparts elsewhere in Europe by leaving off the list the state-dominated integrated oil and gas giants that are part of most pension funds’ portfolios -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  BP  (LON:BP), France’s  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Italy’s Eni (MI:ENI) -- where it holds stakes of between 2% and 2.5%. It will also stay invested in  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) in the U.S., where it owns just under 1% in each.
But there is now an immediate supply overhang problem for investors in the companies on its list, many of which are popular names among U.S. investors.
They include Apache (NYSE:APA), Anadarko (NYSE:APC), Marathon (NYSE:MRO) and big names from the shale sector such as Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) and LNG-focused producer Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG).
As with Glencore’s about-turn on coal production a couple of weeks ago, the decision both is and isn’t about climate change. Prima facie, it’s a move to disperse a very concentrated financial risk: the fund will still be sitting on billions of dollars’ worth of investments in hydrocarbons and it is seeded by money from Norway’s own oil and gas revenues.
But the risk it’s provisioning against is a permanent downturn in oil and gas prices as the world migrates to renewable sources of energy (and even, ultimately, packaging). And the main factor behind that megatrend is clear enough.
2. Alarm Rings on Corporate Credit
The Bank of International Settlements said this week slowing global growth threatens to usher in a dark era for corporate bonds that could have profound implications for stocks.
Corporate debt in the riskiest investment-grade category, BBB, has surged since the turn of the financial crisis, a period in which the hunt for yield placed corporate debt at the height of fashionable investing.
But as fresh signs of a wobble in the global economy emerge, investment-grade rated corporate debt may face downgrades to high-yield grade the BIS said.
In the event of a potential downgrade in investment-grade bonds to junk status, many institutional investors would be forced ditch their bond holdings as they are usually mandated to hold only low-risk or investment-grade securities.
“Rating-based investment mandates can lead to fire sales,” warned economists Sirio Aramonte and Egemen Eren in the BIS Quarterly Review published on Tuesday. ""If, on the heels of economic weakness, enough issuers were abruptly downgraded from BBB to junk status, mutual funds and, more broadly, other market participants with investment grade mandates could be forced to offload large amounts of bonds quickly.""
The fallout from a potential selloff in corporate bonds would not only raise yields, making it more expensive for heavily-indebted companies to service their debt, but fuel concerns about the risk of defaults, sending share prices sharply lower.
This scenario is not without merit as  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) investors can attest.
Shares of GE plunged in November, following a downgrade of its debt to investment grade the month before, as fears grew the conglomerate's debt was at risk of being downgraded to junk status. GE has pledged to sell plenty of assets to cut its debt.
AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) are also grappling with a debt problem that could quickly turn ugly if corporate bonds come under pressure.
In 2009 default rates hit record highs, the BIS said. Corporate downgrades from 'BBB' levels into junk rose to 11.4% that year in the U.S. and 16.3% in Europe.
3. Smoke-Free Canada?
Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) issued a profit warning that hit shares on Monday.
The Court of Appeal of Quebec upheld two class-action lawsuits against Philip Morris’ Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, as well as Imperial Tobacco Canada and JTI-Macdonald.
Philip Morris said it would be taking a post-tax litigation expenses charge of $142 million, ""the portion of the judgment that it believes is probable and estimable at this time,” even though it will appeal again.
But lower down the company acknowledged it can’t estimate the eventual repercussions, which could put its entire Canadian business at risk.
“(T)here is a significant lack of clarity with respect to several factors, including the actual number of claimants, the associated administrative process for verification of their applications, further proceedings, and actions by parties to these proceedings,” Philip Morris said. “Therefore, the ultimate liability may differ significantly from this amount.”
With the rest of Canada’s provinces also suing for healthcare costs, the tobacco giant must be thinking of any and all options to avoid that ultimate liability."

(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and two other drugmakers on Friday lost a bid to delay a landmark trial set for May in a multibillion-dollar lawsuit by Oklahoma's attorney general accusing them of helping fuel an opioid abuse and overdose epidemic in the state.
Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman's decision was a win for the state, even as one of the lawyers for the state said Purdue had ""threatened"" to file for bankruptcy rather than face the first trial to result from around 2,000 lawsuits nationally.
""This case needs to get to trial because people are dying every day,"" Reggie Whitten, the lawyer for the state, said during a hearing in Norman, Oklahoma.
Reuters, citing people familiar with the matter, on Monday reported that Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue, owned by members of the wealthy Sackler family, was exploring filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Doing so would allow it to address potential legal liabilities while halting the cases.
Eric Pinker, Purdue's lawyer, made no mention of a potential bankruptcy while arguing that the May 28 trial in the lawsuit brought by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter against it, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd should be delayed.
He said delaying the trial to Sept. 16 was necessary because the state belatedly turned over 1.6 million pages of records critical to Purdue's defense. ""This case is not at a posture where it can fairly and fully go to trial in May of this year,"" Pinker said.
But the judge said the drugmakers had not established the state's actions had prejudiced them.
Purdue in a statement said it ""categorically"" denies that the ruling will affect whether it files for bankruptcy. Purdue said it was ""looking at all of its options"" but had made no decisions.
Opioids, including prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The epidemic has prompted lawsuits by state and local governments accusing Purdue and other drugmakers of contributing to the crisis through deceptive marketing that downplayed the risks of addictive opioids.
The companies deny wrongdoing, noting their drugs carried warning labels and pointing to others factors behind the epidemic.

More than 1,600 lawsuits have been consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has pushed for a settlement ahead of the trial before him in October. Other cases, including Oklahoma's, are pending in state courts.

1433,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 09:16PM ET</span>","FAA warns Southwest, union prolonged dispute could pose safety concerns","By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski 
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration warned Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and a union representing its mechanics in a letter on Friday that their prolonged contract dispute could pose safety concerns.
The letter warned that a ""breakdown in the relationship"" between the airline and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association ""raises concerns about the ongoing effectiveness of the airline's safety management system."" 
The union did not immediately comment on the letter, which noted that the FAA is neutral on the labor dispute.
Southwest called the FAA letter ""normal protocol"" for airlines in times of ""significant change,"" such as labor unrest, and is ""designed to ensure continued safe operations during such times at a carrier.""
""We appreciate the FAA’s oversight and maintain our dedicated focus on assuring the highest level of compliance and safety at all times,"" spokeswoman Brandy King said in a statement.
Southwest and the union, which have been in contract negotiations since 2012, are locked in an escalating battle that last week saw the airline file a lawsuit asking a federal judge to intervene.
CEO Gary Kelly said earlier this week the dispute is costing Southwest millions of dollars in lost revenues a week as well as millions of dollars in costs related to flight cancellations and delays.
The union - which represents more than 2,400 Southwest mechanics - disparaged the comments as ""a way to distract the public from Southwest's own degrading safety standards."" 
An FAA spokesman told Reuters: ""As a standard practice, we have increased oversight at this time.""
The FAA letter, from the associate administrator for aviation safety, Ali Bahrami, said he wrote to ""emphasize the importance of ensuring cooperatively, in accordance with FAA standards, the highest level of safety in the airline's operations.""
The FAA trusts the airline and union will work to ensure ""that any judicial order that might result from the litigation does not constrain appropriate safety activities,"" it added.
Dallas-based Southwest, one of the largest domestic U.S. carriers, has said it is committed to operating a safe fleet and that every maintenance report is investigated.
An unprecedented number of out-of-service aircraft in recent weeks at four of Southwest's maintenance locations has forced the airline to delay or cancel hundreds of flights.

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 09:06PM ET</span>",Prison authorities say they are investigating 'pharma bro' Shkreli,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Bureau of Prisons said on Friday it was investigating former drug company executive Martin Shkreli's conduct in prison after the Wall Street Journal reported he was still helping run his old company using a contraband cellphone.
""When there are allegations of misconduct, they are thoroughly investigated and appropriate action is taken if such allegations are proven true,"" the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement. ""This allegation is currently under investigation.""
The investigation was first reported by the Journal.
The bureau said that possessing a contraband cellphone was considered a severe offense and could result in discipline, including being separated from the inmate population and having visits restricted. It also said that possessing a contraband phone could lead to criminal charges.
Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Shkreli, declined to comment.
The Journal reported on Thursday that Shkreli, 35, still wields significant influence over the drug company he founded, Phoenixus AG, formerly called Turing Pharmaceuticals. Shkreli is about 17 months into a seven-year prison sentence for defrauding investors in a previous company.
The FBI has interviewed Shkreli's associates about his role in the company, the Journal said, citing unnamed people who had been interviewed. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shkreli, born in Brooklyn to Albanian immigrant parents, became known as the ""Pharma Bro"" in September 2015 after founding Turing Pharmaceuticals, buying the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim and raising its price by 5,000 percent to $750 per pill. In December 2015, he was indicted on unrelated securities fraud charges.
Prosecutors said he defrauded investors in two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, schemed to prop up the stock price of Retrophin, the drug company he founded in 2011. A jury in federal court in Brooklyn found him guilty in August 2017.

He is at Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix, a low-security prison in New Jersey.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 09:06PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC to review stock trading rules in big potential shakeup,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is launching a review of the main set of rules governing stock trading, opening the door to the biggest potential changes in a decade-and-a-half, the head of the agency said on Friday.
The possible changes are aimed at making it easier to trade illiquid stocks, making more trading information available to investors, and improving the speed and quality of public data feeds needed for trading. 
The SEC in 2005 adopted a broad framework called Regulation National Market System that was largely aimed at ensuring retail investors get the best price possible and preventing trades from being executed at prices that are inferior to bids and offers displayed on other trading venues.
Since then, faster, more sophisticated technology has put a bigger focus on rapid-fire, high-speed trading. There has also been an influx of new electronic stock exchanges, fragmenting liquidity and increasing costs for brokers around exchange connectivity and market data needed to fuel algorithmic trading. 
""It is clear that the market challenges we faced in the early 2000s are not the same as the issues that we confront over a decade later,"" Jay Clayton, chairman of the SEC, said at an event in New York.
To get a better grasp of current market issues, the SEC held a series of roundtable discussions with industry experts last year that led to potential rule-making recommendations around thinly-traded securities, combating retail fraud, and market data and market access, Clayton said.
Some areas the SEC is looking at include: 
- Increasing the speed of, and adding more stock price information to, public data feeds to help make them more competitive against the more expensive, private data feeds sold by most stock exchanges. 
- Allowing thinly-traded securities to trade only on their listing market, rather than on all 13 U.S. stock exchanges. 
- Improving disclosure around reverse mergers.
- Adjusting the quote size of some high-priced stocks. 
The 2019 review follows an active 2018 for the SEC. 

The regulator adopted rules to increase transparency around broker-dealer stock order routing and private off-exchange trading venues. It also ordered a pilot program to test banning lucrative rebate payments that exchanges make to brokers for liquidity-adding stock orders.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 07:25PM ET</span>",Austria's Signa partners with RFR to buy New York's Chrysler Building: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - Signa Holding GmbH, Austria's largest privately owned real estate company, will buy the iconic Chrysler Building in New York City in partnership with property firm RFR Holding LLC for about $150 million, people familiar with the matter said.
Signa and RFR are equal partners in a joint venture that signed an agreement on Friday to buy the building from the Abu Dhabi Investment Council at a fraction of what it paid to own it, the sources said. 
Abu Dhabi had splashed out $800 million to own a 90 percent stake in the Chrysler Building at the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. Property values subsequently crashed, and in some cases never fully recovered. 
The sources asked not to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Signa Holding and CBRE, which has handled the sale process of the asset, declined to comment. RFR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The art-deco tower, which was the world's tallest building when completed in 1930 only to be eclipsed by New York's Empire State Building, is considered a crown jewel of the city's skyline. Its old age is fueling maintenance costs, however, and its historical status has often made modifications to the needs of its tenants difficult.
Weighing on the sale price was the rent that the Chrysler Building has to pay to the Cooper Union school, because it does not own the land underneath the property. The annual rent increased to $32.5 million in 2018 from $7.75 million in 2017. The lease will increase to $41 million in 2028, according to financial statements from Cooper Union.
The deal marks Signa's debut in the U.S. property sector. Led by its founder Rend Benkoe, Signa has a sprawling real estate and retail portfolio in Europe. Its real estate assets are worth more than 14 billion euros ($16 billion), while its development projects have a gross asset value of over 8 billion euros, according to its website. 
Signa is no stranger in investing in numerous landmark buildings in prime locations. Its holdings include KaDeWe and the Upper West Tower in Berlin, Goldenes Quarter with the Park Hyatt Hotel in Vienna, Alte Akademie in Munich, and Alsterhaus and Alsterarkaden in Hamburg.
Founded in 1991 by Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs, RFR made its name in real estate by owning and managing some of Manhattan's most prestigious office properties, including the Seagram Building and Lever House, which are located on Park Avenue.
Signa and RFR have done deals together in the past, including in 2017, when Signa agreed to buy five landmark properties from RFR in Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Munich for about 1.5 billion euros.

The Real Deal had earlier reported RFR's role in the deal for the Chrysler Building.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 07:22PM ET</span>",Wall Street weekahead: Housing shares dependent on economy easing but not falling,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The pace of U.S. economic growth may prove to be critical for shares of homebuilders, which have climbed sharply as spring approaches. An easing economy that allows for lower interest rates supports an optimistic outlook for the industry, investors say, but any hints of a sustained downturn could sink shares.
So far this year, the PHLX Housing Index has jumped 16.3 percent, versus a 9 percent advance for the benchmark S&P 500. 
Housing shares tend to rise from late fall to early spring, in anticipation of the busiest selling season of the year for homebuilders. Since 2002, the PHLX Housing Index has averaged a 7.1 percent rise between the end of October and the end of April, versus a 3.8 percent drop outside of that period.
This year's run-up is pronounced given the sharp tumble U.S. stocks took in the fourth quarter of 2018. The PHLX Housing Index fell 15.7 percent, even more than the S&P 500's 14 percent decline. The seasonal trend in homebuilding shares has been resilient even in the face of dismal data that showed U.S. housing starts dropped to their lowest level in two years.
Yet a survey from the National Association of Home Builders showed that homebuilder confidence increased in February, and the latest housing starts data released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed that homebuilding increased more than expected in January.
Along with a positive outlook for the U.S. economy as a whole, those data support a sustained climb in homebuilding shares, some investors say.
""The risk-reward ratio for housing still looks good, as long as employment and household formation remain strong,"" said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital in Dallas.
Elevated home prices have been one of the biggest hurdles for the industry, both investors and analysts say. Rising mortgage rates, which climbed past 5 percent last fall, exacerbated concerns about affordability.
But mortgage rates have since eased in tandem with Treasury yields as the Federal Reserve has indicated it will pause interest-rate hikes and inflation has remained benign. U.S. 30-year mortgage rates are tied to the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield.
""We have had a revival in housing because rates have declined,"" said Gary Shilling, president of the investment research firm A. Gary Shilling & Co. in Springfield, New Jersey.
Home prices have also moderated, with the S&P/Case-Shiller index showing prices increasing in December by the smallest percentage since November 2014.
The 2017 U.S. federal tax overhaul capped deductions for state and local taxes, which raised concerns that people would be dissuaded from buying homes in high-tax states such as New York and California. But a slowdown in those markets may be offset by an uptick in other regional markets. 
The Las Vegas market, for instance, has drawn interest from home buyers deterred by high tax rates in California, said Jack Micenko, housing analyst at Susequehanna Financial Group in New York.
Homebuilders that focus on entry-level homes are also especially poised to reap benefits as more Millennials seek to buy their first homes, said Marshall. Hodges owns shares of Century Communities Inc, D.R. Horton Inc and LGI Homes Inc, all of which build starter homes.
Still, given persistently high home prices, affordability could weigh on the housing market once again, said Torsten Sløk, chief international economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities in New York.
That may be especially the case if economic conditions show signs of deterioration. Such concerns rose on Friday when Labor Department data showed the U.S. economy added just 20,000 jobs in February.
While an economic slowdown would support a further decline in interest rates, the ensuing downturn in consumer confidence would outweigh the effect of more accomodative rates, investors say.
""The labor market is crucial for consumer confidence,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. ""If it suddenly slows down to where it looks like a recession is coming, the housing market would suffer.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sam Altman is stepping down from his post as president of Y Combinator, the startup accelerator said on Friday, a pivotal change for the organization that was influential in the creation of startups such as Airbnb, Dropbox Inc and Cruise.
As YC's second-ever president, Altman spent five years expanding the program's reach and scale. He will move on to spending more time working on artificial intelligence efforts while remaining chairman at the company, YC said in a blog post Friday.
YC offers a startup program to which aspiring entrepreneurs can apply to receive mentorship and a $150,000 investment, and participate in a three-month bootcamp to work on their startup idea. YC gained influence in the tech industry after a number of startups that completed the program went on to achieve high valuations and be acquired by big companies. Cruise, for instance, was acquired by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) for $1 billion, and Airbnb, valued at $31 billion, is preparing for an IPO this year.
Of course, many YC graduates fail, too.
Many entrepreneurs apply to YC for the access to Silicon Valley venture capitalists; every YC program ends with a Demo Day when startups can show off their budding companies to prospective investors. 
YC also said on Friday it plans to move to San Francisco from Mountain View, California, the latest sign of how startup activity has moved away from what was traditionally Silicon Valley and concentrated in San Francisco. 
Under Altman's leadership, YC expanded beyond nascent startups and created a separate fund and training program for larger, more mature tech companies. It also expanded into China and added a host of other startup programs.
Altman has become one of the startup industry's more outspoken leaders on issues such as universal basic income and the safety and ethical implications of artificial intelligence. He helped found non-profit AI research organization OpenAI.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 05:46PM ET</span>",Iconic Barbie doll celebrates 60 years of evolution,"(Reuters) - Barbie, the fashion doll famous around the world, celebrates her 60th anniversary on Saturday with new collections honoring real-life role models and careers in which women remain under-represented. 
It is part of Barbie's evolution over the decades since her debut at the New York Toy Fair on March 9, 1959.
To mark the milestone, manufacturer  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) created Barbie versions of 20 inspirational women from Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka to British model and activist Adwoa Aboah. 
The company also released six dolls representing the careers of astronaut, pilot, athlete, journalist, politician and firefighter, all fields in which Mattel said women are still under-represented.
Barbie is a cultural icon celebrated by the likes of Andy Warhol, the Paris Louvre museum and the 1997 satirical song ""Barbie Girl"" by Scandinavian pop group Aqua. She was named after the daughter of creator Ruth Handler.
Barbie has taken on more than 200 careers from surgeon to video game developer since her debut, when she wore a black-and-white striped swimsuit. After criticism that Barbie's curvy body promoted an unrealistic image for young girls, Mattel added a wider variety of skin tones, body shapes, hijab-wearing dolls and science kits to make Barbie more educational. 

Barbie is also going glamorous for her six-decade milestone. A diamond-anniversary doll wears a sparkly silver ball gown.

1443,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 05:28PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow's Late-Stage Rally Falls Short Amid Slump in U.S. Job Gains,"Investing.com - The Dow closed lower for a fifth-straight day Friday as a late-session rally proved too little too late following an earlier slide on data showing the U.S. economy created fewer jobs than expected, adding to fears of a slowdown in global growth.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.09% to close at 25,450.24 after recovering from a session low of 25,252.46. The S&P 500 lost 0.21%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.18%.
For the week, the Dow was off 2.2%, its second weekly loss in a row. The S&P 500 fell 2.15%. The Nasdaq dropped 2.5%. The Nasdaq's decline was its first after 10 straight weekly gains. The S&P 500 snapped a five-week winning streak.
The U.S. Labor Department reported 20,000 jobs were created last month, well short of economists' estimates for around 181,000, raising fears the slowdown in global growth could be starting to make a dent on the U.S. economy. But wage growth and the unemployment rate did offer some solace for investors and traders as both measures exceeded economists' estimates.
Analysts downplayed the report, saying weather-related noise had weighed on job creation.
The slowing may reflect ""some moderation"" in the trend, but much of decline was likely caused by ""weather effects,"" High Frequency Economics said. ""While the three-month average of job gains is a still-healthy 186,000, that is below what has been a 200K-plus trend.""
""The trend likely remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down over time,"" HFE added.
The slump in U.S. job growth comes during a week in which signs of a slowdown in the global economy have been front and center.
China said Friday its exports slid the most in three years in February compared with a year earlier. A day earlier, the European Union launched a fresh stimulus measure to prop up lending after warning the slumber in euro-area growth would likely continue into the current year.
Fears that oil-demand growth could suffer in the wake of a wobble in the global economy, pressured U.S. crude prices, sending energy stocks lower. Brent Oil Futures also fell.
In a sign of souring investor appetite on risk assets, defensive corners of the market were in favor as utilities, real estate and consumer staples ended the day higher.
Consumer staples were also boosted by a 5.1% surge in Costco Wholesale shares after the wholesale members club posted a fiscal-second-quarter profit that topped estimates from Investing.com. The report prompted bullish calls from analysts on Wall Street.
RBC raised its price target on shares of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) to $250 from $235.
Oppenheimer raised its price target on Costco's stock to $245 from $240, citing potential the retailer may declare a special dividend of as much as $10 that ""could add more upside to the story as the year progresses.""
In other corporate news, DowDuPont confirmed it would split into three separate companies - Dow, DuPont (NYSE:DWDP) and Corteva Agriscience - starting April 1.
The new  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) should begin trading in early April followed later by the agricultural business, Corteva.
""Today's announcement marks a major milestone toward successfully separating Dow on April 1, to be followed by the expected separation of Corteva Agriscience from the new DuPont on June 1"" that will bring about three independent companies, Ed Breen, chief executive officer of DowDuPont, said in a statement.
Dow will be an independent, publicly traded company that will list on the New York Stock Exchange on or about March 20 under the ticker symbol ""DOW WI"" and begin trading April 2 under the ticker symbol ""DOW.""
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 04:35PM ET</span>",Wall Street extends losing streak after weak U.S. jobs data,"By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell for a fifth straight session on Friday and posted their biggest weekly declines since the market tumbled at the end of 2018, as a weak U.S. jobs report ignited more concerns about the global economy.
But Friday's declines were only slight. Stocks significantly pared losses late in the day as investors reassessed the employment report and considered whether the market's recent slump was ending.
The eventful session came as some Wall Street watchers prepared to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the start of the S&P 500's bull market run that took root during the financial crisis.
U.S. employment growth almost stalled in February, with the economy creating only 20,000 jobs, adding to signs of a sharp slowdown in economic activity in the first quarter. The payroll gains reported by the Labor Department were the weakest since September 2017.
The weak U.S. report added to economic fears also fanned by a sharp fall in China's exports and after the European Central Bank slashed growth forecasts for the region on Thursday.
""People are worried about the jobs report and global growth in general and that is pushing markets lower,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company in Milwaukee.
But stocks finished well above their lows for the session, as investors noted the jobs report was affected by seasonal effects and the federal government shutdown.
“As people take a step away from the headline number, they say, ‘Hey, this is just one report. The economy is likely not as weak as this one report would suggest',"" said Keith Lerner, Chief Market Strategist, SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.99 points, or 0.09 percent, to 25,450.24, the S&P 500 lost 5.86 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,743.07 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 13.32 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,408.14.
The Nasdaq snapped a 10-week streak of weekly gains.
The closely watched Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.5 percent, dropping for an 11th straight session, its longest streak of declines since 1972, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The recent pullback has paused a rally to start 2019 that has been fueled by optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal and by beliefs the Federal Reserve will be less aggressive in raising interest rates. The S&P 500 is up 9.4 percent this year.
""In the first part of the year, what we have largely done is clawed back what we lost in the fourth quarter that was based upon geopolitical and Federal Reserve fears that are now ebbing,"" Schutte said.
Energy fell the most among the 11 major sectors, declining 2.0 percent as oil prices also fell.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) shares dropped 1.4 percent and were among the biggest drags on the S&P.
Utilities led gains among the sectors, while two other defensive groups, consumer staples and real estate, finished positive. 
In corporate news, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) shares rose 5.1 percent after the warehouse club operator's quarterly profit topped estimates.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 28 new highs and 51 new lows. 

About 7.1 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 7.3 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

1445,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>",Brazil's Sao Paulo state to offer tax incentives to automakers,"By Aluisio Alves
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's Sao Paulo state said on Friday it would offer fresh tax incentives to automakers, weeks after Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it would shut down a plant there with 3,000 employees and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) hinted it might do the same before backtracking.
Sao Paulo is the historical center of Brazil's auto industry, which was one of the world's five biggest until a recent downturn from which it is still recovering. It has been losing ground in recent years to other Brazilian states which have showered automakers with incentives.
Sao Paulo state Governor Joao Doria said at a press conference that the state would offer a discount of up to 25 percent over Brazil's ICMS value-added tax to automakers which invest at least 1 billion reais ($258.78 million) and create 400 new jobs.
Doria added that the government is still trying to help sell Ford's factory in Sao Bernardo do Campo, which is scheduled to be closed by year's end. He said the state is negotiating with three companies, which he did not name.
He did not say when the incentives would take effect. Legislative approval is not required.
Ford declined to comment, while GM said in a statement the incentives would help as the industry seeks to be more competitive.

1453,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: EDP readies sale of electricity generation assets in Portugal - sources,"By Clara Denina , Andrés González and Sergio Goncalves
LONDON/LISBON (Reuters) - EDP-Energia de Portugal is working on a plan to sell some of its electricity generation assets in Portugal, three sources close to the matter said, in an effort to free up cash to drive its renewable energy expansion.
The plan is expected to be unveiled at an investors meeting in London on March 12, one of the sources said. 
EDP, which was approached last year by China Three Gorges (CTG) with a 9 billion euro takeover proposal, owns conventional generation assets in Portugal and Spain that are worth around 1.7 billion euros ($1.9 billion). 
It is currently looking to divest part of its operations in Portugal, which all together account for 90 percent of electricity generation and distribution in the country. 
The move comes after activist investor Elliott launched a campaign to try to thwart CTG's takeover proposal, which EDP has described as too low.
The sale of the Portuguese assets also reflects some of Elliott's demands, one of the sources said. 
Elliott has built a 2.9 percent stake in EDP, becoming one of the utility's top ten shareholders.
It wants EDP's investors to shun CTG, the largest shareholder in EDP with a 23 percent stake, and back an alternative plan to divest assets across Brazil, Portugal and Spain which could be worth about 7.6 billion euros.
EDP, led by Chief Executive Officer António Mexia, will meet the company's investors at the Berkeley Hotel in London's upmarket Knightsbridge district on March 12, the sources said, and will outline a new strategy to raise cash from asset sales to finance renewable energy projects.
The company has also started a parallel sale process for its thermoeletric plant Pecem in the Brazilian state of Ceara, which could be valued at around $520 million, a third source said. 
Meanwhile, CTG's bid proposal needs regulatory approval in a number of countries, including Brazil, the United States, Portugal and the European Union.
Reuters reported on Jan. 25 that CTG had halted talks with EU regulators about the proposed takeover.
European utilities have been forced to change business models by an increasing shift to renewable energy sources.
EDP owns wind energy subsidiary EDPR, which manages operating assets in 11 countries and is also the target of CTG's takeover plan.

Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN) reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of $5.02 a share above expectations from Investing.com for earnings of $4.92 a share. Revenue of $849.6 million was just below expectations for $850.8 million.
The company reported strong visitations and spending growth from local skiers, while destination guest visitation was largely in line with expectations.
Skier visitation at the company's resorts, including those in Colorado and Utah, jumped 27% as total effective ticket price decreased 7.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to ""higher skier visitation by season pass holders and the impact of the new military epic pass,"" the company said. This was partially offset, however, by price increases in both its lift ticket and season pass products. In addition, there has been ample snow at its resorts this winter, the company said.
The above-consensus earnings comes just months after the company in January trimmed its performance outlook for the fiscal year, after reporting destination guest visitation rates came up short prior to the holidays.
""As noted in our January press release, we are lowering our guidance for fiscal 2019, primarily due to the disappointing results from destination visitation in the pre-holiday period and also due to shortfalls from expectations at our Tahoe resorts and Whistler Blackcomb,"" the company said.
The company reduced fiscal 2019 net income guidance to a range of $268 million to $300 million from a prior range of $288 million to $335 million.
On a less somber note, the skiing resorts company hiked its quarterly dividend 20% to $1.76 per share from $1.47 per share in the prior quarter.
The stock has had a volatile run since peaking at $302.76 in early October. It fell to $179.60 in early January before rebounding."

Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said Germany’s vaunted auto industry is headed for a rough patch, predicting consumers will put off new-vehicle purchases and wait for manufacturers to switch over to electric cars.
German car companies are on the precipice of transforming their fleets to electric as soon as 2021, Fink said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Erik Schatzker.
“If you were a consumer today, would you wait for that lifetime change of automobiles?” Fink said Thursday. “I think the answer is they will. I actually think you’re going to see a momentary slowdown in car demand. People are going to wait for that ’21 model, ’22 model.”
Fink, 66, called for Germany to increase fiscal spending to prepare cities and autobahns for the electrification of cars, and said he’s delivered this message to government leaders.

1457,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 12:00PM ET</span>",The Perfect Bull Market Portfolio Might Have Blown Up Your Firm,"(Bloomberg) -- Would you do it all over, knowing what you know now? For a professional money manager looking back on the bull market at its 10th anniversary, it’s a hard question to answer.
Here’s a thought. Imagine you knew exactly which stocks to pick a decade ago, the ones that would do best during the rally -- like, literally. You knew Jazz Pharmaceuticals would soar 23,000 percent, that Abiomed and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) would rise more than 60 fold and Exact Sciences would go from 78 cents to $85. You were granted that knowledge, and you went out and bought those stocks. What would life have been like on the way to world-beating gains?
Worse than you think. From time to time, big losses are inescapable even in a portfolio chosen with 20-20 hindsight, with underperformance often dragging on long enough to put a money manager’s job in jeopardy.
The idea is a variation on an experiment tested three years ago by the research firm Alpha Architect, in a study designed to demonstrate how futile it is for professional investors to try always to outperform. The paper, “Even God Would Get Fired as an Active Manager,” showed that perfect stock-picking clairvoyance over long stretches wouldn’t spare a money manager from rough patches that would threaten his career.
Researchers looked at the period all the way back to 1927 but Alpha Architects’s founder, Wesley Gray, and quantitative researcher Tao Wang agreed to run the numbers on the bull market to see how the perfect portfolio fared in honor of its latest anniversary. And while the pain of owning only winners was a little less over the last decade, the results still cast a brutal light on life on Wall Street.
First the (somewhat obvious) good news. An equal-weight portfolio comprising the best 100 stocks in the Russell 1000 since the bottom of the financial crisis would have returned nearly 20 times the benchmark, according to data compiled by Alpha Architect. But while arriving at that destination felt great, the travel it took to get there was rough.
Take 2011, for example. Stocks that ended up trouncing the S&P 500 over the decade fell behind the benchmark by as much as 10 percent for part of that year, a dose of weakness that would’ve tested a client’s patience. The perfect portfolio plummeted more than 22 percent at one point -- six percentage points more than largest drawdown for the S&P 500. Just half a year later, the god group suffered a three-month stretch of trailing its benchmark again. (The firm calculated returns at monthly intervals, not daily.)
The goal of the original Alpha Architect experiment was to answer the question: “If God is omnipotent, could he create a long-term active investment strategy fund that was so good that he could never get fired?” The conclusion was no. While long-term returns were obviously astounding, shorter stretches -- the ones by which fund managers are often judged -- were “abysmal.”
“Investment managers typically have a set philosophy, and philosophies don’t always work,” said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark, which has around $45 billion on its platform. “Even determining what the right thing to do in terms of performance, 10 years is pretty long. Five years is longer than most portfolio managers would keep their job if they didn’t perform well.”
Just look at the hair-raising routes of the 10-year winners to see how gut-wrenching volatility can get even in sure-thing picks. On March 9, 2009, Jazz Pharmaceuticals traded for 58 cents a share. Ten years and 23,327 percent later, it’s worth $136. From 2015 to 2016, the company lost half its value. In 2014 and last year, it suffered two separate drops of about 30 percent or more.
The next five companies -- Exact Sciences, Ulta Beauty, Lululemon Athletica, Netflix, and Abiomed -- have all endured stretches over the last 10 years when their stock fell almost 40 percent or more.
Scott Davis, who is 62 years old and a portfolio manager for the Columbia Dividend Income Fund, started his career back in 1980. What’s helped him deal with the ups and downs and constant benchmark comparisons is something that only comes with time -- age.
“You worry about it a lot when you’re younger and you’re thinking about your career,” he said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “There’s a temptation to say, ‘Oh, it’s not working, I’ve got to change what I do.”’
This weekend officially marks the 10th birthday of the bull market -- the longest ever. It’s come close to extinction twice, with intraday declines in the S&P 500 topping 20 percent in 2011 and again more recently in December. Each time, it was saved at the last minute.
“One of the most important attributes of any portfolio manager is having the fortitude to go through those periods,” said Eric Marshall, president and director of research for Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.
Back in March 2009 he bought shares of Texas Pacific Land Trust for $25 each, and his portfolio has held the stock in some capacity ever since. It’s now up more than 4,500 percent, although last year its value was cut in half. Marshall’s thought process when purchasing the stock back at the bottom hinged on a simple equation.
“For this investment to work, we need one thing to happen -- the world not come to an end,” he said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “In March of ’09, it was like the world was coming to an end.”

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 11:36AM ET</span>",Worst start to year for equity flows since 2008: BAML,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A $10 billion wipeout over the last week has compounded the worst start to a year for equity flows since 2008, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists said on Friday.
Citing data from flow-tracker EPFR, BAML's analysts calculated that just over $60 billion has now been yanked out of equities this year. Almost $80 billion has been pulled from developed markets, while $18.5 billion has gone into emerging markets.
They added that last week also saw the fourth-biggest inflow on record into 'investment grade' bonds at $9.5 billion and that ""Europe = Japan"" - a reference to long-term aneamic growth and low interest rates - was now the most consensus trade in the world by their calculations.
""Europe = Japan is correct and consensus,"" they said, though they also reckon European assets will outperform in the second quarter now that the European Central Bank has shifted back towards stimulus and there are signs of renewed growth emerging from China.
For many, the monster outflows from stocks will appear at odds with what has been a red-hot start to the year for equity markets.
Despite a wobble this week, MSCI's main world share index has seen one of its best ever starts to a year thanks to surges of 20 percent or more for the likes of Wall Street's S&P 500 and China's main indexes.
The apparent disconnect could be explained by the fact that EPFR data captures only a portion of investment funds but also that firms themselves have been buying up their own shares this year after they became much cheaper last year.
Recent data from Biryinyi associates showed that U.S. companies had already announced plans to buy back nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars of their own stock by the end of February, which was up 7 percent on the same time a year ago.
BAML's analysts noted separately meanwhile that this weekend marks 10 years since the post-financial crisis global equity bull run started.
During that time the value, or market capitalization, of U.S. stocks has surged by $21.3 trillion which is three times the $6.5 trillion overall rise in annual economic output of the U.S. economy.
The top three performers in the Dow Jones index have been plane maker Boeing (NYSE:BA), iPhone giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Unitedhealth Group, while the worst performers have been Walgreen, oil firm Exxon (NYSE:XOM), and IT firm  IBM  (NYSE:IBM).
Annualized total return since the March 2009 low have been 17.5 percent for the S&P 500, versus 13.8 percent by Japan's Nikkei 225 and 9.3 percent for Europe's STOXX 600.

""Ten years after Global Financial Crisis, Eurozone trapped in deflationary ""Japanification"" of growth & interest rates; EU rates unlikely to rise, EU equities in 'value trap'"" BAML's analysts said.

Mining in indigenous reserves is currently prohibited.
Minister Bento Albuquerque said Brazil plans to overhaul mining rules to prevent future disasters such as the dam bursting at a Vale SA facility in January that killed hundreds and also allow for more economic growth in the sector, including of mineral exports.
""That legislative effort shall also include the regulation of the use of indigenous and other areas according to what the Brazilian federal constitution states,"" Albuquerque said at an event in Washington, D.C. A video of the remarks were posted late on Thursday.
Brazil's 1988 constitution states that mining can only be conducted in indigenous areas under rules approved by the country's Congress that ensure the indigenous communities affected benefit. 
But Congress never established such rules, effectively prohibiting mining in indigenous areas until such a law is passed. Albuquerque did not elaborate on efforts to open indigenous areas to mining.
Environmentalists and non-government organizations say that the indigenous are the best defenders of natural habitats and fear that Bolsonaro's promise to bring economic development to reservations could drive environmental destruction.
About 13 percent of Brazil's territory is set aside as indigenous reservations with much of it in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the world's largest tropical rainforest.
""The Amazon is very important to the country. Not just in the respect of preserving the environment for the value it represents to the planet, but also in terms of its riches,"" Albuquerque said. ""The riches of the Amazon have to be explored in a rational and sustainable way that does not harm the environment.""
The government will also make laws more ""severe and effective"" to prevent disasters like the rupture of the tailings dam at the Vale facility in Brumadinho that buried hundreds of people in mining waste in January, he said.
That includes plans to overhaul Brazil's decades old mining code. A similar effort by Bolsonaro's predecessor Michel Temer failed last year.
The newly created regulator National Mining Agency (ANM) must be given more workers and funding to carry out oversight of mining operations, he said.
The accident in Brumadinho was not the result of a lack of legislation, he said.

""I don't want to give a prejudgment, but I have no doubt whatsoever that if the legal framework had been complied with ... that accident would not have occurred.""

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedbank is facing pressure from some of its biggest shareholders to reveal more about what it knew about allegations of money-laundering linked to Danske Bank.
Six of Swedbank's top 20 investors, collectively holding around 14.5 percent of its shares, told Reuters they were seeking more information from the Swedish lender, after a media report last month linked it to the scandal involving Danske.
The Swedish TV program, aired on Feb. 20, alleged that at least 40 billion Swedish crowns ($4.25 billion) had moved between Swedbank and Danske accounts between 2007 and 2015. The report prompted an investigation by financial watchdogs in Sweden and Estonia.
Swedbank's chief executive Birgitte Bonnesen said at the time that she could not comment on specific transactions due to Swedish banking secrecy laws. The bank is due to complete an external report, commissioned by Bonnesen after investor pressure, before its annual general meeting on March 28.
""We are having a dialogue with the company on the issues that we think we need more information on to be able to continue to be investors in the company,"" Magdalena Wahlqvist Alveskog, acting CEO of Handelsbanken Asset Management which is Swedbank's 11th largest investor with a 1.85 percent holding, told Reuters.
Alveskog said that her asset management fund had questioned Swedbank at the time of the Danske Bank revelations and said she had not been happy with the answers Swedbank had given.
Danske Bank is being investigated in five countries over some 200 billion euros ($226 billion) of suspicious payments from Russia, ex-Soviet states and elsewhere that were found to have flowed through its Estonian branch. Several other European and overseas banks have been drawn into the scandal.
Bonnesen, Swedbank's head of Baltic banking between 2011 and 2014 and Chief Audit Executive between 2009 and 2011, said on Jan. 29 that she saw no links between Swedbank and the Danske Bank money laundering scandal. But on Feb. 20, she said she could not guarantee every suspect transaction had been detected.
A spokesman for AMF, Swedbank's fifth largest investor with a 4.77 percent stake, said more transparency was needed.
""We are waiting for the results of the investigation and then we will make further decisions about how to act at the annual meeting and so forth,"" the spokesman said.
Bonnesen and Lars Idermark, Swedbank's chairman, declined to comment, while three other board members approached by Reuters either declined to comment or did not respond.
Swedbank's head of communications, Gabriel Francke Rodau, said Bonnesen had expressed in recent days that she had reflected over her style of communication.
Bonnesen said in an interview with Swedish news agency TT on Tuesday that her answers after the Feb. 20 TV report had been correct but that she could have given more context and nuance.
FACTS ON THE TABLE
AMF and Alecta, Swedbank's third largest investor with 4.86 percent of its shares and a Swedish pension fund holding about 85 billion euros under management, have representatives on the committee that selects Swedbank's board.
Alecta called on the bank to get ""all facts on the table regarding the alleged shortcomings"".
""If we do not crack down harder on money laundering, we are playing fast and loose with European citizens pension savings,"" Alecta's chief executive Magnus Billing said in an email.
Swedish fund Lannebo, another top 20 investor, said Swedbank's management, including Bonnesen, had made mistakes in dealing with the fallout from the Swedish TV report.
""Bonnesen could have communicated differently due to the importance of trust in a bank. That trust has now been harmed ..."" Maria Nordqvist, Lannebo's head of responsible investments, said. 
A fifth top-20 Swedbank investor, who declined to be identified, said that the results of the external report would be critical in deciding on its next steps. 
And Hans Ek, acting head of SEB Investment Management AB, told Reuters that he had regular discussions with Swedbank, including on the issue of money laundering allegations, which was high on its agenda for Nordic financial firms.
Norway's sovereign wealth fund, one of the world's biggest investors, did not comment directly on Swedbank but is also watching developments closely.
""We expect that the companies are dealing with serious issues in a very profound and diligent way. We have no indication that this is not the case at the moment,"" said Yngve Slyngstad, CEO of the fund, which held 2.03 percent of Swedbank shares at the end of 2018.
A further seven shareholders contacted by Reuters did not respond or declined to comment.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 09:05AM ET</span>",'Short' pound bets fade three weeks before Brexit,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - With three weeks to go before Britain is due to exit the European Union, interest in selling the pound against the dollar and euro is dwindling as currency traders bet that the worst-case scenario of a no-deal Brexit will be averted.
Overall positioning still implies a degree of caution about the outcome. But with parliament expected to extend the date of Brexit beyond March 29 rather than let Britain crash out of the EU without a transition period to minimize economic disruption, the pound has surged to multi-month highs in recent weeks. 
It is up 7 percent against the dollar year-to-date, making it the world's best performing major currency. 
Various positioning gauges meanwhile indicate that selling sterling in anticipation of being able to buy pounds back later at a lower price -- ""shorting"" -- is becoming less popular. 
According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which measures changes in investor positioning, speculators had a net $3.2 billion short position on the pound versus the dollar on Feb. 25. That is half the $6.5 billion hit in September 2018 and well below the $4.84 billion seen on Dec. 21, before the U.S. federal government shutdown.
CFTC offers the most reliable and frequent update of investor positions though its data measures only a tiny fraction of the market. 
CFTC data was unavailable for some weeks due to the shutdown, and while figures are now trickling out, more up-to-date positioning indicators compiled by banks and funds show short positions are gradually being washed out.
BNP Paribas's FX positioning tracker, for example, shows that on a scale of +50/-50, sterling 'shorts' were completely pared back in the week to March 4 for a score of plus 4, versus minus 5 the previous week. The score had ended 2018 at -30 and was -18 in the week to Jan. 21.
Separately, analysis by RBC Capital Markets of third-party flows data shows pound buying surged in two distinct rounds recently, especially against the euro, FX quantitative trader Robert Turner said.
""We've seen a huge amount of interest in buying sterling through our positioning monitor recently,"" Turner said. ""Most of the interest is in playing sterling strength versus the euro, rather than dollar.""
The first round was in the week of Jan. 21 and the second occurred on one day, Jan. 25, as markets ramped up expectations that a no-deal Brexit would be avoided. Purchases eased off after that but picked up again last week, he added. 
Investors had a small euro long position versus the pound in early 2019 of +11 percent, swinging to a record short of -100 percent on Feb. 27. The current score is -78 percent, RBC said.
(GRAPHIC: RBC Positions and Flows - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ESpk6D)
Similarly, Nomura's positioning metrics indicate that net short sterling positions have declined to near their lowest levels this year, with a net short bet of less than $3 billion. At end-2018, net short positions amounted to $4.5 billion.
The sizeable drop in overall short pound positions gels with a reassessment of the chances of a no-deal Brexit -- major banks, including Deutsche and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now assign just a 10-15 percent probability to that 'worst-case' outcome.
NOT CHEERFUL YET
Investors are far from cheerful on the pound's prospects, however -- short positions at end-February, according to the CFTC, were well above a five-year average of $2.7 billion. 
""There is a bit of optimism on the pound on hopes that a hard Brexit is avoided but the nature of any delay in the Article 50 process, or even an acceptance of May's deal, introduces new possibilities and risks for investors to consider,"" said UBS FX strategist Lefteris Farmakis. 
Postponing the date of Britain's planned departure or a tilt toward a softer Brexit than envisaged in May's deal would open up the prospect of fresh negotiations between London and Brussels, dampening any knee-jerk rally. 
Caution is also evident in options markets where investors have reduced their Brexit hedging or speculative bets, but not fully, according to traders. 
Another index, compiled by currency fund Millennium Global Investments, shows pound positioning at -0.9 on a scale of -5/+5. It was -1.4 a week ago and around -1.7 a month earlier.
(GRAPHIC: GBP positioning from Millenium - https://tmsnrt.rs/2EUXUNC)
""Our positioning indicator shows positioning is still short as there is still a bit of uncertainty,"" said Claire Dissaux, Millennium's head of global economics and strategy.

""The Parliament has ruled out a no-deal Brexit but there is still the risk of domestic instability, as we have seen the parties split and an election still possible.""

1471,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",Goldman Rips Into U.S. ‘Misconceptions’ About Share Buybacks,"(Bloomberg) -- Buybacks have gotten an unfair rap in the U.S., according to a defense of the practice by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
U.S. companies have “consistently” returned cash to shareholders for almost 140 years, so it’s far from a new development, strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Thursday. And buybacks don’t dominate corporate spending, they said -- growth investment has been the largest share of U.S. companies’ spending every year since at least 1990.
“One of the greatest misconceptions in the public discourse surrounding corporate buybacks is the belief that managements repurchase stock in an attempt to inflate earnings per share and meet incentive compensation targets,” Goldman wrote. “Executives whose compensation depends on EPS,” they said, “did not allocate a higher proportion of 2018 total cash spending to buybacks than companies where management pay is not linked to EPS.”
Buybacks have been getting increased scrutiny in the wake of the tax reforms in late 2017, when companies used money saved from the lower levies to return cash to shareholders. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida released a plan last month that would curb buyback incentives. Democratic Senator Chris van Hollen of Maryland may propose legislation curbing executive share sales after repurchase announcements.
That’s after Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times arguing for limits on buybacks. Goldman’s ex-CEO Lloyd Blankfein issued a rebuttal defending the practice on Twitter, saying the money “gets reinvested in higher growth businesses that boost the economy and jobs.”
Growth investment “has accelerated sharply” since the tax reforms passed, contradicting “the widespread belief” that the changed policies led only to a surge in share repurchases, Goldman said. Companies have boosted buybacks relative to dividends to repatriate overseas profits and because of greater flexibility to match earnings volatility, the strategists added.
The tax-law changes did sharply boost cash spent on buybacks, with a 52 percent jump in 2018 to $819 billion for S&P 500 companies, the report said. Goldman estimates that will rise to $940 billion this year.
“Much of the cash that firms repatriated in 2018 has been recycled back into the domestic economy through a combination of both buybacks and dividends,” the report said.
Goldman found that firms with EPS-linked incentive compensation actually spent a greater portion of their cash on dividends than those without, even though executives in the first category would have had financial incentives to prefer repurchases. Further, the report said, evidence suggests buybacks aren’t crowding out capital investment. The pace of growth investment may even be accelerating.
“Corporates are generally efficient allocators of capital,” Goldman wrote. “We find some evidence that the companies that are able to generate the highest returns on assets are also those that invest the most in growth capex and R&D,” while “firms that generate lower asset returns may find the economics of cash return to shareholders to be superior to investing for growth.”

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 08:06AM ET</span>",Tourism industry fears 'no-deal' Brexit will cost it billions,"By Caroline Copley and Ilona Wissenbach
BERLIN (Reuters) - Travel specialists say the overseas tourism industry could lose billions over the next five years if Britain crashes out of the European Union later this month without a divorce deal.
With just three weeks to go until Britain's scheduled departure from the bloc, the two sides have yet to agree a mutually acceptable deal.
Executives at the ITB travel trade fair in Berlin said many holidaymakers were in wait-and-see mode as uncertainty over visas, insurance and whether they will need an international license to drive in EU countries weighed on sentiment.
""Brexit is a concern,"" Mark Okerstrom, chief executive of online-booking platform  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) told reporters, adding it had seen a significant slowdown in people booking flights from and to the UK beyond the scheduled March 29 departure date.
Consultancy firm Oxford Economics said a no-deal Brexit could cause a 5 percent fall in overseas travel and tourism trips by Britons in 2020. Market researcher Euromonitor said it would curb overseas spending by $5.3 billion between 2019-2025.
""We're not seeing that people aren't booking at all, but they are waiting a bit longer to make their decisions,"" said Christoph Debus, Chief Airlines Officer at Thomas Cook Group, adding Brexit would hit tour operators harder than airlines.
Caroline Bremner, Head of Travel Research at Euromonitor, said tour operators were trying to encourage early booking with flexible payment deals, low deposits and free child places, while some destinations, like Greece, have cut their prices.
Spain, the most popular destination for British sunseekers who accounted for 9 percent of foreign visitors last year, is seen as the biggest loser from a no-deal Brexit, which could wipe off more than $1 billion in spending between 2019-2025, according to Euromonitor.
Seeking to protect an industry which accounts for 12 percent of its economy, Spain last week approved a decree guaranteeing British residents and tourists access to healthcare for a specific time.
Turkey, which is rebounding following bomb attacks in 2016, is pitching itself as a value-for-money destination due to the pound's relative weakness against the euro, while Tunisia is sending a delegation to a London travel fair next month. 
Britain's tourism industry is also concerned that European tourists could stay away. Visit Britain warned in February of a sharp fall in European flight bookings for after March 29.

""The government needs to do more to improve sentiment toward the UK from visitors from continental Europe, which remain its largest market,"" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of lobby group Hospitality UK, told a hotel investment forum in Berlin.

Former officials at state-controlled road maintenance operator Anas were also under investigation, the sources said.
The prosecutors' move broadens a probe started last year after a section of the Morandi bridge in the northern city of Genoa collapsed, sending dozens of cars plunging to the ground and killing 43 people.
The bridge is part of the A10 motorway, which links Genoa to the French border and is managed by toll-road operator Autostrade, a unit of infrastructure group Atlantia. 
The 40 or so additional suspects - from Atlantia units Autostrade and Spea Engineering - join Atlantia CEO Giovanni Castellucci, Chairman Fabio Cerchiai and another 19 officials at both the infrastructure group and the transport ministry who were placed under investigation last year.
Atlantia and Anas declined to comment on Thursday.
""The ministry is calmly waiting on the prosecutors' work, while ensuring full cooperation to get at the complete truth,"" a spokesman for the transport ministry said.
Prosecutors will ask the judge for a new evidentiary hearing on the disaster to ascertain the causes of the collapse, the head of the prosecutor's office Franco Cozzi said recently.
The hearing is expected to last several months, he added.
Autostrade, which has come under fire from Italy's government for the disaster, has repeatedly said that it had carried out checks on the bridge as required by law.

Under Italian rules, the motorway operator is responsible for maintenance, while the ministry has a supervisory role.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 07:30AM ET</span>",Trading slips away from London ahead of Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A quiet, permanent shift in trading from London to the European Union ahead of Brexit is picking up speed as stock and bond platforms in Amsterdam and Paris crank into action.
Few expect London to lose its position as Europe's biggest financial hub, but Britain's departure from the EU is turning into a multibillion-euro boost for the bloc's protracted efforts to build a deeper capital market to rival the UK capital.
Britain's parliament is due to vote on Tuesday on a divorce settlement with the EU that includes a ""business-as-usual"" transition period from March 29 to the end of 2020.
Three weeks away from Brexit Day, it is unclear whether a deal will pass, whether Brexit will be delayed, or whether Britain will leave with no agreement at all.
But whatever happens, a fundamental change in European markets is underway.
""The ship has sailed and market infrastructure has changed with people having made their decision, taken premises, hired staff and doing all the testing,"" said Steve Grob, head of marketing at trading technology firm ION Markets.
Dutch regulatory approval is imminent for trading in euro government bond and repurchase agreements at U.S. exchange CME's new Amsterdam hub to begin on March 18, the company said.
U.S. exchange Cboe also expects the regulatory green light imminently to shift euro denominated share trading from London to its new unit in the Dutch capital for April 1.
Trading platforms, essentially a heavily-regulated grouping of computer servers, are not major employers and therefore the number of jobs leaving London will not be large.
But a shift in trading could act as a magnet that drags other business like clearing and listings across the English Channel, Grob said.
Chunks of trading assets have already gone ahead.
The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) estimated in a 2017 report that lenders held 1.1 trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) of derivatives, stocks and bonds on their trading books in London on behalf of customers in the 27 states that will remain in the EU.
Consultancy EY said that 800 billion euros of assets had shifted from London to new banking hubs in the EU.
For the bulk of the money, the shift is expected to be permanent because the European Central Bank, the main supervisor of EU hubs, has made locating significant amounts of euro business in the bloc a condition in new licenses, bankers said.
Exchange officials also don't want to split trading in euro securities between the EU and London, which would create two, less efficient pools of liquidity.
""At the moment it's incremental steps but with every week and month, it will add up to a lot and it's one way,"" said Rob Boardman, head of European equities at broker ITG.
""I've not heard of EU trading platforms suddenly deciding they want to open a hub in the UK.""
DUTCH SENSE
Brexit and competition to attract trading activity from London is pitting Amsterdam against Paris for the mantle of EU capital markets leader from a departing Britain.
Amsterdam, home to the world's first stock exchange and a trading nation for as long as Britain, is culturally aligned with the City of London financial district, Grob said.
Euro repo trading alone at the CME's new unit in Amsterdam will total about 200 billion euros a day.
""It made natural sense for us to go there,"" CME Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Duffy said.
Egged on by customers, LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange (LSE), has already moved clearing in euro repo trades totaling nearly 780 billion euros a day from London to its established Paris arm in a sign of how clearing is shifting too.
Cboe Europe, which accounts for over a fifth of daily pan-European share trading or 8 billion euros, will trade all European Economic Area listed stocks in Amsterdam from April 1.
Smaller rival Aquis Exchange, representing about 4 percent of pan-European stocks trading, intends to trade all its euro business in a new unit in Paris.
Interdealer broker TP ICAP (LON:NXGN) is also opening an EU hub in Paris, and its iSwap fixed income business is setting up in Amsterdam. MarketAxess has a new hub in Amsterdam too, to trade credit in parallel with its London unit.
The LSE's Turquoise pan-European share trading platform, which has about 7 percent of the market, is opening an Amsterdam hub but will continue trading euro stocks in London if there is a Brexit deal, though much could hinge on where customers want to trade.
Britain's future trading relations with the EU will determine how much euro-denominated trading and clearing will eventually move to the EU, Grob said.
'CITY SUR SEINE'
French banks have mooted a ""City sur Seine"" to reduce the EU's reliance on London and on banks for funding the economy, an ambition that one market veteran called ""aspirational"" given investors' suspicion of France's tradition of interventionism.
But Arnaud de Bresson, head of Paris Europlace, which promotes the French capital as a financial center, said that while Paris would contribute ""energetically"" to EU financial reform, it was also attuned to the needs of markets.
""Paris is already, after London, the top financial center in Europe for capital market activity. We are very close to the capital market culture,"" de Bresson said.
Banks also want Brussels to beef up efforts to build a deeper EU capital market as they face pressure from regulators to build up activity in their new hubs in the bloc.
""In light of Brexit, the CMU (capital markets union) project is more vital than ever for the EU to enhance and integrate its capital markets capacity and infrastructure,"" said Rick Watson, head of capital markets at AFME.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's main financial crime-fighting agency is investigating Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) and its Indian partner Godfrey Phillips for alleged violation of the country's laws, a senior directorate source told Reuters on Friday.
The Enforcement Directorate has been looking into both the companies and the scope of the investigation is much broader than the alleged foreign investment law violations highlighted in a Reuters story published on Wednesday, the source said. 
Philip Morris has for years paid manufacturing costs to Godfrey Phillips to make its Marlboro cigarettes, circumventing a nine-year-old government ban on foreign direct investment in the industry, Reuters reported based on a review of dozens of internal company documents, which were dated between May 2009 and January 2018. (https://reut.rs/2NIlHD8)
Three former officials and one former head of the Enforcement Directorate had reviewed the Philip Morris documents for Reuters and said the dealings should be investigated for circumventing India's foreign direct investment rules.
On Friday, the Enforcement Directorate source declined to comment on whether the ongoing investigation included Reuters reporting findings, but said ""this is already under investigation.""
""Both companies are being looked into,"" said the source, who declined to be named citing sensitivity of the investigation.
The source declined to share further details of the probe. 
A spokesman for the Enforcement Directorate did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Philip Morris and Godfrey did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Philip Morris has previously told Reuters its business arrangements with Godfrey comply with India's foreign direct investment rules. Godfrey has said all the commercial arrangements ""are in complete compliance with the extant regulations governing"" India's foreign direct investment and other laws.
Shares in Godfrey briefly pared gains on Friday following the Reuters report about the investigation. They closed 2 percent higher. 
MANUFACTURING CHARGES 
India in 2010 prohibited foreign direct investment in cigarette manufacturing, saying this would enhance efforts to curb smoking.
Ahead of the ban, Philip Morris formed a new wholesale trading company with Godfrey. Since then, Godfrey has acted as a contract manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes in India, while Philip Morris's local unit acts as a wholesale trading company and promotes the brand.
Dozens of internal company documents showed Philip Morris has been indirectly paying costs related to Marlboro cigarette manufacturing in India in a phased manner.
If the Enforcement Directorate finds a company in violation of the rules, Indian law allows it to impose a penalty of up to three times the amount contravened.

LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese shares were slammed more than 4 percent lower on Friday after data showed exports contracting by a fifth, deepening fears for the world economy and pushing global equities to three-week troughs.
The February data, well below expectations of a 4.8 percent drop, worsened the brittle mood on world markets, following the European Central Bank's announcement slashing growth forecasts and unveiling a new round of policy stimulus.
While the timing of the Lunar New Year made it difficult to draw a true signal from the China data noise, the scale was alarming, especially when coupled with sombre new data from Germany and Norway. 
Chinese stocks plunged more than 4 percent in their worst day in five months while Japan's Nikkei. closed 2 percent lower. 
The dark mood spilled into European stock markets where the STOXX 600 index slipped 0.5 percent, poised for the first weekly drop in a month. 
""The trade data from China is a big part of it,"" said Fiera Capital's co-chief Investment Officer Julian Mayo.
""Our own view is that the Chinese economy is slower than people generally think, but I think the world economy is probably slower than people think - so you put those two together and it is not surprising that the trade data was weaker than expected.""
European auto stocks were at the forefront, slipping 1.6 percent, with an unexpected decline in German industrial orders adding to the China woes. Financials also nursed losses for a second day after the European Central Bank cut its growth forecasts and pushed out an interest rate hike.
ECB President Mario Draghi said the economy was in ""a period of continued weakness and pervasive uncertainty"" as he pushed out a planned rate hike and instead offered banks a new round of cheap loans.
MSCI's 47-country benchmark world index dropped for a fifth straight session - its longest losing streak since December's rout. The pressure looked to continue on Wall Street, with S&P 500 E-Mini futures easing 0.4 percent.
Yet the cocktail of growth woes and dovish central banks proved a boon for bonds. Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield took a step closer to zero percent and both German and French benchmark yields were at their lowest level since 2016 - the year that saw the ECB ramp up stimulus and cut rates to fight deflation and weak economic growth.
""The ECB has had a bullish impact on bond markets and that is set to continue,"" said Ciaran O'Hagan, rates strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in Paris. ""We were not expecting something so clear, so soon, and markets were not either, so bond yields are likely to stay low for longer.""
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit a fresh two week low 2.627 percent. 
On currency markets, the euro inched up to $1.1209 after tumbling 1 percent on Thursday to touch $1.1176 - its lowest since June 2017. 
The dollar weakened 0.2 percent after reaching a new 2019 high against a basket of currencies that includes the euro as traders bet the United States would fare better than Europe in the coming months despite some soft patches in the U.S. economy.
Investors will be scouring U.S. payrolls data for February due out later in the day, with analysts uncertain how much payback there might be for January's outsized jump. There was also a chance the jobless rate could fall by more than forecast given the recent strength in employment.
In commodity markets, oil prices eased as U.S. crude output and exports climbed to record highs, undermining efforts by producer club OPEC to tighten global markets. 

U.S. crude was last down 38 cents at $56.28 a barrel, while Brent crude fell 49 cents to $65.81.

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 06:25AM ET</span>",Investors sweat the small print as Brexit fragments bond laws,"By Virginia Furness
LONDON (Reuters) - European borrowers are starting to raise more debt governed by their own laws rather than the English legal system, creating uncertainty for investors over how bond defaults and bank restructurings will be treated post-Brexit.
The shift underscores how Britain’s impending departure from the European Union (EU) is affecting its status as a go-to jurisdiction for international commerce.
The English legal system’s reputation as a neutral venue for resolving disputes has made it a favourite option for bond investors in Europe. But some borrowers, banks specifically, are starting to issue debt governed by laws from the other 27 EU member states to ensure their bonds are compliant with European rules ahead of Britain’s exit from the bloc on March 29.
Fragmentation of the legal fine print is an unwelcome development for investors. Post-crisis developments in Greece and Portugal have shown that bonds governed by local laws can more easily be wiped out and some fund managers say they would need a higher return to compensate them for that risk.
“You do have to be very careful what jurisdiction your bond falls under,” said David Zahn, head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton, which manages investments worth over $750 billion. “I would never say steer clear of an issue but I would say look at the price.""
English law remains sought-after by European companies looking to raise debt but its popularity has fallen since Britons voted in 2016 to leave the EU.
It is not clear if Brexit is responsible for the shift, which last year saw 28 percent of European corporate bonds issued under English law compared to 34 percent in 2017. The proportion of European corporate bonds governed by the laws of other European countries has risen to 38 percent from 36 percent in the same period, with France and Germany both seeing a jump in bonds issued using their laws.
U.S. law applied to 25 percent of European corporate bonds last year up from 17 percent the year before, Dealogic data shows.

The dominance of English law for international commercial contracts and London’s status as a financial hub have made Britain second only to the United States as a market for legal services.
London’s lawyers, working from ancient chambers and sleek skyscrapers, generate tens of billions of dollars every year in fee income, much of it from advising banks, investors and insurers on deals and disputes.
So far, uncertainty around Brexit has been a boon for lawyers, driving demand for their services. But there are also threats. One third of dispute resolution lawyers surveyed by Thomson Reuters last year said the businesses they advise on were considering selecting different governing law and jurisdiction clauses outside the English system.
BANK BONDS
At the heart of the rethink on legal jurisdiction is Europe’s ability to restructure troubled banks.
In the wake of the financial crisis, new rules required lenders to raise hundreds of billions of euros in bonds to bolster their balance sheets.
To get regulatory approval, banks had to sell some bonds that could be written down or ‘bailed in’ to absorb losses during a crisis. Such bonds need to be governed by the law of an EU member or a regime recognised as equivalent.
Europe has agreed to continue to recognise English law bail-in bonds during a 21-month transition period while London negotiates its trading relationship with Brussels. But if Britain leaves on March 29 without a divorce deal that arrangement may not apply.
The risk for European authorities is that holders of English law bonds could delay bank restructurings, complicating a process that is meant to happen swiftly. 
In the meantime, Europe’s Single Resolution Board, the body in charge of dealing with failing banks, said in January that European banks should insert a bail-in clause in new bond documentation and consider issuing bonds governed by the laws of one of the remaining 27 member states.
Last year, there was a steep drop-off in the amount of subordinated bonds issued by European banks using English law with just 38 percent governed by the English legal system compared to nearly 60 percent in 2017.
(GRAPHIC: Bank bonds issued under English law in Europe - https://tmsnrt.rs/2EbBeYW)
Banks are also inserting clauses into their bond documentation to ensure their bonds still count towards capital ratios in Europe after March 29.
In an English law bond issued in June, Portuguese bank Novo Banco included a clause which allowed the bank to make changes to the law governing the bonds “without the noteholders’ consent” if Brexit meant the debt no longer qualified as regulatory capital.
The clause struck a raw nerve for investors in Europe, where the application of local law in Greece and Portugal has meant losses for bondholders. Investors including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Pimco are suing Portugal's central bank after it transferred more than 2 billion euros of bonds out of Novo Banco in 2015, effectively wiping them out.
The investors and the central bank declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Antonio Ramalho, chief executive of Novo Banco, said the Portuguese lender did not expect to have any problem raising debt in the future.
“We can do it under English law, but we can also do it under another European law and we can do it according to a model that refers to the Portuguese legislation,” Ramalho told Reuters. ""There is always a way to do it.”
Novo Banco's bond offering in June sold at a 8.5 percent yield, the highest for any eurozone subordinated debt sold publicly that year.
A spokesman for the bank declined to comment on the price of the debt.
PREDICTABILITY
For corporate and sovereign borrowers from countries such as France and Germany, where investors feel more comfortable with the legal protections, issuing debt in the local law is not a concern. 
But a working paper by the European Central Bank last year showed that sovereign debt issued under Greek and Portuguese law would have to pay investors a premium of up to 45 basis points, equivalent to 45,000 euros on every 10 million euros raised.
Greece currently issues its sovereign debt under English law and a government official said there had been no discussion about changing that. Portugal's state debt agency, IGCP, did not respond to a request for comment.
Outside of the banking sector, UK-based investors fear that a future default on an EU-law bond could leave them struggling to recoup losses in a continental court.
“In the past, it has been an area that we wouldn’t have to worry about as it was the law and it was straightforward but obviously this will become a bigger issue,” said Zahn.
European courts might not recognise a ruling from an English court or non-EU investors could be at the back of the queue when trying to seize assets in European countries, some investors say.
""A lot of the bonds we invest in are New York law or English law because they are the two jurisdictions which provide certainty,"" said Cecely Hugh, investment counsel at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""There is predictability about how the courts will interpret the contracts. All that is very important for investors.""

HELSINKI (Reuters) - A train tunnel linking Helsinki with Estonia's capital Tallinn has got a provisional 15 billion euros ($17 billion) in financing from China's Touchstone Capital Partners, the latest infrastructure investment in Beijing's Belt and Road plan.
FinEst Bay Area Development said on Friday it had signed a memorandum of understanding providing a third of the funding in private equity, which will give Touchstone a minority stake in the planned 100 km (60-mile) tunnel, and two-thirds in debt.
Beijing's Belt and Road initiative seeks to link China by sea and land with southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, through a network along the lines of the old Silk Road as well as an Arctic route. 
Finland and Estonia have for years considered linking their capitals, which are divided by the Gulf of Finland and the subsea tunnel would cut the travel time to around 20 minutes from the two-hour ferry ride used by tens of thousands of Estonians who commute weekly to the Helsinki area. 
""The long term vision for Finland includes that we can get through the tunnel to Tallinn,"" Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila said this week during a visit to Estonia, which is a popular tourist destination for Finns. 
FinEst Bay Area, which had earlier estimated the total cost of the tunnel at 15-20 billion euros, said financial details will be thrashed out with Touchstone over the next six months. 
The firm raised the first external funding of 100 million euros from Dubai-based construction company ARJ Holding in December and is seeking European investors. 
""Now, the financing is sorted and we can move ahead,"" project leader Peter Vesterbacka, a former executive at the Angry Birds game maker Rovio, told Reuters.
A feasibility study commissioned by the governments of Finland and Estonia and published in 2017 said the planned tunnel could open in 2040 but Vesterbacka reiterated that it would be built by the end of 2024. 
The project is yet to secure backing from the two governments and the European Union.
Earlier this week Estonia's prime minister Juri Ratas stressed the need for security reviews of the project, along with the environmental studies which have already been started by the relevant authorities.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Reliance Industries Ltd plans to grow the number of low-cost Reliance Trends fashion stores across India to 2,500 from 557 over the next five years and integrate them with its online business, two people briefed on the plans said.
The expansion, which has not been reported before, is the latest move by the conglomerate's billionaire owner Mukesh Ambani to grab a dominant share of Indian consumer spending in a struggle with rivals, particularly e-commerce giants Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Flipkart.
Reliance's plans to diversify into e-commerce and expand in fashion come on the heels of India's new foreign investment curbs that have dealt at least a temporary blow to Amazon and Flipkart. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in December modified foreign direct investment rules for e-commerce, barring online retailers from selling products via vendors in which they have an equity interest, and also from making deals with vendors to sell exclusively on their platforms.
Ambani, Asia's richest man, founded Reliance Retail Ltd in 2007 to transform his petroleum behemoth into a consumer-facing conglomerate. 
TARGETING 300 CITIES
Expectations that Ambani will increase bets on retail have been growing, and the latest plan was presented at meetings earlier this year, the sources said, citing proposals the company shared with retail advisors.
Reliance Retail did not reply to an email seeking comment.
The expansion plan should allow Reliance Trends, which sells accessories as well as clothing, to rapidly grow its private labels - the retailer's own brands - the sources said.
Reliance Trends would be in 300 cities in five years, from 160 now, said the second person briefed on the plan.
A Reliance executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said integrating the availability of private labels with its e-commerce venture and penetrating deeper into smaller, tier 3 and 4 cities is the next level of growth for Reliance Trends.
The executive did not confirm the store expansion plan.
Last year, Reliance Trends opened over 100 stores, according to the executive.
""With the new commerce venture that we have planned, it will even be easier to sell our private labels from even third-party stores,"" the executive said.
Ambani's so-called ""new commerce"" venture aims to connect small and mid-sized merchants with his retail network and warehouses, helping them better manage inventory as well as boost sales of Reliance's private labels.
Both the sources declined to be identified as the plans have not been publicly announced. 
CHEAP PRICES FOR INDIA'S YOUTH
India has the world's largest population in the 18-35 year age group at 440 million people, constituting nearly half of its workforce, global consultancy Deloitte said in a recent report. With rising use of the Internet and smartphones, e-commerce retailers have doled out discounts to lure people to shop online for goods as varied as basic groceries and large electronic devices.
""The millennial opportunity is what every retailer is looking at. Reliance is no different,"" said a retail industry veteran and independent advisor to several retailers.
Retailers tend to make better margins out of their own brands than third-party brands because they can keep a much sharper eye on costs of production and associated marketing.
""Reliance Trends' aggressive expansion will see products such as private labels available across multi-brand outlets and smaller format stores as well,"" said independent retail consultant Govind Shrikhande when asked how Reliance will manage the aggressive expansion. 
Almost 80 percent of Reliance Trends' revenue comes from private labels. A team of designers work across seven centers in India and one in London to design items such as jeans, trousers, shirts and t-shirts, the company executive said.

""They are looking at global fashion and then they are looking at how that fashion can be adopted for India at a price which is affordable to churn out our private labels,"" said the executive.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks were heading for their biggest weekly fall since December on Friday, extending losses as weak China trade data and German industrial orders tightened bears' grip on the market, confirming a sharp global economic slowdown.
The STOXX 600 fell 0.5 percent by 0938 GMT, on track for its biggest weekly fall since Dec. 21, when a sharp sell-off was sweeping global markets. 
Euro zone bank stocks had led falls on Thursday when the European Central Bank cut its growth forecasts and pushed out an interest rate hike.
They dropped again on Friday, while basic resources fell 1.3 percent and autos stocks tumbled 1.4 percent after China reported its biggest drop in exports in three years and German industrial orders unexpectedly fell.
Germany's DAX was down 0.5 percent. 
""The weakness in soft data since September is starting to impact hard data, so central banks are reacting,"" said Sophie Huynh, multi-asset strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
But she added ""we should not over-interpret the China trade data because we have to take into account Chinese New Year and potential front-loading.""
Falls in European shares were muted compared to the 4 percent drop in Shanghai stocks after a blistering rally.
""In euro zone stocks there is already so much (investor) capitulation, it is so under-owned, that the reaction will naturally not be as sharp as in China, a much more high-beta market,"" said Huynh. 
EPFR data showed investors pulled some $3.1 billion from European equity funds this week, driving total outflows from the region year-to-date to $25.9 billion.
Company news provided no silver linings on Friday, with results roundly disappointing investors. 
Swiss industrial machinery firm VAT Group tumbled 4.6 percent after it reported lower full-year earnings than expected and a weaker guidance for 2019.
""Overall, we see around 10 percent downside risk to consensus 2019 earnings,"" said UBS analysts. 
EssilorLuxottica shares fell 4.4 percent after the merged eyewear group's maiden set of results disappointed the market and it postponed a long-awaited investor day.
""Broadly speaking, EssilorLuxottica's first set of results for 2018 have essentially been penalised by the dollar, and that is what's hitting the shares sharply this morning,"" said Gregoire Laverne, European equity manager at Roche-Brune Asset Management in Paris.
A report by Focus magazine that the chief executives of Germany's biggest lenders have resumed talks over a potential merger failed to boost the stocks, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) down 1.6 percent and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) down 0.6 percent.
Iliad shares fell 5.4 percent after Exane downgraded the French telecoms stock to ""underperform"". 
Leading the losers was British gambling firm GVC Holdings, which sank 17.5 percent to the bottom of the STOXX after its CEO sold 2.1 million shares in the company.
Mounting evidence of a global economic slowdown kept downward pressure on world earnings expectations. Analysts now see 2019 earnings growth at just 4.4 percent, less than half the growth they expected back in October.

However, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters that Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank's top managers had no mandate from their respective supervisory and management boards for any talks about a merger of Germany's two biggest banks.
""There is no official mandate for merger talks with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG),"" one of the people told Reuters, contradicting the sources in the Focus report who said the CEOs had received the go-ahead for negotiations.
The second source said it was ""total nonsense"" that the boards had given their chief executives the go-ahead to begin talks and there had been no recent discussion at Commerzbank's supervisory board about a merger with a larger rival.
Spokesmen for Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment on the Focus report which cited people familiar with the matter who said Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing and his counterpart at Commerzbank, Martin Zielke, have been in intense talks for some days.
Deutsche Bank shares traded 0.5 percent lower early in Frankfurt, while Commerzbank was 0.1 percent higher. 
Speculation of a merger has heightened under the tenure of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who has spoken out in favor of strong banks. Both banks have been slow to return to sustainable profitability since the global financial crisis.
Last week, a person familiar with the matter said that U.S. investor Cerberus Capital Management, a major shareholder in both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, is open to a merger, raising the chances of a tie-up.

Deutsche Bank, regarded as one of the most important banks for the global financial system, has been plagued by three years of losses, ratings downgrades, failed stress tests, and money laundering scandals. Commerzbank is still partially owned by the German government after a bailout.

Retail sales of sedans, sport utility vehicles, multipurpose vehicles and minivans fell 18.5 percent to 1.19 million units last month, the China Passenger Car Association said Friday. That follows a 4 percent decline in January and the first annual drop in more than two decades.
The worst car-market slump in a generation has prompted dealers and manufacturers to resort to generous discounts and cheap loans, yet consumers are still in a wait-and-see mode ahead of potential government incentives aimed at reviving the market, especially in rural areas. Executives are predicting that the gloom will spell the end for the worst-performing manufacturers as the industry’s consisting of hundreds of manufacturers prepares for a reshuffle.
“Customers are waiting for the other shoe to drop before they make purchase decisions,” Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the PCA, told reporters in a meeting last month. “The longer it takes for governments to take real action, the worse the car sales will look like.”
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. (OTC:HYMLY) are among carmakers counting on an improvement in China to revive earnings hit by a slowing economy and trade tensions. Even as electric-car demand rises, the auto market as a whole is showing no signs of recovery.
“The Chinese government won’t let the car market continuously show negative growth,” said John Zeng, managing director of researcher LMC Automotive Shanghai. “We expect the market to return to growth in the second half of this year if the trade war with U.S. doesn’t deteriorate.”

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are reeling from a double-whammy after early trading, hoping it doesn’t become a triple-whammy later in the day when the monthly U.S. employment report  is published.
A shocking 20% year-on-year decline in Chinese exports in January, announced during the Asian session, has accentuated fears for the global economy, only hours after the European Central Bank revealed the limitations of its ability to support growth when forces such as populism and protectionism are holding it back.
At 04:14 AM ET (0914 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 13.7 points, or 0.4%, at 3295.15, but the standout sectors tell you everything you need to know about what’s wrong: the trade-sensitive Autos and Parts Index and Basic Resources index are the worst affected, down 1.7% and 1.1% respectively, while the Banks Index is also down 1.1%.
Germany’s Dax is down 0.7% after another disappointing set of manufacturing orders data. But the French CAC 40 and Italian FTSE MIB haven’t benefited from industrial production data that were better than expected.
Among the carmakers, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is down 1.9%, thanks to a report in the German daily Handelsblatt chronicling its internal fighting over how to move away from diesel to electric power. The paper said the VW is considering up to 7,000 more job cuts.
Unpicking the bank story isn’t as simple. The overriding concern, says Nordea Markets’ Jan van Gerich, is that the new loans that the ECB plans to offer from September won’t do much to increase bank lending or their profit margins.
“The terms are not particularly attractive and appear mainly aimed at preventing an abrupt tightening of liquidity conditions rather than provide new easing,” van Gerich said in a blog post.
As such, the measure looks like yet another band aid to a sector that still hasn’t cleared up its bad loan problem. That band aid has most value to Italian banks, which have performed better than their regional rivals. But it has done nothing for domestic-focused Spanish banks like Sabadell (MC:SABE) and  Bankia  (MC:BKIA). More internationally-oriented Santander (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA) have fared slightly better."

“Some individuals vow to decouple our economies -- this is just their wishful thinking,” Wang said on Friday at a briefing during the annual National People’s Congress in Beijing. “Decoupling from China would mean decoupling from opportunities, from the future and in a sense even from the world.”
While Wang didn’t name anyone specifically, some hardliners in the Trump administration such as White House trade adviser Peter Navarro have sought a strategic decoupling of the world’s two biggest economies.
The Trade ‘Preferences’ Trump’s Threatening to Pull: QuickTake
“Our two countries should not, and will not, descend into confrontation,” Wang said. He reeled off statistics on economic ties between the countries, including two-way trade totaling more than $630 billion in 2018, a stock of mutual investment of more than $240 billion and more than 5 million visitors in both directions in 2018.
“We still have a positive outlook on China-U.S. relations, and I think this view is shared by broad sections of American society,” he said. “Almost all major U.S. corporations have business in China and all U.S. states are engaged in cooperation with China,” he said.
The remarks come as President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reportedly near a trade deal.
“I am more hopeful now than I have been in a long time that we will see a significant trade agreement reached addressing some of these fundamental issues that have not be addressed for a long, long time,” Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg TV.

Those issues include intellectual property rights, forced technology transfer and access to certain aspects of the Chinese market, Branstad said.
“We want something that’s going to be of substance, addressing these fundamental issues and something that is going to be enforceable,” he said.
Branstad said he didn’t know what enforcement options had been proposed by the U.S. More work remains on an agreement that will ensure China follows through on its commitments, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told Congress late last month.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 01:43AM ET</span>","At Brazil's Petrobras, an uphill struggle to vanquish graft","By Tatiana Bautzer and Gram Slattery
SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Five years after Brazilian prosecutors exposed a long-running bribes-for-contracts racket at state-run oil firm Petrobras, the company is proclaiming it has cleaned up its act.
It has run TV spots touting its whistleblower hotline as well as a compliance department created in the wake of Brazil's epic ""Car Wash"" corruption scandal, which damaged the oil giant, helped tip Brazil into recession and landed a former president behind bars.
In late November, citing progress it had made in rooting out graft, Petrobras closed down a special committee constituted in 2014 to aid investigations into corruption.
But interviews with six people with direct knowledge of the company's graft-busting efforts, including former Chief Compliance Officer João Elek Jr., paint a picture of an organization still struggling to root out bad behavior.
These individuals said Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, has strengthened its internal watchdog processes significantly. 
However, Elek and the others cited a series of obstacles that have hampered the firm's attempts to stamp out corruption. Among them, the people said, is an investigations unit which at times has been severely understaffed. 
In addition, the people said, bureaucratic hurdles for dismissing anyone at the state-owned company, along with unwillingness by many employees to cooperate with compliance investigators, means Petrobras in some cases has left it to law enforcement to gather needed proof of wrongdoing. 
""There was great cultural resistance"" to graft probes, said Elek, who led the Petrobras compliance department from January 2015 through April 2018. A former AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) executive, Elek described his departure from Petrobras as amicable and said it was never meant to be a long-term post. 
All six people were directly involved in designing or implementing Petrobras compliance programs in recent years. Four still work on Petrobras compliance issues.
In a detailed statement, Petrobras vigorously denied that compliance investigators have faced significant internal obstacles. It said it has ""zero tolerance"" for corruption and that it is committed to ""immediate interruption"" of misconduct.   
But the company's ongoing troubles, the people said, were on full view in December with the bombshell indictments of six former and current Petrobras employees. The workers stand accused of taking kickbacks in the latest phase of Car Wash, this one centered on irregularities in the company's oil trading division from at least 2011 to 2014.
Petrobras was alerted to potential problems in its trading operation since at least 2014, when a whistleblower went public with claims that the energy giant was overpaying for some of its oil purchases. The alleged scheme was also cited by two former Petrobras executives and a former senator in subsequent plea deals with prosecutors. 
But Petrobras did not move quickly to investigate suspicious activity, identify potential suspects and sideline them, the people said.
Five of the workers indicted in December had already left Petrobras by the time authorities issued their charges. 
The sixth, a Houston-based trader named Rodrigo Berkowitz, was still on the payroll when prosecutors issued a warrant for his arrest on Dec. 5. Petrobras fired Berkowitz the same day. The alleged scheme may have been ongoing through the time of his dismissal, police inspector Felipe Pace said at the time. 
'TIP OF THE ICEBERG' 
Berkowitz did not respond to multiple requests for comment. His lawyer confirmed he had agreed to plead guilty in the United States to conspiracy to commit money laundering. Berkowitz is now cooperating with U.S. authorities investigating the alleged oil trading scheme, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Legal representatives for the other five people indicted did not respond to requests for comment. 
Petrobras said one reason the firm could not break up the suspected oil-trading racket earlier was that it lacked surveillance resources reserved for authorities, such as phone wiretaps and access to bank accounts to follow the money.
Prosecutors said Berkowitz and the others accepted $31 million in bribes from intermediaries connected to some of the world's largest commodities trading firms, including European heavyweights Vitol SA,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) PLC and Trafigura AG. 
In exchange for the kickbacks, the trading companies got oil contracts at advantageous prices, defrauding Petrobras in the process, authorities said. 
Glencore and Trafigura declined to comment. Vitol said it has a ""zero tolerance"" policy with respect to bribery and corruption and that it is cooperating with authorities. 
Petrobras has steadfastly portrayed itself as a victim of illegal schemes perpetrated by a few rogue insiders colluding with unscrupulous contractors and greedy politicians. It downplayed the significance of the December indictments, saying they relate to alleged bribes paid years ago. 
""The latest phase does not involve high ranking executives, politicians or big construction companies,"" Petrobras said in a statement. 
Brazilian authorities do not share that view. 
Some prosecutors said they are just beginning to unravel what they contend is a complex web of payoffs and players. What they know at present is just the ""tip of the iceberg,"" prosecutor Athayde Ribeiro Costa said during a December press conference.
2,000 WHISTLEBLOWER TIPS 
The Car Wash scandal was a kickback scheme on steroids.
Suppliers formed a cartel to divvy up work with the state-run oil behemoth, inflating contract prices to hide their payoffs to Petrobras collaborators and politicians. The illicit operation rolled along for at least a decade before Brazilian prosecutors blew the lid off. 
The fallout helped force President Dilma Rousseff from office in 2016 and landed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in jail last year on corruption charges. 
The ongoing investigation by Brazilian authorities has spread to nearly every corner of Petrobras' massive operations. 
Elek, the former compliance chief, said Petrobras has taken meaningful steps to prevent a repeat. Supplier vetting has gotten much tougher, he said, and there is now better tracking of project budgets and spending. 
But transforming Petrobras' culture into one that champions transparency will be a long-term undertaking, according to Elek and the others interviewed.
Five of the people said the compliance team's inquiries were frequently slow-walked by management as well as by rank-and-file workers. For example, requests for records that should have taken days to deliver might not arrive for weeks or months, they said. 
In addition, Elek said powerful unions and internal company committees could sometimes hold up an employee's dismissal when evidence against him or her was not bulletproof, which he attributed in part to the bureaucratic structure of state-run companies.
Elek said the modest size of his internal investigations team also hampered some compliance work. He said he started with just two subordinates in the investigations unit in 2015, building it to around 40 employees by the time of his departure in 2018. 
He said he had hoped to recruit as many as 100 people to help tackle the workload in a sprawling company with more than 60,000 employees. But Elek said qualified workers were repeatedly blocked by their managers from joining his team. 
At one point in 2017, he estimates, his backlog of whistleblower complaints had reached some 2,000 cases. 
Petrobras disputed those staffing numbers in part, saying it had hired some 78 people for the investigations team by 2017, a figure that has since grown to 164 employees assisted by more than 180 external advisors. 
TOSSING OUT BAD APPLES 
In its written responses to questions from Reuters, Petrobras emphasized that it has been continually improving and refining its compliance program since Car Wash emerged in 2014. 
The company also said it took steps late last year to make it easier to punish workers found to be involved in corruption, fraud or harassment. 
As part of that push, the firm overhauled an internal oversight body that used to report to the CEO. Now known as the ""Discipline Committee,"" the three-person group has two independent members, including a former federal prosecutor, Marcelo Zenkner. The committee now reports its punishment actions directly to the board of directors. 
But Petrobras has yet to impose independent oversight of Rafael Mendes, the current chief compliance officer, who still reports to the chief executive.
The risks of that structure, some lawyers and corporate governance specialists say, were illustrated by Elek's first boss at Petrobras: Aldemir Bendine. The former CEO is now serving an 11-year jail term following his 2018 conviction for pocketing nearly $1 million in bribes from a contractor in the Car Wash scandal. 
Bendine was disdainful of the compliance committee and never attended one of its meetings, one person with direct knowledge of the situation said. 
Elek said he had no personal issues with Bendine, but that his position as chief compliance officer created natural tension with the former CEO. 
Alberto Toron, Bendine's lawyer, denied that his client was disdainful of the Petrobras compliance committee. Toron said Bendine's conviction related to his activities as CEO of Banco do Brasil SA, a post he held before moving to Petrobras. 
A sentencing document, however, cited accusations from federal prosecutors that Bendine had received the bribes while he was Petrobras CEO, after soliciting them at Banco do Brasil.
Petrobras did not make Mendes available to comment on the matter. In a statement, the company said the current chain of command functions smoothly. It said the chief compliance officer has access to the board ""whenever needed"" and can only be fired by a full board vote. 

""It is wrong to say that, from the beginning, the Petrobras chief compliance officer has encountered resistance,"" the firm said.

1497,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 01:30AM ET</span>",Wealthy millennials boosting the art market,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - The global art market experienced another uptick in 2018, helped by an increase in the spending power of millennials, a report published by UBS and Art Basel said on Friday.
A survey of wealthy individuals conducted by UBS and art economist Clare McAndrew for the report found millennials were buying art more actively and frequently taking to the internet to do so. It found that more of them were willing to shell out big money on art than their older peers.
They also provided a boost for female artists.
""For a generation that might never own a car, their appetite for buying art is encouraging,"" UBS Group Chief Marketing Officer Johan Jervøe told Reuters.
""It may be a reflection of the unique and often experiential qualities of art and collectibles as long-term assets.""
Overall sales in the art market grew 7 percent to $67.4 billion in 2018, according to UBS and Art Basel's third annual art market report.
People between 22 and 37 years of age made up nearly half of the wealthy art buyers who regularly spent $1 million or more on an artwork over the past two years, the survey found, despite representing just over a third of the high-net-worth individuals surveyed.
The results of the survey, which was conducted in Britain, Germany, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong, offered a silver lining for the art world as geopolitical and economic worries have weighed on overall sentiment.
As millennials grow into greater wealth, and benefit from a generational shift in wealth inherited from aging parents, their wealth could reach $24 trillion by 2020, according to Deloitte.
Millennials' spending habits could provide significant potential for both online sales and art's squeezed middle, Jervøe said, benefiting the industry's overall health.
This younger generation of collectors with over $1 million in household assets to spend or invest helped buoy the digital art marketplace to $6 billion sales last year.
And a majority of them also took to photo-sharing social media platform Instagram to source and buy art.

Between 2016 and 2018, 93 percent of the millennials made purchases online, spending $106,930 on average, while the slightly older Generation X - between 38 and 52 years of age -spent around half a million dollars on an average web purchase, but did so with less frequency.

1498,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 01:30AM ET</span>",Trump administration proposes overtime pay expansion,"By Daniel Wiessner
(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Labor issued a long-awaited proposal on Thursday to extend mandatory overtime pay to a million more workers, far fewer than an Obama administration rule that was struck down by a federal judge.
Currently, salaried workers are automatically entitled to overtime pay only if they earn less than $23,660 a year, a figure set in 2004. The proposal released on Thursday would raise the threshold to $35,308.
The Labor Department in 2016 doubled the salary threshold to about $47,000, extending mandatory overtime pay to about 4 million U.S. workers. 
But a federal judge in Texas ruled the following year that the ceiling was set so high that it could sweep in some management workers who are supposed to be exempt from overtime pay protections. Business groups and 21 Republican-led states had sued to challenge the 2016 rule. 
Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said in a statement that Thursday's proposal would ""bring common sense, consistency, and higher wages to working Americans.”
Business groups have closely tracked changes to overtime pay regulations and were critical of the Obama-era rule. Class-action lawsuits alleging unpaid overtime are common, and companies often pay millions of dollars to settle them. 
A higher salary threshold could lead to more lawsuits, since many more workers would be covered by the federal law mandating overtime pay. Trade groups have also said a higher overtime threshold could push employers to cut some workers' hours.
The Labor Department called on Thursday for public comment on its proposed overtime threshold, as well as whether it should be periodically increased to reflect inflation. 

The Obama administration rule would have automatically raised the salary threshold every three years.

China’s exports for February tumbled 20.7%, much lower than market expectations of a 4.8% drop. It also reversed January gains of 9.1%. Imports were also down 5.2%, while the market estimated a 1.4% decline only.
The February export data represented the biggest tumble in three years, and imports also fell for a third straight month.
The decrease has left China with a trade surplus in February of $4.12 billion, much smaller than the expected $26.38 billion.
The worse-than-expected export data sent Chinese stocks further down on Friday afternoon. By 12:33 PM ET (05:33 GMT), the Shanghai Composite was down 3.04% to 3,011.87 and the Shenzhen Component lost 1.28% to 9,554.20.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also slid 1.45% to 28,362.00.
But market watchers warn that seasonal factors such as the long Lunar New Year holidays in February attributed to the business disruptions and the data should be interpreted with caution.
However, China also shows signs of a slowing economy. Chinese policymakers lowered GDP growth targets to between 6% to 6.5% on Tuesday.
The meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) the day before also stirred fears of a global economic slowdown, weighing on Asian markets on Friday morning.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 2.13% to 20,999.00 and the Kospi in Korea was trading down 1.24% to 2,139.02.  In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was also down by 0.96% to 6,203.80.
On Thursday, the ECB cut its 2019 economic growth forecast and announced a series of stimulus measures to encourage lending. It also plans to keep its key interest rates unchanged throughout 2019.
“We are (in) a period of continued weakness and pervasive uncertainty,” said ECB President Mario Draghi.
What further clouds the global economic outlook is the ongoing U.S-China trade talks that have yet to reach an end, though U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly eager to close a deal ahead of the 2020 re-election campaign.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>","As trade wars rage, Emerson plots new U.S. expansion","By Timothy Aeppel
Ferguson, Mo. (Reuters) - In 2009, the chief executive of Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Electric Co. bluntly told investors at a Chicago conference what many of his counterparts at other manufacturing firms would only say privately.
“I’m not going to hire anybody in the United States. I’m moving,” David Farr said as he blasted U.S. taxes and regulations and called it an easy decision to expand in India and China. 
Farr’s flash of candor was emblematic of an era of free trade, globalization and offshoring of U.S. jobs – one that has now come under attack in the trade wars launched by U.S. President Donald Trump.
A decade later, Farr has made a stunning reversal: Emerson now plans to build at least three new U.S. plants and is already expanding existing domestic operations. Farr saw a new era of U.S. protectionism coming before Trump’s election – and started planning accordingly, he said in an interview with Reuters at the company’s sprawling headquarters near St. Louis, Missouri.
“For the first time now, I’m looking for best-cost U.S. locations” to build factories, he said.
Trump’s election, Farr said, accelerated a political shift against free trade policy that is now transforming many U.S. firms’ domestic investment strategy. Protectionist policies — especially toward China — are now a rare point on which many Democrats and Trump agree, relegating formerly bold Republican free traders to the sidelines.
Emerson has committed $250 million for new U.S. facilities through 2021, part of a larger domestic investment in existing operations, including a new headquarters and a factory renovation at its Wisconsin garbage-disposal business. Emerson spent $407 million on U.S. capital projects last year, a 38 percent jump from the year before, and plans to spend $425 million this year.
Those investments have added 2,500 employees, Farr said. Emerson declined to say how many jobs the new factories would create.
Emerson, a diversified manufacturer with $17.4 billion in sales last year, provides dozens of industries with thousands of products, from tools and large industrial valves to refrigeration, lighting and climate control systems. Its best-known consumer brand may be the InSinkErator garbage disposal.
Farr’s new take on U.S. investment reflects a broader questioning of overseas expansions, especially in China, for both political and operational reasons. A survey of top managers at 500 U.S. companies conducted in December by investment bank UBS AG found that 31 percent have moved or are moving production facilities to avoid tariffs. Fifty-eight percent said they expect tariffs to “have a positive impact on domestic investment.”
It remains unclear, however, whether and how much the trade policy upheaval will benefit U.S. workers. Many firms fleeing China to avoid U.S. tariffs are not moving to the United States, often choosing locations in Southeast Asia. Those that are expanding U.S. operations are trying to maximize automation to minimize labor costs, and some U.S. industries - such as consumers of steel - have said they plan to cut jobs because tariffs have raised their costs.
The renewed domestic focus by Emerson, a major employer of high-skilled workers, nonetheless stands out as a victory for Trump’s protectionism. Emerson has been a poster child for globalization, and its CEO is among the nation’s most influential manufacturing executives. Farr just completed a two-year term as chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers, the sector's main lobbying organization.
Emerson once had an overwhelming U.S. and European focus. But that changed as it joined the stampede of manufacturers moving to emerging markets. When Farr became CEO in 2000, 8 percent of Emerson’s sales were in Asia. Last year, that hit 22 percent, and Emerson now has 26,000 employees in the region, slightly more than in the U.S. and Canada. Most of the company’s 215 factories sprinkled around the globe are now outside the U.S. 
But one of Farr’s first moves after Trump’s election was to assign a task force of top managers to adapt the firm’s investment plans to a less certain trade environment. The group has produced a top-ten list of potential U.S. locations for new plants.
TURNING AGAINST TRADE 
Free trade deals once had almost universal support among Republicans and broad support among Democrats. Farr noted that it was Democratic President Barack Obama who negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton once called the “gold standard” of trade agreements. But Clinton turned against the deal during the campaign as Trump’s attacks on trade deals drew applause across the industrial Midwest.
Trump withdrew the United States from the sweeping Pacific accord immediately after his election, and many Republican free-traders have since gone silent on the issue or adopted variations of the president’s rhetoric.
“You have a growing number in the Republican party aligned with what the President calls ‘America first’ – what others call isolationism,” said Andrew Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics at Purdue University Fort Wayne.
The tax reform passed by Republicans has also made the U.S. a better place to invest by slashing taxes on businesses, Farr said, saving Emerson $189 million last year. The tax cuts enabled Emerson to grant a 2.9 percent general wage increase worth $42 million and better benefits.
Some decisions remain in flux as trade disputes simmer. Emerson had long planned a new factory in Mexico to serve North America, but broke construction into two phases pending the outcome of a revised U.S. trade agreement with Canada and Mexico that awaits congressional approval. The first phase is underway, but the second will only be built if the trade deal goes forward.
Forces beyond politics are pushing manufacturers like Emerson to reconsider investments in China, including rising labor and logistics costs there; worries about transferring intellectual property to state-run Chinese firms; and emerging technology to automate factories in high-wage countries.
Farr said his meetings with candidate Trump during the campaign convinced him he was serious about overhauling U.S. trade relationships. But Emerson’s renewed commitment to U.S. manufacturing is also part of a larger move by global manufacturers to produce more goods in the regions where they are consumed to save on transportation costs. 
Foreign companies are also recalibrating, including Dutch multinational Koninklijke Philips NV, one of the world’s largest electronics companies, which last year relied on the United States for 35 percent of its sales. CEO Frans van Houten told investors on a call in January that he is stepping up efforts — like Emerson — to produce more goods where they sell them, moving away from a model of factories specializing in products that are then shipped globally. 
The push is visible in trade data, said Susan Lund, a partner at McKinsey & Company who studies trade flows. In 2007, 28 percent of global production of goods was traded — moving from one country to another. That share has dropped to 22.5 percent.
Emerson’s industrial valve and controls business is one area where Farr plans to move factory capacity to the United States to serve customers there. Emerson produces valves used in everything from fracking to oil refineries and has sprawling research and production facilities in Marshalltown, Iowa, which this fiscal year will receive a $22 million capital investment and three dozen new jobs.
U.S. valve factories produced only about half the goods it sold domestically in 2017. Emerson plans to push that to 90 percent by 2021.

“We’re looking at two new facilities in Texas,” Farr said. “That will mean taking capacity, and jobs - out of Europe and some out of China - and bringing it to Texas.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Thursday it has halted the informal 180-day ""shot clock"" on the review of the merger of wireless providers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc to give the public three additional weeks to comment on the $26 billion tie-up.
The FCC said the decision was made after the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers had filed significant additional information on their network integration plans for 2019-2021 and other new information on the merger.
The FCC said it typically allows for additional public input after ""substantial new submissions"" by the applicants. The FCC said it expects to resume the ""shot clock,"" at the current Day 122 on April 4.
T-Mobile and Sprint in separate statements called the FCC decision ""a positive step"" that the FCC is ""so deeply engaged in understanding this transaction and our recent filing, and we completely understand their desire"" to stop the clock ""to fully review the merits of our merger."" 
Sprint said it hopes to complete the regulatory approval process by the end of June.
The deal to combine the carriers, struck in April 2018, was approved by both companies’ shareholders in October and has received national security clearance, but still needs approval from the Department of Justice and the FCC. A number of state attorneys general are also reviewing the merger.
Last month at a congressional hearing, House Democrats raised worries about the deal because the U.S. wireless market has just four main carriers. The industry leaders are AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ).
T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere defended the deal, arguing that it will create jobs and help with the construction of the next generation of wireless networks. He said the merged company would have more capacity which would lead to a push to lower prices.
Legere and Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure will testify at another U.S. House hearing on March 12.
The deal has run into criticism from unions, consumer advocates, and rural operators.
The Communications Workers of America said in a statement Thursday the decision of the companies to file new analyses of the merger suggests they ""have failed to persuade regulators."" The union argues the deal will eliminate tens of thousands of jobs.

A group of eight Democratic U.S. senators and independent Senator Bernie Sanders last month urged regulators to reject the deal, saying monthly bills could rise as much as 10 percent.

(Reuters) - Two U.S. House Democrats on Thursday asked the White House and Justice Department to turn over documents that could show whether Republican President Donald Trump sought to intervene in the regulatory review of AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's $85 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX).
In letters released on Thursday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Representative David Cicilline, who chairs a panel overseeing antitrust issues, asked them to turn over records after The New Yorker magazine reported this week that Trump directed then-National Economic Council director Gary Cohn to use the Justice Department to block the deal.
The pair wrote that if accurate, Trump's involvement would ""constitute a grave abuse of power."" Last week, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling rejecting a Justice Department challenge to the deal filed in November 2017.
The White House and Justice Department did not immediately comment. AT&T declined to comment.
The letters cited the New Yorker article reporting that Trump called Cohn into the Oval Office ""along with John Kelly, who had just become the chief of staff, and said in exasperation to Kelly, 'I've been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing’s happened! I’ve mentioned it 50 times. And nothing’s happened. I want to make sure it’s filed. I want that deal blocked!’""
Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said in a declaration last year that he had never received ""orders, instructions, or directions relating"" to the AT&T Time Warner deal from Trump, Justice Department officials or officials from the Executive Office of the President.
The Justice Department said last week it would not seek further appeals.
In February 2018, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected AT&T's request to see White House communications that might shed light on whether Trump pressured the Justice Department to try to block the deal.
AT&T lawyers said last year the deal may have been singled out for enforcement, citing as evidence statements by Trump as a candidate and as president that the deal was bad for consumers and the country.

Trump criticized the deal as a candidate in late 2016, saying it would concentrate too much media power in the hands of one owner, and later saying it would raise prices. He has also frequently attacked CNN, a Time Warner property now owned by AT&T, for what he sees as negative coverage of his campaign and administration.

Draghi said in a statement following the policy meeting that ECB would launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations in September to help preserve favourable bank lending conditions and smooth transmission of monetary policy.
ECB also plans to keep its key interest rates unchanged throughout 2019.
Before its policy meeting, the ECB had just downgraded its forecast on 2019 euro-area growth to 1.1% from a previous forecast of 1.7% after ending its bond-buying program three months ago.

MSCI proposed including non-voting depository receipts in its free-float calculations in January, which if approved, could trigger a net inflow between $1.5 billion and $2.6 billion to Thai equities, according to estimates from Churchill Capital Pte. and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). The index provider will announce the results of the consultation on or before March 29.
“I am pretty confident that it will happen as it makes sense and will reflect the free float more accurately,” Churchill Capital sales trader Todd Rice said by phone on Wednesday, citing talks with passive investors that track the MSCI Thailand Index and his own analysis. Several billion dollars will be “more impactful” on a smaller market like Thailand than the inflows expected in China, he said.
The change would increase Thailand’s weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index to 3 percent from 2.5 percent under one scenario, according to the index provider’s proposal. Inflows from funds tracking the benchmark would help boost Thai stocks, which have underperformed their emerging-market peers this year and suffered more than $7 billion of foreign outflows in the last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Thailand’s benchmark SET Index has risen just 4.4 percent this year, little more than half the gain in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
Local Optimism
Market participants in general are bullish on the MSCI proposal even if their level of optimism differs. Soraphol Tulayasathien, senior executive vice president of Stock Exchange of Thailand said the move “will definitely help boost foreign interest in Thai market,” while Sumetha Lewchalermwong, chief investment officer at MFC Asset Management Pcl said the move will be “positive” though “the magnitude of increase could remain small.”
The proposal will also affect the MSCI Thailand Index. The index provider expects Intouch Holdings Pcl, Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Pcl, Central Plaza Hotel Pcl and Total Access Communication Pcl to be included in the gauge. Muangthai Capital Pcl is likely to be removed, according to JPMorgan.
There is also likely to be weight changes for 24 stocks in the index, including higher allocations for Siam Cement Pcl and a cut in for Siam Commercial Bank Pcl, JPMorgan analysts Zhang He, Min Moon and Pankaj Gupta wrote in a Jan. 28 note.
Churchill’s Rice estimates that about $6.5 billion worth of passive money tracks the MSCI Thailand and therefore some stocks could see flows worth six to 10 days of three-month average daily volumes, if the proposal get implemented.
“Around $1.5 billion will come into Thailand from the day it gets implemented,” he said.
(Corrects to say SET Index gains this year have lagged behind MSCI Emerging Markets Index.)

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 08:15PM ET</span>",Nicaragua Congress approves purchase of bank tied to Venezuela's PDVSA,"MANAGUA (Reuters) - Nicaraguan lawmakers voted on Thursday to authorize a $23 million government purchase of Bancorp, a financial institution that has been sanctioned by the United States for its links to Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA.
The acquisition is seen as a way to protect the bank from the tough U.S. sanctions that were enacted in late January and aimed at depriving embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from obtaining proceeds from PDVSA, especially its Houston-based subsidiary Citgo Petroleum.
The government of President Daniel Ortega, one of Maduro's few remaining allies in Latin America, formally asked lawmakers to make the purchase, filing an ""urgent"" request to do so on Wednesday.
Lawmakers from Ortega's ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), who hold a majority in Congress, voted for the measure.
Bancorp was created in 2015 as a subsidiary of Alba de Nicaragua, known locally as Albanisa, a joint venture between Venezuela's PDVSA and Petroleos de Nicaragua, the country's state-owned oil firm, according to statements from government officials at the time of its creation. 
Bancorp officials, however, deny that Albanisa or Petroleos de Venezuela, as PDVSA is formally known, have stakes in the bank or influence its operations.
Last month, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, Kimberly Breier, singled out both Albanisa and Bancorp as falling under the new sanctions.
""Sanctions on @PDVSA also target ALBANISA, Bancorp & all majority owned subsidiaries. We will continue to hold the Ortega regime accountable,"" Breier wrote in a post on Twitter.
Ortega's domestic opposition in the Congress sharply criticized the purchase.
""Buying a bank that's contaminated by PDVSA money is a wrong-headed, infuriating decision that exposes the state to U.S. sanctions,"" said Azucena Castillo, a congresswoman with the opposition Liberal Constitutionalist Party (PLC) during the heated legislative debate on Thursday. 
Lawmakers voted to finance the Bancorp purchase with a six-year bond issuance.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country's biggest lender, said on Friday it will stop automatically charging customers ongoing service fees in 10 days, admitting it had not yet been able to comply with a regulatory order to do so.
The update from CEO Matt Comyn at a parliamentary hearing suggests Australia's lenders are struggling to end a practice known as ""fees for no service"" which featured prominently among several institutions at the year-long inquiry.
Comyn said the bank was overhauling its wealth management business so that customers were only charged a fee at the time they received a service, rather than automatically.
""Approximately 97 percent of those fees have been switched off,"" he said, referring to charges that were billed automatically. He added that 100 percent of the fees would be switched off within 10 days. 
The Australian Securities and Investment Commission told CBA's wealth management subsidiary last month to stop automatically taking fees because it had failed to comply with a court order to fix wrongly levied charges.
Australian bank bosses must face regular questioning in parliament but Comyn was the first to appear since the Royal Commission inquiry delivered its final report last month, with 76 recommendations for changes to finance sector rules.
The report also recommended referring 24 misconduct cases to regulators for possible prosecution. Though the report did not specify which cases deserved such attention, they are expected to include instances of fees charged for no service.
Asked how many of the potential prosecutions involved CBA, Comyn said it was ""not clear to me"".
Shares of Australia's biggest banks have risen since the report was published on Feb. 4 amid relief that the inquiry's recommendations left their market dominance largely unchecked.
CBA shares are up 5 percent since the Royal Commission report came out on Feb. 4, but they are still down 11 percent from their January 2018 peak before the inquiry began.
Comyn dismissed suggestions the report had been soft on the banks, saying it had been an ""extremely difficult and confronting process."" However, when pressed, he said he had been concerned the commission would recommend tougher lending laws. 
The bank had paid customers A$1.4 billion ($983 million) in compensation for wrongdoing, the highest in its history, he said, citing figures given at the bank's half-yearly earnings announcement. 
The bank had also been hit with about 5,500 new complaints since the inquiry started, forcing it to hire dozens of extra staff to take on the workload.

1509,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 07:19PM ET</span>","China tightens rules on wealth management, boosting prospects for foreign banks","By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's efforts to tighten oversight of its $20 trillion-plus wealth management industry are spurring foreign banks to speed up plans to enter the local market or expand there, six people involved in the discussions said.
China's wealth-management industry is the fastest-growing in the world but has historically been linked to the sale of high-risk, illiquid products and lax regulatory oversight. 
Recently, however, officials have begun forcing domestic banks to separate their wealth-management businesses, a move sources said was aimed at improving governance as part of Beijing's broader push to reduce debt and limit the sale of risky products.
This comes as Japan's Nomura is awaiting a license to launch a wealth business in China, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of Singapore, a unit of Asian lender Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp are among others considering entries, the people said.
At stake is access to a market where personal assets for investment rose from $11 trillion in 2012 to $22 trillion by 2017, according to consultancy Oliver Wyman. It expects that figure to reach $37 trillion in the next five years.
Of that, only 5 percent, or $1.1 trillion, was invested offshore in 2017, according to Oliver Wyman.
""China has long been considered the Wild West by the foreign private banks,"" said an executive at a leading wealth manager in China, declining to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media. ""With the market moving towards more regulated environment, onshore business is going to be the most important pie.""
The private banking units of top Chinese commercial banks, including China Merchants Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Bank of China dominate the local market, according to Asian Private Banker. 
(GRAPHIC: Personal investable assets in China - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VATCAC) 
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD
China's five major banks have so far gotten the regulatory nod to set up wealth management units, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said last month.
The units must maintain separate books and accounts and ""perform the duties of entrusted wealth management honestly, diligently, and responsibly,"" the regulator wrote in its December guidelines.
The rules are aimed at strengthening local wealth managers' risk-management practices, including those related to client background checks and the sale of investment products, which often imply a guaranteed return, industry sources said.
Francois Monnet,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) private banking head in North Asia, said onshore investors' ""normalizing"" expectations of returns had created a more level playing field for foreign banks.
Credit Suisse in 2016 hired a senior banker in China to prepare a roadmap for an onshore private banking business.
""We are at an early stage of strategic readiness in terms of developing what will make sense to increase that presence, and to be ready to deploy that aggressively,"" Monnet said.
Credit Suisse will compete with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and UBS on advising wealthy clients in China. China is a ""strategic priority"" for UBS and billionaires are being created at a faster pace there than anyplace else in the world, said UBS Wealth Management's China business head Marina Lui.
Bank of Singapore plans to set up an office to promote its brand in China as a first step, Samuel Tsien, chief executive of parent company OCBC, said at an earnings briefing last month, adding that it was not looking to operate a ""full-blown"" private banking business.
JPMorgan has started discussing how to set up an onshore private banking business in China, two people with knowledge of the matter said. A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Nomura, which is said to be in line for regulatory approval this year for the securities joint venture that will allow it to offer wealth management services, also declined to comment.
STRICTER STANDARDS
In the mass affluent market - clients with investable assets of between $100,000 and $1 million - in China, foreign banks are gearing up to boost growth as a shadow banking crackdown brings such investors into the mainstream.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) expects its China wealth-management client base to grow faster in 2019 than last year, at more than 30 percent, its country CEO Christine Lam said in January.
HSBC aims to grow its Asia revenues by at least $1 billion by 2020 from retail and private banking wealth, asset management and insurance, with the China business set to be a big contributor, the bank said in a statement to Reuters.

""China's new wealth management regulations will remove implicit guarantees, set stricter investment standards and standardize the rapidly growing wealth management industry,"" it said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain must not go soft on anti-money laundering standards to win trade deals after it leaves the European Union, a panel of lawmakers said on Friday.
The report on economic crime from parliament's Treasury Select Committee (TSC) also called for better estimates for such crimes, and for a single supervisor of Britain's 25 bodies that enforce anti-money laundering rules.
Britain's tax and revenue service should ensure that all estate agents are registered with it to ensure compliance with rules aimed at stopping proceeds of corruption being stashed in property, the report said.
Companies House, where new firms are registered, should have powers to make sure it plays no role in helping those undertaking economic crime, it added.
""With the uncertainties of Brexit around the corner, the government should regularly review the UK's effort to combat money laundering to ensure a constant stimulus to improve,"" TSC chair Nicky Morgan said in a statement.
""The government must ensure it does not bow to buccaneering deregulatory pressures and maintain its intentions to lead in the fight against economic crime.""
Despite Brexit challenges, Britain must work to keep the financial sector ""clean"" to match its ambitions to continue to be a leader in global financial services, it said.
The report also cautioned about overly focusing on Russia in the fight against economic crime, even though there has been a ""malign influence"" on the UK financial system from certain elements of Russian money.
Estimates for economic crime in Britain range from the tens of billions of pounds to hundreds of billions and the government should provide a more precise estimate so that the response is better tailored, the report said.

An incident report was started by the Pentagon some time after the marijuana event, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The review was first reported by Bloomberg. 
Musk has a security clearance as SpaceX provides satellite launch services to the U.S. government. An unmanned capsule from the company was due to return to earth on Friday after a short-term stay on the International Space Station, part of NASA's long-delayed quest to resume human space flight from U.S. soil later this year.
""For privacy and security reasons, we do not publicly discuss individual clearance status,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Pentagon spokesman. 
Musk, who is also the CEO of electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, has refiled his SF-86 security form, which requires a federal employee or contractor seeking a clearance to acknowledge any illegal drug use over the previous seven years, according to the Bloomberg report, which said the review has not impacted SpaceX.
The U.S. Air Force in September said reports that it was reviewing his security clearance were inaccurate.
In September, Musk provoked a Twitter storm by smoking pot, drinking whiskey and wielding a sword on a live web show with comedian Joe Rogan. 
SpaceX declined to comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The electric carmaker's shares pared gains and were lower in late afternoon trading.

1512,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 06:49PM ET</span>",Exclusive: SEC scrutinizes fairness of stock exchange pricing,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the multi-tiered pricing system used by stock exchanges favors large brokers at the expense of small ones, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Under the current system, Wall Street banks and other massive traders get hefty rebates based on how much business they funnel to exchanges. The result of this complex and often opaque system is that big users can end up trading for free, or even get paid to trade, while small brokers pay substantial fees. 
Most exchange operators, including New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, Nasdaq Inc and Cboe Global Markets, have embraced the system in at least some of their exchanges to help boost volumes and fatten their bottom lines. 
While the SEC has not launched a formal civil investigation, it is seeking information from the exchanges on the pricing system. If the SEC were to determine that the tiered structure is unfair, exchanges could be forced to simplify their pricing models, potentially costing them millions of dollars in fees. 
SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns declined to comment. NYSE and Nasdaq declined to comment on the SEC probe into multi-tiered pricing.
Cboe said it offers different types of pricing tiers catering to all of its clients and that the tiers are the result of years of intense competition among exchanges. 
""At this point, we do not have plans to change our pricing schedules,"" said Bryan Harkins, who co-heads Cboe's markets division.
More generally, exchanges say that fierce competition in the industry has resulted in tighter bid-ask spreads that benefit all investors. 
The regulatory scrutiny is part of a broader effort by the SEC under Chairman Jay Clayton to improve transparency around exchange pricing and ensure it is fair and equitable as required under the Exchange Act.
""The SEC has thrown the gauntlet down,"" said Chester Spatt, a finance professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a former chief economist at SEC. Tiered pricing will likely emerge as a central issue in the debate, said Spatt, who has a working paper on the topic.
The regulator has also ordered exchanges to justify recent fee hikes for market data, and has mandated a pilot program to test banning rebate payments that exchanges make to brokers for liquidity-adding stock orders. 
ICE (NYSE:ICE), Nasdaq and Cboe have filed lawsuits or appeals challenging the SEC's authority on those two mandates. 
Tackling U.S. exchanges is one of the few areas where Republicans and Democrats agree. Republicans believe the current rules are anti-competitive, while Democrats worry existing exchange structures and incentives could hurt small and large investors.
(For graphic comparing number of small brokers to mid- and large-sized brokers, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2VKfgCw)
HARD TO COMPETE
Tensions between Wall Street and the exchanges, which were once member-owned, not-for-profit utilities, have risen over the past decade and a half as the bourses have become public companies.
Some brokers say the exchanges have used their essential position in the market to maximize profits, often to the detriment of smaller brokers. 
Joe Wald, chief executive of brokerage Clearpool Group, said tiered pricing makes it harder for smaller brokers to compete for customer orders against bigger firms, which get significant discounts on trading costs. 
""It discriminates against smaller broker dealers who end up almost perversely subsidizing the cost of the whole exchange relationship for the largest firms,"" he said.
Clearpool executes more than 2 percent of U.S. stock trades on an average day, but comes nowhere near hitting the higher-volume exchange tiers, which allow the biggest brokers to reap rebates nearly 60 percent higher than those that qualify for base rates, Wald said.
When factoring in rebate payments from the exchanges, five of the top 10 customers at both Nasdaq and Cboe by volume actually receive checks from the exchanges at the end of the month, net of fees, according recent comments by a Cboe executive and a Nasdaq report.
PRICING PATHS
The current fee schedule was approved by the SEC, and exchange pricing lists are publicly available. But they can be dozens of pages long and it is impossible to know which brokers qualify for which tiers.
An analysis by RBC Capital Markets in October found at least 1,023 ""pricing paths"" across exchanges, made up of 3,762 variables, meaning that there are dozens of possible net prices for execution.
""These 3,762 variables strongly suggest that exchange prices are tailored and offered on a bespoke basis,"" the report said.
Exchanges have credited pricing tiers for helping boost revenues. Bats, an exchange operator that has since been sold to Cboe, said the introduction of tiered pricing for its markets in July 2011 helped increase revenues by $14.6 million over the rest of that year.
Large brokers, which include investment banks and high-frequency trading firms, can also profit from tiered pricing by offering smaller brokers that funnel their orders through them a portion of their steeper discounts, while keeping the remainder.

Cboe's Harkins said that this ""sponsored access"" allows smaller firms to share in the savings with big brokers.

1513,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 06:26PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Wages in Spotlight for Jobs Numbers
The unemployment report finally arrives tomorrow, with expectations for another solid month of job growth.
The Labor Department will release the February jobs numbers at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists forecast that the economy added 181,000 jobs last month, pushing the unemployment rate down slightly to 3.9%.
Barring a big beat or miss on payrolls, the market focus should be on wage growth, which is expected to have heated up in February. Wage inflation has been very slow to catch up with the tight U.S. stock market, giving the Federal Reserve a lot more leeway to be patient at present.
Average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3% for the month, bringing the year-over-year gain in earnings to 3.3%.
2. Housing Market Still Showing Cracks?
While the labor market consistently impresses, the housing market has been showing signs of fragility.
The January numbers on housing starts and building permits will arrive at 8:30 AM ET as well.
On average, economists expect that housing starts jumped 9.9% in January. But the forecast for building permits, an indicator of future demand, are forecast to have fallen 2.9%.
Last week the Economic Cycle Research Institute said its leading measure of home prices -- which it says “nailed” the 2006 housing bust in real time -- indicates “there is a real risk prices will actually fall.”
The graph of growth of the ECRI’s U.S. leading home price index indicated the worst home price outlook since 2009.
3. Costco Gets an Earnings Boost
The retail sector could get a boost when the opening bell rings tomorrow as Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) rose on bullish results.
Costco rose about 5% in postmarket trading this afternoon.
The company reported a fiscal second-quarter profit of $2.01 per share on sales of $35.4 billion. Profit was well ahead of analysts estimates of $1.69 a share, while sales were about in line with the forecast of $35.6 billion.

The company broke ground on the factory in January. A Shanghai city government official said on Wednesday the factory is expected to be completed in May.
Tesla has said that the Gigafactory will cost around $2 billion. 
In its filing, Tesla said it had amended its asset-backed lending credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, increasing revolving commitments by $500 million to a total of $2.425 billion, while extending the maturity date of the agreement by three years.
The credit agreement is secured by part of Tesla's accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Tesla borrowed $431.0 million under the agreement in 2018. 
The amendment also doubled the letter of credit subfacility to $400 million from $200 million.
Producing cars in China is likely to help the company minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, which has forced Tesla to adjust prices of its U.S.-made cars in China. 
Keeping prices in check will also help Tesla fend off competition from a swathe of domestic electric vehicle startups such as Nio Inc, Byton and XPeng Motors.

1519,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 05:01PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Posts Triple-Digit Loss as ECB Flags Slowing Growth,"Investing.com - The Dow closed lower Thursday, as sentiment on stocks was soured by slowing global growth concerns after the European Central Bank slashed its growth forecasts and launched fresh stimulus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.78% or 200 points, after falling as many as 321 points. The S&P 500 lost 0.81%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.13%. The S&P broke below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Feb. 11.
In the clearest signal yet the global economy is stuck in a rut, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said sizable moderation in euro-area growth would continue into the current year.
Draghi's downbeat remarks arrived just after the ECB downgraded its forecast on 2019 euro-area growth to 1.1% from a previous forecast of 1.7%. The central bank also detailed fresh stimulus measures intended to encourage lending, just three months after announcing an end to its bond-buying program.
Concerns about slowing global growth fueled demand for U.S. government bonds, pushing prices higher and yields lower, keeping a lid on bank stocks.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) fell 1% as 10-Year Treasury yields ended the day lower.
Falling Treasury yields are seen as a headwind for banks, reducing their net interest margin, the difference between the interest income generated by operations and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
Energy stocks struggled to shake off the broad market selloff. U.S. oil prices settled higher, but remained under pressure as traders continued to weigh up ongoing output cuts from major oil producers against data from a day earlier showing a surge in domestic crude supplies.
As the curtain closes on the quarterly earnings season, the latest batch of corporate results were mostly negative, adding to losses in the major averages.

On the economic front, investors digested mixed economic data showing subdued quarterly productivity gains and a decline in jobless claims.
The decline in jobless claims comes a day ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls data due Friday 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).

HONG KONG/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies sued the U.S. government on Thursday, saying a law limiting its American business was unconstitutional, ratcheting up its fight back against a government bent on closing it out of global markets.
Huawei said it had filed a complaint in a federal court in Texas challenging Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in August, which bars federal agencies and their contractors from procuring its equipment and services.
The lawsuit marks the latest confrontation between China and the United States, which spent most of 2018 slapping import tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods. The year ended with the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in Canada at U.S. request, to the consternation of China.
Long before Trump initiated the trade war, Huawei's activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with 10 people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.
""The U.S. Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products. We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,"" Huawei Rotating Chairman Guo Ping said in a statement.
""This ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers,"" he said. ""We look forward to the court's verdict.""
While Huawei had very little share of the U.S. market before the bill, it is the world's biggest telecoms gear maker and is seeking to be at the forefront of a global rollout of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and services.
In its lawsuit, Huawei said its ""equipment and services are subject to advanced security procedures, and no backdoors, implants, or other intentional security vulnerabilities have been documented in any of the more than 170 countries in the world where Huawei equipment and services are used.""
The privately owned firm has embarked on a public relations and legal offensive as Washington lobbies allies to abandon Huawei when building 5G networks, focusing on a 2017 Chinese law requiring companies to cooperate with national intelligence work.
""The U.S. Government is sparing no effort to smear the company and mislead the public,"" Guo said in a news briefing at Huawei's headquarters in southern China.
The U.S. State Department declined comment on the lawsuit on Thursday.
""More generally,"" State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters, ""the United States advocates for secure telecom networks and supply chains that are free from suppliers subject to foreign government control or undue influence which would pose risks of unauthorized access and malicious cyber activity.""
U.S. Representative Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican who has sponsored anti-Huawei legislation, called the Huawei lawsuit ""bogus.""
""NO PROOF""
The NDAA bans the U.S. government from doing business with Huawei or compatriot peer ZTE Corp (HK:0763) or from doing business with any company that has equipment from the two companies as a ""substantial or essential component"" of their system.
In its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas, Huawei argues that the section in question is illegal because it could sharply limit the company's ability to do business in the United States despite no proof of wrongdoing.
The lawsuit also alleges that Huawei has been denied due process and that Congress, by stripping Huawei of commercial opportunities, has violated the ""separation of powers"" portion of the U.S. Constitution by doing the work of the courts.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he had no information on whether China's government may also seek legal action against the U.S. law, but added Huawei's move is ""totally reasonable and totally understandable.""
UPHILL BATTLE
Some legal experts said Huawei's lawsuit is likely to be dismissed because U.S. courts are reluctant to second-guess national security determinations by other branches of government.
The lawsuit ""will be an uphill battle because Congress has broad authority to protect us from perceived national security threats,"" said Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English.
In November, a federal appeals court rejected a similar lawsuit filed by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, which was challenging a ban on the use of its software in U.S. government networks.
The Texas court hearing Huawei's case will not be bound by that decision, but will likely adopt its reasoning because of similarities in the two disputes, said Steven Schwinn, a professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago.
""I don't see how (Huawei) can really escape that result,"" said Schwinn.
Huawei's chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said the two cases were different in terms of evidence and scope, and that the Chinese company's case had ""full merits.""
If a judge decides Huawei has a plausible claim, the case will proceed to the discovery phase, in which internal documents are shared and U.S. government officials could be forced to provide testimony and lay out their security concerns.
RETRIBUTION
The legal action compares with a more restrained response in December emphasizing ""trust in justice"" after the arrest of Chief Financial Officer Sabrina Meng Wanzhou.
Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei later said Meng's arrest was politically motivated and ""not acceptable.""
Meng - Ren's daughter - is accused by the United States of bank and wire fraud related to breaches of trade sanctions against Iran. Canada approved extradition proceedings on March 1, but Meng has since sued Canada's government for procedural wrongs in her arrest. The next court hearing is set for May 8.
The case strained Canada's relations with China, which this week accused two arrested Canadians of stealing state secrets and blocked Canadian canola imports.

Meng is under house arrest in Vancouver. It is unclear where the two Canadians are being detained in China, and at least one does not have access to legal representation, sources previously told Reuters.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 04:03PM ET</span>",American Airlines grounds 14 planes due to overhead bin issue,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc grounded 14 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 airplanes on Thursday after complaints by pilots that overhead bins on some recently-retrofitted aircraft cabins were not closing, an American official said.
In a statement, American said the issue did not jeopardize the safety of flights and that it is working with the supplier that handled the cabin retrofits and the Federal Aviation Administration to immediately address the issue.
American had hired a long-time supplier, ATS, to update the main cabins of some of its 737-800s with 12 additional seats, said Gary Schaible, president of Transport Workers Union Local 591, which represents 4,800 American mechanics.
After write-ups from pilots saying that overhead bins on some 737-800s were not closing after the updating, the planes were taken to American's maintenance base in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where mechanics discovered additional issues, Schaible said.
The American official confirmed the problem of bins not closing.
""After further inspection by American, the work that was conducted on these two aircraft was not up to our standards. Out of an abundance of caution, we have proactively removed from service the additional 12 aircraft that were updated by this vendor and have notified the FAA,"" American said.
American, the world's largest air carrier, has rebooked all customers on 40 canceled flights so far as a result of the groundings. 
The airline has completed around 70 retrofits of the 737-800s, the American official said, but only around 15 were done by ATS, with the remainder handled in-house and by a separate supplier.
The company has not had an issue with any of the other updated planes, the official said. 

The outsourcing of maintenance work, to U.S.-based suppliers like ATS or in-house American employees abroad, is at the core of ongoing contract talks between American and its mechanics unions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Purchases of U.S.-made Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co aircraft by China could be part of a sweeping deal currently being negotiated to end the months-long trade war between Washington and Beijing, Boeing's top executive said on Thursday.
A tit-for-tat trade war between the world's two largest economic powers has slowed the global economy. It has also opened up new risks for Boeing, which calls itself America's biggest exporter, in the world's fastest growing aviation market. Boeing sells roughly a third of its top-selling U.S.-made 737 jetliners to customers in China.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told an aviation summit in Washington that he sensed U.S.-China trade talks were progressing ""in a good way.""
""They are dealing with some of the tough framework issues around intellectual property and things like that,"" Muilenburg said. ""I do think they are making progress. And at the same time, I think there's an economic opportunity here for airplanes to be part of the ultimate deal and help further close the trade deficit gap.""
Governments typically use jet deals to achieve broader diplomatic objectives. In talks with Beijing, U.S. officials have demanded more details on China's pledge to make big purchases of American goods, as well as to push for ways to hold China to any commitments on changes to industrial policies.
U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded that China shrink its widening trade surplus with the United States. On Wednesday, the U.S. reported the goods trade deficit with China rose 11.6 percent to an all-time high of $419.2 billion in 2018. 
China is poised to overtake the United States as the world's largest aviation market in the next decade and is gobbling up planes made by both Boeing and European rival Airbus SE, while also investing in homegrown aircraft businesses. 

Boeing forecasts Chinese demand for 7,700 new airplanes over the next 20 years valued at $1.2 trillion.

(Reuters) - Wall Street dropped for the fourth day on Thursday, led by financial stocks, after the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to launch a fresh round of cheap loans to revive the eurozone economy and defer interest rate hikes to at least next year.
The ECB also cut its growth and inflation forecasts, adding to a cocktail of concerns over trade tensions, Brexit uncertainty and global growth risks, which have weighed on markets over the past year.
""We are (in) a period of continued weakness and pervasive uncertainty,"" ECB President Mario Draghi, acknowledging that Europe's slowdown was longer and deeper than earlier thought.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields slipped to a one-week low. The interest rate sensitive financial sector fell 1.05 percent and weighed the most among S&P sectors.
Shares of big banks Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) fell between 0.8 percent and 1.4 percent.
""Investors are trading off of global macro concerns because the ECB reduced eurozone growth expectation and induced more monetary stimulus,"" said Brant Houston, a managing director at CIBC U.S. Private Wealth Management in Denver, Colorado.
""The rally in the U.S. market looks tired. They have come a long way in a short period of time and the pace of gains are not sustainable through the full year.""
After a nearly 10 percent rally in the S&P 500 this year on the back of optimism over trade negotiations and a dovish stance by the Federal Reserve, U.S. stocks have taken a pause this week, looking for triggers to drive markets higher.
The four days of losses for the S&P 500 is the longest since late December.
At 12:52 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 162.73 points, or 0.63 percent, at 25,510.73. The S&P 500 was down 14.39 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,757.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 42.61 points, or 0.57 percent, at 7,463.31.
Also dragging markets lower were technology companies, which slipped 0.36 percent, hurt by a fall in marquee names including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Only the defensive utilities and real estate sectors were trading higher.
At session lows, the benchmark index dipped below its closely watched 200-day moving average, a proxy for long-term momentum, after failing to rise above the 2,800-point mark in recent sessions.
Data showed U.S. weekly jobs claims unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to strong labor market conditions despite signs that job growth was slowing. The Labor Department report comes a day ahead of the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report.
Among stocks, Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co tumbled 9.27 percent after the supermarket chain projected annual earnings below Wall Street forecasts.
Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc rose 5.05 percent, despite its depression drug failing three late-stage studies, as analysts called the failure widely expected.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.96-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.51-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 17 new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 17 new highs and 41 new lows.

Rosetta Stone (NYSE:RST) surged 30% after reporting a fourth-quarter a loss of 19 cents a share, above expectations compiled by Investing.com for loss of 38 cents a share. Revenue of $44.57 million fell just short of estimates for $44.8 million.
The company blamed the miss on the top line on a decline in its consumer language segment - driven largely from the company's transition from perpetual product sales to subscription-based sales - offsetting record growth in its literacy segment.
Consumer language segment revenue declined 13% year over year to $15.5 million. Revenue at Lexia increased 20% year over year to a record $14.5 million.
""(Last year) was a transformative year for Rosetta Stone, marked by exceptional growth in our Literacy business, re-imaged products in our Language business and the completion of the transition of our company to subscription sales,"" said Chairman and CEO John Hass.
The company transitioned from a one-time sales model to a subscription-based product, which offers a predictable revenue stream, reducing the rate of customer churn.
The mixed results failed to deter Wall Street, as Barrington reiterated its outperform rating on Rosetta stone and raised its price target on the stock to $27 from $24 on expectations that ""(s)ales and revenue growth will return in 2019 after three consecutive down years.""
Rosetta Stone expects revenue of about $191 million for 2019 and a full-year loss of $0.68 per share, above its prior forecast for loss of $1.02 a share."

“Canada has provided consular access and due process for Ms. Meng,"" Risch said in a statement. ""It is only right for the Senate to join Canada in expressing concern over arbitrary detention and mistreatment of Canadian nationals by the Chinese government.""
China on Monday accused detained Canadian citizen Michael Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him from another detained Canadian, businessman Michael Spavor, in a move likely to increase tension between Ottawa and Beijing.
Huawei has sued the U.S. government, saying a law limiting its U.S. business is unconstitutional, ratcheting up its fight against a government bent on closing it out of global markets.

Huawei CFO Meng is accused by the United States of bank and wire fraud related to breaches of trade sanctions against Iran. Canada approved extradition proceedings on March 1, but Meng has since sued Canada's government for procedural wrongs in her arrest. The next court hearing is set for May 8.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan has blocked the sculptor of the ""Fearless Girl"" statue that promoted gender diversity on Wall Street and in other companies from selling replicas, court papers released on Thursday show.
U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods issued a temporary restraining order against Kristen Visbal as part of a lawsuit filed against her last month by  State Street  Global Advisors, which commissioned the original bronze statue.
State Street said Visbal's sale of unauthorized replicas undermined its message that female leaders help companies perform better. It said the replicas damaged its goodwill, and infringed its intellectual property rights.
The unit of Boston-based State Street Corp (NYSE:STT) has about $2.5 trillion of assets under management.
According to court papers, Woods declined on Feb. 26 to issue a restraining order after Visbal's lawyers told him she planned merely to discuss her creation of ""Fearless Girl"" at an unveiling in Melbourne, Australia.
The judge changed his mind after State Street said Visbal instead promoted two financial institutions and discussed gender diversity in that sector, violating her license agreement.
Woods' order bars Visbal from selling a ""Fearless Girl"" replica to a German buyer, or using online forms to sell replicas, including a smaller version for $6,650. (http://www.fearlessgirl.us/purchase-a-reproduction)
""Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, and ... that it will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not entered,"" Woods wrote.
Visbal's lawyer Nancy Wolff called the order ""unfortunate,"" but said State Street's agreement lets her client sell replicas, and discuss their shared gender diversity goals at unveilings.
""Kristen's goal for 'Fearless Girl' is to create replicas for public placement around the world, where the public can stand with the iconic artwork and be inspired by its meaning,"" Wolff said in a statement.
Lawyers for State Street did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""Fearless Girl"" was installed in March 2017 in Bowling Green in downtown Manhattan, facing the ""Charging Bull"" sculpture.
It was removed last November for eventual installation near the New York Stock Exchange.

The case is State Street Global Advisors Trust Co v Visbal, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-01719.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",EPA disregarded biofuel rules to help refineries: court documents,"(Reuters) - U.S. environmental regulators quietly changed the way they assess applications from refineries for waivers from the 2017 federal biofuel law, making it possible for highly profitable plants to secure lucrative exemptions, according to court documents filed by a biofuels trade group on Thursday. 
The new documents, part of a ongoing lawsuit that initially began last year, could provide the most complete explanation to date of how the Environmental Protection Agency, under former Administrator Scott Pruitt, vastly expanded the number of small refinery hardship biofuel waivers early in the Trump administration.
The change saved the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars and angered farmers in the nation's heartland, who say the expansion crushed the credit prices that are an integral part of the ethanol industry.
The EPA stopped considering whether compliance with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard would prevent a refinery from making money and being competitive, according to the court filing by the Advanced Biofuels Association (ABFA) in 2017.
Instead the agency considered primarily whether compliance would cause a ""disproportionate"" impact on the facility, an easier hurdle to clear. 
Under the government's Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), refiners must mix biofuels like ethanol with their gasoline and diesel, but they can be exempt if they can prove that complying would cause them a level of financial harm.
RFS requires that refiners blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel pool or buy credits from competitors who do.
To assess applications, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) scores facilities before the EPA makes a final decision.
The EPA turned over documents explaining their decisions to the ABFA related to 48 applications as part of the legal discovery process. In 24 cases, the DOE ruled that the RFS would have no impact on the refinery's ability to stay competitive and profitable, but the EPA still granted the waiver, ABFA alleged in the court documents.
EPA officials were not immediately available to comment. The EPA has said it has not changed how it handles biofuel waiver applications.
The trade group has asked a federal court in Washington to rule on the legality of the expansion of the hardship waivers under Pruitt.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 12:59PM ET</span>","GE seeks better insurance returns in junk bonds, other risk assets","By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co will invest more heavily in junk bonds, private equity and other high-yield investments to boost returns at its ailing insurance business, company executives said on Thursday.
Seeking to calm investors about its insurance liabilities, GE said its insurance investments are too conservative compared with competitors. The change will allow for better returns that help reduce the amount of reserves it must set aside for claims, Anthony Grandolfo, the chief investment officer of GE's insurance business, told analysts on a conference call.
Asked about increased risk, he said GE was still being prudent. ""We're starting from a point where we think (the portfolio) is quite conservative and we expect to continue to maintain a portfolio that is quite conservative,"" said Grandolfo, who was hired as GE's first dedicated chief investment officer for insurance in October.
Only 2 percent of GE's insurance assets are currently in non-investment-grade investments - much less than the 12 percent average in the industry, Grandolfo said, citing a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) study. GE plans to gradually increase its level to 8 percent by 2024, he added.
GE has also hired two other executives to run its insurance unit: Chief Executive Officer Tim Kneeland, who formerly handled long-term care policies at Transamerica, and Managing Director Bob Deutsch, former chief financial officer at CNA Financial.
In a presentation https://www.ge.com/investor-relations/sites/default/files/GE_Capital_Insurance_Teach-In_Presentation.pdf that repeated information GE supplied in its annual report last week, the Boston-based conglomerate said it has achieved about $500 million worth of premium increases that it is in the process of putting in place. It is also pressing for $1.2 billion in further increases to help stem losses on some 300,000 long-term care insurance policies, which cover costs for services such as in-home or nursing-home care.
GE shares were up 2.3 percent at $9.32 on Thursday. 
Investor focus now turns to GE's presentation of its full-year forecast, scheduled for March 14. 
GE shocked investors when it took a surprise $6.2 billion after-tax charge last year and began setting aside $15 billion - one of the largest such amounts ever - to cover the policies that were underwritten more than a decade ago, when actuaries did not yet know how costly the claims would become. 
GE's insurance losses are among a host of problems the 127-year-old company is facing as it attempts a breakup under new Chief Executive Larry Culp in an effort to restore profit and buoy its stock, which has tumbled to less than a third of its value in mid-2016.
The company also said it is looking at ""options"" to reduce its insurance risk, adding to hints from Culp on Tuesday about possible sales of parts of the business. 
GE's massive power-plant business is hemorrhaging cash and contending with falling sales and technical problems, while the company is selling assets to pay down its outsized debt.
Since last year, GE has reduced the total amount of insurance reserves it plans to set aside to $14.5 billion by 2024 after completing an analysis of the policies. 
But some analysts have said GE may need to nearly double that amount because assumptions it used to calculate the exposure are optimistic. 
As a reinsurer, GE cannot seek premium increases directly. It must rely on about 30 companies that underwrote the policies it holds to seek increases from regulators in the numerous U.S. states where they were sold.
GE's target for new reserves amounts to about $55,000 per policy, compared with $77,282 at  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM) and $10,614 at  Unum Group  (NYSE:UNM), according to an analysis for Reuters by Audit Analytics, an independent research company based in Massachusetts.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 12:48PM ET</span>","Kroger's $3 billion splurge set to hit earnings, shares slide","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co projected annual profit below Wall Street estimates on Thursday, as the grocer spends billions of dollars on modernizing its stores and delivery to compete better with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Its shares slid as much as 14 percent in morning trade after it also reported a 10 percent fall in fourth-quarter revenue and lower-than-expected earnings for the first time since October 2017.
Profits are expected to come under pressure as the retailer plans annual spending of up to $3.2 billion — up from $3 billion last year — to overhaul stores and improve its online business under a program called ""Restock Kroger"" launched over a year ago.
""We realized business transformations are hard,"" Kroger Chief Executive William McMullen said on a conference call with analysts. ""But I want to emphasize we are on track to deliver on our Restock Kroger commitments.""
The Cincinnati-based company has built robot-aided warehouses and is trying out self-driving vehicles to improve delivery, while introducing shelves in hundreds of stores that play videos and show nutritional information.
Such moves are expected to help Kroger better compete with the likes of Amazon, which is looking to expand in the grocery business, according to media reports.
Kroger said it had finished most of its store remodeling last year, and going forward, its work would be more targeted and less disruptive to customers.
The retailer, which also runs gas stations, forecast full-year earnings of between $2.15 and $2.25 per share, which fell short of Wall Street expectations of $2.26.
""We expect 2019 to be a transition year with only modest operating income growth,"" Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha said of Kroger.
Its net income plunged to $259 million in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 2, from $854 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 48 cents per share, below analysts' estimates of 52 cents.
Revenue fell to $28.09 billion, missing estimates of $28.38 billion, mainly due to higher gas prices that discouraged customers from buying fuel.

Kroger's shares were last down 9.5 percent at $25.76 in afternoon trading.

Foreign platinum and diamond miners have been restricted to only 49 percent ownership of their Zimbabwe operations by the black economic empowerment law introduced during Robert Mugabe's rule. The law was aimed at increasing black Zimbabweans' stake in the mining sector, but foreign investors said its implementation was often murky and open to abuse.
Zimbabwe holds the world's second-largest known platinum reserves behind South Africa. 
Asked to confirm a Bloomberg report that Zimbabwe will scrap the black empowerment rules for platinum, Winston Chitando told Reuters in a WhatsApp message: ""Confirmed. It's part of continued review of (the) Zimbabwe is open for business mantra.""
On when the amendments will be brought to parliament, Chitando said that dates would be announced soon.
Chitando, who is in Washington with Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube scouting for investment in Zimbabwe, did not respond when asked whether the changes will be extended to the diamond sector.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa is keen to revive the mining sector after years of reticence from foreign investors during Mugabe's rule. 
Investor interest in Zimbabwe's underexplored resources has improved more recently, however. Australia's Arcadia Resources is setting up a lithium mine while privately owned Karo Resources signed a $4.2 billion deal to set up a platinum mine and refinery and revived a Russian joint venture for a big platinum project near Harare. 
Among existing operations, Impala Platinum and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Platinum have assets in Zimbabwe while Sibanye-Stillwater has a joint venture mine with Implats.
Although no foreign platinum company had been forced to cede control, investors said the empowerment law added to the country's political risk profile.

The finance minister has said that Zimbabwe attracted $8 billion into mining last year alone and that projects are expected to take off in the next three years.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) , once one of the most active banks in commodities trading, has cut 10 roles to further downsize its global commodities trading division amid rising costs and shrinking profits.
Three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday the cuts were announced this week following an annual review of headcount across all divisions and regions. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
The commodities trading business was once one of Goldman's largest, most active units and a significant driver of profits earned by the Wall Street bank until tighter regulation curbed the risks it could take on proprietary bets.
Cuts were accelerated as competition with trading houses and oil majors increased and as profits shrank.
Three out of the 10 people being let go held senior roles or managing director positions within the company's commodities unit, a source with knowledge of the cuts said.
The cuts are global and will involve merging the commodities unit's metals trading desks, the source said.
Banks do not disclose their commodities revenues but financial analytics firm Coalition estimates the top 12 banks generated commodities trading revenue of less than $4 billion in 2018, down from nearly $16 billion in 2008. 
Fixed income, currencies and commodities revenues across all major investment banks dropped to their lowest levels seen since the financial crisis in the final quarter of 2018, the Coalition data showed, with oil trading suffering significant declines across the year. 
Goldman launched a months-long review of the commodities division to evaluate its profitability and the use of capital.
The review began under Goldman's previous chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, who was once a commodity trader himself and was seen as a big supporter of the division, but was completed under the new chief, David Solomon, who has never traded commodities.
The review showed the business was using too much capital for too little profit, the Wall Street Journal reported in February, citing people familiar with the matter.
The Journal said Goldman was discussing pulling back in physical trading of iron ore, platinum and other metals.

One of the sources told Reuters on Friday that Goldman was not exiting any commodity businesses and they would remain a large and important part of the bank's securities division.

The ruling, seen by Reuters in a document filed on Thursday, confirms a decision taken in June by Italy's Court of Accounts saying it did not have jurisdiction in the matter.
The case revolves around Morgan Stanley derivative transactions made by the Italian state between 1995 and 2005 and terminated in December 2011 and January 2012.
The Italian state incurred large losses on its derivative positions. 
State prosecutors had argued some contracts negotiated with the U.S. bank were speculative in nature and contained termination clauses that were overly advantageous to the bank.
Morgan Stanley said it welcomed the judgment and did not comment further. In the past the bank has repeatedly said the claim was groundless.
The case also includes claims against former senior officials at Italy's Treasury for a total of 1.18 billion euros. All the defendants have denied any wrongdoing.
""It's the right ruling, which fully reflects the defence's reasons,"" said Mario D'Urso, the lawyer representing former Treasury Director General Vittorio Grilli.
Prosecutors in the case can appeal the decision to Italy's Supreme Court.

Allergan announced on Wednesday that rapastinel, its depression treatment, had failed to meet clinical goals in three late-stage trials, spurring concerns among analysts over the drugmaker's pipeline of products.
""With this latest fiasco, we again call on the Company to install an independent chairman with suitable experience to bring new leadership to the Board and rein in management's predilection for value-destruction,"" Appaloosa said.
The hedge fund, led by billionaire David Tepper, has also said Allergan should consider selling or separating itself, and demanded that it split the role of chairman and chief executive officer.
Implementing Appaloosa's recommendations would be ""highly disruptive"" to its operations, Allergan has said.
""The Board's misplaced fear of 'disrupting' Allergan is wearing thin as an excuse for inaction and can only perpetuate further erosion in the shareholders' investment,"" Appaloosa added on Thursday.
Allergan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Its shares have been lagging those of its industry peers on account of abandoned plans to sell some businesses, a disappointing 2019 revenue forecast and rising competition for several important drugs.

BMW has factories in Europe, China and the United States and plans to establish China, the world's largest market for electric cars, as an export hub for such vehicles, given its lower labor costs and support for zero-emission cars.
But Washington and Beijing are locked in a trade dispute, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to increase tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods if the two sides can't reach a deal.
The uncertainty is making it hard for BMW to take a decision about exports, chief executive Harald Krueger said.
""We have no basis for taking a decision at the moment. Whether this is financially viable and whether it makes sense needs to be evaluated,"" Krueger told journalists at the Geneva car show. 
BMW bought a majority stake in its Chinese joint venture partner Brilliance last year and announced plans to build an electric version of its X3 sport-utility vehicle at the venture's plant in China.
So far, BMW has no other plans to produce the electric X3 in other markets, so that it can ramp up economies of scale in a technology that has so far proven to be a low margin business.
BMW has also signed a memorandum of understanding with China's Great Wall to build an electric version of the Mini. 
Whether an electric Mini could be exported from China is an open question, Peter Schwarzenbauer, BMW's board member responsible for Mini told Reuters in an interview.
""That’s probably the most strategic question we discussed over the past two or three years. With all the uncertainty around tariffs. I wouldn’t be able to give you a good answer of what will happen. The only option is to put yourself in a situation where you can react.""
China's size and government regulations favoring locally produced electric cars make it worthwhile for BMW to pursue the alliance with Great Wall to build a Mini in China.
But BMW is still undecided where to have Mini's export hub for electric cars. It has the option of building electric Mini's in Oxford, England, Born the Netherlands and in China, Schwarzenbauer said. 

""If China export is something that can be done easily, we could export much more out of China. If this becomes difficult, we have to balance it with Oxford and Born.""

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>",UK fraud office failed to get key Qatar documents for Barclays trial,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) failed to take ""reasonable and appropriate"" steps to get key documents from Qatar's U.S. lawyers before a fraud trial of four former  Barclays  (LON:BARC) executives, a London criminal court heard on Thursday.
The jury was told that Judge Robert Jay had ruled in January on the SFO's failure to obtain the documents from Latham & Watkins, before the start of the landmark court case against former Barclays CEO John Varley and former senior colleagues: Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath.
The men are on trial over side deals struck by the British bank when it raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14.5 billion) from investors, including Qatar, to stave off a state bailout in June and October 2008 at the height of the credit crisis.
Prosecutors allege the men, who are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation, misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds to Qatar through advisory service agreements (ASAs) that were not genuine.
The men deny wrongdoing. In documents shown to the court during the prosecution's case, they say they relied on legal advice at the time. 
Boath, the only defendant to answer SFO questions in 2014 and 2016 that went beyond a prepared statement, was told the agreements were legal as long as Qatar provided valuable services, according to extracts of interview transcripts shown to the court. He said he was confident that Jenkins, who had the relationship with Qatar, would deliver, the court heard.
The flagship SFO case marks the first criminal charges filed in Britain against such senior bankers over credit crisis-era conduct. The trial has offered a rare glimpse into how Barclays battled to avoid state control by clinching a rescue deal with Qatar over a decade ago.
Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested around 4.0 billion pounds in Barclays in two capital raisings in June and October 2008. 
In so-called ""agreed facts"" between prosecutors and the defense read out by the prosecution, the jury at Southwark Crown Court was told that the SFO had not interviewed or investigated either Qatari party.
The judge had also noted that although documents held by Qatar's lawyers Latham & Watkins were probably covered by legal privilege, the SFO had had options to try and obtain them, the jury heard.
SFO investigator David Webb told the jury on Thursday it had taken 18 months to two-years to get ""essential"" documents from Barclays that the bank originally said were privileged - confidential advice by lawyers for clients - before it waived privilege.
The judge asked Webb if he had asked Boath whether the former director knew that the ASA was never intended to provide genuine services. 
""I don't know,"" he said. ""If I did say that it would be on the transcript.""
Prosecutors have now closed their case, marking the formal half-way stage in the trial. The judge dismissed the jury until April 1 to allow for lengthy ""discussions of law"" to begin, he said.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 10:05AM ET</span>",SoftBank extends tech reach with $5 billion LatAm fund,"By Sam Nussey
(Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group is launching a $5 billion fund to invest in technology companies in Latin America, it said on Thursday, ramping up its tech ambitions beyond its huge Vision Fund.
The new fund will be headed by SoftBank's Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, it said in a statement, with the Japanese technology conglomerate committing an initial $2 billion and serving as the fund's general partner.
The group has already shaken up the technology sector with the Saudi-backed $100 billion Vision Fund, making splashy investments in late-stage start-ups such as ride-hailing company Uber and shared offices provider WeWork Cos. 
The launch of the Latin America-focused SoftBank Innovation Fund will extend Bolivian-born billionaire Claure's responsibility beyond managing SoftBank-owned companies like chip designer Arm. 
Responsibility for driving synergies between minority-stake portfolio companies, which is a key rationale for SoftBank's investment strategy, is shared between Claure and the head of the Vision Fund Rajeev Mishra. 
""There is so much innovation and disruption taking place in the region and I believe the business opportunities have never been stronger,"" said Claure, who is executive chairman of SoftBank's U.S. telecoms unit Sprint Corp and is working to ensure the success of its planned takeover by Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile. 
The fund will invest across the region, targeting much the same sectors as SoftBank's existing investments, including e-commerce, fintech and healthcare. 
""Latin America presents significant opportunities for SoftBank Group and the Vision Fund will have the ability to co-invest alongside the SoftBank Innovation Fund,"" said Mishra. 
Claure, Mishra and Chief Strategy Officer Katsunori Sago are all seen as potential successors to SoftBank Group founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son. 
The new fund, the size of which will give it a strong presence in the region, will also help existing portfolio companies to expand in Latin America, SoftBank said. 
SoftBank's previous bets in the region include a $100 million stake in ride-hailing business 99, which was later acquired by another of its investments, Didi Chuxing.

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 09:58AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Thyssen, Tata on collision course with Europe over joint venture: sources","By Maytaal Angel, Christoph Steitz and Tom Käckenhoff
LONDON/FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and Tata Steel will not go very far in concessions to gain approval for a planned steel venture, four people familiar with the matter said, adding their offer might not be enough to satisfy the European Commission.
The two companies last year struck a deal to combine their European steel units to create the continent's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, a move that must be cleared by the European regulators.
Brussels last month sent a statement of objections in its antitrust review of the transaction, effectively asking for remedies in exchange for approval in three areas -- electrical steel, galvanized steel for car parts, and packaging steel.
While Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel are working on a remedy package, they are unlikely to make far-reaching concessions, three people familiar with the matter said, increasing the risk of a lengthy tussle with the Commission.
Two of the people said the groups would argue that remedies in the areas of electrical and galvanized steel were not needed.
""The whole JV is half the size of ArcelorMittal, so Tata and Thyssen are trying to challenge the view of the EU on galva, they're not accepting it, they're going to try resist it as much as possible,"" one of the people said.
""Why would you leave ArcelorMittal being so big?""
Another person said an overly generous remedy offer would also eat into planned synergies of 400 million to 500 million euros ($452-$566 million), which has been one of the cornerstones of the transaction for shareholders on both sides.
A spokesman for Thyssenkrupp said the company was in constructive talks with the Commission and that it remained confident that the transaction could be completed in the spring. Tata Steel was not immediately available for comment.
FINE BALANCE
The situation highlights growing pressure on Thyssenkrupp boss Guido Kerkhoff, who must strike a fine balance between demands of powerful labor leaders, who have warned not to give up too much, and investors that have been waiting for a deal for about three years.
It is widely expected that the companies need to offer up remedies in the area of packaging steel, where the combined entity would have a large share of the European market. Thyssenkrupp, however, will try to keep its Rasselstein packaging unit, the people said.
Ultimately, it will come down to who needs the joint venture more. Thyssenkrupp, whose steel unit has been seen as the stronger part of the planned entity, could live with a collapse, Kerkhoff said last week.
If the deal fails, the German conglomerate may lose a right to get a bigger share of proceeds from a potential public listing and, more importantly, an opportunity to offload about 4 billion euros in liabilities.
But at the same time it would leave more meat on Thyssenkrupp Materials AG, the entity that will be left after a planned spin-off of Thyssenkrupp's capital goods business: elevators, car parts and plant engineering.
Tata Steel, on the other hand, is considered to be keener on the joint venture, partially because it improves future prospects for its ailing Port Talbot plant, the people said.
The two groups must send their remedy proposal to Brussels by March 20, two of the people said, adding this would delay an April 29 deadline the Commission has set to rule on the matter by 15 working days.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Compliance and anti-money laundering staff are in hot demand in the Nordic financial sector following tougher regulations and a string of scandals involving the region's top banks Danske Bank, Nordea and Swedbank.
Compliance officers ensure banks meet industry regulations that have mushroomed since the financial crisis a decade ago, and most global financial hubs have been through a hiring boom.
The recruitment drive in the Nordic region, however, has been given extra impetus by a money laundering scandal at Denmark's Danske Bank, which has spread to some other lenders in Sweden and Finland.
""We've become the new 'business rock stars',"" a Copenhagen-based compliance professional told Reuters. 
He saw a 50 percent jump in wages the last time he changed job to almost 1.2 million Danish crowns ($182,000) per year and is regularly contacted by headhunters. 
""Money-laundering was the buzzword of the year last year, and I wouldn't be surprised if compliance officer became the buzzword this year,"" he said.
The highest paid 10 percent compliance managers in Copenhagen's financial sector now earn more than 1.2 million crowns per year, almost twice the average for law and economy graduates, figures from trade union DJOF show. 
Danske Bank said last month it would take on an extra 600 compliance and anti-money laundering staff this year. It has already quadrupled the number since 2015 to 1,200.
""There is great competition for the skilled employees, and we can feel that,"" said Ole Bech-Petersen, head of Joining & Leaving at Danske, adding it would be impossible for the bank to find enough trained staff in Denmark. 
The bank is expanding its search to include new graduates from many different fields of study, experienced customer-oriented bankers, and compliance experts who could be recruited outside Scandinavia, he said.
BROAD DEMAND 
Compliance professionals are also in demand in other industries, such as drugmaking, software development, law and manufacturing, as regulations proliferate and companies seek to reduce legal risks. 
""The perception has been that we can just get someone from outside the financial sector. But they're not there. Many companies need these people,"" said Michael Budolfsen, president of Nordic Financial Unions, a labor group for financial staff.
Jobindex, a major Danish job site, posted almost 1,500 job adverts containing the word ""compliance"" last quarter, up from less than 200 per quarter a decade ago.
""Many companies are interested in these employees, so the recruitment process often happens very fast, especially for young, well-educated people,"" said Soren Billeschou Christiansen, partner at Proselection, a large recruitment specialist within accounting and finance. 
Finland-based Nordea, the largest bank in the Nordics, said it had invested more than 730 million euros ($825 million) in the last three years in areas such as fighting financial crime and compliance, and now has over 1,500 staff in such fields. 
Because of local skills shortages and rising wages, Nordic banks are looking at alternative ways to manage risks. 
Sweden's Handelsbanken, for example, said that as well as hiring more people banks could develop IT systems and use artificial intelligence in areas such as fraud prevention. 
The largest Nordic banks have in recent years also increasingly moved administrative and service tasks to Baltic countries, where wages are generally lower.
Danske's Bech-Petersen said most of its 600 new jobs would be in either Denmark or Lithuania, where the bank set up a service center in 2012 that has more than 2,300 employees.
But such steps have so far done little to temper demand for local compliance specialists, as some of the region's financial regulators can testify. 
""Ironically, when we ask the banks to bolster anti-money laundering we know that they start looking at our personnel,"" said Erik Thedeen, head of Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority
""This has been a major problem ... We are a state agency, we can't pay the kind of wages they pay in the private sector.

The V3 charger was designed with the Tesla Model 3 sedan in mind. Its newer battery composition can accommodate the newer charger right away, while Model S and Model X vehicles will remain limited to 120kW charging for the time being,  The Verge reported. A planned software update will raise that cap to 145kW ""in the coming months,"" Tesla said.
According to Tesla, the new V3 chargers can add up to 75 miles of range to a Model 3 Long Range sedan in just five minutes, and ""charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour.""
""Combined with other improvements we’re announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data,"" Tesla said in its statement Wednesday night.
The new V3 chargers went online in the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday. Additional locations are expected to open later.

The electric-car company has been keenly focused on developing its charging infrastructure — an effort that's been kicked into high gear since the Model 3 sedan, its first mass-market vehicle, went on sale.
Echoing its previous remarks on the matter, the company said ""charging needs to be even faster, and the number of vehicles able to charge at a location in a day needs to be significantly higher.""
To that end, Tesla says its new V3 chargers will also be able to charge vehicles at optimal rates, even at Supercharger stations where multiple vehicles are charging at once.
""With thousands of new Superchargers coming online in 2019, the launch of V3, and other changes we’re making to improve throughput, the Supercharger network will be able to serve more than 2x more vehicles per day at the end of 2019 compared with today,"" Tesla said."

They have also agreed not to introduce geoblocking clauses in future film-licensing contracts with other broadcasters in the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU states and Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland

Sky's contracts require film studios to ensure that their movies are not available on rival pay-TV services available in Britain and Ireland. But the British company has now agreed that it will no longer apply these clauses.

1562,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 08:23AM ET</span>",Weekly Comic: Elon Musk Trolls the SEC as Tesla’s Stock Price Suffers,"Investing.com - Elon Musk’s itchy Twitter fingers have failed him again after a tweet he sent to his 25 million followers late last month got him in hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The SEC has asked a federal judge to hold the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss in contempt for a Feb. 19 tweet about his electric car company.
""Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,"" the offending tweet reads. This was misleading, according to SEC officials, because the true output for this year will be considerably lower.
Musk issued a clarifying tweet a few hours after the first one: ""Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.""



That could jeopardize the deal he struck last September with the SEC, which notably required Musk to step down as Tesla chair and pay a fine of $20 million.
Musk’s Twitter use is supposed to be sharply observed after the Tesla CEO reached a settlement with the SEC for a different twitter-related controversy last year, when he claimed he had sufficient funding to take Tesla private.
“While Musk claims to ‘respect the justice system,’ his deliberate indifference to compliance with this Court’s final judgment indicates otherwise,” the SEC argues.
Musk has a long history of disagreements with the SEC, which he once termed the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission”.
In a Feb. 26 tweet, he said that ""something is broken with SEC oversight.""



Shares of the electric-car maker, which have lost 17% in the past 12 months, are currently trading near their lowest level since October.

The reorganization is expected to be implemented in mid-2019 and the new holding company's shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under its current ticker ""XRX"". 
A holding company structure allows a firm to lower its tax bill, protect patents and diversify its unit's businesses efficiently. In 2015, Google formed a holding company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, with distinct units under it.
Xerox scrapped a complex deal last year to merge with Fujifilm Holdings Corp after it ran into strong opposition from activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason. 

In the last two quarters, Xerox topped profit estimates and undertook initiatives to streamline its business under the new management led by Chief Executive Officer John Visentin, an Icahn appointee.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks were stuck in their worst run of the year and bonds were on the rise on Thursday, as investors waited for confirmation that the European Central Bank will start shoveling cheap cash at the euro zone again.
The ECB was holding its second meeting of the year, and with the euro almost motionless and stocks (EU) suffering from the same growth nerves that will see the central bank chop its in-house forecasts later, markets were poised.
Europe's STOXX 600 index retreated further from five-month highs as MSCI's 47-country benchmark world index dropped for a fourth straight session, setting its longest losing streak since December's rout. 
Italy's government bonds rallied to a 7-month high though its banks, which used the biggest share of the previous round of cheap ECB loans, failed to add to the highs hit in the previous session. 
The ECB's post-meeting statement is due at 1245 GMT. A return to what was once its flagship crisis-fighting tool would be a wrenching change of direction for the ECB just months after it wound down its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.94 trillion) QE program.
But Head of investments at UK fund manager Hermes, Eoin Murray, said he wondered how much impact such measures, or even another round U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus, would have, considering the potency has tended to wane with every new round in recent years.
""I just don't think it will have the power to get the economy to the point of takeoff,"" Murray said. ""The question is, is the world moving toward Japanification?"" referring to Japan's decades-long struggle to revive its economy. 
Europe's caution also came after Asia had struggled overnight. 
Japan's Nikkei fell 0.7 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.9 percent and Chinese blue-chips snapped a four-day winning streak as the boost from new stimulus plans there ran into the sand. 
Wall Street's main indexes had fallen for a third straight session, with the S&P 500 posting its biggest one-day decline in a month, as investors sought reasons to buy after a near 20 percent rally since the start of the year. 
Futures markets were pointing to another day in the red too.
""For some time, markets had been pricing in good news, namely that the talks between the U.S. and China will likely go well,"" said Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset Management. ""Now markets are having a pause.""
Adding to concerns about the talks was data that showed the U.S. goods trade deficit surged to a record high in 2018 as strong domestic demand pulled in imports, despite the Trump administration's ""America First"" policies aimed at shrinking the gap.
Other U.S. data out on Wednesday had suggested some slowing in the labor market, though the pace of job gains remains more than enough to drive the unemployment rate down and Friday's ""non-farm"" carry far more weight anyway. 
(Graphic: Impact of TLTRO on Italian and Spanish banks link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2VH5AZw).
TIME TO TLTRO?
In the currency market, the euro hovered near a two-week low at $1.1304 ahead of the ECB and its expected news on its cheap long-term loans for banks, known more formally as Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs). 
If ECB officials had needed any more convincing, the European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, on Thursday confirmed euro zone GDP rose just 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter in the final part of last year. 
It also revised down to 1.1 percent the year-on-year number from its original 1.2 percent estimate made late last month. 
The dollar was steady at 111.70 yen, just off a 2-1/2-month peak of 112.135. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six of its peers, barely moved at 96.820. 
The Canadian and Australian dollars languished near two-month lows after it became increasingly clear on Wednesday that both country's would either keep interest rates steady or even lower them this year. 
Adding to the Aussie's woes was data on Thursday showing local retailers suffered another bleak month in January though the Aussie last changed hands at $0.7042, up 0.1 percent on the day.
Renewed Brexit uncertainty, meanwhile, pushed the pound away from an 8-month to below $1.32 after meetings between EU diplomats and British Prime Minister Theresa May's chief lawyer, Geoffrey Cox, looked to have gone badly.
EU sources told Reuters they were now skeptical a reworked Brexit transition deal -- that needs to solve the deep political complexities of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland -- can be agreed before a crucial March 21-22 summit that was supposed to seal the deal.
""Markets are getting conflicting signals from lawmakers in Britain and the negative news flow from Brussels on the negotiation process, and that is keeping the pound in a tight range,"" said Nikolay Markov, a senior economist at Pictet Asset Management.
The gloomier outlook wasn’t confined to Europe. Full-year 2019 GDP contractions of more than 1 percent were forecast for last year’s emerging market casualties Turkey and Argentina, whose currencies are again on the slide. 
MSCI's emerging market equity index fell back to its lowest level in a couple of weeks on Thursday and its currency equivalent slipped for the second day. 
Among commodities, oil edged up amid ongoing OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against exporters Venezuela and Iran, although prices were prevented from rising further by record U.S. crude output and rising commercial fuel inventories. 
Brent crude futures were last at $66.83 per barrel, up 84 cents or 1.2 percent from their last close, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were at up 60 cents at $56.82 per barrel.

1568,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Rent the Runway and West Elm partner to rent customers home decor,"By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rent the Runway will partner with Williams-Sonoma Inc's West Elm brand to allow subscribers to rent home decor, the clothing rental company said on Thursday.
The New York City-based company, which has previously only rented out designer apparel and accessories, will let customers try out soft home goods, including quilts, blankets, shams and decorative pillows made by West Elm beginning in the summer. The items will be available in 26 ""bundles"" ranging in retail value from $150 to $450.
Founded in 2009 by Jennifer Hyman and Jenny Fleiss, Rent the Runway is one of a handful of clothing rental companies that have pitched themselves as an alternative to fast fashion players like H&M and Zara. 
Rent the Runway's unlimited subscribers pay $159 a month to rent four items at a time from a selection of more than 600 designers of clothing and accessories, for as long as they like.
The home good bundles would count as one of the four items. 
""One of the things that we continue to hear from our subscribers, other than that they want more, was what other parts of my life can you solve and home was something that kept popping up,"" said Maureen Sullivan, chief operating officer at Rent the Runway, adding that the partnership would give the company more access to data in hopes of luring in new customers.
""We have a ton of learnings around what people want to rent in apparel and accessories, but we don't know what people want to rent for their home.""
The partnership with Rent the Runway, whose customer is an average age of 29, will also potentially help West Elm attract a younger generation of shoppers, Sullivan said.
On home goods retailer Williams-Sonoma's last earnings call in November, Chief Executive Officer Laura Alber highlighted that product mix and lower price points have helped the company bring in new shoppers across brands.
""West Elm continues to grow its business across not just furniture but in other categories... And so they're attracting younger customers and customers coming into the market with not only price point but mix,"" Alber said, adding that they have also had success with Williams-Sonoma's dinnerware line Open Kitchen, which is ""attracting a younger clientele and new customers to the brand.""
This is the first time West Elm has made products available for rent.
""Together we can listen and respond to customer shopping behavior, allowing demand to drive iteration,"" said President of West Elm, Alex Bellos. Bellos did not provide comment on whether the partnership would lure in younger shoppers.

Fleiss also co-founded Jetblack, part of Walmart (NYSE:WMT).com Inc's first portfolio company, Store No. 8., in 2018. Jetblack is a same-day delivery service where customers can place orders using a text message.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Britain matches EU offer to maintain flights in no-deal Brexit scenario,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Thursday it would match an offer by the European Union to protect airlines' flying rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit, tackling one of the main concerns that planes could be grounded and lead to travel chaos. 
The Department for Transport said the government was still working to secure a withdrawal and transition deal with Brussels, but that as part of its preparations for all eventualities it had agreed to reciprocate EU plans. 
The EU executive has proposed allowing British airlines to fly to and from EU airports for 12 months after March 29, assuming Britain offered equivalent rights to EU airlines.
Britain said on Thursday for the 12 month period it intended to grant EU air carriers a level of access to the UK at least equivalent to the rights that would be granted to UK airlines under the EU's regulation. 
""This includes traffic rights, ownership and control, leasing of aircraft, cooperative marketing arrangements and fair competition,"" it said. 
It said it would also go further and allow member state airlines to operate wholly within the UK for the IATA summer season 2019, which ends on 27 October 2019, to maintain connections between regional bases. 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary had been vocal in warning that planes could be grounded if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. Rival easyJet (LON:EZJ) has established a new airline in Austria to protect its rights.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 06:48AM ET</span>",Deutsche Post plays down impact of trade tensions on its business,"By Emma Thomasson
BONN, Germany (Reuters) -  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) DHL Group on Thursday forecast profit growth for this year that lagged analysts' expectations, but played down concerns over global trade, saying more complex supply chains could in the near term benefit its business. 
In an industry seen as a bellwether for the global economy, U.S. rival FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) jolted investors in December with a steeper-than-expected cut in its 2019 profit forecast, warning of weakening freight demand as the global economy slows.
But Deutsche Post Chief Executive Frank Appel said he was not worried, saying the business had a broad base both geographically and operationally that made it resilient even if global economic growth weakened. 
""We have not seen any signs of a noticeable slowdown on the horizon,"" Appel said. ""The fundamental growth from globalization and digitalization will continue.""
FedEx executives said they had noted a sharp slowdown in Britain due to uncertainty over the country's departure from the European Union, Germany's economic contraction, protests in France and a cooling of the Asian economy.
Appel said however that disruptions to trade such as a possible ""hard"" Brexit could even benefit the company in the short term as supply chains became more complicated, although protectionist moves would be negative in the long term.
""Complexity is good for our business. We are very good at managing complex logistic streams,"" he told a news conference.
Deutsche Post DHL said last month it had hired hundreds of workers to deal with new customs procedures expected to be imposed when Britain leaves the EU.
The German postal and logistics group reported a 5.1 percent rise in fourth-quarter sales to 16.9 billion euros ($19.11 billion), versus analysts' forecast for 16.65 billion, while operating profit was in line at 1.1 billion euros.
Deutsche Post said operating profit should rise to between 3.9 billion euros and 4.3 billion euros in 2019, and confirmed its guidance for the metric to reach at least 5 billion by 2020.
The 2019 guidance compares to average analyst forecasts for 4.1 billion euros, according to Refinitiv data, but includes a 400 million-euro gain from the disposal of its China supply chain business.
""As a result, the midpoint of the underlying guidance range is 8 percent below consensus,"" wrote Jefferies analysts.
Shares in Deutsche Post, which have fallen by a quarter in the last year, had turned slightly positive by 1130 GMT after falling more than 1 percent in early trade. 
The group issued a profit warning for 2018 last June and started a restructuring program at its Post - eCommerce - Parcel (PeP) division, including an early retirement program, as well as splitting its post-and-parcel delivery division into a German and an international unit.

It could take several months until the measures had a positive impact on its figures, but they should help profitability for the year and longer term, Appel said.

The telecoms equipment maker claims a law limiting its U.S. business is unconstitutional and has filed a complaint in Texas.
It is the latest confrontation between Huawei and the U.S. government, which escalated again last Friday when Canada's government said it will start proceedings to extradite Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to the U.S. to answer charges of violating sanctions against Iran.

In economic data news, weekly jobless claims figures come out at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT). Investors are also waiting to find out if the European Central Bank will give the bloc fresh stimulus in the form of cheap loans. It's widely expected to slash its growth forecasts after a weak start to the year in Germany and Italy, in particular.

1572,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",Huawei’s Efforts to Derail U.S. Prosecutions Face Steep Odds,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co., China’s biggest smartphone maker, is using its financial and political clout to fight U.S. allegations that the company was involved in bank fraud, technology theft and spying.
The effort probably won’t work, American legal experts say.
“I don’t see the U.S. backing away from these cases,” said Peter Henning, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit.
Huawei has aggressively fought U.S. claims it can’t be trusted by business or government, allegations at the core of two indictments. The company has lobbied countries around the world to ignore American warnings against its products. On Wednesday, Huawei filed a lawsuit saying the U.S. broke the law by barring government agencies from using Huawei equipment in contracts. It’s based on an argument that the company has been singled out for punishment by Congress in violation of the U.S. Constitution without a fair chance to defend itself.
And given that all of this is playing out amidst prolonged negotiations between China and the U.S. to resolve a trade war, there’s intense speculation over how much the cases could be used as a bargaining chip for President Donald Trump.
Huawei’s Legal Battles
The company’s aggressive response to the criminal charges may reflect a desire to both circumvent the U.S. justice system and combat claims that threaten billions of dollars in sales outside of China, said Alexander Capri, a visiting senior fellow at the National University of Singapore Business School.
“Huawei is in a public relations blitzkrieg,” Capri said. “Spying allegations have done damage to the company’s image and, if a significant number of U.S. allies were to block or restrict Huawei’s access to either western tech or markets, the company would be in serious trouble.”
China has become addicted to western technology components, and Huawei can’t afford to get cut off from U.S. suppliers, especially as it seeks to build the world’s next generation of wireless modems, Capri said. Last year, the Trump administration banned Chinese company ZTE Corp (HK:0763). from purchasing critical U.S. technology for violating export sanctions against Iran and North Korea. ZTE eventually paid more than $1 billion in fines.
Bombshell Arrest
But the Huawei prosecutions aren’t likely to get sidetracked, U.S. legal experts say. That’s in part due to the high-profile way in which they’re been handled, with a bombshell arrest in Vancouver on Dec. 1 of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and daughter of the company’s founder, and a highly publicized press conference in Washington the following month when the indictments were unsealed.
In addition, the allegations at the heart of the two cases -- that Huawei stole trade secrets from an American company and that it violated U.S. sanctions on Iran -- are issues that the Trump administration has made top priorities. While prosecutors can always drop cases, it’s highly unlikely in this case -- even if it would help trade talks. A settlement on the other hand might be a more reasonable goal for Huawei.
What Bloomberg Opinion Says
The quest for justice is everyone’s right, yet Huawei risks coming off as belligerent instead of the calm and trustworthy partner it’s trying to portray. And the irony of appealing to Canada’s rule of law when no such option exists back home isn’t lost on the hordes of critics who were already wary of this new charm offensive.--Tim Culpan, columnistClick here to view piece.
“I guess Trump could order the Justice Dept to dismiss the indictment, but that would be unprecedented,” Henning said.
To be sure, Trump is an unusual president, and international trade professor Alan Sykes said the cases could be used as leverage in the negotiations.
“There’s many ways for prosecutors to pull back on what they’re seeking,” and U.S. attorneys are subject to the commands of the Attorney General, who works for the president, said Sykes, a professor at Stanford Law School. “There’s a question of whether that’s appropriate -- if it compromises the independence of the Justice Department. But it’s a logical possibility.”
The prosecutions also may not interfere with trade negotiations, like when the European Union imposed billions of dollars of fines on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or levied tax penalties on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Sykes said.
“Multinational companies have legal issues in foreign markets all the time,” he said. “It doesn’t mean the country that the company is based in and the country in which they’re operating can’t negotiate constructively.”
The U.S., citing security concerns, has urged allies to bar Huawei and other Chinese technology providers from building infrastructure for fifth-generation, or 5G, mobile cellular networks. China has dismissed the allegations against Huawei, saying U.S. actions are based on fear of facing a formidable industrial competitor.
In addition, it may be difficult for the U.S. to backpedal on the Huawei prosecutions after the Trump administration announced a get-tough initiative on China’s business practices. In November, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the crackdown was intended to counter what he saw as a looming threat of China’s economic espionage.
Trade Secrets
Among the enforcement actions being targeted were efforts by China to gain access to proprietary U.S. technology and trade secrets, through techniques such as computer hacking or theft by insiders. Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue, whose office is prosecuting Meng’s case, is on a list of the nation’s top prosecutors on the Justice Department’s Working Group for China.
And while Meng fights extradition from Canada -- she too has filed a retaliatory suit, claiming the Canadians violated her constitutional rights during her arrest -- the bank fraud and trade sanctions case that she’s named in is moving forward all the same. Huawei is due to be arraigned in Brooklyn federal court on March 14. Both Meng and her company have denied any wrongdoing.
Given Meng’s wealth and connections, she could drag out the extradition fight for years. But few have ever been successful in persuading a Canadian court not to extradite to the U.S., said Brad Simon, a former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, New York, who is now a partner at Phillips Nizer LLP.
So, for Meng, too, the most likely positive outcome would be for a relatively lenient plea deal, given that under federal law, the charges she faces in Brooklyn carry as much as 30 years in prison.

This provision, to be taken in the fourth quarter of 2018, will bring its total provisions to $611 million, or 2.29 billion shekels, Hapoalim said in a regulatory filing in Tel Aviv, noting it had held talks with U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) officials in recent weeks.
""It is reasonable to assume the total amounts which the bank will pay to settle with the American authorities, if achieved, will be significantly higher,"" Hapoalim said.
Hapoalim, which has suspended dividend payments due to the uncertainty caused by the investigation, said its last meeting with DOJ officials was held on March 5.
The shares were down 2.7 percent on Thursday. They fell 7.6 percent last year while the index of Israel's top five banks rose 4.8 percent.
""While today’s news is unfortunate, we see the shares as oversold on DOJ concerns and believe the market fails to account for Hapoalim's strong capital position, which should allow the bank to grow its risk-weighted assets while maintaining its dividend policy,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Tavy Rosner, adding the bank can weather litigation costs of up to $2.4 billion.
Rival Bank Leumi in 2014 agreed to pay $400 million to settle two separate investigations into whether it helped U.S. clients evade taxes.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares retreated further from five-month highs on Thursday before a European Central Bank meeting that is expected to slash growth forecasts and hint at a new round of ultra-cheap loans for euro zone banks. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.3 percent by 0937 GMT, while Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and London's FTSE 100 was down 0.4 percent. 
Euro zone banks fell 0.4 percent on profit taking after gains made in anticipation of the ECB scheme and as investors awaited for details on the loans that could prop up lending and help banks roll over a previous facility. 
""It seems all but certain that the ECB will need to relaunch these loans this year, although it may choose to hold fire at this meeting,"" said Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com.
UniCredit analysts said a formal announcement on the loans with technical details might only come in April.
Italian banks, which used the biggest share of the previous round of central bank loans, edged up but remained below the highs hit in the previous session. 
 Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) rose 0.3 percent after reports that the country's largest retail bank is in talks to sell about 10 billion euros in impaired loans, signaling more progress in Italian banks' effort to clean up their books.
The export-oriented auto sector, down 1.7 percent, continued to slide on worries over the sector's prospects amid slowing Chinese growth.
German carmakers Daimler and BMW fell 2.2 and 1.4 percent following a downgrade from Bankhaus Lampe to hold and sell respectively.
""Daimler is facing a much tougher market environment than in the past. Car sales seem to have peaked and global trade wars are adding additional uncertainty and risk to the sector,"" said Bankhaus Lampe analyst Christian Ludwig.
On BMW, which is due to release its annual report on March 20, he said: ""We believe the market will be disappointed by the outlook for 2019.""
Basic resources stocks were also under pressure, down 1.9 percent, as copper prices fell, while gains in defensive sectors like telecoms and utilities, which are favored in time of economic uncertainty, were not enough to offset broader market weakness. 
The STOXX 600 is up nearly 11 percent so far this year, having rebounded from a sharp sell-off at the end of 2018 but investors expect the potential for more gains this year is limited by political risks and slowing growth.
Elsewhere, earning drove the biggest share price moves.
A weak outlook sent shares in German publisher Axel Springer to the bottom of the STOXX, down 8 percent to a two-year low, while in-line results and a share buyback announcement sent brewer Royal Unibrew up 4.9 percent. 

Britain's Melrose rose 3.6 percent after the turnaround specialist's full-year profits rose, boosted by last year's hostile takeover of British engineer GKN (LON:GKN), beating analyst expectations.

1577,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 03:55AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Mario Draghi Doesn't Have All the Answers,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets have opened mostly lower Thursday on a day when the European Central Bank is widely expected to present the case for more monetary stimulus at the meeting of its policy-making governing council meeting.
Even bank stocks are finding it hard to get excited, although Spanish and Italian banks, which need the ECB’s safety net more than their French and German counterparts, have outperformed a little this week as the prospect of new, ultra-cheap long-term loans has come into focus.
There are reasons for the lack of enthusiasm: first, the overall market has risen 11% so far this year without much of a correction, so the air is getting a bit thin.
Second, it’s now clear that, for bank stocks, money-laundering issues matter as much to the investment case for some banks as the policy backdrop. Non-euro-zone  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa) is down after activist Bill Browder filed a criminal complaint against it, while ING (AS:INGA) is down another 1.4%, and is down nearly 7% this week. Raiffeisen Bank International (DE:RBIV), the Austrian bank that came off worst in the so-called Troika Laundromat disclosure dump, is doing a dead cat bounce, up 0.7% after shedding 15% over the previous three days.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is down 1.6% for a different reason, as reports that it has cut its bonus pool for 2018 cast more doubt over its ability to keep star performers in its underperforming investment bank.
Finally, there’s no getting away from the poor growth outlook. The ECB is likely to cut its GDP forecast for this year sharply from its last estimate of 1.7%. The OECD’s new forecast, released on Wednesday, is for only 1.0%. Bloomberg cited sources close to the ECB as saying Wednesday that the revisions will be sharp enough to justify a new round of long-term refinancing operations, or LTROs, but its sources shied away from saying that they would be announced today.
As always, there are individual bright spots out there: French advertising group JC Decaux (PA:JCDX) is up nearly 5% after stronger-than-expected earnings, but German media giant  Axel Springer  (DE:SPRGn) is down over 7% after forecasting a weak 2019, while most things with exposure to the China story are under pressure after Huawei  sued the U.S. over its exclusion from public-sector procurement tenders.
There are some things for which even Mario Draghi doesn't have the answers."

1583,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 12:40AM ET</span>",Korea Traders Can Thank Activism for Newfound Corporate Largesse,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korean companies, notorious for low dividends and cash hoards, are becoming more generous. Thank activists and changes in corporate governance for it.
Kospi index members have been boosting their shareholder returns and last year paid almost 23 percent of their net income in dividends, according to data available compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the most since 2007, with the payout yield rising to 2.2 percent. The increases came even as analysts see profits falling this year.
Activism has landed in South Korea in recent months -- Paul Singer just struck again -- and institutional investors including the National Pension Service have adopted a stewardship code giving directives on how to exercise shareholder rights. That’s why companies have been taking pre-emptive actions, increasing dividends ahead of annual general meetings starting next week, said Yoon Tae-Ho, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities.
“Companies that previously paid low dividends appear to feel a burden,” Yoon said. “The upcoming shareholder meetings will be an opportunity for investors to confirm the effect of the stewardship code.”
David Hurwitz of U.S. hedge fund SC Fundamental LLC says shareholders discovering they can get management to behave differently is the “biggest change” in attitudes that he’s seen.
“Shareholders, for years, viewed owning shares as a passive thing to do,” the fund manager said in a telephone interview from New York. His firm has invested in Korean equities for more than a decade. “People discovered they have a voice -- ‘We are an owner, we are not bond holders!’”
The New York-based hedge fund frequently demands changes to Korean companies with attractive valuations but poor capital allocations, Hurwitz said. While the requests aren’t always successful, liquor maker Muhak Co. accepted a proposal from SC Fundamental and other shareholders to maintain its dividend at 350 won a share despite a loss in 2018, according to Hurwitz and the company.
“Although it was a bit of a burden for the company due to a loss last year, we decided to accept it amid the rising public interest for shareholder returns,” said Ji Yong-Uk, a Muhak representative.
Even though large-sized companies are leading the recent change in dividend policies, investors may find further opportunities in small- or mid-cap firms, says Korea Investment & Securities’ Yoon. Most of those still have payout ratios of less than 15 percent despite stable earnings growth, he added.
Pressured by Singer’s Elliott Management Corp., Hyundai Motor Group and its subsidiaries have announced shareholder returns including buybacks and dividends. And for the first time, the company recently hosted a conference where executives actively communicated with investors, Kim Jin-Woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities, wrote in a note entitled “Now we can finally communicate with them.”
Some local fund managers have started mimicking Elliott. Platform Partners Asset Management Co., a Seoul-based fund, said it earned returns of between 10 percent to 30 percent last year by pushing Macquarie Group Ltd. to cut management fees. In February, family-controlled conglomerate Hanjin Group said it would strengthen management transparency and increase shareholder returns following calls from a homegrown activist, while the NPS is debating whether to also ask for changes.
Of course, shareholder proposals are not always successful, even for the NPS, the country’s largest pension with stakes of 10 percent or more in about 100 listed companies. Just last month, Namyang Dairy Products Co. refused to accept its call to pay higher dividends.
The mentality of boosting earnings and keeping them on the balance sheet has been “very destructive” to Korea, according to SC Fundamental’s Hurwitz. When a company goes public, it’s to let investors participate in its growth and get a piece of future profits, he said.
“Who’s going to invest in an IPO where, there really is: ‘We are just keeping the money and you’re never going to see anything?”’ Hurwitz said.

SYDNEY/TOKYO (Reuters) - The chances of recession have faded enough for emerging market investors to plow billions of dollars into Asian stock markets, but not enough to buy shares in the region's banks.
After a year-long sell-off, stocks in Asian banks are languishing at multi-year, crisis era lows, even though their lending business should benefit from the Federal Reserve and other central banks easing up on monetary tightening as they switch to a pro-growth stance.
Rising hopes that the United States and China will soon de-escalate their trade war has encouraged buying in other cyclical sectors, but few banks are making it onto investors' shopping lists.
Besides the reduced, but still abiding risk of a sharp economic slowdown, investors are deterred by onerous regulatory changes introduced for lenders since the last crisis.
""Valuations are cheap but they are cheap for a reason,"" said Olivia Mayell, London-based investment specialist of multi-asset solutions at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
""We're not currently confident enough to want to own banks, we'd look for more stable value, for recession-proof assets. Not to say recession is coming soon, but these things get priced into asset values well in advance of when they happen.""
Asian banks are cheap. Going by the broadest measure, MSCI's index for Asia ex-Japan banks trades at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 0.9, lower than it has been during financial crises in 1997, 2001 and in 2008.
The price-to-book (P/B) ratio, a popular metric for measuring valuation, compares stock price with underlying assets. A ratio below 1 could indicate either an undervalued stock or that investors have concerns about how well the stock is backed up by assets. The low banks' P/B is a red flag for investors. 
(Graphic: Asian banks' price-book ratio lags other sectors - https://tmsnrt.rs/2CaEC5c)
Some analysts, who think banks are a good buy, argue that banks' book values, which reflect net assets, may have been undermined by the past three years of rising interest rates and a broad reduction in corporate borrowing. But as policy interest rates are cut, book values will recover, they say.
Yet, there are more reasons to regard them as risky investments.
Banks would be prime losers if the United States slips into recession, dragging down global growth and demand. Even if Asian growth holds up, investors have for long struggled to evaluate the quality of banks' assets and quantum of bad loans.
New regulations are also being rolled out that potentially hamper bank profitability ranging from India's new bankruptcy code and requirements for capital to South Korea's plans for internet banks and capital-raising by traditional big banks.
""A lot of people still remember what happened during the financial crisis. That made banks really out of favor and that is reflected in the really trough valuations,"" said Jian Shi Cortesi, an Asian equities portfolio manager at GAM Investment Management in Zurich.
HOSTAGE TO POLICY
The idea that banks' fortunes are hostage to sometimes fickle government policy also scares investors.
""In many cases, one share in a bank equals one share in a country. Banks in emerging markets are a regulated business. They are often driven by what's happening in government policy,"" said Sean Taylor, chief investment officer for the Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank's asset manager DWS in Hong Kong.
Taylor cites China as an example where, despite easing policy, some banks have been squeezed in a scramble for funds. 
South Korean banks are also trading at lows last seen before the 2008/09 financial crisis, he said, because domestic regulations are limiting their ability to make money.
The other big risk is that, despite all efforts, the U.S. economy slips into recession, dragging global demand down.
Some analysts see more value in owning sectors like technology or healthcare, which are just as sensitive to growth and demand as banks, but are more resilient.
The extreme cheapness of banks could mean there is room for a rally in the next 6 months to a year, said GAM's Cortesi.
Still, she said: ""If you are investing in Asia growth, you probably don't want to be in banks.""
Consumer stocks, technology and real estate have all posted double digit growth in the past two months. Banks gained 5 percent, underperforming the broad Asian shares' 10 percent jump.
Even among banks, plenty of investors see value in India's better-capitalized private sector banks and Thai banks. Outliers include Indonesia's Bank Mandiri, which has risen 33 percent since 2015, outperforming the broader Jakarta index's near 25 percent gain. Singapore's DBS is up by a quarter in four years having defied a fall in Singapore markets.
In a sign of investor enthusiasm for Asian assets, global emerging market funds have registered net inflows of about $21 billion since the week of Nov. 7, with gains in 14 of the past 16 weeks, Nomura said in a report released on Feb. 26.
Yet, only six banks feature in Nomura's list of 52 'buy' rated stocks in Asia - India's SBI, ICICI and Axis, Indonesia's Bank Mandiri and Metropolitan Bank and BPI in the Philippines.

Asian tech giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent Holdings, insurance group Ping An, Hong Kong property firm China Overseas Land and Hong Kong's MTR are among Nomura's top 5 picks.

1586,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 10:30PM ET</span>","Huawei Sues U.S. Over Equipment Ban, Escalating Legal Clash","(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. sued the U.S. government for barring its equipment from certain networks, delivering a legal riposte to American accusations it aids China in espionage.
The lawsuit is aimed at a U.S. statute that blocks government agencies from using equipment from Huawei and its domestic rival ZTE Corp (HK:0763)., according to a complaint filed in federal court in Texas. Huawei argues in the suit that it’s unconstitutional to single out a person or a group for penalty without a fair trial.
The action signals a more aggressive response from the company toward its U.S. accusers, who have been trying to persuade other countries to ban Huawei gear from crucial fifth-generation communications networks. The complaint landed days after finance chief Meng Wanzhou sued Canada’s government for allegedly trampling her constitutional rights during her December arrest -- an effort to discredit the case against her as she awaits potential extradition to the U.S. for bank fraud.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.
In its U.S. case, Huawei is taking aim at a provision in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. That provision bars any executive agency, government contractor or company that receives a government loan or grant from using Huawei and ZTE equipment, according to the complaint. The Chinese company argues that the provision is a bill of attainder, a legislative punishment without trial that’s prohibited by the U.S. Constitution.
“That’s a very hard argument to win but certainly something that they can try in an effort to slow down the federal government,” Peter Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School, told Bloomberg on a podcast.
Legal experts give Huawei’s lawsuit little chance of success based on a recent, similar case filed by Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab Inc.
In September 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security directed agencies to stop using Kaspersky’s anti-virus software based on concerns the Russian government could use the programs to spy on federal information systems. President Trump signed the ban Dec. 12, 2017.
A Washington DC-based appeals court agreed late last year with a lower court’s rejection of Kaspersky’s argument that the prohibition amounted to an unconstitutional bill of attainder because it addressed a national security vulnerability.
Huawei is increasingly in the crosshairs of the U.S. government and its allies, just as it’s pushing for leadership in supplying fifth-generation wireless technology. Countries are preparing to spend billions on the potentially revolutionary equipment aimed at enabling everything from smart highways to self-driving cars. The world’s top provider of networking gear faces the prospect of being shut out of pivotal infrastructure markets. And the clash has complicated negotiations between Washington and Beijing as they try to hammer out a trade deal.
Huawei also repeated its argument that a blockade on its gear simply disadvantages Americans.
“Consumers in the United States (particularly in rural and poor areas) will be deprived of access to the most advanced technologies, and will face higher prices and a significantly less competitive market,” the company said in the complaint.
Washington-based law firm Jones Day is representing Huawei in the lawsuit.
U.S. officials and industry executives have long harbored questions about Huawei’s ties to China’s government, and concerns about its technology have mounted in lockstep with its growing success. Federal authorities in Seattle are investigating the company for allegedly stealing trade secrets from U.S. partner T-Mobile US Inc., and in December Meng was arrested in Canada on fraud charges linked to Iran trade-sanction violations.
“This is one part of a much broader effort here to confront China over trade secrets theft and how the Chinese government is subsidizing companies and trying to get their products into the United States,” Henning said.
The case is Huawei Technologies v. U.S., 4:19-cv-00159, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Sherman).

But according to the complaint, Sears breached the license agreement by launching its new tool line and touting its stores as ""the real home of the broadest assortment of Craftsman.""
Stanley said the tagline falsely implies that other Craftsman products are ""somehow illegitimate.""
It also said Sears' actions threaten to confuse shoppers and irreparably harm Stanley's own Craftsman brand and trademarks, as well as its goodwill and customer relationships.
Sears emerged from Chapter 11 in February after longtime Chairman Edward Lampert, who oversaw its years-long descent into bankruptcy, won court approval for a $5.2 billion takeover, which included the Craftsman licensing rights.
The reorganized company was expected to have about 425 Sears and Kmart stores, down from roughly 3,500 when those companies merged in 2005. Sears brands also include DieHard and Kenmore.

The case is Stanley Black & Decker Inc v Transform Holdco LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-02081.

1588,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 09:55PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Kick off with Losses, Awaiting Sino-U.S. Trade Deal","Investing.com – Most Asian shares slid on Thursday morning as global economic growth concerns deepened and investors awaited news of final results of Sino-U.S. trade talks.
The Shanghai Composite Index hit 3107.30, up 0.14%, by 9:30 AM ET (2:30 AM GMT), while the Shenzhen Component dipped 0.43% to 9658.39.
Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for U.S. negotiators to close a Sino-U.S. trade deal soon,
U.S. markets started the year with a strong rally fuelled by hopes of a trade deal between the world’s two biggest economies. Bloomberg quoted sources that said Trump had noticed the market gains following progress in the talks and is concerned that the lack of an agreement will send stocks down.
""For some time, markets had been pricing in good news, namely that the talks between the U.S. and China will likely go well,"" said Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset Management, according to Reuters. ""Now markets are having a pause.""
In China, the ongoing meeting of the National People’s Congress continues to attract attention. Policymakers have already lowered the target for economic growth in the country for this year to between 6% and 6.5%, providing a target “band” rather than the more specific goal of around 6.5% last year. Regulators also announced cuts to the value added tax (VAT), including a 3% to the top bracket, in a move that could help support manufacturing.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was down 0.23% at mid-morning to 28,969. Hong Kong stocks kicked off Thursday with marginal losses as global growth concerns continue to grow.
The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OEPC) cut forecasts again for the global economy in 2019 and 2020, which contributed to broader concerns over the slowing economic growth.
""Chinese macroeconomic data remains weak at the moment but I expect them to improve by the middle of the year,"" said Maeno in comments quoted by Reuters.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.67% to 21,452 and the KOSPI in Korea was trading down 0.45% to 2,174.63.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares rose marginally in early trade on Thursday, with caution prevailing as investors awaited some kind of resolution to Sino-U.S. trade negotiations, while the euro remained under pressure ahead of the European Central Bank meeting.
Japan's Nikkei average fell 0.6 percent, while Australian shares added 0.2 percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.1 percent in early trade. It was not far from its five-month high marked last week and was up 10.4 percent year-to-date.
Overnight, Wall Street's main indexes fell for a third session, with the S&P 500 posting its biggest one-day decline in a month, as investors sought reasons to buy after the market's strong rally to start the year.
""For some time, markets had been pricing in good news, namely that the talks between the U.S. and China will likely go well,"" said Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset Management. ""Now markets are having a pause.""
Adding to concerns about the talks was data that showed the U.S. goods trade deficit surged to a record high in 2018 as strong domestic demand fueled pulled in imports, despite the Trump administration's ""America First"" policies aimed at shrinking the gap.
Other U.S. data on Wednesday suggested some slowing in the labor market, though the pace of job gains remains more than enough to drive the unemployment rate down.
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 183,000 in February after surging 300,000 in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 189,000 in February.
The government's more comprehensive employment report for February is scheduled for release on Friday.
Also weighing on investor sentiment were broader concerns about growth after the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development cut forecasts again for the global economy in 2019 and 2020.
""Chinese macroeconomic data remains weak at the moment but I expect them to improve by the middle of the year,"" said Okasan's Maeno.
Investors are now look ahead to the ECB's board meeting later on Thursday. The central bank is expected to slash growth forecasts and give its strongest signal yet that fresh stimulus is coming in the form of more cheap loans.
In the currency market, the euro traded at $1.1312, hovering near a two-week low on expectations that the ECB could suggest offering cheap long-term loans for banks.
The loans, known more formally as Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs), are expected to boost troubled euro zone lenders.
The dollar eased 0.1 percent to 111.62 yen, moving further away from Tuesday's 2-1/2-month peak of 112.135, while the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six of its peers, barely moved.
The Canadian and Australian dollar sank to two-month lows on Wednesday as traders scaled back holdings on expectations policy-makers would leave interest rates alone in the foreseeable future or even lower them to counter their softening economies.
Adding to the Aussie's woes on Thursday was data showing local retailers suffered another bleak month in January, in a sign overall economic momentum was slowing.
U.S. oil prices were lower and Brent prices edged up after data from the Energy Information Administration showed an unexpectedly sharp build in U.S. crude inventories, but a third weekly drawdown in gasoline stocks kept losses at bay.

U.S. crude futures stood at $56.11 per barrel, down 0.2 percent, in early Asian trade. They hit a 3-1/2-month high of $57.88 on Friday.

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 07:20PM ET</span>","Undercover Down Under: Miners study gum leaves, groundwater for new finds","By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian mining magnate Lang Hancock famously discovered the world's biggest iron ore deposit when he noticed the red-stained cliffs of a canyon while flying over the Outback in the 1950s.
Now, the days when massive mineral deposits could be simply spotted by plane are gone, so miners are adopting new lab techniques and machine-led mapping to detect metal traces in everything from sand to gum tree leaves and groundwater.
Australian miners are taking a deeper look at the 80 percent of the country that lies ""under cover"" - obscured by meters of sediment and sand, particularly in the desert interior, across an area twice the size of India. 
They are using a mix of new techniques and established methods in new ways, backed by greater computing heft, including a new generation of multi-layered maps produced by Australian government agencies. 
""There has been a perception that Australia is a mature destination and all the big finds have been found,"" said Will Robinson, managing director at Encounter Resources, which is exploring for gold using a new type of soil sampling developed by the CSIRO, Australia's peak science body.
""You’re seeing more success as companies go out there and supply new technologies and new thinking into areas to find new big deposits,"" he said. ""It has reset the maturity clock.""
Having repaired their balance sheets on the back of a commodities price recovery, miners large and small are rushing to peg out prospective land in undercover areas. 
 Anglo American  (LON:AAL) told Reuters it has recently been granted or is seeking permits over almost 11,000 square km of land in Queensland state, while iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group raised its exploration tenements by a third last year.
 Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) also sharply increased its exploration holdings under the remote Great Sandy Desert, where it announced a large copper find last week.
Encounter Resources last month reported a gold find under shallow sand using CSIRO's Ultrafine Soil technique, sending the explorer's shares up 30 percent.
""These ancient landscapes have buried deposits,"" said Ryan Noble, a CSIRO scientist leading the development of the process. 
The analysis relies on separating out large particles of sand, which in remote Australia can account for as much as 95 percent of a sample, from much smaller clays and iron oxides, which attract gold, copper and zinc. 
Developments in analysis mean smaller particles of 2 microns can now be detected, about one-50th the size of a grain of salt, revealing signs of mineralization as deep as 10-20 meters (30-65 feet) under soil or sand.
""We think there is huge value for Australia and other places to reprocess the samples they have collected and generate new targets and open up new areas,"" CSIRO's Noble said. 
Other new techniques are also starting to show results.
In South Australia, ASX-listed Marmota is using a biogeochemical leaf analysis which helped guide it to a high-grade gold strike at its Gawler Craton project in September.
Gum trees siphon up minute traces of gold from their roots to their leaves, which are then analyzed in a lab. 
""The gums were able to pick up moderate mineralization down to about 60 meters (200 feet),"" geologist Aaron Brown told Reuters. 
The technology was developed during the boom years of 2012-2013 but has taken time to be used commercially as miners and investors look to reinvest in exploration after several lean years.
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
Australian government bodies are also getting on board.
The Australian government is part way through a four-year, A$100 million ($70.75 million) exploration program under the oversight of GeoScience Australia. It includes projects to collate soil geochemistry data with groundwater data sets into predictive maps for highly prospective mineral regions.
Geoscience Australia is also working with other international bodies such as the Geological Survey of India to help uncover hidden deposits on the subcontinent, underscoring the competition among global mining zones to attract capital in the new wave of exploration. 
""The release of excellent pre-competitive geoscientific data by Geosciences Australia and the Geological Survey of Queensland has enabled us to evaluate previously under-explored parts of Australia, including undercover areas of interest,"" Anglo American told Reuters.
Meanwhile,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), which launched a resources platform developed in Canada that uses machine learning to better predict where mineralization lies, is drawing interest from Australian miners. 
IBM's Watson for the natural resources industry uses artificial intelligence to combine data such as government drill results and aeromagnetic surveys with historical visual data including hand drawn maps in a way that has not been done before.
Geologists can ask technically specific questions of Watson about a resource and get an answer back.
“Traditionally geologists would spend 80 percent of their time sorting through data, trying to find it, correlate it, then organize it, and then running their models,"" IBM partner David Dickson told Reuters. 
""Now it’s flipped and 20 percent of the time is spent doing that, and geologists can spend more time on getting insights from the information and making better decisions on where the prospective regions are.” 
Australia has a long tradition in mining and a significant potential of still unexplored reserves, he said. 
""Gold for example, generally is very low-grade so you can spend a lot of money on exploration. The more we remove the uncertainty and variability from the exploration program, the more viable the program is.""

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",Air Lease says Boeing signaling 'full speed ahead' for midsized jet,"By Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is indicating ""full speed ahead"" for a new midsized airplane in what would be the first all-new jet program for the world's biggest planemaker in more than a decade, Air Lease Corp's chief executive, John Plueger, said on Wednesday.
Boeing reiterated on Wednesday that it will make a decision in 2020 on whether to launch the plane, which aims to address the middle of the jet market between traditional narrowbody jets with one aisle and long-distance widebody planes. It can start seeking offers in 2019, subject to launch.
""Boeing is signaling full speed ahead but there's still a lot to be decided in these programs,"" Plueger said at a conference, noting the company had met with Boeing in Seattle on Friday. 
In an emailed statement, Boeing said it is still working through the business case for the new jet, adding: ""If we decide to offer the airplane and the market responds positively, we will proceed with a launch decision sometime in 2020.""
Air Lease, one of the largest aircraft lessors, said it sees interest in Boeing's proposed mid-market aircraft from airlines, some of which are looking for longer range while others, such as Asian carriers, seek the lowest possible cost per seat kilometer.
Still, Boeing is taking a ""thoughtful approach"" to the potential project following a series of cost overruns and delays with its last jet program, the 787, and has yet to discuss possible pricing, Air Lease Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy said.
Air Lease will meet on Saturday with Airbus SE, which is preparing to counter the potential new jet by Boeing with a new version of its A321 and the larger A330neo.
While Boeing and Airbus have traditionally launched new jets alongside purchase commitments from airlines, interest by aircraft lessors like Air Lease is forming an increasingly important role in the decision-making process, industry sources have said.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Monday that it is interested in a mid-market aircraft from Boeing to replace 200 757 and 767 aircraft over the next decade.
Last month, Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) dropped out of the race to power Boeing's planned jet, strengthening a leading position in the high-profile contest for a transatlantic venture involving  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).
""Somebody had to drop out and the competition at this point is progressing normally,"" Plueger said.

Pratt & Whitney is also a potential supplier for the new Boeing jet.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies is set to announce a lawsuit on Thursday against the United States, ratcheting up its response to a campaign aimed at closing it out of Western markets for fear its telecoms equipment could be used by Beijing for spying.
The privately owned firm has embarked on a public relations and legal offensive over the past two months as Washington lobbies allies to abandon Huawei when building fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, centering on a 2017 Chinese law requiring companies cooperate with national intelligence work.
Founder and Chief Executive Ren Zhengfei has said Huawei, the world's biggest telecoms gear maker, has never and will never share data with China's government.
Close to 10 senior Reuters journalists have been approached recently by Huawei recruiters for public relations director roles, with some offered annual pay packages of $200,000. Such appointments would beef up its international media team just as it restructures a 300-strong corporate affairs department.
In response to a Reuters query, Joe Kelly, vice president of communications, said Huawei was hiring but not more than usual, to fill positions where people had been assigned overseas. He did not verify salaries, which were advertised by headhunters.
RETRIBUTION
The planned legal action and public relations outreach compare with a more restrained response in December emphasizing ""trust in justice"" when its chief financial officer, Sabrina Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Vancouver at U.S. request.
The United States has accused Meng - Ren's daughter - of bank and wire fraud related to breaches of trade sanctions against Iran.
Huawei's legal action, first reported by the New York Times on Monday, comes after news that Meng was suing Canada's government for procedural wrongs in her arrest.
Days earlier, Canada authorized a hearing for an extradition request, quashing Chinese hopes of a rejection on grounds that Meng's arrest was politically motivated.
The case had strained relations with China, which this week accused two arrested Canadians of stealing state secrets in a move widely seen as retribution for Meng's arrest.
While Meng is under house arrest in Vancouver, it is unclear where the two Canadians are being detained in China. Sources previously told Reuters that at least one of the Canadians did not have access to legal representation.
CHANGE OF TUNE
Ren met international media for the first time in several years in mid-January, calling U.S. President Donald Trump ""great"" and refraining from commenting directly on Meng's case.
Shifting tone, Ren in mid-February said Meng's arrest was politically motivated and ""not acceptable"".
A week later at the Mobile World Congress, where Huawei unveiled the world's most expensive foldable phone, Rotating Chairman Guo Ping opened his speech with a jab at the United States.
""PRISM, PRISM, on the wall, who is the most trustworthy of them all,"" he said, referring to the U.S. National Security Agency's internet surveillance program PRISM, which collected data from major internet companies.
Guo later said the United States wanted to thwart Huawei's rise as it ""hampers U.S. efforts to spy on whomever it wants"".
A senior member of Huawei's public relations team told Reuters the firm was taking a more proactive approach to U.S. attacks. It launched facts.huawei.com and invited media to tour its Shenzhen headquarters.

""We've had enough,"" the staffer said.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 05:55PM ET</span>",GE explores stake sale in Enel renewables joint venture: sources,"By David French
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co is exploring a sale of its 50 percent stake in a renewable energy joint venture with Italy's  Enel  (MI:ENEI) SpA, the latest deal GE CEO Lawrence Culp is pursuing to pay down debt, according to people familiar with the matter.
Culp has made a new push to shed assets since taking over as CEO in October, culminating in a $21.4 billion deal last month to sell GE's biopharma business to Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR).
The joint venture, called EGPNA Renewable Energy Partners, was formed in late 2016 between Enel's U.S.-based renewables subsidiary, Enel Green Power North America (EGPNA) and GE Energy Financial Services. It could be valued at more than $1 billion, excluding debt, according to the sources.
GE has hired an investment bank to assist it in selling its stake, the sources said. Among the joint venture's assets are the Cimarron Bend wind farm in Kansas and the Lindahl wind farm in North Dakota.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is confidential. A spokeswoman for GE Energy Financial Services declined to comment. Enel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
GE Energy Financial Services has been selling down its portfolio under a plan to reduce those holdings to about $5 billion by the end of 2019 from $10 billion in 2017. GE sold pieces last year to Starwood Property Trust Inc and Apollo Global Management.
The Boston-based conglomerate slashed its dividend last year as it took massive asset writedowns and huge insurance charges. Its debt stood at $121 billion at the end of December.
Renewable energy assets and stakes in firms operating them have been in high demand from buyout firms and infrastructure funds, given the steady yields they generate at a time when global interest rates remain near historical lows.
While the sale effort is focused on GE's stake, Enel could also offload part of its holding, the sources added.

Any partial divestment by Enel would be dependent on the utility retaining operational control over the assets in the portfolio, one of the sources said.

Culp said Tuesday free cash flow from the company's industrial segment is likely to remain negative this year amid ongoing struggles in its power business.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that trade talks with China were moving along well and predicted either a ""good deal"" or no deal between the world's two largest economies.
Washington and Beijing have been locked in intense negotiations to end a months-long trade war. Trump, citing progress in talks, last week delayed a planned tariff increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
""They're moving along well and we'll see what happens,"" the president said on Wednesday during a meeting in the Oval Office, referring to the trade talks. He said there would either be ""a good deal or it's not going to be a deal, but I think they're moving along very nicely.""
Trump's comments after the Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the U.S. goods trade deficit surged to a record high in 2018 as strong domestic demand fueled by lower taxes pulled in imports, despite the president's tariffs and ""America First"" policies aimed at shrinking the trade gap.
Talks are primarily taking place via video teleconference and going well, Ted McKinney, undersecretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, told a press call. 
""Right now, I think there's just a lot of work in getting words down ... a contract or agreement, and that’s the current status,"" he added.
The United States has demanded that China make substantial changes to its laws and practices to protect U.S. intellectual property, end forced transfers of U.S. technology to Chinese firms, curb generous industrial subsidies and open the domestic market to U.S. companies.
In addition, Washington has sought increased Chinese purchases of U.S. goods, including farm and energy commodities and manufactured products, to reduce a U.S. trade deficit with China that it estimates at more than $417 billion for 2018.
People familiar with the talks told Reuters the two sides still had substantial work ahead to reach agreement on a way to ensure China follows through on any pledges. Talks could still collapse if a deal cannot be reached on enforcement of these ""structural"" issues.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 04:45PM ET</span>",Trump rose on Forbes richest list as other billionaires slipped,"By Dan Fastenberg
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's personal fortune held steady over the past year, but he vaulted higher on the Forbes list of the richest people in the world as dozens of his fellow tycoons suffered financial setbacks. 
Trump's $3.1 billion net worth is unchanged from last year, Forbes said. Still, his real estate holdings held their value better than assets that make up the portfolios of a lot of other billionaires, boosting him 51 spots to 715th among the world's 2,153 billionaires, said Luisa Kroll, Forbes Magazine assistant managing editor.
""He moves up because so many billionaires dropped in the ranks,"" Kroll told Reuters on Wednesday. ""He kind of stayed flat but was able to increase his position.""
Making the biggest splash on this year's list was Kylie Jenner, 21, who became youngest self-made billionaire of all time thanks to the success of the cosmetics company she founded three years ago. The half-sister of reality television stars Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian, Jenner made her debut on the list this year after spinning $250,000 she earned from modeling into a fortune.
""She definitely was able to leverage her family's fame,"" Kroll said. ""She started making makeup and sold it through her Instagram account and online. And sales took off.""
Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), held his No. 1 spot on the list, with a net worth of $131 billion. But it may be his last time on top, now that he and his wife MacKenzie Bezos are divorcing. She was an early accountant at Amazon and may be entitled by Washington state law to half his stake in the company, Kroll said.
""If that happens he would not be Number One and she would be the world's richest woman,"" Kroll said.
The 2019 list shrank in both the number of billionaires and value. In 2018, there were 2,208 billionaires, or 55 more than this year, with a combined net worth of $9.1 trillion, compared with $8.7 trillion in 2019. 
At the same time, the very rich face a growing anger from the general public, Kroll said.

""We are in a bad moment for the very rich,"" Kroll said. ""You see a vehemence against these people because of the wealth inequity that we see in the world. Nobody's immune from market forces and markets being shaken up, and that's impacting even the ultra-rich.""

1601,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>",Wall Street Gets Relief From Tough Aspect of Fed's Stress Tests,"(Bloomberg) -- One of Wall Street’s biggest annual fears is poised to disappear after the Federal Reserve said Wednesday it plans to ease what was one of the most burdensome aspects of its stress tests.
For the largest U.S. lenders, the so-called qualitative portion of the exams will no longer be a factor in whether they pass or fail, the Fed said in a Wednesday statement. But some foreign banks that have had trouble clearing the hurdle -- such as  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) -- will still face the measure.
The qualitative part of the tests measures each firm’s ability to manage capital in a crisis. Large U.S. banks will still be required to pass the quantitative elements of the exams, which evaluate their ability to maintain minimum levels of capital under hypothetical stress scenarios. The latest scenarios, released by the Fed last month, contemplated the deepest recession yet.
The regulator had been moving since the Obama administration to downplay the qualitative portion of the stress tests, and it had already released mid-sized institutions. Such efforts have accelerated since President Donald Trump took office.
The Fed said foreign banks, including  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, Toronto-Dominion Bank and UBS Group AG, will have to pass the tests four times before they’re no longer subject to the qualitative portion. Fed Governor Lael Brainard dissented from the regulator’s decision on reducing the significance of the qualitative aspect."

One of the nation’s top funds says the poll will boost stocks despite the tension.
The new government is likely to implement investment-friendly policies that bolster the economy, said Dennis Lim, the president of MFC Asset Management Pcl, which oversees about $15 billion of assets. That should spur equities providing the next administration is stable, he said.
""Whoever comes to power, they will get a nice honeymoon period,"" Lim said in an interview Tuesday in Bangkok, adding he expects ""a lot of good news to be dribbled into the market"" in the six to nine months after the vote.
Thailand’s benchmark SET Index rose an average of 6.6 percent in the month after four major polls dating back to 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. So far this year, the index has climbed about 4 percent, trailing a 9 percent advance in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.
The Constitutional Court’s ruling on whether to dissolve the Thai Raksa Chart party, which is linked to exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, is due at 3 p.m. in Bangkok on Thursday. The Election Commission called for its break up over a failed bid to install a Thai princess as its candidate for prime minister.
Thaksin or his allies have won every election since 2001, only to be unseated by the courts or the military. Parties linked to him have been dissolved in the past, leading to deadly street protests.
This time around the dissolution may have a limited impact on Thai equities, as most investors have already factored it in, according to Lim. Consumer spending and tourism will remain the major drivers for Thai economic growth, he said."

Haven will be tasked with improving healthcare for the three companies' 1.2 million employees and family members in the United States, but will also share its findings with outsiders, according to its website, launched on Wednesday.
Haven did not say when the changes would be in place for employees.
The three companies announced plans for a new venture in January of 2018, shaking the shares of health insurance companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) that manage large corporate benefits on worries that Amazon would disrupt the traditional insurance and drug benefit businesses.
Haven Chief Executive Atul Gawande, who has been running the company since July, said in a news release that the company plans to start small and expand.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 04:11PM ET</span>",U.S. extends time for divestment from sanctioned Russian company GAZ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Wednesday it was extending by four months the deadline for investors to divest from Russian automaker GAZ, a company linked to Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska that Washington sanctioned over Russia's ""malign activity.""
The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a statement that it would allow investors and businesses until July 6 to cut ties with GAZ. The previous deadline was March 7.
The extension gives Deripaska more time to lower his stake in GAZ, potentially allowing the company to be removed from the U.S. sanctions list.
GAZ’s spokeswoman declined to comment.
On Jan. 27, the Treasury lifted sanctions on Deripaska's aluminum and energy businesses Rusal, its parent En+ and EuroSibEnergo after they had agreed to restructure to reduce his stakes.
The Treasury had imposed sanctions in April on 24 Russian allies of President Vladimir Putin, including Deripaska, as well as Rusal, En+, GAZ and other companies in which he owns major stakes. Treasury cited Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other ""malign activity.""
Deripaska had ties with Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign manager. Manafort has been a target of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and is due to be sentenced in two separate cases on Thursday and March 13. Russia denies any meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
When the Treasury announced the sanctions in April 2018, it also said ""Deripaska has been investigated for money laundering, and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering."" 
After lobbying by European governments, Washington postponed enforcement of the sanctions and started talks with Deripaska's team on removing Rusal and En+ from the blacklist if he ceded control of Rusal.
GAZ is Russia's largest producer of light commercial vehicles (LCV) and exports vehicles to more than 25 countries.
It has a contract manufacturing relationship with Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) on LCV production in Russia, and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG uses GAZ facilities to produce some passenger car models in Russia.
VW was viewed as a possible buyer of Deripaska's stake in GAZ, but a company official was quoted on Wednesday as saying talks on a deal had been suspended because of the U.S. sanctions.

""At the moment this (a deal to buy a stake in GAZ) is not possible for us because of sanctions ... Talks are suspended,"" RIA news agency quoted Marcus Osegowitsch, Volkswagen's Russia head, as saying.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The lawyer for Huawei Technologies' Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou told a Canadian court on Wednesday that he has concerns allegations against her have a political character and raised U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on the case.
Meng appeared in a British Columbia court for a scheduled hearing, during which her lawyer Richard Peck raised the issue and referenced ""comments by the U.S. President"" without going into detail.
Canada arrested Meng in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. prosecutors, who have charged Meng and China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, portraying the company as a threat to U.S. national security and that it conspired to violate U.S. sanctions. Both deny the allegations.
Trump said in December that he would possibly intervene in the criminal trial if it could help him to secure a trade deal with China.
Legal experts and Canadian officials have previously said the comments could allow Meng's lawyers to contend her prosecution is politically motivated, an argument that would resonate in Canada where judges are particularly wary of abuse of the court system.
Last week, Meng's lawyers also said they were suing the Canadian government, its border agency and federal police, with allegations she was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights.
""There are issues arising out of the treatment of Ms. Meng upon her arrival at the Vancouver International Airport and her detention and subsequent arrest,"" lawyer Peck said on Wednesday.
The Canadian government approved extradition proceedings against Meng on March 1. With appeals, it may be months or years before a judge could issue an order effectively recommending extradition to the United States.
The British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Heather J. Holmes set Meng's next court date for May 8. Peck said her team plans to discuss with prosecutors what applications will be brought before that appearance.
Canada's minister of justice would have to make a final decision on whether to send Meng to the United States.
Relations between Canada and China have deteriorated sharply since Meng's arrest. China has arrested two Canadians on national security grounds and sentenced another to death.

China has canceled Canadian agribusiness Richardson International Ltd's registration to ship canola to China, in the latest sign of tensions between Ottawa and Beijing.

1607,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 03:40PM ET</span>",Volcker 2.0 to Face Do-Over After Wall Street Complaints,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. regulators are poised to scrap their proposal for revising Volcker Rule restrictions on banks’ trading in favor of a newer version as they respond to a misstep that drew fire from Wall Street lobbyists, according to people familiar with the effort.
The Federal Reserve and other financial regulators are working on changes to their Volcker 2.0 plan that will likely require the agencies to re-propose the rule, said two people who requested anonymity because the process isn’t yet public. No final decision has been made to abandon the earlier proposal, the people said.
In writing last year’s proposal, the agencies inserted a new standard for transactions that they’d consider banned as proprietary trading. That measure drew vigorous criticism from bankers, who said it would make the often-criticized rule even more burdensome than the existing version. It isn’t clear what would replace the accounting standard that drew the criticism.
Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said no decision has yet been made on re-proposing Volcker, and Eric Kollig, a Fed spokesman declined to comment. Spokesmen for the other agencies responsible for the rule didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The revision would require approval by five separate agencies -- including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Simplifying the rule was a big priority for the group of agency chiefs installed by President Donald Trump, and they moved relatively quickly to get out the initial revision in May.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers last week that he’s heard the industry’s worries about the proposed new standard and also that the current restrictions unnecessarily hamper their investments in certain funds. He said the Fed is “looking carefully” at ways to address the complaints. But Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting was more pointed in January, when he said, “I think we have to step back and think through that again,” and that the agencies may have “overshot.”

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 03:32PM ET</span>","Airline bosses, asked to trade places, reveal tensions of the industry","By Alistair Smout
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Airline chiefs from the top five operators in Europe on Wednesday were asked a simple question: If they could trade places with one of their rivals for a week, who would they choose?
Their answers were light-hearted, provocative, and revealing about the state of the airline industry in Europe.
The panel of the bosses of IAG (LON:ICAG), easyJet (LON:EZJ), Lufthansa, Ryanair and KLM were asked the question while they were sitting alongside each other at an Airlines for Europe (A4E) summit.
Although they joined forces to create A4E as a lobbying group to pressurize the European Commission on aviation policy, the stark contrasts between its members was apparent during the day-long event in Brussels.
The bosses of KLM and Lufthansa traded barbs with Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, chief of the pioneering low-cost carrier which has shaken up the market with its cheap fares and given traditional flag-carriers a headache.
""I would take Ryanair, and I would show customers that they can really have an enjoyable journey if they paid (a bit more),"" KLM's Pieter Elbers said in answer to the question.
O'Leary said Elbers' answer had made him change his mind, and he used the opportunity to poke fun at Elbers, who had resisted answering questions about the Dutch government's stake in Air France-KLM for much of the day.
""I was going to say Lufthansa, so I could feel what it's like to own Germany and Austria,"" he said, ""I've changed at the last minute Pieter, so I could encourage the Dutch government to buy more of the shares.""
IAG boss Willie Walsh also chose KLM, and stirred the pot by introducing an M&A aspect to the session.
""I would pick KLM and I would spend that time convincing them that the should be part of IAG,"" Walsh said. 
Lufthansa chief Carsten Spohr said he would run IAG-owned British Airways, as he was ""jealous"" of London as a home hub.
EasyJet's Johan Lundgren noted that none of his peers had chosen easyJet, meaning he must be doing a good job.
""It's a massive compliment,"" he said.
Despite the tensions between the airlines, all have ultimately been able to thus far navigate the treacherous European airline market, which has seen the likes of Alitalia, Air Berlin and Monarch need rescues or go bust.
And one thing they were able to agree on Wednesday was that more weaker airlines would fail in the coming year. Even if they might not agree on everything, the A4E airline bosses could end up needing to deal with each other for a while longer.
""Five major airline groups in the next five years will control 80 percent of the traffic across Europe,"" O'Leary said.

""It's moving... that way, and I think that will be good for Europe.""

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said the last Chevrolet Cruze rolled off the assembly line Wednesday afternoon at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant, the first of five plants in North America to end production this year and ending U.S. production of the Cruze.
Workers posted photos of the final Cruze making its way down the assembly line on social media. It came off the line around 3 p.m., a GM spokesman said.
The Cruze ""was a good product and was built with tremendous pride by the Lordstown employees. We know this is an emotional day for our Lordstown team,"" GM said in a statement.
The Lordstown plant is being idled, resulting in the loss of 1,500 jobs. Since 2017, GM cut two of the three production shifts, eliminating 3,000 jobs amid sagging demand for small cars. GM is continuing to produce the Cruze in Mexico for other markets, but not for the United States.
GM noted that over 400 Lordstown employees have accepted offers at other GM locations, and it reiterated that jobs are available at other assembly plants for anyone willing to relocate to other states.
The United Auto Workers union, which has filed suit challenging GM's decision to end Cruze production at Lordstown, said it ""will leave no stone unturned in keeping the Lordstown plant open.""
GM's chief executive, Mary Barra, has said the final fate of the plant and whether it will reopen will be decided this summer in contract talks with the UAW.
The 6.3-million-square foot Lordstown assembly complex has manufactured more than 16 million vehicles since it opened in 1966, including nearly 2 million Chevrolet Cruze cars since 2010.
In November, GM announced it would idle five North American plants, including Lordstown, and cut up to 15,000 jobs.
GM also disclosed on Tuesday in a notice to the state of Ohio it would cut 101 jobs at the West Chester, Ohio, service and parts warehouse and operations facility that is closing.
The automaker told employees of the plans in June 2018 to close the facility and shift the work to a new warehouse in Burton, Michigan. Ohio workers can move to Michigan if they choose, GM said.
Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio called Wednesday ""a heartbreaking day. ... These workers are the heart and soul of GM.""
Separately, the UAW and the Communication Workers of America union sent a letter this week to the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee asking it to investigate significant corporate tax cuts received by GM and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) even as they cut thousands of union jobs.
The letter said there is ""no evidence to date that the corporate tax cuts have encouraged GM to bring back any production from Mexico to the U.S.""
GM and AT&T did not immediately comment on the letter.

Investing.com - Yes, Amazon.com apparently wants to start a supermarket chain. No, it isn't going to put  Kroger Co ., one of the largest supermarket chains, out of business.
A Wall Street Journal report that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was looking to start a new brand of supermarkets in some of the largest markets sent Kroger (NYSE:KR) shares down nearly 4.5% on Friday. The shares still haven't recovered.
Kroger is set to report earnings before U.S. markets open Thursday. Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the company to report earnings of 52 cents a share in the fiscal fourth quarter, down from 63 cents a year ago with revenue of $28.5 billion, down 8.3%. The stock is up slightly in 2019 and was flat in 2018 after a 5% hit in the fourth quarter.
But Amazon isn't Kroger's biggest problem -- yet. A huge problem, which has contributed to Kroger's 35% stock price decline since 2015, is that big chains are stepping all over one another. And there are other competitors like Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST).
Kroger is still big. It operates 2,765 stores nationally, plus a network of food processing plants, including 17 dairies and 10 deli/bakery operations. Store brands generate more than a third of sales with higher profit margins. About 90% of grocery shopping is still done in stores, which are located to attract customers within a few miles.
But the art of surviving is painful, even for a company founded in 1883. Kroger abandoned 14 Kroger-branded stores in the Raleigh-Durham region in North Carolina last year.
And online and Amazon pose big challenges. Last year, the Food Marketing Institute projected online sales will account for 20% of grocery sales by 2025, with Amazon among the leaders.
Kroger isn't sitting still. Last year it bought a 5% stake in the UK's  Ocado Group  (LON:OCDO), a pioneer in online grocery delivery logistics. The companies will partner to build 20 warehouses focused purely on online delivery by 2020. The first are projected for Cincinnati, Houston, Louisville and Nashville.
Amazon is looking to start its chain, featuring everyday products, in major markets, the Journal said, with stores sized at about 35,000 square feet. That's about half the size of a typical Kroger store, but bigger than the typical store operated by the more upscale Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM).
The Journal said Amazon hopes to open one store in Los Angeles this year, ground zero for people who drive and hate it, and is looking for locations in places like San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia."

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 02:28PM ET</span>",Exxon Mobil CEO sets plan to boost spending; shares slide,"By Jennifer Hiller
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) plans to boost capital spending for several years, CEO Darren Woods said on Wednesday, and the largest U.S. oil company's shares fell after he laid out a strategy to ""lean in"" while the rest of the industry cuts back.
Exxon shares fell more than 1.6 percent after the company told analysts attending its annual investor meeting that it plans to lift spending by 10 percent or more for the next several years as rivals are sidelining equipment and capping spending to boost shareholder returns. 
Woods defended the strategy of ""leaning in as our competitors are leaning back,"" saying the best time to buy into projects is not when everyone else is active. ""You do it when everybody else is at home,"" Woods said.
Exxon's plans include a big bet on U.S. shale, where output has surged in recent years, making the United States the world's largest oil producer.
Exxon shares were down $1.33 apiece in mid-day trading at $78.86. The stock has underperformed rivals for years and Woods faces challenges to boost investor confidence. He took over as chief executive in 2017, with a mission to boost sagging production and repair missteps made under former CEO Rex Tillerson, including expensive bets on natural gas and Russia.
Capital spending will rise to $33 billion to $35 billion next year from $30 billion this year and from $23.1 billion in Woods' first year as CEO.
""With investors increasingly pressuring energy companies to return cash to shareholders, it is no surprise that the higher capital budget was not positively received by the market,"" said Muhammed Ghulam, energy analyst with Raymond James.
Over the last five years, Exxon shares have posted a total return of negative 0.16 percent, lagging total returns of 32 percent at  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and 54 percent at  BP  (LON:BP) PLC over the same period, while the benchmark S&P 500 index has gained 48 percent, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
BIG BETS ON SHALE
Exxon's output has declined in nine of the last 10 quarters, but the company now forecasts continued production gains. It has placed one of its biggest bets on drilling in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. shale field.
The independent oil companies that launched the Permian boom are reducing drilling rigs and cutting spending in response to investor demands to rein in expenses while Exxon and other majors are cranking up investments in the oilfield.
Woods argued that more investment was justified because global demand is rising for oil and gas, and that the declining output of existing wells must be replaced.
“This is a compelling case for industry as a whole,” Woods said.
This week, Exxon and rival Chevron released dueling Permian output projections. Exxon said its Permian production could hit 1 million barrels of oil and gas per day as early as 2024, up from its previous estimate of 600,000 by 2025. 
Both companies have boasted of superior technology to overcome one of shale's biggest hurdles: rapid declines in production rates. New well production in the Permian was about 600 bpd per rig as of February, down from nearly 760 bpd in mid-2016, according to U.S. Energy Department data. 
Woods said Exxon can earn a double-digit return in the Permian even at $35-per-barrel oil. It expects annual cash flow from overall operations to reach $60 billion in 2025, on assumption of $60 per barrel international oil prices.
GRAPHIC - Exxon returns lag Big Oil peers: https://tmsnrt.rs/2C2CuvZ
Other major investments for Exxon include offshore projects in Brazil and Guyana, and from global investments in liquefied natural gas.
Exxon, which faces investor pressure to trim its assets, said it would divest $15 billion in holdings over the next three years.
Exxon needs to ""convince the market that higher spending today translates to higher returns to shareholders over time,"" which could be helped by increased asset sales, said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Europe Limited, in a note to clients.

Analysts and investors have pressured Exxon to be more open and transparent. Woods opened Wednesday’s analyst meeting by saying he had spent “quite a bit of time engaging with our shareholders,” in the last year. Last month, for the first time, he joined the quarterly earnings call to discuss results.

1620,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 01:31PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Nio in Sharp Reverse on Wider-Than-Expected Loss,"Investing.com - Nio slid sharply on Wednesday after the China-based electric automaker reported a wider-than-expected loss, blaming a slowdown in China and weaker SUV demand.
NIO (NYSE:NIO) reported a fourth-quarter loss per share of 3.37 renminbi , wider than the 2.22 billion loss per share consensus, according to estimates from Investing.com. Revenue for the quarter came in at 3.44 billion renminbi, beating expectations of 2.91 billion.
The electric automaker blamed the loss on a slowdown in deliveries, particularly for its ES8, an SUV launched last year in the Chinese market, as demand waned and Chinese consumers held back from auto purchases amid a slowdown in the economy.
“Deliveries of the ES8 in January and February 2019 were 1,805 and 811 vehicles respectively, which reflect a greater than anticipated slowdown in monthly deliveries compared to December 2018,” Nio said.
The company also suffered an overhang from accelerated deliveries toward the end of last year, when Chinese consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles to beat the electric-vehicle subsidy that went into effect this year.
In a sign that optimism may have soured, the company slammed the brakes on the plans to open a factory in Shanghai, raising concerns that slowing auto sales in China are set to continue.
The electric automaker's deeper-than-expected swerve into the red also prompted some on Wall Street to turn bearish.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch dropped Nio to an underperform rating from neutral, citing the company's downgraded forecast for shipments.
For the first quarter, Nio is expecting ES8 delivery to be between 3,500 and 3,800 vehicles, a decrease of 56% to 52% from fourth quarter. The company guided revenue between 1.39 billion renminbi and 1.52 billion renminbi, which would be about 60% to 56% lower year on year."

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",KLM boss seeks to ease airline row under mocking gaze of Ryanair,"By Alistair Smout and Tim Hepher
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The head of Dutch airline KLM sought on Wednesday to ease a Franco-Dutch row over share purchases in parent group Air France-KLM by the Dutch government - as low-cost airline chief Michael O'Leary gleefully stoked the embers of the dispute.
France, which owns 14 percent of the airline group, clashed with the Netherlands when the Dutch government abruptly bought a matching 14 percent stake in order to counter French influence over a group disproportionately heavily reliant on KLM profits.
""It's too early to (know) all the exact consequences and the exact impact. What's important is that we continue to do our work,"" KLM chief Pieter Elbers told reporters in Brussels.
Speaking on the sidelines of an Airlines for Europe conference, he said there was a ""good atmosphere"" with colleagues at Air France and that he had a good relationship with Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith.
Air France-KLM was born from a Franco-Dutch airline merger in 2004 in the hopes of creating a European champion, but has been hit by repeated French pilot strikes and uneven profits.
Tensions between French and Dutch partners came to a head when recently appointed Smith declined to give assurances sought by the Dutch in a meeting in The Hague on Feb. 15, sources have said.
Shortly afterwards, the Dutch government took Paris by surprise by buying a 14 percent stake in the airline - almost matching the France’s 14.3 percent stake.
The move drew a furious response from French politicians, though many analysts noted that state intervention is also a common feature of the French corporate landscape.
""It's good that some of these discussions have been clarified in the last couple of weeks, we can move forward now,"" Elbers said.
The Dutch government said last week it would seek seats on the board of Air France-KLM to increase its influence over the airline’s strategy.
Maneuvering at state-backed airlines like Air France-KLM and Italy's struggling Alitalia drew derision from the head of Europe's largest low-cost airline, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary.
O'Leary joked during a panel at the conference that he would like to see more state involvement in airlines and poked fun at Alitalia, the Rome carrier that is looking to be rescued. 
""I would positively encourage state involvement in the ownership of airlines. I compete with Alitalia in Italy,"" O'Leary said, adding French President Emmanuel Macron should increase France's stake in Air-France KLM to spark a bidding war. 

""And we can sit back and enjoy the show.""

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>","Former Barclays executive felt sick over 2008 Qatar deal, court hears","(Editor's note: paragraph 2 contains language that readers may find offensive)
By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A former  Barclays  (LON:BARC) executive told in-house lawyers he felt sick when he was told the bank could be challenged by criminal authorities over side deals with Qatar during a 2008 emergency fundraising, a London fraud trial heard on Wednesday.
Richard Boath, in the dock at Southwark Crown Court with former Barclays CEO John Varley and former senior colleagues Roger Jenkins and Tom Kalaris, told investigators in 2016 he also thought Qatar should have been told to ""fuck off"" when it demanded additional fees when helping bail the bank out.
The four men are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation over how they secured a two-part, 11 billion pound-plus ($14 billion) capital raising as the bank scrambled to avoid a state bailout during the financial crisis.
The Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which is prosecuting the case, alleges the defendants misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds to Qatar through advisory service agreements (ASAs), which the SFO says were not genuine.
The men deny wrongdoing.
Extracts of transcripts of telephone conversations and emails were read out and shown to the court by the prosecution on Wednesday.
Former in-house Barclays lawyer Judith Shepherd told Boath on June 18, 2008, that the bank had to show it had received valuable services from Qatar in return for the ASA - or risk other investors, the market regulator and criminal authorities viewing them as disguised commissions for the capital raising.
""I'm already feeling sick. There's no need to use all those words to make me feel sicker,"" Boath responded in the telephone call, according to one transcript.
Eight years later, Boath told SFO investigators that although he had not liked the Qatar deal, it had been negotiated by his seniors, approved by lawyers and that he thought the bank believed it would get value for the money.
""The lawyers persuaded themselves that even though they knew that the ASA in June was a consequence, a response to the request from the Qataris for additional fees, it didn't matter as long as we got value for services,"" Boath, the bank's former head of European financial institutions group, told the SFO, according to interview transcripts read out to court. 
Boath said that Jenkins, who was negotiating with the Gulf state, had ""real heft"" in Qatar and was a ""big deal down there"". ""I believed Roger would get his pound of flesh,"" he said, according to the transcripts.
""I don't think (former finance director) Chris Lucas or John Varley would ever have signed off on it if they thought that they were not going to get value for their services,"" he added in a recorded interview that was played to the court.
Asked by the SFO investigator if the ASA in June 2008 was a disguised commission, Boath replied: ""No. The advisory service agreement was put in place by Barclays in exchange for services that they expected Roger to get value for.""
""Judith goes on to say: 'Well, Big Dog will be in the dock first',"" the SFO investigator noted in the 2016 interview.
""Yeah, that's Roger, by the way,"" Boath said in the recorded SFO interview.
Lucas has not been charged because he is too unwell to stand trial, the jury has been told. Shepherd, the Barclays lawyer, and Qatar have not been accused of any wrongdoing.

(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) defended its planned $74 billion takeover of  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG), saying it had carried out a ""robust"" assessment of the merger after two major investors opposed what could be the largest pharmaceutical deal ever.
The drugmaker reiterated on Wednesday in a letter to shareholders that buying Celgene was the ""best path forward,"" even as investors Starboard Value LP and Wellington Management look to thwart the deal.
Starboard, an activist investor with a history of opposing deals it is unhappy with, maintained its view on Wednesday that the merger was ""ill-advised"" and recommended that fellow Bristol-Myers shareholders vote against it at a meeting slated for April 12.
The New York-based hedge fund has also presented a slate of five nominees to Bristol-Myers' board, including Starboard Chief Executive Jeffrey Smith.
Wellington, one of Bristol Myers' top shareholders with a nearly 8 percent stake, has said it finds the deal to be too risky and expensive.
""While (Bristol-Myers') letter conveys the Board's belief that the deal is compelling, the intent of the letter also appears to be to address shareholders arguments against the deal,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Vamil Divan said.
In its appeal to investors, Bristol-Myers highlighted that a buyout of Celgene would provide ""significant advantages"" with less risk compared with other options like pursuing a series of small transactions.
It also pointed to a six-month ""deep-dive analysis"" and weeks of confidential due diligence by its advisers that provided a comprehensive view of opportunities and risks associated with buying Celgene.
As its most important cancer immunotherapy Opdivo faces competition from Merck & Co's Keytruda, Bristol-Myers is betting on Celgene to strengthen its position in the lucrative oncology market.
It also stressed that the deal was expected to increase earnings by over 40 percent in the first full year when it closes.

""The talks are going well,"" Ted McKinney, Undersecretary for Trade and Foreign Agriculture Services told a press call. ""Presently there's a lot of discussions going on by digital video conference, also a very good and productive thing,"" he said.
""Right now, I think there's just a lot of work in getting words down ... a contract or agreement, and that’s the current status,"" he added.
Washington and Beijing have been locked in intense negotiations to end the trade war between the world's two largest economies. President Donald Trump, citing progress in talks, last week delayed a planned tariff increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
The United States has demanded that China make substantial changes to its laws and practices to protect U.S. intellectual property, end forced transfers of U.S. technology to Chinese firms, curb generous industrial subsidies and open the domestic market to U.S. companies.
In addition, Washington has sought increased Chinese purchases of U.S. goods, including farm and energy commodities and manufactured products, to reduce a U.S. trade deficit with China that it estimates at more than $417 billion for 2018.
People familiar with the talks told Reuters the two sides still had substantial work ahead to reach agreement on a way to ensure China follows through on any pledges. Talks could still collapse if a deal cannot be reached on enforcement of these ""structural"" issues.

McKinney said he did not know of any firm plans for a U.S. delegation to go back to China for further negotiations but added that such a trip would not come as a surprise.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>",Qatar sells triple-tranche jumbo bond to raise $12 billion,"By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar sold $12 billion in bonds on Wednesday, and drew around $50 billion in demand - the largest order book globally since its bond sale last year and the latest indication of how the country has overcome a boycott imposed by some of its Arab neighbors.
The debt sale, split into tranches of five, 10 and 30 years, was much bigger than the $7.5 billion bond issued by rival Saudi Arabia in January, which had attracted over $27 billion in orders.
It was not clear where most of the demand came from, but the high volume showed that despite a lack of demand from Gulf countries, hampered by the boycott, international investor demand remained strong.
""The political environment in the region remains challenging, however we would expect this bond to have support and buying interest out of Asia, Europe and other Western countries,"" said Theodore Holland, senior portfolio manager at Fisch Asset Management.
The $2 billion five-year notes offer 90 basis points over US Treasuries, while the $4 billion 10-year and the $6 billion 30-year debt offer 135 bps and 175 bps respectively over the same benchmark, a document issued by one of the banks leading the deal showed.
Earlier price indications were 20 bps higher for the five-year tranche and 25 bps higher for the longer tranches.
The initial guidance looked ""attractive,"" said Sergey Dergachev, senior portfolio manager at Germany-based Union Investment, offering some 30 basis points of new-issue premium - the price an issuer is ready to pay over its existing bonds to attract demand for the new issuance.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), QNB Capital and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) have been hired to arrange the five- and 10-year notes.
The Taiwanese branches of Credit Agricole, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered are joint bookrunners for the 30-year tranche, which is a Formosa bond - a type of debt security sold in Taiwan by foreign issuers and denominated in currencies other than the Taiwanese dollar.
Four of the banks leading the deal have Qatari ownership and there was no U.S. or Japanese bank among the bookrunners.
International banks with significant business ties to Saudi Arabia have been treading cautiously since the Qatar boycott started in 2017, sidestepping public Qatari deals.
A source familiar with the issuance said that the fact that Qatar chose as arrangers the same banks of its previous issuance, in April last year, reflected an extension of existing banking relationships.
Qatar, the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, rated Aa3 by Moody's, and AA-(minus) by S&P and Fitch, does not need to raise financing. It forecasts a budget surplus of 4.3 billion riyals ($1.18 billion) in 2019, partly because of higher oil prices.
But improved market conditions, and the recent inclusion of Qatar and other Gulf countries in JPMorgan's emerging-market government bond indexes might have prompted the sovereign to take advantage of global investor demand for Gulf debt.
""The timing is right to issue the bond,"" Dergachev said.
Also, more than $10 billion in Qatari debt is due next year, so a large debt sale could be used to pre-fund those maturities.
""I think it's a little surprising that they are coming to market with a very large issue, given the limited budget financing needs,"" said Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management.
""I guess this is in response to GCC index inclusion, and a response to increased demand for the region’s debt.""
Last year Qatar raised $12 billion through a similarly structured bond deal, outdoing an $11 billion debt sale by Saudi Arabia.
That deal was Qatar's first test of international investor demand after a boycott imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. They severed diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism, which it denied.
Partly thanks to rising energy prices, Qatar has largely overcome the economic impact of the boycott.
""Qatar is seen as an improving credit story – they have responded well to the economic blockade, pushing on with structural reforms, diversifying their trade, and improving their resilience,"" Ash said.

(Reuters) -  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) announced plans to close hundreds more Family Dollar stores on Wednesday as it wrote off $2.7 billion, or nearly a third of the value of the struggling discount chain it bought for $9 billion four years ago.
Shares of the company rose 2 percent as it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter same-store sales, along with the results of its full strategic assessment of the Family Dollar business.
Hedge fund investor Starboard Value LP in January urged Dollar Tree to explore all alternatives for its Family Dollar business, including a sale, after years of weakness that has hurt the company's overall profitability. 
Though Family Dollar has remodeled some stores and expanded its product range, same-store sales growth has been nearly flat on average in the past two years, pushing down the parent company's shares 7 percent in the last 12 months. 
Same-store sales rose 1.4 percent at the smaller chain in the fourth quarter, the strongest in a year and pushing overall numbers up 2.4 percent, above an average analyst estimate of 1.5 percent rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company said it would shut 390 Family Dollar stores, besides planned remodeling of 1,000 stores this year to add $1-only items. Dollar Tree had already closed 122 Family Dollar stores in the fiscal year ending Feb. 2.
The Chesapeake, Virginia-based company, which took a $2.73 billion one-time charge for the decline in the chain's value in the fourth quarter, also said it would explore pricing some goods above the $1-mark, as Starboard has demanded.
""We are confident we are taking the appropriate steps to reposition our Family Dollar brand for increasing profitability as business initiatives gain traction in the back half of fiscal 2019,"" Chief Executive Officer Gary Philbin said in Wednesday's statement.
The restructuring will weigh on operating income in the first half of 2019 fiscal year, it said, but lead to material improvement in the second half.

The company forecast first quarter earnings of $1.05-$1.15 per share, below analysts' expectation of $1.29 per share. It said its forecast takes into account a possible rise in U.S. tariff on Chinese products to 25 percent in 2019.

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 11:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Rosneft opens trading arm in Singapore as part of Asian pivot,"By Olga Yagova and Dmitry Zhdannikov
MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Rosneft is opening a trading arm in Singapore as part of a pivot to Asia, the world's biggest and fastest-growing energy-consuming region, where the Russian state oil major plans to manage new projects and boost oil sales.
Six sources familiar with Rosneft's strategy told Reuters the arm, Rosneft Singapore, had been registered at the end of 2018 and that several employees would relocate from Moscow during the spring and summer of 2019.
The office will likely be run by Andrey Bogatenkov, currently the first deputy head of crude and product exports for Rosneft in Moscow, three of the six sources said.
""The fact that Rosneft plans to appoint a key crude and products trader as the head of its Singapore branch means it is really betting big on the region,"" a trader at a Western oil major working on the Russian crude oil market said.
Rosneft said it was not immediately able to comment.
Russia's coveting of the eastern oil market dates to the middle of the last decade. Back then, Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, was shipping most of its oil to Europe.
Rosneft and pipeline monopoly Transneft borrowed tens of billions of dollars from China to construct the first direct pipeline to the country and later expanded it to add a major export terminal on the Pacific, Kozmino.
The shift toward consumers such as China and India accelerated in recent years as Asia showed steady import growth and Russia came under Western sanctions over its actions in Ukraine.
The sanctions complicated Western lending to Moscow, forcing Rosneft to borrow more from Asian energy consumers. 
The share of Russian crude exports heading east rose to 36 percent in 2018 from 31 percent in 2017, according to the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies.
Rosneft is run by a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, Igor Sechin, who pledged in 2017 to open offices in Singapore and has significantly boosted the company's presence in Asia. 
Rosneft's crude oil exports to Asia-Pacific markets reached 51 million tonnes, or 1 million barrels per day, in 2018 - about half of the producer's foreign sales, the Russian Energy Ministry says.
In 2017, Rosneft signed a long-term supply deal with China's CEFC and increased supplies to the country under a new inter-government agreement.
TRADING AMBITIONS
Rosneft had long planned to buy a major oil trading division to compete with companies such as  BP  (LON:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa). 
At some point it agreed to purchase the oil trading unit of U.S. bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), but the deal was derailed by sanctions.
The company subsequently developed a Swiss trading arm, Rosneft Trading, which focuses mostly on supplying Rosneft's refineries in Germany.
Rosneft also formed a broad alliance with Swiss commodities firm Trafigura to further boost its trading activity.
The two firms co-own a refinery in India, and Trafigura has been selling a significant share of Rosneft's oil on global markets. The opening of the Rosneft branch in Singapore represents another attempt to further boost trading.

""Rosneft wants to claw back some volumes and deal directly with many customers in Asia,"" a source familiar with Rosneft's strategy said.

The company will halt most of the operations at the plants for month around May and again for a month around August to avoid excessive chip inventories amid uncertainties stemming from Sino-U.S. trade frictions, the person said.
Renesas expects chip demand for autos, machine tools and air conditioners to slip further this year, said the source, who declined to be identified as the plan has not been officially announced.
No one was immediately available for comment at Renesas.
Production at four plants in China and Malaysia may be also temporarily suspended depending on demand, the source said.

""It is a chicken and egg situation. Somebody has to standardize the technology and regulation will follow,"" Klaus Froehlich, BMW's board member responsible for development, said.
Spiraling development costs for self-driving cars have forced BMW and Daimler to team up to share the financial and engineering burden, executives explained at a press conference in Geneva.
With fully autonomous cars that lack drivers, manufacturers take on potential liability risks arising from accidents, pressuring the industry to clarify technological standards so that regulators can draw up rules.
""It is to push technology forward and to set standards already in generation two vehicles, and not just in generation four. We do not want to waste resources,"" Froehlich said to explain the collaboration between the German automakers.
""We should not invent this complicated wheel twice. On the path to setting these standards, it makes sense to share some of these investments,"" Daimler board member Ola Kaellenius said.
BMW and Daimler will form committees to pick potential suppliers of advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technology in the coming four months, executives said.
""Daimler started earlier working on autonomous driving; they have invested in fields of computer vision where the cooperation will benefit from this experience,"" BMW's Froehlich said.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 09:45AM ET</span>","Dialog Semi, smaller after Apple deal, targets new growth areas","By Douglas Busvine
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Dialog Semiconductor is targeting new growth opportunities from home healthcare to gaming consoles following a $600 million deal to cut its exposure to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), CEO Jalal Bagherli told Reuters on Wednesday.
The Anglo-German chip designer struck the deal in October with Apple, which accounts for three-quarters of its revenue, helping it to weather an iPhone sales downturn better than other suppliers to the smartphone maker.
Dialog said the business that will remain after it transfers a team of programmers and patents to Apple should show strong growth in 2019, weighted towards the second half.
This upbeat outlook helped to lift Dialog's shares, which were up more than 5 percent by 1400 GMT, providing a rare boost for the semiconductor industry, which has been through a rough patch.
Dialog joins a small but growing number of chipmakers forecasting stronger demand later in the year, in a sector hit by the U.S.-China trade dispute and weakness in the car and smartphone industries. Nvidia and AMD have both given optimistic 2019 outlooks in the past few weeks. 
CONNECTED HEALTH
Dialog is working with four pharmaceuticals firms to develop connected health applications, as well as with two gaming companies to provide power chips for their next gaming consoles, Bagherli said.
The connected health devices would monitor blood pressure, check glucose levels or administer insulin doses for diabetic patients without them having to visit a hospital, he said in an interview.
These are part of the so-called Internet of Things - or smart devices and sensors that can be managed remotely and are expected to proliferate as fifth-generation mobile networks are launched in the years ahead.
The Apple deal, expected to close in the first half of the year, will hand Dialog a cash windfall to back its transition to a smaller, more diversified business.
""We find this transformation of Dialog's business compelling, and think its current valuation overly discounts the risk associated with the company's evolving business model,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Andrew Gardiner said in a note. 
Gardiner holds an ""overweight/neutral"" rating on the stock.
Dialog earlier forecast a single-digit percentage decline in revenue this year, reflecting weaker iPhone sales. This forecast topped a consensus view among analysts for a 9 percent fall.
Apple had shocked the sector in November by warning of slow year-end sales and did so again on Jan. 3 when it issued its first sales warning in 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China.
Those warnings hit shares in other European suppliers, like Austria's AMS, while weak automotive markets have also weighed on larger players like Infineon and STMicroelectronics.
Some industry players have forecast a quick, V-shaped rebound in demand although persistent weakness in measures of industrial activity such as purchasing managers indexes and inventory builds suggest a recovery may be slow.
Dialog expects first-quarter revenue of $270-$310 million, representing a more pronounced than usual seasonal slowdown, with gross margins broadly in line with the 2018 figure. 
NEW PRODUCTS
Dialog is also looking to boost sales of mixed-signal integrated circuits, which can be configured by users. This business, which Dialog entered with the takeover of U.S. company Silego, is growing well, Bagherli said.
The company is seeking opportunities for its power-management chips from folding smartphones unveiled at last week's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. These will carry two or three battery cells that need managing, he said.
Asked about how Dialog would use the cash windfall from the Apple deal, Bagherli said he would spend some on acquisitions.
He is looking at targets in Internet of Things connectivity - in narrowband radio and WiFi - to back up Dialog's existing strengths in Bluetooth. A follow-on deal to bolster Silego's franchise would also make sense, he added.
Dialog reported a 2 percent rise in fourth-quarter operating profits. Revenues were down 7 percent.
Based on its divisional performance, mobile sales fell 13 percent in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a decline in sales of main PMICs to Apple.

Taken together, other divisions showed a 20 percent rise in sales, although this was buoyed by the contribution from the Silego takeover in late 2017.

""Nevertheless, we believe the bull narrative will shift to Tesla as a combination of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford Model T.

Johnson cut his price target from $210 to $192 — implying a 30% drop from current levels — and maintained his ""underweight"" rating on the belief that increased volume and cost savings are unlikely to offset the company's lower margins.

Furthermore, demand is a key risk facing the bull case for Tesla. Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said he saw the recently announced shift to online sales as a ""'Hail Mary' in the face of a largely exhausted U.S. demand for higher priced variants.""
In a similar vein, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli told clients that while bulls will ""applaud Tesla's pricing achievement,"" bears could suggest the move was motivated by slowing demand. 
""If demand doesn't surge from here (or if Tesla struggles to meet it/service it), the bull case could suffer meaningfully,"" wrote Michaeli, who rates the stock as ""sell/high risk,"" with a $273 price target.
""If demand does surge, the bull case will likely live on (through Model Y) even if Tesla's gross margins end up lower, so long as the company can be profitable in Q2/beyond.""
As of Tuesday, ""sell"" ratings outnumbered ""buy"" ratings. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, 13 analysts say ""buy,"" 14 say ""sell,"" and 8 say ""hold.""

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>","Abercrombie predicts strong 2019 sales, shares surge","(Reuters) - Abercrombie & Fitch predicted annual sales above Wall Street forecasts on Wednesday, as new store designs and a broader selection of apparel resonate better with shoppers.
Shares in the teen-focused clothing chain jumped 11 percent in early trade as the company also beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly sales and earnings, as shoppers bought more Hollister apparel during the holidays.
Abercrombie is emerging from an identity crisis that hurt sales during the past few years as young shoppers shunned its trademark logo-emblazoned designs for fast-fashion brands and cheaper clothes online.
Since then, the New Albany, Ohio retailer has toned down its risqué advertising, remodeled its dimly lit and over-perfumed stores and begun offering more appealing designs. It has also closed unprofitable stores and expanded its online business.
""Our transformation initiatives are gaining traction,"" Chief Executive Officer Fran Horowitz said in a statement, pointing to digital sales that had exceeded $1 billion annually.
Sales at Abercrombie & Fitch stores open for at least a year rose 3 percent in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 2, about twice the 1.47 percent increase analysts had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net sales in 2019 should range between $3.66 billion and $3.73 billion, the company said, comfortably above Wall Street expectations of $3.61 billion.
Abercrombie also announced it would close up to 40 stores, mainly in the United States, and launch 85 remodeled stores, particularly as its namesake brands suffers a decline.
""There is obviously a lot more work to be done, especially in the Abercrombie division,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData Retail. ""But there are clear plans for this and, as such, both (Abercrombie and Hollister) have a clear sense of direction as they move into the new fiscal year.""
Fourth-quarter revenue overall fell 3 percent to $1.16 billion, but exceeded analysts' forecasts of $1.13 billion, led by a 1 percent rise in sales at Hollister.

Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.35 per share, well above expectations of $1.15.

1645,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 09:01AM ET</span>","Tesla Probably Can't Make Money in China, Morgan Stanley Says","(Bloomberg) -- Investors should keep their expectations about Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s “ability to run a profitable Chinese business very low,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note, adding that he’s “cautious” on China’s role in the carmaker’s long-term “commercial strategy and fundamental value.”
Jonas cited Chinese authorities suspending customs clearance for imported Model 3s -- even though Tesla seems to have resolved that particular problem. The customs issue highlighted “the risks inherent in U.S. auto/tech firms conducting business in the PRC in high value imported products or technological areas that may become sensitive along the grounds of data privacy, cybersecurity, robotics, and AI.”
Jonas listed a host of concerns, including Tesla’s reliance on China having “constructive trade relations and economic policies with the U.S.” There are also American regulations that should be considered, such as the Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as Cfius, along with the “unquantifiable risks of technology transfer.”
Electronic and automated vehicle technology may be regarded as “as having dual-purpose,” he warned, which could limit the role of U.S. companies within China’s transportation industry, and vice versa. He added that Morgan Stanley’s China team is aware of dozens of domestic Chinese electric vehicle startups.
Further ahead, Jonas sees the auto industry “morphing into a public transport utility operated as a public good.” That might naturally limit the role of foreign entities, as national and economic concerns come into play.
Morgan Stanley repeated its equal weight rating on Tesla shares, which are down 17 percent so far this year after closing Tuesday at the lowest since Oct. 22. The stock is also far below its 50-, 100- and 200- day moving averages. Shares are rising 0.4 percent pre-market Wednesday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Airlines will be able to withstand the impact of Britain leaving the European Union, even without a deal, but the lack of political progress is frustrating and has dampened consumer demand, airline chiefs said on Monday. 
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, and Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to seal a deal that has the approval of lawmakers in Westminster.
""I don't think it's concern that we've expressed -- it's frustration ... We do really need the politicians to resolve this,"" Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways and Iberia parent IAG (LON:ICAG), said at the Airline for Europe summit in Brussels.
""The industry manages (these uncertainties) better than any other industry ... I'm fairly confident that IAG and other airlines will be able to manage this situation whatever happens.""
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters that even if a deal is passed, it would only clinch a transition arrangement until the end of 2020, with further political instability delayed but not resolved.
""(A deal) is good news in the short term but fixes nothing over the medium term because they are still going to have to negotiate the trade deal. And what the UK government have demonstrated in the last two years is that they are incapable of negotiating the purchase of a packet of crisps,"" he said.
""So short term I think the threat of a cliff edge is moving away but it is only going to be postponed for another 21 months and now we are back to the same situation all over again.""
Britain and the EU have said that flights will continue, even in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit. The EU has proposed a provisional arrangement to mitigate the impact of a no-deal Brexit on airlines, including an extra six months to meet rules requiring airlines flying within the single market to be majority-owned by shareholders from its countries. 
EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren told Reuters on the sidelines of the summit that those moves were reassuring the companies that they could operate, even if ongoing uncertainty was not good for consumers. 

""The uncertainty that exists around Brexit and the impact that this has on the customer is not helpful, is not good,"" he said. ""(But) even in the event of a no-deal, we are prepared, because we know there will be a deal on aviation.""

Production at the mine was halted after talks on the deal with the Zeljeznice RS railway company collapsed last week. Transportation of iron ore was also halted.
ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, operates a steel plant in the central Bosnian town of Zenica which processes iron ore from its Omarska mines in the town of Prijedor.
The new agreement over transportation costs and quantities of iron ore shipped will enable the production to resume, the company said in a statement without giving more details.
In January, ArcelorMittal's application to bid for the Bosnian government's stake in the nearby Ljubija iron ore mine was rejected over procedural issues, prompting the company to warn of risks to the future of mining in the area.

The company's steel-making operation in Zenica, ArcelorMittal Zenica, is Bosnia's largest steel exporter and accounts for 2.5 percent of the country's GDP. ArcelorMittal employs about 3,000 people in Bosnia.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co is considering plans to suspend production at its oldest plant in China, the South Korean carmaker said on Wednesday, as it reels from tumbling sales and massive overcapacity in its biggest market. 
The move by Hyundai, which together with affiliate Kia Motors was the No.3 automaker in China until 2016, highlights the reversal of fortunes of China's auto industry.
""Hyundai Motor is reviewing production to enhance competitiveness and profitability,"" it said in a statement, adding that the plan includes ""suspension, not closure of Plant 1 in Beijing"".
The company, which has three manufacturing plants in the city, said that it has yet to decide when a suspension would start. However, the Korea Economic Daily newspaper reported that suspension could start as early as next month.
All of Hyundai's five factories in China are operated by its Chinese joint venture with BAIC Motor Corp, at which about 2,000 employees have taken voluntary retirement or transferred to other factories, the statement said. 
A BAIC spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. 
OVERCAPACITY 
China's auto industry has been slowing after a period of strong growth, hit by a weakening economy and the fallout of trade frictions with the United States. China's car sales contracted for the first time since the 1990s last year and Hyundai's sales in China amounted to only half its total production capacity in the country. 
For Hyundai, troubles have been exacerbated by a diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing that hit demand for South Korean products in China.
A lack of attractive models and strong branding also makes Hyundai vulnerable to competition from both Chinese and global carmakers, analysts and dealers have said.
Hyundai will start to produce its new ix25 SUV at its latest plant in Chongqing from September, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.
The current ix25 is made at the Plant 1 factory built in 2002. The model is Hyundai's second-biggest selling SUV, with sales reaching more than 75,000 last year, company data showed.   

Hyundai Motor CEO Lee Won-hee last week said the company was considering cutting capacity in China, sources said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese shares surged to a nine-month high on Wednesday bolstered by hopes of more stimulus measures from Beijing, but the rally failed to fuel broader gains in global markets as investors waited for fresh central bank cues.
Benchmark indexes in China rose between 1-2 percent after China's state planner said the government would implement measures to further boost domestic consumption to counter the impact of a slowing economy.
Taking into account Wednesday's gains, Shanghai Composite Index has now gained a quarter so far this year but is still down more than 13 percent from January 2018 as fears of a wider slowdown in the economy have dogged sentiment.
""China is outperforming today because of the stimulus plans and that is a localized phenomenon as other global markets are focused on central bank decisions and major economic data,"" said Ricardo Evangelista, a senior analyst at ActivTrades in London.
At 1500 GMT, the Bank of Canada may signal a policy turning point after raising interest rates five times since July 2017, while European Central Bank policymakers are expected to take a tentative step on Thursday to shore up growth by signaling fresh stimulus to keep banks lending.
Fresh signs of dovishness from other major central banks as China is moving to boost its economy and the U.S. Federal Reserve is signaling a pause in its rate hike cycle would boost equities and high-yielding debt, at a time when broader economic data has shown signs of flagging.
A Citi Research's gauge on U.S. economic data surprises is holding near a two-year low while a European index is holding well below September 2018 highs.
DEFINING 
Risky assets have staged a remarkable comeback in the first two months of 2019 - an index of global equities is up 16 percent - as concerns that monetary policy would continue tightening despite a slowing global economy has given way to optimism that major central banks will remain dovish.
But despite signs of caution from the U.S. Federal Reserve in recent weeks and expectations of a dovish European Central Bank at a meeting on Thursday, analysts say the broader underlying momentum of global economic data has struggled.
""One defining characteristic of the recent market rally has been the broad lack of participation from real money funds and the broader economic cycle continues to show a slowing trend,"" said Shaniel Ramjee, a multi-asset manager at Pictet Asset Management based in London.
A weekly Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merill Lynch report for the week ending Feb. 27 showed net outflows from equities at $50.28 billion on a year-to-date despite the rally in global equities.
Asian stocks had a more lively session thanks to a rally in Chinese stocks on expectations of more stimulus.
Beijing announced billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending on Tuesday to reduce the risk of a sharper economic slowdown.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan nudged up 0.1 percent. The positive news from China also rubbed off on emerging stocks with an index rising 0.2 percent. 
However, more stimulus plans in China failed to lift the Australian currency, an asset that typically benefits from any positive news from Beijing, as data showed the economy slowed to a near standstill in the fourth quarter.
The Australian economy expanded just 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter, slower than the 0.3 percent increase economists had forecast in a Reuters poll fueling a selloff in the currency.
The Aussie dollar slid 0.8 percent to $0.7028, its lowest since Jan. 4.
""The key domestic demand components were all weak and our economists suggest the door for rate cuts has opened further,"" said Adam Cole, currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
In the bond markets, sentiment was a bit more cautious with longer-dated German bond yields edging lower. U.S. crude oil futures were down one percent at $56.01 per barrel. 
Brent crude eased 0.9 percent to $65.27 per barrel.

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 06:48AM ET</span>",Ousted Nissan boss Ghosn leaves Japan jail after $9 million bail,"By Tim Kelly and Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn walked out of a Tokyo prison on a $9 million bail on Wednesday, slipping past reporters in a face mask and moving closer to mounting a defense against financial misconduct charges that he has called ""meritless"".
Ghosn, among the world's most prominent auto executives whose dramatic rescue of Nissan two decades ago made him a celebrity in the industry and in Japan, was barely recognizable as he left Tokyo Detention House where he had been detained for more than 100 days in a small cell with no heating.
Surrounded by security guards and dressed in a workman's uniform and a blue cap, Ghosn's face was obscured by thick glasses and the surgical-type mask, a far cry from his usual tailored suits. He managed to avoid many of the reporters camped at the site before being whisked away in a small Suzuki van.
Ghosn paid the 1 billion yen ($9 million) bail, among the highest ever in Japan, after the Tokyo District Court rejected a last-ditch appeal by prosecutors to keep him in jail. 
Ghosn, also the former chairman of  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors, has agreed to strict bail conditions and given assurances he will remain in Tokyo, surrender his passport to his lawyer and submit to extensive surveillance.
He has agreed to set up cameras at the entrances and exits to his residence, and is prohibited from using the internet or sending and receiving text messages. Ghosn is also banned from communicating with parties involved in his case, and permitted computer access only at his lawyer's office.
He faces charges of aggravated breach of trust and under-reporting his salary by about $82 million at Nissan for nearly a decade. If convicted on all charges, he faces a maximum jail sentence of 15 years, prosecutors have said.
""I am innocent and totally committed to vigorously defending myself in a fair trial against these meritless and unsubstantiated accusations,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday.
The finance minister of France welcomed Ghosn's release, saying the executive would now be able to defend himself ""with greater ease"". Ghosn holds a French citizenship.
BUILDING DEFENSE
The release will allow Ghosn - the architect of Nissan's automaking partnership with Renault and Mitsubishi - to meet his new legal team more frequently and build a defense ahead of trial, which could be several months away.
Last month, Ghosn hired lawyer Junichiro Hironaka, nicknamed ""the Razor"" for his success at winning acquittals in several high-profile cases, to replace Motonari Otsuru who once ran the prosecutor's office investigating him.
Hironaka's appointment suggests a shift to a more aggressive defense strategy. He has already said that the charges against Ghosn should have been dealt as an internal company matter and that Japan was out of step with international norms by keeping his client in jail.
The case has cast a harsh light on Japan's criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defense lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.
While the bail is a significant step, Ghosn still faces a criminal justice system with a conviction rate of 99.9 percent. 
Credited with reviving Nissan in the early 2000s, Ghosn was one of the auto industry's most powerful figures as head of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, whose combined sales rank it as one of the world's biggest automakers.
At the time of his arrest, he had been seeking a full merger of the companies, an idea opposed by many Nissan executives.
However, his arrest has since muddied the outlook for the alliance, which is based on a web of cross-shareholding and operational integration.

1660,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 06:00AM ET</span>",Credit Agricole shares drop on money laundering allegations report,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) fell by more than 2 percent on Wednesday, with traders saying the drop was linked to media reports about a money laundering network alleged to have channeled billions of euros from Russia.
Two traders linked the drop to a report in French newspaper Les Echos, which said Credit Agricole, through its private banking subsidiary Indosuez, was among the banks mentioned in a report by a collective of European news outlets called the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).
A spokeswoman for Credit Agricole said its Indosuez unit has ""fulfilled all its obligations regarding anti-money laundering"" when asked about the case.
The OCCPR said its report was based on leaked documents detailing transactions worth more than $470 billion sent in 1.3 million transfers from 233,000 firms.
Credit Agricole shares were down 2.3 percent at 1034 GMT, the second biggest fallers on the Paris blue-index index, and were set for the worst daily performance in nearly a month. The CAC 400 was down 0.2 percent.
Meanwhile shares in Dutch bank ING, which was mentioned in the report on Tuesday, extended losses on Wednesday. They were down more than 4 percent and set for their biggest daily drop since Dec. 20.
ING spokesman Raymond Vermeulen said the bank always takes such allegations seriously, but could not comment on the specifics of the report.
Last year ING settled with Dutch prosecutors for a record 775 million euros ($876 million) for failing to address money laundering through its bank accounts.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla's upcoming vehicle assembly facility in Shanghai is expected to be completed in May this year, a Shanghai city government official said on Wednesday. 
Chen Mingbo made the comments on the sidelines of an annual parliamentary meeting in Beijing, adding that part of the facility's production line would be put into operation by the end of the year. 
Chen, who heads the city's economic and information technology commission, did not provide any further details. 
The U.S. electric carmaker broke ground on the Shanghai factory in January and its CEO Elon Musk has said the firm aims to finish initial construction this summer and start production of the Model 3 toward the end of the year. 
A full-fledged auto assembly factory can take about two years to build but the Shanghai government has thrown its support behind the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) project, which would be China's first wholly foreign-owned car plant and a reflection of the government's broader shift to open up its car market. 
Tesla has been pushing forward its plans for the 500,000-vehicle-capacity plant after it secured a site in October, hiring staff, starting procurement for building materials and setting up a local financial leasing company.
Producing cars locally is also likely to help Tesla minimize the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war, which has forced the car maker to lower prices of its U.S.-made cars in China - which has becoming increasingly important as the company seeks to offset softening demand in the United States. 
On Tuesday, Tesla's shares fell more than 5 percent in early trade after Chinese media reported Shanghai customs had suspended clearance for a batch of Tesla's cars. 
The company said that authorities have accepted its plan to resolve the clearance problem.
Chinese customs confirmed in a statement on its official WeChat account on Wednesday that it had stopped the Tesla Model 3 imports and was now monitoring the firm' rectifications. 

It said the Model 3 cars were stopped because they did not have Chinese language-warning signs and had missing or incorrect nameplate labels. It added, however, that the nameplates could be replaced at the port.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 05:35AM ET</span>",Ex-Nissan chief Ghosn case shines harsh light on Japan's 'hostage justice',"By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - The high-profile case of ex-Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn has shone a light in Japan on what critics call ""hostage justice"", in which suspects can be held for months after arrest, but any reforms will likely be incremental and slow.
Ghosn, a former titan of the global auto industry, who has French, Brazilian and Lebonese citizenship, was released on bail of 1 billion yen ($9 million) on Wednesday after being held for more than 100 days following his Nov. 19 arrest by prosecutors on suspicion of under-reporting his compensation.
In a scenario common in Japan's justice system, Ghosn was arrested two more times on fresh suspicions, including aggravated breach of trust, each time allowing prosecutors to keep him in custody and interrogate him without his lawyers being present.
The term ""hostage justice"" refers to holding the suspect in custody while pressing for the ""ransom"" of a confession.
Ghosn's case has sparked harsh international criticism of Japan's justice system, in which 99.9 percent of people charged with crimes are convicted.
""The affair was reported abroad and many Japanese know that the Japanese criminal justice system is not necessarily at a global standard,"" wrote former Tokyo District Court judge Takao Nakayama in the Nikkei business daily.
""In that sense, the Tokyo prosecutors opened a Pandora's box,"" he wrote. The article was part of a full-page spread headlined ""What should be fixed in Japan's 'hostage justice'."" 
Granting bail after indictment and ahead of trial is rare for suspects who, like Ghosn, maintain their innocence, with the stated reason being fears the defendant would flee, tamper with evidence or seek to sway witnesses.
Ghosn had to agree not only to stay in Japan but to having surveillance cameras placed at his residence and to limits on his mobile phone and computer use. His first two requests for bail were rejected.
""I do think that this has made the whole system, that most Japanese on the street don't really know exists, much more visible and much more vulnerable to criticism,"" said Tokyo-based lawyer Stephen Givens. 
Domestic civil rights groups and lawyers including the Japan Federation of Bar Associations have long criticized a system they say gives too much power to prosecutors and is too reliant on confessions, some later found to have been forced and false. 
ASKING QUESTIONS
Ordinary citizens - and media - often equate arrest with guilt. 
""Japan is a country that respects authority and I think most people assume that when somebody is arrested, that there's a reason for that,"" Givens said. 
""Media ... are of that view - although I do think that some of the mainstream media are beginning to ask questions and present other views.""
Prosecutors have defended the system.
""Each country has its own culture and systems,"" said Shin Kukimoto, a deputy public prosecutor, at a news conference in December. 
""I'm not sure it's right to criticize other systems simply because they are different.""
High-profile cases involving forced confessions periodically attract public attention, although no outcry has been sustained. 
In a possible sign the issue was creeping onto the public radar even before Ghosn's arrest, a private broadcaster launched in 2016 a television drama called ""99.9 Criminal Lawyers"" about defense lawyers fighting the odds against acquittal. The title refers to the conviction rate.
Still, there is caution over prospects for change.
""I'm skeptical and it depends on what you mean by 'change',"" said Colin Jones, a law professor at Kyoto's Doshisha University. 
""Courts are institutionally subject to foreign pressure. The trend has been a gradual increase in the rejection of detention warrants and we might see a trend toward incremental change,"" he said.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 05:21AM ET</span>","Japan's Mizuho slashes profit outlook, hit by $6 billion restructuring costs","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Mizuho Financial Group slashed its full-year profit outlook by 86 percent, citing one-time restructuring costs of 680 billion yen ($6 billion) at its bank and brokerage units and an overhaul of its securities portfolio. 
Japan's second-largest bank by assets said it expects 80 billion yen in net income for the business year ending March 31, instead of 570 billion yen it had predicted earlier.
Mizuho said it would book about 500 billion yen of impairment losses on fixed assets, including costs from closing retail branches at home and software-related expenses. It will also book 180 billion yen of losses to restructure its securities portfolio of foreign bonds.
""Mizuho Financial Group's profit warning highlights the key risks facing Japanese banks,"" said Tetsuya Yamamoto of ratings agency Moody's in emailed comments, adding the restructuring costs for the domestic business suggests bank branches are no longer valuable assets.
""All of these losses indicate Mizuho's efforts in eliminating structural issues in order to reduce future downside risk. Other Japanese banks will also face losses if they take similar actions.""
Mizuho, like its rivals, has been accelerating cost-cutting as it grapples with the ultra-low interest rates and a declining population at home. In 2017, the bank said it would cut one-quarter of its workforce, or 19,000 positions, over a decade by scaling back hires. It has also said it would close about 100 of its 500 domestic branches by 2025.
But unlike its rivals, Mizuho has been dogged by a series of system troubles, for more than a decade. It had a costly ""fat-finger"" keyboard error at its securities arm in 2005 and suffered a breakdown at its ATMs after a devastating earthquake hit Japan in 2011. 
Mizuho's online brokerage platform crashed last year, forcing a suspension of trading for 2-1/2 days.
Chief Executive Tatsufumi Sakai told a media briefing that with the impairments losses announced on Wednesday, restructuring costs related to branch closures have completed. 
Most of the impairment costs are associated with the banking group's network, Sakai said.
""Amid growing uncertainty in financial markets ... the company will implement the restructuring of its securities portfolio in respect of past investment in foreign bonds,"" Mizuho said in a statement.
The announcements on the slashed profit outlook and the impairment costs came after Tokyo's stock market closed for the day.
Mizuho shares have delivered a total return of only 0.14 percent over the last five years, underperforming rivals Mitsubishi UFJ, which has returned nearly 12 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui, with around 2 percent.

The decision had been agreed with the Russian government, the source, who is familiar with the negotiations, said, confirming an earlier report by the RIA news agency.
""This is not the Kremlin's direct responsibility to open accounts and coordinate with business,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, while Rusfincorp said that it has no information that Venezuelan companies, including PDVSA, intended to transfer their accounts to the bank. Reuters reported last month that Russian lender Gazprombank had decided to freeze the accounts of PDVSA and halted transactions with the firm to reduce the risk of the bank falling under U.S. sanctions. 
Russian authorities made the decision to move the Venezuelan accounts after consultations with their counterparts and business in Venezuela, two sources familiar with the negotiations were cited as saying by RIA.

The United States imposed sanctions against Rusfincorp, which is owned by Russian arms exporter Rosoboroneksport, and some businessmen in April 2018 in one of Washington's most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other ""malign activity.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares stalled on Wednesday as weak results from the troubled autos sector dragged the market down and investors' confidence in a rally that has sent stocks shooting up this year showed signs of fraying.
Exuberance in Chinese shares over hopes for fresh stimulus failed to spill over into European trading where the STOXX 600 hovered near five-month highs, flat on the day.
""The good news is China is now easing quite aggressively. The less good news is it takes time for credit easing impact the domestic and global economies,"" said Nicholas Brooks, head of economic and investment research at Intermediate Capital Group. 
""We think Europe will see growth pick up in the latter part of 2019 as China import demand stabilises and recent exceptional domestic factors weighing on Europe growth start to fade.""
Auto stocks fell after German bearings maker Schaeffler warned of an ""extremely challenging"" business environment in 2019 and said it would restructure, sending its shares down 10.8 percent.
""The midpoint of the new guidance implies 17 percent consensus earnings (EBIT) downgrades, and the 2020 guidance elimination will likely hurt sentiment,"" said UBS analysts. 
The sector index fell 1.3 percent as German carmakers Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) tumbled, dragging the DAX down 0.2 percent. 
Traders said the stocks were also hurt by an article in Handelsblatt saying the European Commission is preparing fines on German carmakers in an ongoing antitrust investigation. 
Carmaker shares, facing a potent cocktail of slowing global growth and rising trade tariffs, have been under pressure for months. 
French car suppliers Faurecia and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) also fell 1.4 to 2.9 percent while small-cap Swiss autos supplier Autoneum fell 9.3 percent after reporting a drop in profitability.
Results from the tech sector were more encouraging.
Logitech shares rose 1.4 percent to a four-month high after the chipmaker said it expects annual sales to increase by mid to high single-digit in the next financial year ending March 2020.
""Delivering on its medium term targets is not fully reflected in shares yet,"" UBS analysts said. 
Dialog Semiconductor shares jumped 8.6 percent after the Anglo-German chip designer said revenue would suffer a single-digit percentage drop this year as it reduces its exposure to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), above analysts' consensus view. 
Italy's Prysmian, the world's largest cable maker, fell 7 percent after its results were deemed a ""mixed bag"" by analysts and Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"".
The company revised upwards its savings expectations from a U.S. acquisition to offset provisions it has taken on its WesternLink cable connection.
Outside results, Dutch bank ING tumbled 4.5 percent in its second day of losses after a report on money laundering. 
Also among top movers,  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) and Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) rose 3.5 and 1.4 percent respectively as investors bet the surprise resignation of U.S. Food & Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb may call into question the agency's regulation of e-cigarettes.

Madrid, winners of European soccer’s elite competition for the last three seasons, were firm favorites with bookmakers to progress to the quarter finals after winning the first leg in Amsterdam 2-1 on Feb. 13. But two Ajax goals within the first 18 minutes on Tuesday night left Los Blancos, the world’s richest soccer club, chasing the tie.
Dusan Tadic’s goal in the sixty-second minute meant the game’s richest team was all but out of the tournament, and the match finished 4-1 to Ajax, or 5-3 on aggregate. Ajax have won the tournament previously known as the European Cup four times, but the last victory was in 1995. The club hasn’t reached the quarter final since 2003.
Ajax’s shares jumped 9.5 percent to 16.80 euros at 9:15 a.m. in Amsterdam, giving the company a market value of 307.1 million euros ($347.2 million). The intraday advance of 11 percent was the biggest since March 2017.
A place in the next round is worth an extra 10.5 million euros ($11.9 million) in prize money, with another 31 million euros potentially at stake if clubs progress further. Success in the tournament also tends to bring greater leverage with sponsors."
1670,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",It's Payback Time for Stocks as Balance-Sheet-Be-Damned Ends,"(Bloomberg) -- Equity investors accustomed to ruling the corporate agenda are facing a gut check as big-name brands from telecommunications to consumer cyclicals pacify creditors with moves that signal a shift in the stock-bond power balance.
The latest examples: Marks & Spencer Group (LON:MKS) Plc said it would finance a $1 billion investment with new shares and cut its dividend;  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc issued bonds that will be repaid in stock instead of cash in a few years’ time, sparing balance-sheet damage in the near-term.
One takeaway is intuitive enough. The equity of levered or cyclical companies is in the firing line late as bondholders play defense late in the business cycle.
The harder part is sizing up this brewing shift -- and making money from it. The new-year rally is feeding demand for risky balance sheets. Hedge funds are struggling to find short bets en masse. And what’s good for bondholders can boost equity peers over the long haul.
In short, the tug of war between equity and debt is far from clear-cut.
“The situation for equity investors is getting trickier,” said Roelof Salomons, chief strategist at Kempen Capital Management NV, who’s a fan of equities with strong balance sheets. More treasurers are “running the company for the bondholder and not for the equity holder,” he said.
There are two things market players largely agree on right now. Expect more bad news from cyclical industries with leverage, low growth and margin pressure. And it’s better for treasurers to clean up debts in the good times.
With the memory of the fourth-quarter bloodbath fresh, belated balance-sheet clean-ups could get a company “punished twice,” according to Stephen Repoff, analyst at GW & K Investment Management.
“It makes sense to do some of that dirty work now when expectations are so high,” said Repoff. The market “might give you a pass,” he said.
As M&S Chief Executive Officer Steve Rowe unveiled a plan for a share-dilutive rights issue to fund a joint venture with Ocado (LON:OCDO), he said a foreboding macro climate called for conservative finances.
“We have to make sure our balance sheet is appropriate and our dividend is sustainable,” Rowe said at a press conference last week. “These are uncertain times and we wanted to make sure we had something we could grow on.”
Meanwhile, Vodafone managed to please both shareholders and bondholders, for now. Tuesday it announced a financing package which includes a potential stock buyback as the securities reach maturity in 2021 and 2022.
At Fidelity International, money manager Kristian Atkinson is avoiding tobacco companies faced with higher funding costs that will eat into growth. Retailers with bloated balance sheets are also going to be hard-pressed to meet deleveraging demands as the cycle turns, he said.
Slowing cash flow at Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co., PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. and  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc may prompt dividend cuts at the beverage makers, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kenneth Shea and Duncan Fox.
European names that have taken equity unfriendly actions to placate creditors in recent months include Kier Group Plc, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and Leoni AG.
“There’s too much leverage and it has to come down as we enter the end of the cycle,” said Georges Gedeon, founder of London hedge fund Antler Capital Partners LLP. He’s on the look-out for capital-structure trades -- like bidding up bonds at the expense of equity -- on speculative-grade retailers and auto-parts companies with rising financing costs.
Such late-cycle trades work best when corporate credit risk rises, Gedeon said.
Indeed, those looking for trades to exploit a deleveraging cycle will need to be patient.
Kevin Muir, a strategist at East West Investment Management Co., also likes trades that short stocks in riskier companies while holding their bonds. The problem is: it may be too soon to put those bets on.
“I still think that this is the story,” Muir said. “But so far, it hasn’t worked. The market has been chasing the levered-up stocks.”
Despite investor concerns about share dilution and leverage, shorting indebted companies in Europe is a losers’ game as companies with weak balance sheets up 16 percent since December lows. What’s more, prospective equity dilutions in recent cases are modest relative to market capitalization while lower stock prices compared to last year’s peak are flattering dividend yields across the board.
The story may play out ever-so gradually. Higher debt-refinancing costs may spur earnings-per-share downgrades in Europe in 2019, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). warned earlier this year.
“The penny hasn’t dropped yet, there needs to be a more aggressive reduction in balance sheets and leverage, and that probably will mean some pain for equity holders,” said Sajiv Vaid, another money manager at Fidelity International in London.
And the interests of shareholders and bondholders may yet align.
Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivative strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA, says dividend cuts can strengthen a company’s finances and give it resources for expansion or strategic turnarounds.
“If the return on these new investments exceeds the cost of capital, then this is a logical step and does not necessarily penalize the equity shareholder, at least in the long-term,” Shing said.

Britain is due to leave the bloc in under four weeks' time but lawmakers could back an extension in a parliamentary vote if Prime Minister Theresa May's exit agreement is voted down, potentially prolonging uncertainty for businesses.

""We want to know what the rules are, we want to know how we are going to be trading with the EU partly for selling cars there but probably more significantly is we source a lot of components there,"" he said. 
""If a delay brought a more orderly, managed exit, absolutely fine, then it's worth having a delay.""

ATC industrial action, a lack of controllers or other structural issues were responsible for over 75 percent of delays, with the number of EU airline passengers hit up 26 percent on the previous year to 334 million, the industry body said, citing Eurocontrol data.
""Progress on aviation has stalled and we are going backwards,"" Michael O'Leary, Ryanair CEO and A4E Chairman, said in a statement which outlined steps to tackle the issue. 
""The EU must tackle inefficient ATC monopolies through internationalization of airspace, introduction of competition between ATC providers, and quicker delivery and flexible deployment of air traffic controllers.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China Petroleum and Chemical Corp plans to sign a 20-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply agreement with Cheniere Energy once China and the United States end their trade dispute, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
Cheniere and China Petroleum and Chemical, known as Sinopec, reached a consensus in late-2018 on commercial terms after months of negotiations, but the signing of the deal was held back by the ongoing trade friction between the world's top two economies, one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the matter, told Reuters. 
""Without the trade spat, the deal should have been signed some time ago,"" the source said, declining to be named because the matter is not public.
In recent weeks, Beijing and Washington appear to have moved closer to a deal to end a bruising eight-month dispute that has seen the countries slap tariffs on billions of dollars worth of the other's good. A resolution is widely expected to include stepped-up Chinese purchase of U.S. goods.
Sinopec intends to buy close to 2 million tonnes a year of LNG from Houston-based Cheniere starting 2023, the two sources added, without giving a deal value.
Cheniere may start delivering some supplies before 2023, said the second of the two sources. 
Based on the delivered cost of U.S.-sourced supplies into east China in January at $8.30 per million British thermal units given by Chinese customs, the 20-year deal would amount to roughly $16 billion. 
Sinopec and Cheniere both declined to comment on the status of a deal.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that as part of a trade deal with the United States, China would buy $18 billion worth of natural gas from Cheniere. Officials from Cheniere visited Beijing in late February, said a third source, who was also familiar with the matter.
Sinopec, a late comer to China's LNG scene compared to domestic rivals China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) and PetroChina, has said it wants to more-than double its receiving capacity over the next six years to around 41 million tonnes annually, by building three new terminals along China's east coast and expanding existing facilities.
China, the world's second-largest LNG buyer after Japan, imported just over 2 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel in the first nine months of 2018 from the United States, according to Chinese customs.
Imports have since almost dried up after Beijing announced a 10 percent tariff on U.S. LNG in September, with sporadic shipments in November and January, amid an escalation of the tit-for-tat trade war.
In February 2018, before the trade war started, PetroChina's parent company CNPC signed a 20-year deal with Cheniere to buy 1.2 million tonnes of LNG a year through 2043, with a portion of the supply beginning in 2018.
Thanks to its shale boom, the United States is on track to become the world's third-biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2019, after Australia and Qatar.

Cheniere said last week it planned to make a final investment decision to build a sixth liquefaction train at its Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana in the coming months.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are mostly lower in early trading Wednesday, with the latest in a string of money-laundering exposures still weighing on bank stocks, and a profit warning from one of the continent’s biggest auto suppliers casting more gloom over that sector.
At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was inching down 0.12 points, 375.52. The Stoxx Automobiles and Parts index was down 1.1%, while the banks sectoral index was down 0.3%
A new report alleging billions more in illicit transactions out of Russia handled by western banks hit Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International (DE:RBIV) and Dutch-based ING (AS:INGA) hard Tuesday, and both are still falling this morning. While Raiffeisen figures most prominently in the report, ING is suffering because it’s less than a year since it agreed reached a wide-ranging and expensive settlement with Dutch prosecutors for compliance shortcomings.
However, the impact on  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) appears to be fading, given that Deutsche’s role was again limited to that of a correspondent bank. ABN argues its restructuring since its takeover in 2007 means it’s not liable for any of the business in the report.
Elsewhere, German auto supplier Schaeffler (DE:SHA_p) fell over 7% at the opening after it abandoned its 2020 profit targets due to pressure on its business in Greater China and Europe. It’s regained some of those losses in the meantime, but it has dragged down the whole auto sector.
On a brighter note, Dutch football club AFC Ajax (AS:AJAX) Amsterdam is up 9.2% after a stunning victory in the Champions League over holders Real Madrid, a victory that knocked out the team that has won the trophy four of the last five years. It’s a different story for Borussia Dortmund (DE:BVB), which is down another 2.1% after exiting the competition last night. It’s down over 10% since defeat in the first leg of the tie effectively sealed its fate – and its faltering challenge for the domestic championship is likely to put further pressure on the share price."

1678,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 03:16AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Philip Morris paid for India manufacturing despite ban on foreign investment – documents,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) has for years paid manufacturing costs to its Indian partner to make its Marlboro cigarettes, circumventing a nine-year-old government ban on foreign direct investment in the industry, internal company documents reviewed by Reuters showed.
The Indian government in 2010 prohibited foreign direct investment (FDI) in cigarette manufacturing, saying the measure would enhance its efforts to curb smoking.
Restricting foreign investment leaves cigarette manufacturing largely in the hands of domestic players, and is supposed to prevent any foreign-funded expansion. A year after the government's decision, Japan Tobacco exited India, citing an ""unsustainable business model"".
Philip Morris, though, stayed in India and used another route, according to company documents dated between May 2009 and January 2018. A year before the FDI ban, it struck an exclusive deal with India's Godfrey Phillips to locally manufacture the world-famous Marlboro cigarettes. 
Ever since then, Godfrey has publicly acted as a contract manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes in India, while Philip Morris's majority-owned local unit acts as a wholesale trading company and promotes the brand.
But dozens of internal company documents - including invoice bills, legal agreements, e-mails and accounting statements - show Philip Morris has for years indirectly paid costs related to Marlboro cigarette manufacturing in India.
Some former Indian enforcement officials said the practice of indirectly paying for manufacturing-related costs violates regulatory rules. However, some lawyers such as Pratibha Jain, a partner at Nishith Desai Associates, disagreed, pointing out that the federal rules did not explicitly prohibit such payments.
Philip Morris' director for corporate affairs in India, R. Venkatesh, in an e-mail, said the company's ""business arrangements with Godfrey Phillips India comply with Indian Foreign Direct Investment Rules"". He did not elaborate. 
The company did not answer detailed questions for this article and did not offer any executive for interview, despite repeated requests from Reuters over the past month.
MANUFACTURING CHARGES
Six invoices issued by Godfrey showed billing of 45.5 million Indian rupees ($644,200) to Philip Morris between December 2013 and January 2018 for manufacturing-related charges. Philip Morris paid for items ranging from large cigarette-making machines to costs of smaller equipment such as barcode scanners and printers deployed in Godfrey's factories. 
One invoice from January 2018 sent from Godfrey to Philip Morris showed the Indian company had spent 206 million rupees ($3 million) on capital expenditure for Marlboro-related manufacturing activities since 2009, though it was not clear how much of that was paid by Philip Morris. 
Godfrey Phillips' head of corporate affairs, Harmanjit Singh, said in an email that all the commercial arrangements ""are in complete compliance with the extant regulations governing the Indian Foreign Direct Investment and other applicable laws, and, incidentally, all transactions are in Indian Rupees. Also, it is our considered view that no illegality can be impugned to these commercial transactions between the parties.""
Philip Morris' local unit and Godfrey arranged a mechanism for such transfer of funds around the time they struck the 2009 deal. A 94-page ""procurement agreement"" signed between the two sides that year, which is not public but has been reviewed by Reuters, said that Godfrey may acquire new machinery for solely manufacturing Marlboro cigarettes and will then ""invoice PM (Philip Morris) India"" for charges in a phased manner. Philip Morris ""shall pay such invoice by bank transfer"", the agreement said.
The agreement specified Philip Morris would make periodic payments calculated according to the normal depreciation charge of the machinery, plus 10 percent per annum on its net book value.
Other than those regular payments, Philip Morris also signed off on one-time expenses and refurbishment costs incurred by Godfrey on at least two occasions in 2013 and 2014, according to internal e-mails and accounting records. It then accounted those transactions internally under a heading ""Packaging - Research"", accounting records showed.
""THEY ARE CAMOUFLAGING""
Three former officials and one former head of India's main financial crime-fighting agency, the Enforcement Directorate, reviewed the Philip Morris documents for Reuters and said the dealings should be investigated for circumventing India's foreign investment rules. 
One of the former officials said that paying for machines to manufacture cigarettes essentially resulted in the promotion of cigarettes, and the government's intent of banning foreign direct investment in 2010 was to deter that.
Bhure Lal, a former head of India's Enforcement Directorate, said the companies ""should be investigated ... they are camouflaging"". 
The current chief of India's Enforcement Directorate, Sanjay Kumar Mishra, did not respond to a request for comment.
If the Enforcement Directorate investigates a company and finds it to be in violation of the rules, Indian law allows it to impose a penalty of up to three times the amount contravened.
Jain of Nishith Desai Associates, which also advises global companies on foreign investment rules and reviewed the Philip Morris documents for Reuters, said the company was able to circumvent the FDI prohibition in cigarette manufacturing by paying for the machines through invoices. That's because the Indian regulations only restrict direct foreign investments into a company and were silent on such indirect payments for machines, she said.
""The company can argue in its defense that it is only funding the equipment purchases and not investing directly in an Indian cigarette manufacturing company, and they would be technically correct,"" Jain told Reuters.
INDIA CIGARETTE MARKET
The Indian journey of Philip Morris, which is one of the world's largest international tobacco companies, began in the late 1960s when it acquired a majority stake in the London-based parent of Godfrey Phillips. It gradually reduced its stake in Godfrey over the years, in part due to regulatory changes, and currently holds a 25 percent equity stake.
Though India banned foreign investment in cigarette manufacturing in 2010, it still allowed tobacco companies to invest through technology collaboration and licensing agreements. Investments could also be made by forming a trading company. 
Ahead of the 2010 ban, Philip Morris formed a new wholesale trading company with Godfrey. The New Delhi-headquartered local unit, named IPM India Wholesale Trading Pvt. Ltd, is 50.1 percent owned by the global tobacco giant, with the rest owned by Godfrey and an investment firm.
Among the payments outlined in the documents, Godfrey in January 2018 sent an invoice to Philip Morris's local unit for 10.2 million rupees ($144,500), billing for charges for the preceding six-month period, an invoice showed. In August 2017, Godfrey sent an invoice for manufacturing-related charges of 9.5 million rupees ($134,600).
The documents also showed that Philip Morris at times would discuss with Godfrey which type of equipment should be used for Marlboro manufacturing, and then sign off on related payments. 
In July 2016, the head of Philip Morris's India supply chain operations, Nilay Mehta, asked a Godfrey Phillip executive in an e-mail to raise a purchase order for an embossing roller, a type of equipment used in cigarette manufacturing.
Given the equipment had to be used only for Marlboro manufacturing, ""IPM will be picking the cost for this"", Mehta said in an email to a Godfrey executive on July 26, 2016. 
Mehta did not respond to an e-mail from Reuters. 
India has 106 million smokers, second only to China, and a young demographic makes it an attractive market for tobacco companies. 

Philip Morris is a small player in India's estimated $12 billion cigarette market but has seen its market share rise steadily in recent years. That was aided by its marketing activities, such as advertising at roadside kiosks and free distribution of cigarettes at parties. Both tactics were described as illegal by health officials in a Reuters investigation published in 2017. (https://reut.rs/2uy9vOr)

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese online retailers have started discounting iPhones for the second time this year as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) wrestles with a prolonged sales slowdown in the world's largest smartphone market.
Several electronics vendors announced discounts on iPhone devices this week, following mass discounts in January just before Apple reported sinking sales in China.
Gadget retailer Suning.Com Co Ltd said it would slash the price of the iPhone XS by as much as 1,000 yuan ($148.95) from its official price. Suning had lowered the prices of other iPhone models in January along with other retailers, but those cuts excluded the iPhone XS.
Pinduoduo Inc, an e-commerce site best known for selling inexpensive goods, has also said it would sell the 64GB edition of the iPhone XS for 6,999 yuan, a drop of over 1,000 yuan from the official price. 
Online retail giant JD.com Inc said it would offer discounts on a range of Apple products including the iPhone XS and XS Max, with models of the latter device selling at discounts of up to 1,700 yuan. Like Suning, JD.com initially did not discount the iPhone XS upon its first major round of discounts in January.
Apple, JD.com and Pinduoduo did not respond to requests for comment, while Suning could not be reached.
Apple's sales from China declined 20 percent year-on-year, according to its most recent earnings report. Slowing demand for smartphones and increased competition from local brands have chipped at its dominance in the country.
The U.S. company has yet to change the official sticker prices of its devices that it lists on its Chinese website. Yet the company has partnered with Ant Financial, the finance arm of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, and several state-owned banks to let consumers purchase iPhones via interest-free loans.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 01:40AM ET</span>",Factors that have propelled Chinese stocks to nine-month highs,"By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese stocks have staged a robust rebound this year, unexpectedly recouping much of 2018's sharp losses, buoyed by hopes Beijing will roll out more support measures for the slowing economy and signs of progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks.
Adding fuel to the rally is a pick up in the momentum in the A-share market's internationalization process, which drew foreign money into China even as authorities vowed to further open up its financial markets and deepen reforms.
The benchmark Shanghai composite index SSEC gained 17.9 percent in the first two months of 2019, versus an 8.2 percent rise in MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares in the same period. 
(For a graphic on 'Shanghai benchmark VS. MSCI Asia Pacific' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ul6URs)
Growth in the world's second largest economy cooled to a 28-year low in 2018, and authorities have announced a flurry of measures in recent months to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown. 
China will cut billions of dollars more in taxes and fees, increase infrastructure investment, and step up lending to small firms, Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday. 
In a move to further lower financing costs and spur growth, China's central bank in October announced a steep cut in the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves, its fourth in 2018. 
There have been signs of credit easing. China's banks made the most new loans on record in January - totaling 3.23 trillion yuan ($482.58 billion), as policymakers try to jumpstart sluggish investment. 
Proposed subsidies on items such as appliances have helped push up China's consumer firms, which have long been liked by foreigners, with the CSI consumer staples index having gained nearly 30 percent this year.
(For a graphic on 'RRR cuts amid gdp slowdow' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2VEObkb)
Market participants were also encouraged by the developments in Sino-U.S. trade talks.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday he thought the United States and China were ""on the cusp"" of a deal to end their trade war, adding to positive signs about negotiations from both sides of the Pacific.
Analysts say a trade deal would be no panacea for China's ailing economy, but it would relieve some pressure on its exporters and manufacturers and help business confidence. 
TECH TOPS
At the forefront of the rebound, technology firms soared as Beijing continues its push to reduce dependence on foreign technology and to upgrade its industries. 
China has finalised regulations for a new tech board that promises to smooth the way for Chinese technology IPOs and, if successful, could raise Shanghai's profile as a capital-raising competitor to Hong Kong and New York. 
As of March 4, the CSI information technology index had surged nearly 40 percent so far this year, while an index tracking major telecoms firms had also advanced more than 30 percent. 
The tech-heavy start-up board ChiNextp shot up 30 percent so far this year, up to Monday. 
Financial firms also shone, with the CSI300 financials index up nearly 30 percent this year, as investors cheered Beijing's plan to deepen supply-side reforms in the sector, counting finance as a key part of its core competitiveness. 
(For a graphic on 'China's tech firms lead charge' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2C3jnlK)
INFLOWS
Also powering the rally is a surge in foreign inflows, a not yet dominant though increasingly significant force in the A-share market, just as the country further deregulates its capital markets.
Net flows into the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets via the Stock Connect scheme as of end February topped 120 billion yuan, nearly four times that in the first two months of 2018. 
In late January, China said it would ease foreign institutions' access by combining two inbound investment schemes, while broadening their investment scope to include derivatives, bond repurchases and private funds. 
Global index provider MSCI said it will quadruple the weighting of Chinese mainland shares in its global benchmarks later this year, potentially drawing more than $80 billion of fresh foreign inflows to the world's second-biggest economy. 
""Foreign investors as a group have surpassed insurers as the largest A-share holder, and with the help of the MSCI weight increase, are likely to rival domestic mutual funds soon,"" Gao Ting, Head of China Strategy at UBS Securities noted in report.

(For a graphic on 'Foreign investors hiked their holdings of Chinese equities in the past five years' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2VGQ93z)
Investors are also being attracted by the cheapness of mainland stocks, whose valuations many say are near record lows by historical standards.
Even after the rally, Chinese mainland shares are still relatively cheap by historical and international standards. 
SSEC currently trades at 12.7 times earnings, compared with an earning multiple of roughly 18 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
Leveraging is also back with a vengeance in China's stock markets as regulators shift their focus back to growth after a lengthy clampdown on riskier types of financing. 
Margin loans, seen as a barometer of risk appetite and sentiment as aggressive investors borrow to buy stocks, reached more than 800 billion yuan as of early this week.

1683,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 12:50AM ET</span>",Huawei's Meng Wanzhou Prepares for Extradition Court Battle,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou begins her battle Wednesday against extradition to the U.S. to face fraud charges, aided by a phalanx of lawyers gearing up for a full-blown legal offensive.
The Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver is expected to set the date of her first extradition hearing -- the start of a politically explosive proceeding that could take years and has entwined the fate of two Canadians detained in China. Meng has been under house arrest at her Vancouver mansion since she was arrested Dec. 1 while en route to Mexico.
China has accused Canada of abetting ""a political persecution"" against its biggest technology company and has demanded the release of Meng, daughter of billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei. History shows that if Canada follows the letter of its law, Meng will likely be extradited. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has muddied the legal waters with conflicting statements on whether he might try to intervene in what’s supposed to be an independent law enforcement operation in order to boost a China trade deal.
In an escalation of the dispute, the Chinese technology giant intends to file a lawsuit this week claiming the U.S. government is overstepping by banning Huawei equipment from certain networks. That complaint would come just days after Meng sued Canada’s government and border service for allegedly trampling her constitutional rights in an effort to discredit the extradition case against her.
Prisoner in Vancouver: Huawei CFO Awaits Fate in Splendor
U.S. prosecutors in New York accuse Meng of fraud, alleging she lied to banks including  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) to trick them into processing transactions for Huawei that potentially violated Iran trade sanctions. She faces multiple criminal charges, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment, according to court documents.
Since her December release on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail, she’s been living with her husband and youngest daughter in one of the family’s two luxury homes in Vancouver, a city where they’d often spent their summer holidays.
At least five law firms in Vancouver, Toronto and New York are working on her defense. Her bail hearings in December had drawn crowds: supporters calling for her release, Huawei and Chinese consular officials, and a group of lawyers and aides who’d occupied two rows of seats in the public gallery.
Her legal team moved onto the offensive on Friday, filing a lawsuit against the Canadian government, the border services agency and a police officer. In it, she claims officers failed to immediately arrest her at the Vancouver airport and instead detained her under the guise of a routine custom check to “unlawfully compel her to provide evidence and information.”
Chinese Arrests Are All Too Familiar for Past Canadian Detainees
While Meng awaits her hearing, two Canadians who were detained in China nine days after Meng’s arrest remain in captivity. Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig will soon mark three months in secret jails, where they’ve had a total of seven consular visits combined and have yet to see a lawyer. After Canada last Friday formally moved Meng’s case toward extradition proceedings, China responded swiftly, accusing Kovrig on Monday of spying and alleging that Spavor supplied him with intelligence.
Black Jails
In China, Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave from the foreign service, was working for a Brussels-based non-profit research group, while Spavor was a North Korea travel guide based in the Chinese border town of Dandong. They were whisked away by China’s state security to extrajudicial detention centers known as ""black jails.""
Kovrig and Spavor are being held in isolation, questioned multiple times a day in cells where the lights can’t be turned off, according to a person familiar with the situation. Kovrig has also been questioned on his activities as a diplomat. Canadian officials believe that’s a violation of the Vienna Convention -- to which China is a signatory -- conferring ongoing immunity for that period in his life.
China’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission announced Monday that Kovrig had “severely” violated Chinese law by spying and stealing state secrets while working for the International Crisis Group and said that Spavor was his primary contact. Also in January, a third Canadian, Robert Schellenberg, saw his sentence in a drug case increased to the death penalty rather than a prison term in a one-day trial at a Chinese court.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 10:20PM ET</span>",J&J nasal spray gets U.S. approval as first new type of anti-depressant in decades,"By Saumya Joseph
(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it approved a Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) nasal spray antidepressant for people resistant to other treatments but placed restrictions on use of the drug, which it warned could be misused and abused.
The approval of nasal spray esketamine marks the first new type of treatment for depression in more than 30 years and has raised hopes for its relatively fast action and ability to treat some otherwise unreachable patients.
Esketamine would be sold under the brand name Spravato and is a chemical mirror image of anesthetic ketamine, which is also abused as a recreational party drug and goes by the street nickname ""Special K"". To prevent abuse, patients must take the drug in a doctor's office or medical facility and cannot take it home.
Currently available anti-depressants such as Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co's Prozac work on neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, but most drugs take at least four weeks to show effect and fail to produce an adequate response in about 30 percent to 40 percent of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
""Spravato has the potential to change the treatment paradigm and offer new hope to the estimated one-third of people with major depressive disorder who have not responded to existing therapies,"" said Mathai Mammen, global head of J&J's Janssen Research & Development.
Spravato has been touted as an asset with blockbuster potential and is expected to improve investor sentiment toward the growth prospects of J&J's pharma unit Janssen, as its top-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade faces increased competition from cheaper biosimilars.
The treatment carries a boxed warning - FDA's harshest - flagging the risk for sedation and difficulty with attention, judgment and thinking, abuse and misuse, and suicidal thoughts after administration of the drug.
Spravato is absorbed by the lining of the nasal passages and into the blood stream and will be used along with a newly prescribed oral antidepressant, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/htmlnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u= 
During clinical trials, Spravato was found to relieve depression symptoms within 24 hours in some patients, said Janssen spokesman Greg Panico.
The approval comes after an FDA advisory panel in February voted heavily in favor of the drug esketamine, saying its benefits outweighed the risks.
However, the panel members echoed concerns raised by FDA staffers regarding the increased risk of sedation, dissociation and higher blood pressure observed in the study.
The drug is also being tested in patients with depression who are at a high risk of committing suicide.

Recent research shows that depression involves deterioration of the quality and number of nerve cell connections in areas of the brain related to mood. J&J's drug helps restore these nerve cell connections in the brain, leading to an improvement in depression symptoms, according to the company. Over 300 million people globally live with major depressive disorders, and the incidence of attempted suicide in people with this condition is about 20-fold higher than that among those without the disorder.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 09:40PM ET</span>",Uber not criminally liable in fatal 2018 Arizona self-driving crash: prosecutors,"By David Shepardson and Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc is not criminally liable in a March 2018 crash in Tempe, Arizona, in which one of the company's self-driving cars struck and killed a pedestrian, prosecutors said on Tuesday.
The Yavapai County Attorney said in a letter made public that there was ""no basis for criminal liability"" for Uber, but that the back-up driver, Rafaela Vasquez, should be referred to the Tempe police for additional investigation. 
Prosecutors' decision not to pursue criminal charges removes one potential headache for the ride-hailing company as the company's executives try to resolve a long list of federal investigations, lawsuits and other legal risks ahead of a hotly anticipated initial public offering this year.
The crash involved a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle that Uber was using to test self-driving technology. The fatal accident was a setback from which the company has yet to recover; its autonomous vehicle testing remains dramatically reduced. 
The accident was also a blow to the entire autonomous vehicle industry and led other companies to temporarily halt their testing. Scrutiny has mounted on the nascent technology, which presents fatal risks but has minimal oversight from regulators. 
Vasquez, the Uber back-up driver, could face charges of vehicular manslaughter, according to a police report in June. Vasquez has not previously commented and could not immediately be reached on Tuesday.
Based on a video taken inside the car, records collected from online entertainment streaming service Hulu and other evidence, police said last year that Vasquez was looking down and streaming an episode of the television show ""The Voice"" on a phone until about the time of the crash. The driver looked up a half-second before hitting Elaine Herzberg, 49, who died from her injuries.
Police called the incident ""entirely avoidable."" 
Yavapai County Attorney's Office, which examined the case at the request of Maricopa County where the accident occurred, did not explain the reasoning for not finding criminal liability against Uber. Yavapai sent the case back to Maricopa, calling for further expert analysis of the video to determine what the driver should have seen that night.
An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter.
The National Transportation Safety Board and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are still investigating.
The Maricopa County Attorney's Office did not immediately comment on Tuesday. 
Uber in December filed confidentially for an initial public offering and is expected to seek a valuation of up to $120 billion. Its self-driving program, which costs hundreds of millions of dollars and does not generate revenue yet, is likely to come under scrutiny by investors. 
The ride-hailing company, which last year lost about $3.3 billion, is betting on a transition to self-driving cars to eliminate the need to pay drivers. 
At an autonomous vehicles conference in Silicon Valley last week, industry leaders lamented the loss of confidence from the public, regulators and investors that lingers a year after the Uber crash. There is no consensus on safety standards for the industry.
In March 2018, authorities in Arizona suspended Uber’s ability to test its self-driving cars. Uber also voluntarily halted its entire autonomous car testing program and left Arizona. 
In December, Uber resumed limited self-driving car testing in Pittsburgh, restricting the cars to a small loop they can drive only in good weather. The company is now testing with two people in the front seat and more strictly monitors safety drivers. The company also said last year it made improvements to the vehicles’ self-driving software.
Uber has not resumed testing in San Francisco or Toronto, where it previously had programs.

In mainland China, Shanghai was up but Shenzhen was down. Hong Kong was in positive territory and Australia was up. Korea was in the red as was Japan.
Overnight in the U.S., most major indices slipped but the losses were relatively mild with the S&P 500 closing down 0.11%, the Dow 30 down just 0.05% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq virtually flat.
In Asia, with no significant news on the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China and the Chinese government focused on the meeting of the National People’s Congress, movements were generally constrained.
The Shanghai Composite Index was up just 0.05% by 9:15 AM ET (2:25 AM GMT) to 3,055 while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.45% to 9,553.
In Hong Kong Tuesday morning, the Hang Seng Index was up 0.19% at mid-morning to 29,019.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.71% to 21,571 and the Kospi in Korea was trading down 0.36% to 2,175.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.49% to 6,229.
On Tuesday, China’s National People’s Congress opened its annual meeting and policymakers lowered the target for economic growth in the country to between 6% and 6.5% for 2019, providing a target “band” rather than the more specific goal of around 6.5% for 2018. Regulators also announced cuts to the value added tax (VAT), including a 3% to the top bracket, in a move that could help support manufacturing. The tax could add up to as much as CNY800 billion, according to figures from Morgan Stanley quoted by Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, trade negotiations between the U.S. and China are progressing and a deal could be reached as early as this month, according to reports by the Wall Street Journal over the weekend. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the media that the trade dispute between the two countries could be resolved soon.
“We’re trying to get that rectified, get that fixed, make it fair and reciprocal and I think we’re on the cusp of doing that and I hope all those tariffs will go away, all those barriers,” Pompeo said in comments reported by CNBC.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 07:55PM ET</span>",FDA chief tough on e-cigs steps down in surprise resignation,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Tuesday that he plans to step down next month, a sudden resignation that calls into question how the agency will handle issues such as surging e-cigarette use among teens and efforts to increase competition in prescription drugs. 
Gottlieb was well regarded by public health advocates and won bipartisan support for his efforts to curb use of flavored e-cigarettes by youths, speed approval times for cheap generic medicines to increase competition and bring down drug prices, and boost the use of cheaper versions of expensive biotech medicines called biosimilars.
Unlike his predecessors, who said drug pricing was not the purview of the FDA, Gottlieb waded into the intensifying debate about the high cost of medicines for U.S. consumers and had the agency actively looking into possible solutions. 
""Scott's leadership inspired historic results from the FDA team, which delivered record approvals of both innovative treatments and affordable generic drugs, while advancing important policies to confront opioid addiction, tobacco and youth e-cigarette use,"" Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. 
Gottlieb, who said he wanted to spend more time with his wife and three young children in Connecticut, was nominated by President Donald Trump in part to aid in Trump's anti-regulation agenda. But Gottlieb took an aggressive stance toward e-cigarette makers, such as Juul Labs Inc.
On Monday, he confronted 15 retailers including Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, for illegally selling tobacco products to children. In early February, the FDA pursued enforcement actions against some Walgreen and Circle K locations. 
But Gottlieb ran into fierce opposition from anti-regulation groups, such as Americans for Tax Reform, and former FDA officials, who said the agency's regulatory efforts would destroy thousands of jobs. 
A coalition of these groups wrote Trump last month asking him to ""immediately halt the Food and Drug Administration's aggressive regulatory assault"" on e-cigarette businesses. 
Following news of Gottlieb's resignation, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index turned negative.
It closed down 0.5 percent as shares of  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) erased gains and  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) shares fell further. Shares of  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) Plc rose after the news on Gottlieb, who had signaled his intention to also go after menthol and other flavored cigarette products.
“He made proposals that were unprecedented in their breadth, scope and, if they were adopted, likely impact,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “But they were just proposals."" 
E-CIG 'EPIDEMIC' 
Gottlieb's campaign against flavored e-cigarettes followed preliminary federal data showing teenage use had surged by more than 75 percent since last year, which the FDA described as an ""epidemic."" 
Under Gottlieb, the FDA proposed a ban on the sale of fruit- and candy-flavored electronic cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations. The FDA also proposed stricter age-verification requirements for online sales of e-cigarettes. 
""Scott has helped us to lower drug prices, get a record number of generic drugs approved and onto the market, and so many other things. He and his talents will be greatly missed!"" Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday.
Trump picked Gottlieb to lead the agency in March 2017 and he was confirmed by the Senate in May of that year. 
The Washington Post first reported on Tuesday that Gottlieb planned to resign. 
""There's perhaps nothing that could pull me away from this role other than the challenge of being apart from my family for these past two years,"" Gottlieb wrote in a note to FDA staff.
In his resignation letter, Gottlieb touted several agency initiatives, including efforts to curb tobacco use, decrease the rate of opioid addiction, speed up approval of generic drugs and streamline the process to bring to market novel medical technologies, such as gene therapy.
Gottlieb, 46, a conservative and former physician, was deputy FDA commissioner under Republican President George W. Bush. Before taking over at FDA, he was a healthcare investor and consultant who sat on multiple company boards.
He surprised critics who worried about his ties to the pharmaceutical industry by speaking out about rising drug prices and drug company tactics to keep competitors off the market.
“In all my years of public service, I’ve never worked with a more talented, forthright, and effective agency leader than Dr. Scott Gottlieb,"" Republican Congressman Greg Walden said in a statement. ""He worked effectively with Congress to find solutions and to improve the quality of life for all of us.""
Gottlieb often touted that the agency had approved more than 1,000 generic drugs as evidence that it was helping to curb prescription drug prices, a priority of Trump's administration.
Among those seen as possible successors, according to the Wall Street Journal, are Norman Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute, and Brett Giroir, assistant secretary at HHS. Giroir has been the senior adviser to Azar for HHS efforts to fight the opioid crisis.
In January, Gottlieb said in a tweet that he did not plan to leave the agency after speculation that he was preparing to step down. ""We've got a lot of important policy we'll advance this year,"" he wrote in the January tweet.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 07:29PM ET</span>",FDA finds asbestos in three Claire's cosmetics products,"By Chad Terhune
(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration called on Congress to modernize rules for cosmetics safety on Tuesday after it issued an alert warning consumers not to use three cosmetics products sold by Claire's Stores Inc because they tested positive for asbestos, a known carcinogen.
The FDA said it would work with Congress to update the regulatory framework that the agency has been operating under for more than 80 years for cosmetics. It said there are currently no legal requirements for any cosmetic manufacturer selling goods to American consumers to test their products for safety.
In its safety alert, the FDA identified the products as Claire's eye shadows, contour palette and compact powder and cited the talc used in the products.
Claire’s disputed the FDA test results, saying they “show significant errors” and have “mischaracterized fibers in the products as asbestos.”
The retailer, which emerged from bankruptcy in October, said, “There is no evidence that any products sold by Claire’s are unsafe.” However, out of an abundance of caution, it said it removed the three products in question from stores as well as “any remaining talc based cosmetic products.”
The FDA has come under intensifying pressure from lawmakers and consumer advocates to investigate possible asbestos contamination of talc following a report published by Reuters on Dec. 14 about talc in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) powders. The Reuters report detailed that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s. J&J did not disclose its test results to regulators or consumers.
The alleged presence of asbestos in talc products is at issue in thousands of lawsuits filed against J&J. Last month, J&J said it had received federal subpoenas for the first time related to the asbestos litigation and said it is cooperating with the inquiries.
J&J and its talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, have said numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe and asbestos-free.
In response to the FDA’s call on Tuesday for new rules, J&J said it supports the agency’s efforts to “reaffirm the safety of cosmetic talc products.” The company said it has backed previous legislative efforts to modernize FDA’s regulatory authority over cosmetics.
J&J also reiterated Tuesday that “for decades global independent laboratories and health authorities have tested Johnson’s Baby Powder and have never found asbestos.” 
""SHIFT THE SAFETY PARADIGM""
The FDA on Tuesday said it would investigate cosmetics manufacturers' sources for talc and what steps they take to test the raw material or their finished products. The agency did not name specific companies.
""We also want to know how many cosmetics products contain talc and whether manufacturers have received adverse event reports associated with talc-containing products,"" the FDA said.
In a joint statement on Tuesday, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who separately announced his resignation, and the director of the agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Susan Mayne, said federal rules have not keep pace with the cosmetic industry's substantial growth and a global supply chain.
""To significantly shift the safety paradigm of cosmetics in the U.S., we would need to work with stakeholders, including Congress, to modernize the outdated regulatory framework that the FDA has been operating under for more than 80 years when it comes to cosmetics,"" they said in the statement.
The FDA said the new rules for cosmetics manufacturers may require companies to report adverse events, provide access to consumer complaints during routine inspections and disclose known allergens on a product’s label.
In the meantime, U.S. regulators are asking cosmetics firms to voluntarily register their products and a list of ingredients, including talc, with the FDA.
Asbestos is a mineral often found near talc, a common ingredient in many cosmetics, and if steps are not taken to purify raw talc sufficiently the talc put in consumer products may be contaminated with asbestos, the FDA said.
Talc may be used in cosmetics, for example, to prevent caking or to make facial makeup opaque.
In 2017, the FDA said it became aware of reports of asbestos contamination in several cosmetics sold by Claire's and another retailer, Justice, which is owned by Ascena Retail Group Inc. The two retailers subsequently removed certain products, such as glitter creams, eye shadows and make-up sets.
The FDA then ordered independent tests and the results received in late February confirmed asbestos in three Claire's products and one from Justice. The Justice product had already been recalled from the market. 
In a statement on Tuesday, Justice said it “quickly and responsibly issued a voluntary recall in 2017 out of an abundance of caution.”
The FDA said Claire's had refused to comply with its request to recall the products that tested positive for asbestos. The FDA said it does not have the authority to mandate a recall, so it issued the safety alert. 
The United States Public Interest Research Group last May reported the health and safety regulator for the Netherlands ordered Claire's to remove several makeup products from Dutch shops after a study by U.S. PIRG showed contamination with asbestos.
Claire's in March 2018, in a statement, questioned the accuracy of asbestos testing by Dutch authorities. It said its own testing at independent laboratories in the European Union and the United States labs found that Claire's products were “compliant with all relevant cosmetic safety regulations.” 
Claire's, based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, operated 2,471 stores in North America and Europe as of August 2018. 

The FDA said the warning pertains to: Claire’s Eye Shadows – Batch No/Lot No: 08/17; Claire’s Compact Powder – Batch No/Lot No: 07/15; and Claire’s Contour Palette – Batch No/Lot No: 04/17.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Opposition leader Juan Guaido has asked Citibank to delay by 120 days Venezuela's scheduled repurchase of gold that President Nicolas Maduro's government put up as collateral for a loan in 2015, three members of the team advising Guaido said. 
Advisers to Guaido, who has been recognized by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate head of state, have met with Citibank officials to ask them to hold off claiming the gold that Maduro's cash-strapped government committed to give up if it failed to pay off the loan by its March due date.
One of the sources told Reuters that Citibank has not yet informed them whether or not it will agree to the request. A Citibank spokesperson declined to comment. Venezuela's Information Ministry and the central bank did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the loan and its own discussions with Citibank, if any.
The request is part of the opposition's strategy to safeguard Venezuela's foreign assets and prevent the socialist Maduro government from selling off gold reserves to raise hard currency amid tightening sanctions. 
Guaido, who invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, accuses Maduro of being illegitimate; Maduro says he is victim of a U.S.-led economic war to force him from power.
The U.S. government has recognized Guaido as Venezuela's leader and anchored that decision by ordering all U.S. companies buying crude from state oil company PDVSA to make payments into bank accounts controlled by Guaido's government.
Maduro's government began to use gold swap deals some four years ago in order to obtain financing as oil income plummeted in the face of sanctions. Under such agreements, if the borrower does not pay back the loan on time, the financial institution keeps the gold.
Venezuela allowed a similar gold swap arrangement to expire in 2017, a legislator said at the time.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/venezuela-allows-1-7-billion-gold-swap-with-deutsche-to-lapse-legislator-idUSKBN1CS2CD
In a public report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in February, Citibank said the Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) had agreed to repurchase an undisclosed amount of gold in March as part of an agreement signed by both institutions in 2015. The report did not give an exact date for the agreement.
In the deal, the BCV had sold $1.6 billion of gold to a British unit of Citibank, to be held at the Bank of England, according to the report filed to the U.S. market regulator.
The sources did not specify whether repurchasing the gold would cost more or less than the original $1.6 billion.
""The next such date will be in March 2019 at which time the BCV will be required to purchase a significant amount of gold from Citi under terms of the Agreements,"" it said in the report.
Guaido has asked British authorities to prevent Maduro from gaining access to any gold reserves held in the Bank of England, which holds around $1.2 billion in bullion for Maduro's government.

The Bank of England has said it does not comment on client operations.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 05:58PM ET</span>","GE's CEO warns of negative industrial cash flow in 2019, shares drop","By Alwyn Scott and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's chief executive surprised investors on Tuesday by forecasting a net cash outflow from its industrial businesses this year mainly due to its ailing power-plant unit, a gloomy outlook that sent shares and bonds tumbling.
""Industrial free cash flow will be (in) negative territory,"" compared with a positive $4.5 billion last year, CEO Larry Culp said in a webcast interview with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Stephen Tusa, a longtime GE bear. 
The shock remark dealt a fresh blow to GE investors who have watched the Boston-based conglomerate slash its dividend as it took massive asset write-downs and huge insurance charges last year. The stock is up nearly 36 percent this year but is still worth less than a third of its value in mid-2016.
""I don't want to sugarcoat"" the problems in GE's power business, Culp said, adding the unit likely will lose more cash in 2019 than the $2.7 billion in free cash flow it lost in 2018.
The cash forecast shows ""demand for GE's (power) turbines is half what the company forecast two years ago, and this is likely to persist into 2020,"" said Jim Corridore, an analyst at CFRA, who rates GE a ""buy.""
The stock swiftly fell below $10, the company's biggest intraday percentage drop in more than three months, which knocked more than $4 billion off GE's market value. The shares closed 4.7 percent lower at $9.89 on Tuesday after falling as much as 7.6 percent.
GE's bonds also declined, with GE Capital bonds the hardest hit. A $2.25 billion issue at 4.5 percent coming due in March 2044 was down 1.65 percent. 
""The risk of additional debt ratings downgrades has now increased,"" said John Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors, who rates GE ""underperform.""
GE's bonds are rated three notches above junk and it is selling assets to reduce its high level of debt.
Culp's comments went well beyond his January warning that industrial free cash flow, which excludes GE Capital dividends and cash from asset sales, would weaken in 2019. Investors are looking closely at GE's cash because of the gap between cash and earnings. 
Profits collapsed at GE's power unit in mid-2017 as sales fell and the company failed to deliver on promises to increase margins after a $10 billion acquisition of  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) of France. 
Since then, GE has blamed the power unit's losses, which totaled $22 billion last year, on its own poor management and a shift toward new wind and solar power plants.
The power unit is spending at least $480 million to fix thousands of turbine blades that are at risk after blades broke in 2015 and 2018, causing serious damage to power turbines and coinciding with a drop in GE's market share.
GE also has poured billions of dollars into its insurance business, which includes thousands of money-losing long-term care policies written more than a decade ago. Some experts said GE may have to spend billions more to cover claims. 
Culp said the power business would face headwinds for ""a couple of years,"" would not resolve problems with breaking power turbine blades for ""a while"" and promised to step up restructuring in the business and elsewhere. GE declined to provide restructuring cost estimates. The company is due to publish a financial forecast on March 14.
Culp said on Tuesday that GE would continue to provide cash to its GE Capital unit for the foreseeable future, though probably not as much as the $4 billion it provided last year. 

GE Capital used to pay dividends to the parent company, but that stopped after losses mounted at GE's reinsurance business in the second half of 2017.
