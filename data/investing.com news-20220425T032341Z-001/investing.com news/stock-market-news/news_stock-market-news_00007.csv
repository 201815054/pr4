Investing.com – GameStop stock (NYSE:GME) fell over 5% in premarket trading on Thursday after the video game retailer disappointed traders with another quarterly loss.
Compounding the poor results was the company’s disclosure that the U.S. securities regulator issued it a subpoena in August for documents on a probe into its share trading activity. GameStop ruled out any adverse impact due to the inquiry.
The net loss of $105 million was wider than expected and also more than five times the loss in the last financial year’s third quarter. The loss, GameStop’s sixth in the last seven, underscores the challenges it needs to overcome in the digital world. 
In the last year, the company has overhauled its management, raised fresh funds, while extinguishing most of the debt, and revamped its stores to attract a new audience. Before all this happened, GameStop started the year as the Reddit gang's favorite meme stock that also fueled its rally by more than 900%, the subject of SEC's study. 
The stock is now 64% off the year’s high as stakeholders await a sound turnaround strategy. Ryan Cohen, the co-founder of pet supply company Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) who joined the board earlier this year, has outlined a strategy for GameStop with a wider choice of digital products. The market is still awaiting the final word on it. 
Net sales rose 29% to $1.3 billion in the three months ended October 30 and were higher than estimated. The company attributed the rise in sales to new and expanded partnerships such as those with Samsung (KS:005930) and LG. 
It also said its inventory level, at $1.14 billion at the end of October, is higher by a third from the year-ago levels and reflects its efforts to meet consumer demand and mitigate supply chain issues.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Luxury watch retailer Watches of Switzerland Group (WoS) said on Thursday trading in November supported its recently upgraded full-year guidance, after strong revenue growth boosted earnings in the 26 weeks to Oct. 31.
""We upgraded our guidance about a month ago, we're confirming that guidance after a good start to our third quarter,"" Chief Executive Brian Duffy told Reuters in an interview. ""November has been strong.""
He said the group had sold a lot of Rolex watches in May, June and July and then had to rebuild stock until the end of October. WoS is the biggest Rolex retailer in Britain and the brand accounts for about half of the group's business.
He said a scarcity of Rolexes had benefited other brands. ""Cartier, Omega, Breitling, TAG Heuer, Tudor are all doing well.""
Duffy said the group, which has 163 stores across Britain and the United States, was now well stocked for the holiday trading period.
In the 26 weeks to Oct. 31, adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose almost 60% to 82.8 million pounds ($109.4 million). 
Last month, WoS upgraded its full-year revenue outlook to 1.15-1.20 billion pounds, also thanks to the acquisition of five U.S. stores with a combined annual revenue of about $100 million. 

The group's five-year strategy to 2026 envisions becoming the leader in the United States, a market it entered in 2017, and entering the EU market. It said it could spend 150-200 million pounds on acquisitions in the United States and the EU over the next five years.

2,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 03:36AM ET</span>",European Stocks Edge Higher; German Trade Data Impresses,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets edged cautiously higher Thursday, as investors continued to monitor developments surrounding the Covid virus and ahead of the release of important U.S. employment data.
At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.2%. 
Global stock markets have been buoyed this week by indications that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus may produce a milder reaction in patients, even if it is more transmissible, along with studies from drugmakers that the current vaccines can cope with the virus’s mutations.
That said, many countries in Europe are still battling to stop a fourth wave of the pandemic by imposing tougher Covid-19 restrictions, including England recommending people to work from home and Denmark closing restaurants, bars and schools.
In corporate news, Lagardere (PA:LAGA) stock rose 4.3% after French entertainment Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) announced it will acquire activist fund Amber Capital’s stake of just under 18% in the media group in the coming days and then file a full takeover offer.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) stock fell 1.5% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the German lender may have violated a criminal settlement with the U.S. Justice Department by its silence over an internal complaint. 
Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) stock fell 2.9% despite the U.K. engineering firm reporting an improved trading performance, which resulted in a return to positive free cash flow in the third quarter. The company was severely hit by the pandemic due to its exposure to the airline industry. Improved cash flow in the current year is due partly to the fact that 300 million pounds of liabilities have been deferred to the 2022 fiscal year.
German trade data offered up some positive news Thursday, as exports grew at their strongest pace in more than a year in October, climbing 4.1% after falling in August and September. Imports also saw an unexpected leap, growing 5% after a slightly revised rise of 0.4% in the prior month. 
Still, much of the attention is likely to be on the release of the latest weekly U.S. jobless claims data from the U.S., at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), the most up-to-date gauge of the strength of the country’s labor market.
Economists are expecting the number of first-time claimants to come in at 215,000, a small improvement from the 222,000 seen the previous week.
Oil prices stabilised Thursday after recent gains on increasing optimism that the new variant will not cause a significant hit to crude consumption.
Meanwhile, Wednesday’s U.S. crude oil supply data from the Energy Information Administration showed a draw of 240,000 barrels for last week, less than the previous week’s 910,000-barrel draw and also below the draw of 3 million barrels indicated by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday.
By 3:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $72.44 a barrel, while the Brent contract was largely unchanged at $75.83. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,784.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1322.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 03:22AM ET</span>",Toshiba investors fret over lack of clarity surrounding vote on breakup plan,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp is grappling with difficult decisions as it seeks to muster shareholder support for its plan to split into three companies, with some investors concerned it might set a preliminary bar for approval lower than they would like.
The scandal-ridden Japanese conglomerate outlined the breakup plan last month - a scheme that runs counter to calls by some investors for Toshiba to be taken private and one which sources have said was partly designed to encourage activist shareholders to sell their stakes.
3D Investment Partners, which owns more than 7% of Toshiba, last month publicly said it opposes the plan and called on the conglomerate to solicit offers from potential buyers. At least several other large shareholders are also opposed, people with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters.
Toshiba has proposed an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in the January-March quarter to gauge shareholder support. If it wins support, the company would then proceed with preparations for the breakup which it wants to complete by March 2024. A formal shareholder vote would take place much closer to the timing of the breakup and would by law require two-thirds in favour for it to be approved.
Much about the EGM, however, is unclear - including how Toshiba will word any motions and exactly when it will take place. The EGM would also not be binding under Japanese law, meaning Toshiba is allowed to set the level required for shareholder approval.
A Toshiba spokesperson said details of the EGM have yet to be decided including the level of approval.
Some shareholders said they would be upset if Toshiba decides it only needs a simple majority at the EGM.
""If the company will need two-thirds two years later, they should set the same bar now,"" said a source at a major hedge fund shareholder, who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
AN ALTERNATE PLAN
Activists account for nearly 30% of Toshiba's shareholders - the result of a desperate capital raising in 2017 - and setting the EGM's bar at two-thirds for approval could be hard to meet.
Setting it lower at a simple majority would be easier and could buy Toshiba time to convince doubtful investors to come round to its point of view. A longer run-up to a shareholder vote requiring two-thirds in favour could also test the patience of some investors who might pull out of Toshiba before then.
One alternative to seeking a direct vote on support for the breakup plan that has been floated among Toshiba's board is asking shareholders at the EGM to instead vote on the reappointment of its board directors, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Reappointments, which require approval of more than 50%, would then be taken as a vote of confidence in the board and by extension the breakup plan, the sources said.
One of the sources said, however, that the chance of the company choosing that option was low.
""It risks creating a power vacuum if board directors are voted down,"" the source said.
Toshiba has long had a tense relationship with its activist shareholders. In June, an explosive shareholder-commissioned investigation concluded that the company had colluded with Japan's trade ministry to block investors from gaining influence at last year's shareholders meeting.
The breakup plan, borne of a strategic review in the wake of that scandal, calls for Toshiba's energy and infrastructure divisions to be one company while its hard disk drives and power semiconductor businesses will be another. A third will manage Toshiba's stake in flash-memory chip company Kioxia.

Toshiba has walked away from potential private equity buyout offers, as well as advanced talks for a minority stake from Canada's Brookfield, sources have said.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 03:22AM ET</span>",Toyota halts production at 2 Japan factories due to supply shortage,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp has halted production at two factories in Japan due to a supply shortage, a spokesperson told Reuters on Thursday.
The stoppage means that Toyota cannot return to normal operations in December as it had originally planned. 
The automaker had previously said that it hoped to return to normal production for the first time in seven months in December, after supply shortages disrupted production. 

Production at the factories was halted on Wednesday and the suspension is expected to continue for about three days, the spokesperson told Reuters, who added this was prompted by a supply chain disruption in Japan as well as a lack of labour in Vietnam due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company expects a production fall of 3,500 vehicles from the stoppage, but will keep its target to produce 9 million vehicles worldwide during the financial year ending on March 31, the spokesperson said.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 03:21AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Look on the bright side,"A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao. 
England is going under tougher COVID-19 curbs, Christmas parties are being cancelled across Europe and the United States, and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) became the first big Wall Street bank to send employees home. 
But markets are looking on the bright side -- news that a three-shot course of BioNTech/Pfizer's vaccine neutralised the Omicron virus variant in a laboratory test enabled stock markets to carry on merrily higher on Wednesday.
Even S&P 500's airlines index managed to recoup pre-Omicron highs.. 
But with focus returning to central banks and inflation, the rally has lost some of its edge. European and U.S. futures are flatlining, Japanese stocks fell 0.3% and a global equity index paused near two-week highs. 
Chinese factory gate prices at 12.9%, had eased only slightly from 26-year highs touched in October, data showed on Thursday.
Elevated factory prices eventually feed into CPI which ticked up to 2.3% in November, from last month's 1.5%. Authorities fixed the yuan a touch below the three-year highs hit on Wednesday but the inflation worry will limit how much it can weaken.
China's data sets the stage for Friday's U.S. CPI, which some participants in this week's Reuters monthly summit predicted would print with ""a 7-handle"". Core inflation could be above 5%, some reckon.
It will be the last key piece of data before the December 14-15 Federal Reserve meeting, which could flag a step-up in the pace of policy tightening. 
In neighbouring Canada, markets now see interest rates rising from 0.25%, after the central bank on Wednesday dropped a reference to inflationary forces as temporary.
Those inflation projections and the stock market rebound forced bond yields higher -- a three-day rise in 10-year Treasuries was their longest since mid-October. This morning, edgier equity markets have sent U.S. and German bond yields a touch lower and the dollar index is back at one-week highs.
And data never ceases to surprise. Germany just reported October export figures which grew 4.1%, the highest in over a year and beating expectations of a 0.9% gain
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday: 
-  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares down on WSJ report it may have violated U.S. criminal settlement
-U.S. job openings jump to 11 million; fewer workers voluntarily quitting
-Brazil central bank makes 150 bps rate hike, signals another

7,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",Tech firms say EU rules should ensure they are regulated in their bases,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Proposed European Union rules targeting tech companies should ensure that they are regulated in the EU country where they are based, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), online video platform  Vimeo  (NASDAQ:VMEO) Inc and three other companies said on Thursday.
Tech companies are concerned that European countries seeking to grab regulatory power over them may try to amend the ""country of origin"" principle in the Digital Services Act (DSA) draft.
Under the principle, Ireland regulates Twitter, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) because they have their European headquarters there, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is subject to Luxembourg's supervision.
""A strong country of origin principle supports a diverse online marketplace,"" Twitter, Vimeo, Automattic, which is the parent company of online publishing tool WordPress and Tumblr, Czech search engine Seznam and German social media platform Jodel said in a joint statement.
""Without it, we risk entrenching the largest players, reducing consumer choice and irreparably splintering the Digital Single Market,"" they said.

They said the DSA, which requires U.S. tech companies to do more to police the internet for illegal content, should set out a standard definition for illegal content and a harmonised enforcement framework across the 27-country bloc.
The European Commission will kick off negotiations with EU countries and EU lawmakers next year before adopting the DSA.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Trade in shares of Macau's Suncity Group Holdings Ltd and its unit Summit Ascent Holdings Ltd were suspended on Thursday, pending a statement in relation to a possible loan default.
Alvin Chau, Suncity's CEO as well as the founder of Macau's biggest operator of junkets that bring in high rollers to play at casinos, was arrested last month over alleged links to cross-border gambling.
Suncity shares were halted pending an announcement ""in relation to a possible loan default by an associate of the controlling shareholder of the company and possible enforcement of securities charged,"" Suncity Group said in a statement.
Earlier this month, Chau's junket operations closed all of its VIP gambling rooms in Macau in the wake of his arrest.
Chau's junket operations, also called Suncity, are estimated to have accounted for a quarter of Macau's gambling revenue. 
The closure of Chau's gaming rooms is expected to exacerbate pain for casino operators in the gambling hub and is expected to lead to closures in parts of Suncity Group such as restaurants, bars and hotels.
Macau's gaming regulator has also ordered junket operators in the former Portuguese colony to stop offering credit to customers, according to brokerage firm Bernstein.

With Chau's arrest, Macau and mainland Chinese authorities are adopting a zero-tolerance approach to the promotion of gambling in mainland China where it is illegal.
In tandem, they are seeking to rein in the flow of Chinese gambling-related funds into Macau and other gaming hubs - outflows that China last year deemed a national security risk.

13,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 01:50AM ET</span>","Rights of Evergrande shareholders, creditors to be respected, says China central bank chief","HONG KONG (Reuters) - The rights of shareholders and creditors of cash-strapped property developer China Evergrande Group will be ""fully respected"" based on their legal seniorities, central bank governor Yi Gang said on Thursday. 

The risk caused by a few Chinese real estate companies in the short term will not undermine Hong Kong's capital market, he told a financial forum in the Asian financial hub.
Evergrande's missed deadline this week on debt payment has put it at risk of becoming China's biggest defaulter, with $300 billion in liabilities, even as hopes for a managed debt restructuring calmed fears of a messy collapse. 
 
"
14,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 08, 2021 10:45PM ET</span>",Evergrande Restructuring Leaves Bondholders at Mercy of Beijing,"(Bloomberg) -- When China Evergrande Group finally acknowledged the need for a debt restructuring last week, the embattled property giant pledged to “actively engage” with offshore creditors to create an overhaul plan.
But the reality is that both Evergrande and its bondholders are likely to have little control over what happens next. 
That power lies with China’s Communist Party, including authorities from Evergrande’s home province of Guangdong. Officials from the province dominate a risk-management committee unveiled by the developer this week to guide its overhaul.
For international creditors, the government’s hands-on role is a mixed blessing. While it may help prevent nightmare scenarios of an uncontrolled Evergrande collapse, Chinese policy makers will almost certainly put offshore bondholders near the bottom of a priority list that includes homeowners, employees, individual investors, suppliers and Chinese banks.
Here are some of the questions international investors are considering as they weigh the value of Evergrande bonds (most of which are trading below 20 cents on the dollar):
What role will China’s government play?
Regulators have made it clear they have no appetite for an Evergrande rescue. At the same time, they’re now deeply involved in management of the company. Guangdong said last week it would dispatch a team to Evergrande to ensure “normal” operations. The developer’s new seven-member risk committee includes senior managers from Guangdong state-owned enterprises and China Cinda Asset Management Co., the nation’s largest bad-debt manager. Another is from a law firm, while only two members are from Evergrande, including Chairman Hui Ka Yan, the company’s controlling shareholder. 
“The Guangdong provincial government is likely taking a lead role in dealing with Evergrande’s debt problem and finding ways to make sure the company’s finances hold up as long as possible,” said David Qu, an economist at Bloomberg Economics.
Guangdong’s government may provide some capital to support Evergrande projects but will probably “stop short of bailing out the entire company including all of its bondholders,” said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research Inc. in Hong Kong. For the committee, the hard part is to figure out which assets to target, he said. “That’s a very difficult political calculus.”
Are there any precedents?
Qu said authorities may follow the principle that guided the seizure of Baoshang Bank Co. in 2019: prioritizing social stability, with a “bail-in” of institutional investors to be used when needed. In Evergrande’s case, homebuyers are probably equivalent to depositors at Baoshang, who were fully repaid, he wrote in a note. 
He Jun, a researcher at independent strategic think tank Anbound Consulting, sees a potential road map in the restructuring of HNA Group Co. HNA’s home province of Hainan formed a government-led working group in February 2020, effectively taking control of the conglomerate. About a year later, it entered a court-led restructuring.
Hainan Development Holdings Co., owned by the provincial government, was later introduced as a strategic investor for HNA’s airport business, while privately owned Liaoning Fangda Group Industrial Co. took control of its airline operation. HNA founder Chen Feng was detained in September along with Chief Executive Officer Tan Xiangdong for unspecified crimes. 
How bad are Evergrande’s finances? 
Evergrande reported 1.97 trillion yuan ($310 billion) in liabilities as of June 30, the most among its peers in China. Almost half of that amount is bills to suppliers and other payables, while interest-bearing debt totaled 572 billion yuan, down 20% from six months earlier. The company has reduced its net debt-to-equity ratio to below 100%, meeting one of the Chinese government’s “three red lines” -- metrics imposed to limit borrowing by real estate companies. 
The company has $19.2 billion in offshore dollar bonds outstanding, the most among Chinese developers. Another risk for creditors is the firm’s guarantees on related-party debts, including private placement bonds with limited disclosure. Evergrande reported 557 billion yuan of financial guarantees to home buyers and business partners as of June. 
How much bargaining power do offshore bondholders have?
Not much. Some offshore bondholders see little use in pressing their case in Chinese courts, given the government’s heavy involvement in the overhaul. The fact that this is a cross-border restructuring with debt-issuing units listed in multiple jurisdictions creates another challenge for bondholders trying to get organized and show a united front.
Still, some offshore creditors are already consulting with financial and legal advisers. It could help that bondholders may include some of the world’s biggest investment firms, which China is unlikely to want to alienate. Ashmore Group, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., FIL Ltd., UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) and Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE have all reported holding Evergrande debt in recent months, Bloomberg-compiled data show.
Some of Evergrande’s bondholders own notes across multiple maturities and units. That means they’re less likely to get tied up in their own legal tussles over which notes should receive preferential treatment and can focus on working as a group in talks with the developer.
How will they be treated relative to onshore creditors?
Evergrande bondholders including Marathon Asset Management have said they expect offshore creditors to be near the bottom of the queue for repayment. The Chinese government’s prime motivation is often maintaining social stability, which in this case means giving priority to homeowners, employees and individual investors in wealth management products.
Evergrande’s overseas obligations also include bonds with keepwell provisions. These are essentially a gentleman’s agreement that often involves a pledge to keep an offshore issuer solvent, which may not be legally recognized in this restructuring.

(Reuters) - Investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group on Wednesday asked staff to work from home again due to a spate of COVID-19 cases, raising questions about banks' efforts to return to business as usual.
U.S. banks have been more assertive than other industries in encouraging employees back to the office, but those plans have come under renewed scrutiny due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.
Jefferies said it was also cancelling client parties and virtually all travel. The firm's disclosure prompted speculation about whether other banks will follow suit.
""Those financial institutions and Wall Street firms that believed there will be an automatic return to work and were pushing for that are going to reexamine their current return to work status especially given employees’ concerns,"" said Brian Marks, a former banking regulator and now senior lecturer at the University of New Haven's business school.
Jefferies, with its headquarters in midtown Manhattan, had called its staff back to offices in October. The bank has felt the pandemic's impact acutely, as its Chief Financial Officer Peg Broadbent died due to coronavirus complications in March 2020.
""Our priority now is to best protect every one of you and your families,"" wrote Chief Executive Richard Handler in a memo seen by Reuters. ""Effective today, we are cancelling all social events and entertainment until January 3rd.""
Jefferies added in the memo that while it was ""beyond eager for all of our people to be back in our offices...When you can, we ask that you work from home.""
The firm has had more than 40 new COVID-19 cases this month including 10 on Tuesday, the memo said, adding only very few cases required hospitalization. Handler added that Jefferies was re-imposing a mask mandate in all offices, regardless of vaccination status.
Jefferies, which had seen attendance average as high as 60% many days globally in recent weeks, said it will require booster shots by Jan. 31.
The investment bank, which has 4,500 employees worldwide, also has offices in Asia and Europe. More than 95% of Jefferies staff are now vaccinated, and all visitors to Jefferies' offices must be fully vaccinated, Handler said in the memo.
Jefferies did not say where the staff with COVID worked.
Shares in the bank closed down 2.3%.
New York set a vaccine requirement for workers at all private companies as the highly transmissible Omicron variant pushes into more U.S. states. The New York City Mayor's office and New York Department of Financial Services did not respond to requests for comment on the Jefferies cases.
Most major U.S. banks have had staff working in offices since the summer. Senior bankers such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive David Solomon and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Chief Executive James Gorman have spoken of the benefits of in-person interaction, particularly for younger employees.
So far, U.S. banks are sticking to their existing COVID-19 policies although sources at the ""big six"" firms say they are keeping a close watch on developments.
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have had most workers back at offices on a rotational basis since the summer.
Others, like  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), have taken a more flexible stance.
Wells Fargo pushed its return-to-office plans back to January, while Citigroup employees in New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. have been working from the office at least two days a week since Sept. 13.
HOLIDAY PARTIES
Some U.S. banks are also choosing not to host holiday parties. Wells Fargo said Wednesday it had no firm-wide celebrations planned. Team parties are at the discretion of individual managers. Citi will not host holiday parties this year to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, a source familiar with the matter said.
In Europe, where Omicron has spread more rapidly, some banks have cancelled events such as JPMorgan's annual festive carols reception in London and year-end party in Paris.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has told its London staff they can hold small gatherings at the team level. Asset manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR) and the City of London Corporation, which runs London's historic financial district, ask guests to take rapid tests before some festive events.

Some large U.S. companies are also pushing back their office-return date due to the Omicron variant.
Businesses ""have to do a balancing act,"" said Marks. ""While it's really important to get people back together, (concern over COVID-19) could sever the relationship to the point of no return, leading employees to look for other jobs.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning, with investors digesting the latest Chinese inflation data and the impact of the new omicron COVID-19 variant on the economic recovery.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.39% by 9:04 PM ET (2:04 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.21%.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 2.3% year-on-year and 0.4% month-on-month in November. The producer price index grew 12.9% year on year.
Investors also continue to monitor China’s property sector, with a group of  Kaisa Group  Holdings Ltd. (HK:1638) bondholders close to signing non-disclosure agreements with the developer. The move could pave the way for discussions around a potential financing deal for the company.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.03%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.19%. South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.57%, with the number of COVID-19 cases in the country exceeding 7,000 for the first time on Wednesday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.01%, with Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe speaking earlier in the day.
U.S. Treasury yields climbed, with the benchmark 10-year rising above 1.50% after a 10-year note auction.
Initial lab studies showed that a third dose of the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)/BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) COVID-19 vaccine could be needed to neutralize omicron. Pfizer will have data that will show how well the vaccine prevents omicron infections before the end of 2021, said Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla. He added that a third booster dose will hopefully “do the job” in restoring high levels of protection.
Investors now await more clarity on omicron’s risk to the economic recovery, the U.S. CPI on Friday, and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision, which will be handed down next week. But until then, some are bracing for more volatility.
“We are looking to potentially have a rise in volatility even if the market continues higher around those events next week. Many of the catalysts that gave us this boom out of COVID-19 are slowing. And then you have the Fed potentially tapering into a decelerating economy,” Optimal Capital portfolio strategist Frances Stacy told Bloomberg.

NEW DELHI/MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's Generali (MI:GASI) is in talks to raise its stake in two Indian insurance businesses as its local partner, debt-laden Future Group, looks to exit the arrangement, three people familiar with the discussions told Reuters. 
Generali wants to increase its stake to as much as 74% in both the life and non-life insurance entities in India from 49% currently, added the sources, who declined to be identified as the talks were private.
Generali ""wants to have a majority which could be a 74% stake but also (could be) slightly less. Future wants to completely exit the businesses,"" said one of the sources.
Future and another Indian entity together own a 51% stake in the life-insurance joint venture with Generali, while Future holds all of the remaining 51% stake in the non-life insurance venture.
Indian insurance sector regulations https://reut.rs/2L5QIUG allow a foreign player to hold a maximum of 74% of a local entity so another investor or investors would be needed if Future were to completely exit the businesses, the first source added. 
The second source said Future is hoping to raise 30 billion rupees ($400 million) by selling its entire stake in the two businesses, adding that talks with Generali were close to being finalised and the Italian firm was keen to raise its stake soon.
The Indian business, Future Generali, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spokespersons for Future Group and Generali also did not reply.
Future Generali sells life insurance and other policies including health, motor and travel insurance in India, where it is a relatively small player. Its life cover business has insured 1.5 million people to date and manages assets of around $680 million, according to its website.
The third source said insurance was a non-core business for Future group, which runs India's second largest retail chain Future Retail, and talks with Generali had been taking place for several months. 
Future, which is facing a mountain of debt and is in dire need of funds after being hit hard by the pandemic, is struggling to sell its retail assets due to an ongoing legal dispute https://reut.rs/3BV0tJG with estranged local partner Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Future would use proceeds from the sale of the insurance stakes to sustain its retail business and clear liabilities of other group companies, the third source added.

The deal is likely to require regulatory approval in India, including from the insurance and competition regulators.
While take up of insurance products is low in the country of 1.3 billion people, it is expected to grow, with investment promotion agency Invest India forecasting an insurance market worth around $250 billion by 2025.

(Reuters) - The head of Instagram said on Wednesday he aims to launch next year a version of the app with a chronological feed, rather than one ranked algorithmically, in his first appearance before Congress where he was grilled about children's safety online.
Instagram's Adam Mosseri was the latest tech executive pressed by lawmakers to provide more transparency into their platforms' algorithms and the impact of the content they curate and recommend for users. 
Instagram and its parent company Meta Platforms Inc, formerly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), have come under intense scrutiny over the potential impact of their services on the mental health, body image and safety of young users, including after whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents about the company's approach to younger users.
Speaking before a Senate panel, Mosseri said the photo-sharing app had been working ""for months"" on the option of a feed ordered chronologically and planned to launch it in early 2022, in a significant change for the service, which uses algorithmic ranking to personalize a feed based on user preferences.
At the hearing, lawmakers pushed Mosseri for specific answers on what legislative reforms he would support around kids' online safety, including on targeted advertising. In his opening remarks, Senator Richard Blumenthal said the time for self-regulation was over.
In his testimony, Mosseri called for the creation of an industry body to determine best practices to help keep young people safe online. The body, he said, should receive input from civil society, parents, and regulators to create standards on how to verify age, design age-appropriate experiences, and build parental controls. 
Mosseri said tech companies should have to adhere to standards by this proposed industry body to ""earn"" some of their Section 230 protections, referring to a key U.S. internet law which offers tech platforms protections from liability over content posted by users.
'TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE' 
Instagram, since September, has suspended plans for a version of the app for kids, amid growing opposition to the project. 
The pause followed a Wall Street Journal report that said internal documents, leaked by former Facebook employee Haugen, showed the company knew Instagram could have harmful mental health effects on teens. 
Mosseri, speaking at the hearing, echoed the company's previous statements that public reporting mischaracterized the internal research. He did not commit to making permanent the pause on a kids-focused version of Instagram. 
He also touted product announcements Instagram made on Tuesday on young users' safety, but Senator Marsha Blackburn called the updates ""too little, too late,"" while Senator Blumenthal referred to the changes, including Instagram's pause on its kids app, as a ""public relations tactic.""
In a call after the hearing, Blackburn said she would like to see Instagram offer ""today"" the option for a purely chronological news feed while Blumenthal said it could be a ""significant step depending on the details.""

Senator Blackburn also said that her team created a fake Instagram account for a 15-year-old that defaulted to a public account, despite Instagram's changes to make new accounts for users under 16 private by default. Mosseri said this loophole had been missed on the web version of the site and would be corrected. 
Instagram, like other social media sites, has rules against children under 13 joining the platform but has said it knows it has users this age. In his testimony, Mosseri called for more age verification technology at a phone level, rather than by individual tech platforms, so users have an ""age-appropriate experience.""

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said on Wednesday it will give an additional bonus to its employees globally this year, as the tech giant pushes back its return-to-office plan. 
Google will give all employees, including the company's extended workforce and interns, a one-time cash bonus of $1,600 or equivalent value in their country this month, a company spokesperson told Reuters. 
The latest benefit is in addition to Google's work-from-home allowance and wellbeing bonus, to support its employees during the coronavirus pandemic, the spokesperson said, without giving details on how much the company has set aside in total for the purpose. 
Earlier in March, Google's internal survey showed a drop in its employee wellbeing over the past year, after which the company announced a series of benefits, including a $500 wellbeing cash bonus.

Last week, Google delayed its return-to-office plan indefinitely amid Omicron variant fears and some resistance from its employees to company-mandated vaccinations. It earlier expected staff to return to office from Jan. 10.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed slightly higher on Wednesday with the three major indexes managing their third straight day of gains after test data showed the COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech offered some protection against the new Omicron variant.
Pfizer and BioNTech said their three-shot course of the vaccine was able to neutralize the Omicron variant in a laboratory test and they could deliver an upgraded vaccine in March 2022 if needed.
Investors reacted by piling into travel related stocks. The S&P 1500 Airlines index closed up 1.96%. Its session high was the highest since Nov. 24, which was just before news of the variant emerged. 
Markets have been hugely volatile since the variant was discovered, with investors worried Omicron could force new restrictions in countries and hurt the global recovery. 
In a bid to slow its spread, Britain said Wednesday it could implement tougher measures, including advice to work from home, as early as Thursday.
While Pfizer said Omicron protection was reduced among people who took just two doses of the vaccine, investors were still somewhat reassured. 
With Nasdaq outperforming the Dow, Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago described the session as a ""perfect risk-on kind of day.""
""A lot is revolving around virus news. It's a reopening trade more than anything else,"" said Nolte. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 35.32 points, or 0.1%, to 35,754.75, the S&P 500 gained 14.46 points, or 0.31%, to 4,701.21 and the Nasdaq Composite added 100.07 points, or 0.64%, to 15,786.99.
The S&P finished less than a point below where it closed before a steep sell-off. The index fell as much as 4.4% between Nov. 24, the day before Thanksgiving, and Friday, as investors fled risky bets due to Omicron fears and concerns about rising interest rates after a Federal Reserve update last week.
""Equity investors are buying into the thesis that rates won't have to go up very much to tame inflation. It makes them more comfortable buying stocks although more inclined to buy quality growth stocks than cyclicals,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. 
Sector gains were led by communication services, which rose 0.75% followed closely by healthcare, up 0.74%. With only three of the 11 major S&P sectors losing ground on the day, the laggards were financials, down 0.46%, consumer staples, down 0.37% and utilities, which edged down 0.1%.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said governments should urgently reassess their national responses to COVID-19 and accelerate their vaccination programs.
So-called reopening stocks, most affected by the pandemic's lockdowns, were among the S&P's top gainers on Wednesday. These included Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH), up 8%, Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp, up 5.5% and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL), up 5.2%.
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co rose 2.6% after  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""hold"".
Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) advanced 3.3% after Sweden's Securitas agreed to buy its electronic security solutions business for $3.2 billion.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.93-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 39 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges 10.3 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.52 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

The hearing will look at ""the effect on the airline industry’s workforce, and the effect of airline operational performance on American consumers,"" according to a committee statement.
American CEO Doug Parker and Southwest Gary Kelly, who are both stepping down in early 2022, will testify, as will United CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX).
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Chief Operating Officer John Laughter also will testify, as will Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.
Lawmakers are expected to quiz executives about how carriers used pandemic-related federal aid, staffing issues and other matters.
U.S. airlines and carriers around the world were hard hit by reduced business and tourist travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in March 2020, Congress approved three rounds of taxpayer bailouts totaling $54 billion to cover much of U.S. airline payroll costs through Sept. 30 of this year as a result of the pandemic.
Nelson said in October that the airline industry ""created a COVID-19 relief plan that no other industry got.""
Lawmakers want to know if voluntary employee buyouts offered by airlines, despite receiving payroll assistance, caused operational problems at some carriers that have resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights in recent months.
The leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation Committee separately have asked industry trade group Airlines for America (A4A) to answer questions about the government payroll aid that the carriers received.

A4A said in a response letter Tuesday, the assistance program ""was an overwhelming success... that kept employees on the job with a paycheck, healthcare and retirement contributions."" Without it, the group added, ""U.S. airlines would have been forced to implement massive layoffs, dramatically reduce service and cancel fleet orders.""

(Reuters) -U.S. oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) will quit Indonesia, selling its assets there for $1.355 billion to domestic energy company Medco Energi Internasional, and beef up in Australia as it continues to reshape.
The deals follow ConocoPhillips move to double down on U.S. shale with a $9.5 billion purchase of Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa)'s West Texas properties and a $13.3 billion deal for Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO), and its exit from Canada's oil sands, U.S. offshore and British North Sea fields.
The largest U.S. independent oil producer said on Wednesday it would sell its subsidiary that indirectly owns a 54% stake in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC), which has two oil fields and seven gas fields, and a 35% shareholding interest in Transasia Pipeline Company.
At the same time, ConocoPhillips said it was exercising its right to buy up to an additional 10% stake in Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) from Origin Energy for up to $1.645 billion, pre-empting an offer from private equity firm EIG Partners for that stake.
""The Asia Pacific region plays an important role in our diversification advantage as an independent E&P and these two transactions enhance that advantage by lowering our aggregate decline rate and diversifying our product mix,"" ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance said in a statement.
ConocoPhillips' subsidiary currently holds a 37.5% APLNG interest and would own as much as 47.5% upon the closing of the deal, expected in the first quarter of 2022.
The other partner in APLNG, China's Sinopec (NYSE:SHI), still has the right to match the offer for part of the 10% stake Origin is selling by Dec. 17, Origin said on Thursday.
ConocoPhillips' full-year 2020 production from APLNG was about 115,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). By comparison, the Indonesia assets it is selling produced about 50,000 boepd.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold said ConocoPhillips continues a ""proactive A&D (acquisitions and divestitures) strategy to streamline and high grade its global portfolio.""
He added that overall the update is a slight positive for the company but a fairly neutral event for the shares.

The company's shares were down 0.5% at $74.17.
MedcoEnergi said the Corridor PSC assets it is acquiring fit well with its Sumatra operations and would boost its oil and gas production to 155,000 boepd, up about 40% from its current production capacity.

Private equity firms and investment managers including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc, Brookfield Asset Management and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc have been building up their insurance arms in the last two years. 
They see an opportunity to use the capital from life insurance and annuities policies to invest in corporate credit, where the money managers can lock in spreads between their liabilities and their returns. Insurers are offloading the policies as they struggle to service them amid historically low interest rates. 
Money managers' interest in the space has been spurred on by Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO)'s success with Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) Ltd. The reinsurance platform, which Apollo is set to acquire in January in an $11 billion deal, will account for around 40% of Apollo's $481 billion of assets under management once combined. 
Toronto-based CPP Investments, which invests for retirement on behalf of 20 million Canadians, had been an early mover in this space.
It acquired Wilton Re, which takes over or reinsures life insurance and annuity portfolios from insurers, for $1.8 billion in 2014, and Ascot Group, the former Lloyd's of London property and casualty insurance business of American International Group (NYSE:AIG), in 2016 for $1.1 billion.
It also bought credit businesses it could use to invest the insurance assets. It acquired Antares Capital, a lender to companies, from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) for $12 billion in 2015.
However, with competition ramping up, making it harder to acquire from insurers the life insurance and annuity policies which CPP Investments needs to use to earn the spreads on credit products, it has decided to exit its insurance businesses, the sources said.

Norwalk, Connecticut-based Wilton Re is the holding company for a number of insurance and reinsurance entities, including Wilton Reassurance Company, Texas Life Insurance Company and Wilco Life Insurance Company.
Ascot Group provides global insurance and reinsurance products through its Lloyd's operations, as well as its platform in Bermuda. It has U.S. operations under the Ascot U.S. and Ethos brands, according to its website.

Sydney Airport last month agreed to be bought out by Sydney Aviation Alliance (SAA), comprising IFM Investors, QSuper, AustralianSuper and U.S.-based Global Infrastructure Partners.
An assessment of cross-ownership between Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide airports found limited competition, making it unlikely for any one consortium member to gain control of an airport, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Thursday.
The deal was unlikely to lessen competition as a result, the ACCC said. It also did not demand IFM divest its stakes in Australian airports.
IFM has stakes in nine airports across the country, including a more than 25% share in Melbourne and a 20% interest in Brisbane.

In a separate statement, Sydney Airport noted the ACCC's statement and said the deal was also approved by the European Commission. It still needs a go-ahead from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board and the company's shareholders.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) must again face a class action by shareholders who said they lost $13 billion because the Wall Street bank hid conflicts of interest when creating risky subprime securities before the 2008 financial crisis, a judge ruled on Wednesday.
U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty in Manhattan rejected Goldman's claim that its general statements about its business, including that client interests ""always come first"" and ""integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business,"" were too generic to mislead investors and affect its stock price.
Shareholders accused Goldman of concealing its packaging and selling of collateralized debt obligations it wanted to fail so favored clients like hedge fund billionaire John Paulson could secretly bet against them. They said Goldman's stock price fell as the truth became known.
Goldman declined to comment. Darren Robbins, a lawyer for shareholders including the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, said they were ready to move the 11-year-old case to trial.
The case had gone to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in June said lower courts could use expert testimony and ""a good dose of common sense"" in deciding whether generic statements affected stock prices.
Applying that decision, Crotty said even Goldman's more generic statements could reinforce misconceptions about its practices, and that Goldman offered no evidence its stock price would have ""held fast"" had it disclosed its conflicts.
Noting Goldman's claim that dozens of blue-chip companies make similar statements, Crotty said he was ""hard pressed"" to understand why such statements would achieve ""such ubiquity"" if they had no effect on stock prices.
The judge said Goldman did not show it more likely than not that its alleged misstatements ""had no price impact whatsoever.""
In 1988, the Supreme Court said investors could rely on a presumption that all public information about a company was reflected in its stock price.

Goldman reached a $550 million settlement in 2010 resolving U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it concealed Paulson's role in creating the Abacus 2007-AC1 CDO, and that he made $1 billion betting against it.
The case is In re Goldman Sachs Group Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03461.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 cut intraday losses to close higher Wednesday, underpinned by positive vaccine news and a fresh record high in Apple as the iPhone maker neared an unprecedented $3 trillion valuation.
The S&P 500 rose 0.3% to close above 4,700 for the first since Nov. 24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.10%, or 35 points, the Nasdaq climbed 0.6%.  
Underlying investor sentiment on stocks continued to be supported by further positive news highlighting the efficiency of vaccines in protecting against the Omicron virus.
""I think [the recent rebound] is very much tied in with the better news on COVID-19 vaccines,"" Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management, told Investing.com in an interview on Wednesday. ""It's hard to dismiss the [positive vaccine] news because when the omicron news first appeared that really seemed to spook markets.""
 Pfizer  and BioNTech said Wednesday preliminary results showed their Covid-19 vaccine neutralizes the virus' Omicron variant after three doses. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) ended lower.
Pfizer also said it that would submit full results of its Covid-19 pill, Paxlovid, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the coming days, CNBC reported, citing the company's Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla.
Consumer staples, a defensive corner of the market, was the biggest decliner, paced by a decline in the Kroger (NYSE:KR), Brown Forman, and Kraft Heinz.
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) fell more than 3% after Guggenheim downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, citing margins pressures ahead.
""Kraft Heinz portfolio's lack of pricing power is getting more apparent as weeks pass, which, in our view, has a significant consequence in near term top and bottom line growth,"" Guggenheim said.
Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb) reported third-quarter results that fell short of expectations on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 2%.
Renewed optimism on the recovery, pushed cyclical stocks including financials and energy higher.
Financials, mostly banks, gave up some their gains from a day earlier despite rising Treasury yields, an ally of bank stocks.
 State Street  (NYSE:STT), Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) led financials to the downside.
The United States 10-Year yield rose above 1.5% for the first time in almost a week. But the recent move higher in the 10-year yield comes after a continued flattening in the yield curve, which signals that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to move aggressively on rate hikes to avoid a significant slowdown in the economy. 
""The clear signal from the bond market that we've seen recently is that there's going to be a limit as to how quickly and how high the Fed can go with regards to rate hikes,"" Heppenstall added. ""In a global negative interest rate world, if U.S. monetary policy gets too far out of line with other central banks that haven't started to move on the rate front that won't be good for U.S. economic growth.""
Strength in communication services, however, supported the broader market as social media stocks including Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) advanced.
Twitter's new chief executive talked up the prospect of improving the speed of execution at the company to support plans to double revenue by 2023.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, closed at record high for the second day in a row that took the giants' market cap to $2.87 trillion to close in on an unprecedented $3 trillion valuation. 
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), meanwhile, notched an agreement with Google to keep YouTube and YouTube TV on its platform, sending its shares more than 18% higher."

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Wednesday won a reprieve from having to make major changes to its lucrative App Store while it appeals an antitrust lawsuit brought by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games. 
In September, a U.S. judge ordered Apple to change its App Store rules, which ban developers from including links in buttons to outside payment systems rather than using Apple's own in-app payments that charge a commission on sales. The injunction was set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time on Thursday. 
But with just slightly more than 12 hours remaining before the deadline, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted Apple's request to pause the order.
The appeals court order means Apple will not have to make the changes while it pursues a potentially years-long appeal of the Epic Games decision, which was largely favorable to the iPhone maker aside from the order to allow buttons to outside payment methods. The lower court did not find that Apple violated any antitrust laws, but said the company broke California's unfair competition law by not allowing developers to tell consumers about alternative ways to pay for software.
""Apple has demonstrated, at minimum, that its appeal raises serious questions on the merits of the district court’s determination,"" the 9th Circuit Court wrote on Wednesday.
Apple said that ""our concern is that these changes would have created new privacy and security risks, and disrupted the user experience customers love about the App Store.""
Epic declined to comment on Wednesday.
Joel Mitnick, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and a former U.S. Federal Trade Commission trial lawyer, said the 9th Circuit's ruling gave few ""tea leaves to decipher"" about how the appeal will ultimately play out, but said the court is ""signaling a serious concern"" that the lower court found Apple violated California unfair competition laws but not federal antitrust laws. 

He said the 9th circuit cited a previous case that held that conduct that does not violate antitrust laws cannot be the basis for a finding of unfairness under competition laws.
Randal Picker, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said Wednesday's decision was ""clearly good news for Apple. Good news in the short run in that they don’t have to implement changes to the App Store right now, and a hint that Apple may win in the Ninth Circuit when the case is considered fully on the merits.""

The internal complaint alleged that DWS Group, Deutsche Bank's asset manager, overstated how much it used environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria to manage its assets, the report said.
Deutsche Bank had agreed in January to pay nearly $125 million to avoid U.S. prosecution on charges it engaged in foreign bribery schemes and manipulated precious metals markets.
At that time, the lender entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and a related civil settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing it to avoid being indicted.
However, if the authorities were to conclude Deutsche Bank had breached the agreement and if they pursued the bank, it could lose its earlier deal and could also face indictment and prosecution, the Journal report said.
Officials in the United States could also ask the German bank to pay an additional fine, according to the report.
The DOJ and Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the Journal report.
In October, a DOJ official outlined policy changes aimed at rooting out repeated corporate misconduct, signaling the agency will take a tougher stance on white collar crime under Democratic President Joe Biden. 

Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said that among other measures, the agency would review whether it was appropriate to enter into agreements to waive or defer prosecutions with companies that continue to break the law. 
Between 10% and 20% of all significant corporate criminal resolutions involve repeat offenders, Monaco said, adding that the Justice Department had notified two companies, without naming them, that they were in breach of such agreements.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A new socially focused fund from star stock picker Cathie Wood's ARK Invest rose 1.5% in its first day of trading Wednesday.
The ARK Transparency ETF, which the firm says will focus on the ""100 most transparent companies in the world,"" gained ground on the strength of top holdings including Maxlinear (NYSE:MXL) Inc and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. The gains came as the broad S&P 500 index rose 0.3% for the day. 
ARK Invest's new fund comes as its flagship ARK Innovation fund remains down 17% for the year to date. The $17.2 billion fund outperformed all other U.S. equity funds last year thanks in part to its bet on technology companies that rallied during the early stages of the pandemic, helping turn Woods into a household name among retail investors. 

The ARK Transparency fund's portfolio retains a technology focus, with seven out of its 10 largest holdings connected to the sector. Among its largest holdings outside of tech are retailer Buckle (NYSE:BKE) Inc and green energy firm Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) Corp.

The antibody cocktail, Evusheld, is only authorized for adults and adolescents who are not currently infected with the novel coronavirus and have not recently been exposed to an infected individual, the regulator said. 
The authorization for the therapy, made up of two monoclonal antibodies tixagevimab and cilgavimab, marks a significant step for AstraZeneca, whose widely used COVID-19 vaccine is yet to be approved by U.S. authorities. 
AstraZeneca last month had agreed to supply the U.S. government with 700,000 doses of Evusheld, which had earlier shown to cut the risk of people developing any COVID-19 symptoms by 77% in a late-stage trial. 
While vaccines rely on an intact immune system to develop targeted antibodies and infection-fighting cells, Evusheld contains lab-made antibodies designed to linger in the body for months to contain the virus in case of an infection.
AstraZeneca's therapy, given in two sequential injections, is designed to last several months to a year.
Although vaccines currently provide the best defense against COVID-19, certain immune compromised individuals or those who have a history of severe adverse reactions to a vaccine need an alternative prevention option, said Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. 

However, the FDA added that pre-exposure prevention with Evusheld is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. 
Monoclonal antibodies aim to stop COVID-19 from worsening during early, milder stages. Drugmakers such as Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) with partner Vir make similar therapies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chair of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday asked a regulator to investigate whether Meta Platforms' Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) misled its advertising customers and the public about the reach of its advertisements.
In a letter to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan seen by Reuters, Senator Maria Cantwell said ""evidence suggests that Facebook may have deceived its advertising customers about its brand safety and advertising metrics"" and ""may have engaged in deceptive practices.""
Meta and the FTC did not immediately comment.
Cantwell added that ""public information suggests that Facebook’s potential misrepresentations about brand safety and advertising metrics may be unfair, as well as deceptive.""
She said ""a thorough investigation by the Commission and other enforcement agencies is paramount, not only because Facebook and its executives may have violated federal law, but because members of the public and businesses are entitled to know the facts regarding Facebook’s conduct.""
Cantwell cited a 2020 Senate report that Facebook reportedly controlled approximately 74% of the social media market.
In October, Senator Richard Blumenthal said both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the FTC should investigate claims made by a Facebook whistleblower that the company knew its apps were harming the mental health of some young users.
The FTC has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook that urged a court to demand that the company sell two big subsidiaries.

The FTC's case against Facebook represents one of the biggest challenges the government has brought against a tech company in decades, and is being closely watched as Washington aims to tackle Big Tech's extensive market power. 
The FTC originally sued Facebook during the Trump administration, and its complaint was rejected by the court. It filed an amended complaint in August that Facebook has asked be tossed out.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global stock markets and Treasury yields edged higher on Wednesday as investors became less concerned about the Omicron coronavirus variant but sentiment cooled after the prior day's big rally in equities and crude oil prices.
Stocks closed lower across Europe but the three main U.S. indices closed up as drugmakers  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNtech said a three-shot course of their COVID-19 vaccine neutralized Omicron in a laboratory test.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose for a third straight day, climbing above 1.5% for the first time in a week, and gold prices were little changed as investors squared positions before Friday's release of U.S. consumer prices data. 
Investors are carefully watching the effectiveness of existing vaccines on Omicron along with its severity and how infectious it is, according to Jeremy Leung, portfolio manager at UBS Asset Management in London.
""We also need to consider the time needed to adapt the vaccine, which would determine whether there is further disruption to the recovery ahead,"" Leung said, adding that Omicron could exacerbate supply chain difficulties. 
""Rate expectations have fallen recently due to macro concerns and therefore caused growth versus value volatility along with general market volatility,"" Leung added.
MSCI's all-country world index rose 0.39% and the STOXX Europe 600 index fell 0.44%. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 came less than 0.1% from a record close. 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.10%, the S&P 500 gained 0.31% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.64%. Communication services and healthcare led the S&P sectors higher, with growth shares rising 0.58% and value little changed.
The dollar slipped against several major currencies as easing concerns about Omicron helped support riskier currencies, with the Australian dollar rising 0.83%, on pace to notch a third straight session of gains.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.38% to 95.906. The euro rose 0.74% to $1.1346 and the yen added 0.10% at $113.68. 
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 4.8 basis points to 1.528%.
Longer-term yields had fallen recently as investors were unsure what Omicron would mean for the economy, said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree.
""If Omicron does fade a bit in the headlines you will continue to see all Treasury yields rising as we move forward,"" Flanagan said.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note last week posted its biggest weekly drop since June 2020 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell took a more hawkish policy tone and Omicron concerns rattled markets. 
The U.S. central bank is scheduled to hold its final policy meeting of the year next week, when an increased pace of tapering its bond purchases is widely expected.
London's FTSE 100 and the British pound were knocked by reports that Britain could implement tougher COVID-19 measures as early as Thursday.
Brent crude, the international benchmark, steadied above $75 a barrel in choppy trade, taking a breather after strong gains earlier this week.
Brent crude futures rose $0.38 to settle at $75.82 a barrel, while U.S. crude settled up $0.31 to $72.36 a barrel.

U.S. gold futures settled mostly unchanged at $1,785.50 an ounce.
Shares in China's Evergrande Group hit a record low after a missed debt payment deadline put the developer at risk of becoming the country's biggest defaulter. Analysts said the news produced limited global market impact because it was already ""well-priced"" by the market.

Mason said the new rule, which banks must adopt by the first quarter, will likely increase  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s risk weighted assets by $60 to $65 billion and impact its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio by 50 to 60 basis points.
Speaking at an investor conference, Mason said the bank is taking steps to mitigate the impact of the rule and will resume its buybacks in the first quarter at ""levels close to"" those of the third quarter.
The new rule, known as the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk, is a complicated directive that sets out how banks should tally some of the risk-weighted assets against which they must hold capital. The higher the tally, the more capital the banks must hold.
The impact varies by bank and influences the return on capital that they report, a key profit measure.

In October,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said it expected the rule would add about $40 billion to its risk weighted assets, but Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) adopted the rule earlier and saw its RWA tally decrease.
For Citigroup, having to suspend buybacks, even briefly, to build capital, is painful because its stock is cheap and has recently been trading for less than its book value.

Then Avoid These 4 High-Beta Stocks,"Factors like high inflation, weak job growth reports, and surging COVID-19 cases have been fostering immense volatility in the markets of late, leading to concerns about a potential market correction in the near term. For investors seeking to hedge their portfolios against such market fluctuations, we think high-beta stocks MP Materials (MP),  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK), Canaan (CAN), and Altus Midstream (ALTM) are best avoided now. Let’s discuss these names.Impressive third-quarter corporate earnings, declining jobless claims, and rising consumer spending drove the markets to fresh highs in October. However, increasing concerns about high inflation, weak job growth reports for November, supply chain constraints, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy, and the discovery of the new COVID-19 omicron variant caused the major stock indexes to pull back last week.
Notably, the CBOE's volatility index has gained 14.7% over the past month, reflecting high market volatility. Though major benchmark indexes have rebounded lately, the aforementioned factors will likely keep the markets under pressure in the near term. High beta stocks tend to be highly correlated with the broader markets. Thus, these stocks typically witness tremendous fluctuations in a highly volatile market.

The transfer was allegedly carried out by SMCP's previous Chinese owner for the sum of 1 euro to an entity in the British Virgin Islands belonging to current SMCP board member Chenran Qiu, according to a statement issued Wednesday by Glas, a company representing SMCP shareholders.
Glas, which includes asset manager Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) and an affiliate of private equity firm Carlyle, said a commercial court in Britain had issued a worldwide freezing order to prevent the transfer of further SMCP shares. 
Glas obtained a 29% stake in SMCP and 25% of its voting rights following the default of bonds issued by European TopSoho, a unit of the French group’s Chinese shareholder, the conglomerate Shandong Ruyi.
TopSoho did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment on Glas's allegation.
Glas, which wants to sell its SMCP stake, has called for changes on the board, including the removal of Chenran Qiu and her father, board president Yafu Qiu.
SMCP said that, following a ruling by a Paris commercial court in favor of Glas, it would hold a shareholder meeting in January to vote on the proposed ouster of five board members. All are linked to Shandong Ruyi, according to SMCP's website. 
Shandong Ruyi harbored ambitions of creating a luxury clothing empire and in 2015 embarked on a buying spree that, as well as SMCP - bought from private equity firm KKR in 2016 - included London-based suitmaker Aquascutum and Paris-based fashion house Cerruti 1881.

But it has struggled under the weight of its debts and its financial difficulties worsened with the COVID-19 pandemic.
SMCP, meanwhile, has seen a recovery, with third quarter revenues back close to pre-pandemic levels.

Investing.com —  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares have fallen after hours on the back of its third quarter earnings, which saw it miss on EPS expectations but report higher than anticipated revenue.
The video game retailer announced a loss per share of $1.39 on revenue of $1.297 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated a per-share loss of 52 cents on revenue of $1.19 billion.
GameStop shares have reacted negatively to the report, currently down 3%.
The company's increase in sales was attributed to new and expanded brand relationships, such as Samsung (KS:005930), LG, Razer, Vizio and others, contributing to GME's growth in the quarter.
GameStop said its inventory was $1.141 billion at the close of the quarter, compared to $861 million at the close of the third quarter of 2020. This reflected the company's focus on ""front-loading investments in inventory to meet increased customer demand and mitigate supply chain issues."""

Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) fell more than 3% after Guggenheim downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, citing margins pressures ahead.
""Kraft Heinz portfolio's lack of pricing power is getting more apparent as weeks pass, which, in our view, has a significant consequence in near term top and bottom line growth,"" Guggenheim said.
Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb) reported third-quarter results that fell short of expectations on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 2%.
Renewed optimism on the recovery, pushed cyclical stocks including financials and energy higher.
Financials, mostly banks, gave up some their gains from a day earlier despite rising Treasury yields, an ally of bank stocks.
 State Street  (NYSE:STT), Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) led financials to the downside.
The United States 10-Year yield rose above 1.5% for the first time in almost a week as investors continued to price in a step in the pace of Federal Reserve's monetary policy tightening.
Strength in communication services, however, supported the broader market as social media stocks including Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) advanced.

Then Buy These 2 Travel Services Stocks,"Early studies of the COVID-19 omicron variant suggest that the new strain could be less severe than earlier strains. Furthermore, vaccine producers  Pfizer  and BioNTech have given assurances that three doses of their vaccine will “neutralize” the variant. And, in response to omicron's surge, the U.S. government has imposed stricter testing requirements rather than international travel bans. Thus, we think travel services stocks Travel + Leisure (TNL) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), which have gained significantly over the past few days, could soar higher in price in the near term. Read on.Nations worldwide are once again dealing with the COVID-19 induced uncertainty as the newly identified omicron variant threatens global public health and the economic recovery. However, early data about the variant coming from South Africa indicate that it may cause less severe symptoms. In addition, preliminary lab studies of the Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)/ BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) vaccine shows that three doses of the vaccine would neutralize its threat.
The new variant has compelled some governments to re-impose travel restrictions. But rather than banning international travel, the U.S. government has decided to impose stricter testing requirements for travelers. Furthermore, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) has predicted that the U.S.’ travel and tourism sector could grow by 35.6% year-over-year in 2021, with promising prospects for the coming year.
Given this backdrop, we think it might be reasonable to bet on travel services stocks Travel + Leisure Co. (TNL) and TripAdvisor, Inc. (TRIP), given their fundamental strength.

The company also owns and operates Golf Galaxy, Field & Stream, and other specialty concept stores, e-commerce websites, and GameChanger, a youth sports mobile app. As of May 1, 2021, it operated 730 company-owned stores. In comparison, SPWH in Midvale, Utah, offers a broad range of products, including clothing, camping, fishing, footwear, hunting and shooting, boating, optics, electronics, and other accessories. In addition, the company’s stores provide archery technician services, fishing-reel line winding, gun bore sighting and scope mounting, cleaning services, and issuing hunting and fishing licenses. As of March 31, 2021, the company operated through 112 stores in 27 states.
Despite a travel ban and social distancing restrictions, the sporting goods industry was resilient during the pandemic because people focused on playing individual sports and home workouts. However, increasing vaccination rates and the lifting of travel restrictions have resulted in the rescheduling of big sports tournaments and other outdoor activities this year. As a result, brick-and-mortar store sales and e-commerce sales witnessed huge growth in the first half of this year. The global sporting goods market is expected to grow at a 3.2% CAGR and reach $62.84 billion by 2027. So, both DKS and SPWH should benefit.
But while SPWH’s stock has lost 28.5% in price over the past six months, DKS has surged 11.8%. DKS is a clear winner with 93.6% gains versus SPWH’s negative returns in terms of their year-to-date performance. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let us find out.

Investing.com -- Stocks traded mostly flat on Wednesday after a surge at the beginning of the week as new restrictions in Europe to slow the spread of Omicron clashed with news the variant might be less severe than feared.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) said their vaccine appears to be effective against Omicron after three doses, and they said they could upgrade the vaccine by March 2022 if needed.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told people to work from home starting Monday and adhere to masking and vaccine passport rules for crowded spaces. Denmark limited operating hours for bars and restaurants and closed schools for the holidays early.
Despite that, travel stocks rebounded on Wednesday.
Investors have spent the last week trying to decide whether the new variant was worrisome enough to end the recent rally that has lifted the indexes to new highs, especially now that central banks are trying to back away from the extra stimulus they used to keep economies afloat during the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said governments should urgently reassess their national responses to Covid-19 and accelerate their vaccination programs to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, Reuters reported.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Broadcom earnings
Amid an ongoing chip shortage, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)is expected to report fourth-quarter profit per share of $7.74 on revenue of $7.35 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co said on Wednesday it was expecting to be profitable in the fourth quarter on the back of stronger travel demand and fares.
It had previously forecast a loss for the quarter due to mounting costs.
The Texas-based carrier also said it expects to be ""solidly"" profitable next year and is trying to ensure adequate staffing as well as restore operational reliability.
Southwest's upbeat outlook comes at a time when the airline industry is grappling with the uncertainty caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant. The flurry of new testing rules and border closings has raised concerns ahead of the important Christmas travel season.
The airline said it has yet to feel the new coronavirus variant's impact as leisure bookings for December travel are topping its expectations. Bookings in the January quarter are also in line with the company's estimates, Southwest added.
Chief Financial Officer Tammy Romo, however, warned that any material impact of the Omicron variant could upset the company's projections.
""Any number of external factors may change and impact this plan,"" she told investors. ""But we were cautious in our assumptions about travel demand.""
The company's shares were trading up 0.8% at $45.56.
Southwest, which has had to cancel flights en masse partly due to staff shortages, said its efforts to hire 5,000 employees this year are ""going well."" The company also plans to add at least 8,000 employees to its workforce next year.
But the carrier said a tight labor market will likely not only pose hiring challenges, but also inflate its costs.

The staffing crunch has forced the company to trim capacity in the quarter through January. In 2022, the carrier expects capacity to be in the range of down 3% to up 2% compared with 2019.
Southwest expects revenue in the quarter through December to recover to at least 90% of the 2019 levels. It refrained from providing any estimates for first-quarter revenue, citing the uncertainty caused by the new COVID-19 variant.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2021 03:02PM ET</span>",Robotaxi race opens up as top contender Waymo in low gear in Arizona,"By Paresh Dave and Hyunjoo Jin
CHANDLER, Ariz. (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo risks losing its lead in the U.S. race to prove robotaxis are a viable business as it sticks to a limited service and rivals backed by automakers near their own launches. 
Companies including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's Argo AI and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Cruise are competing for the billions of dollars in financing needed to automate driving through artificial intelligence software and expensive sensors.
Waymo has led the field. In the first and only fully driverless taxi service in the country, Waymo has driven thousands of people since opening a year ago east of Phoenix to anyone who downloads its ride-hailing app. And since August, hundreds in San Francisco have trialed cabs with safety drivers aboard. 
But Waymo lacks investment from a major automaker, which analysts say could hamper efforts to grow its fleet. 
Plans Waymo touted in 2018 to buy up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans and 20,000 Jaguar I-Pace SUVs have not materialized. A big order for cameras to give eyes to its vehicles was scaled back, a person familiar with the matter said. Partnership talks in the past with automaker Hyundai Motor Co also fell through, another source said.
Waymo's ride-hailing service in Arizona has not expanded beyond suburbs. It inquired about permitting for Phoenix airport rides in 2018 but has not pursued the process or approached San Francisco's airport at all, according to government records obtained by Reuters.
Waymo cars still have lessons to learn. Some mall drop-offs in Arizona seen by Reuters blocked access to disabled parking spots for minutes in what disability advocates described as a potential legal violation.
Raj Rajkumar, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, said high staffing costs also could contribute to Waymo's slow expansion. Riders in Arizona told Reuters that support crews in person or monitoring remotely have had to re-direct vehicles paralyzed by, among other sights, freight pallets, an errant stop sign and road-paving gear. 
Waymo has a different view. 
Partnerships with several automakers from around the world, rather than investment from just one, serve what it describes as unparalleled ambitions across trucking, grocery delivery and more. Waymo said it has met all production goals, introduced hundreds of I-Pace crossovers.
""It would make little sense to place a bet on an individual OEM (equipment maker) - that would increase our risk and give us fewer future paths to market,"" the company said. ""The future of autonomy is about much more than ride-hail services.""
At the Reuters Next conference last week, Waymo Co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said the company was in ""a robust phase of not only developing the technology but also developing commercial opportunities.""
""There's a lot that goes into doing this the first time,"" she said. ""Then you build a playbook and it's just much easier to replicate it in future cities.""
Waymo recently began testing in central Phoenix, though without riders. It said personnel costs are not a determining factor in plans, and its system tries to avoid pulling over in disabled parking spots. 
Cruise aims to be permitted next year for a middle-of-the-night, driverless offering in San Francisco, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk continues to promise fully self-driving cars. Argo says it will partner with  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) to open robotaxis in Miami before the new year - with a safety driver present. 
All the companies have missed targets or downsized plans, but some observers see a shift in Waymo's standing.
""Waymo is playing catch-up now,"" said Grayson Brulte, president at autonomous mobility consultancy Brulte & Co. 
WAYMO VS TESLA
Born in 2009 as a project inside Google, Waymo has raised $5.75 billion in funding since 2020. 
Some analysts viewed the resignations this year of former CEO John Krafcik and other executives as a sign of Alphabet management's disappointment in slow progress, a charge Waymo denies. Krafcik remains an advisor.
Waymo's strategy prioritizes safety and incorporating feedback. It has avoided a major accident, a testament to its caution. 
Hang Zhao, assistant professor at Tsinghua University and a former Waymo scientist, said that though it requires more engineers, Waymo has taken a safe approach to solving AI problems, especially in contrast to Tesla's tactics.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. 
Swamy Kotagiri, chief executive of Waymo investor and auto industry supplier  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) Inc, told analysts in July that he anticipates ""a long road"" for fully autonomous cars, adding that even by 2030 only ""a small number"" would be produced.
Waymo's heady progress and optimism catalyzed the industry, with its then-chief Chris Urmson saying in 2015 that he expected his son to rely on autonomous vehicles in 2020. 
Urmson's new company Aurora, backed by big automakers, now targets 2024 to commercialize autonomous rides. But his earlier vision has come true, narrowly. In Chandler, the suburban hub of Waymo's commercial operation,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) engineer John Mitkowski is among residents commuting for work daily by driverless minivan. 
""Just get in, go,"" Mitkowski said of his 3-mile, $8 Waymo trip each way.
But he needs alternatives when flying or going to the nearby university or some favorite golf courses. His wife is too scared to ride in a robotaxi and his daughter, fresh out of university, opts for the convenience of her car.
Waymo's limited supply in Arizona has led to 30-minute waits this year, according to customer Jordan Ranous, who has turned to rideshare service Lyft, where dinnertime trips cost $4 more for pick-up 26 minutes sooner. 
The majority of people opening Waymo's app see waits under 10 minutes, and ridership is growing, the company said.

Mawakana, a half-year into her elevated role, said she has learned not to estimate timelines. She declined to predict when Waymo would drop safety drivers in San Francisco or might demonstrate profitability. 
""What we've learned is it's not as important,"" she said of forecasts.

(Reuters) -  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) agreed to pay $200 million to settle claims by New York that its Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit helped fuel an epidemic of opioid addiction in the state, shortly before jurors heard closing arguments from remaining defendant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd in a trial that has lasted more than five months.
New York Attorney General Letitia James announced the deal on Wednesday, saying more than $150 million would be used to remedy harms caused by opioid addiction. Allergan, which AbbVie acquired in 2020, said in a statement it was pleased to have reached the settlement.
James, along with New York's Nassau and Suffolk Counties, had been seeking to hold Teva and AbbVie liable for marketing practices that they said encouraged addiction. The settlement resolves the counties' claims against Allergan as well.
Harvey Bartle, a lawyer for Teva, told jurors in his closing argument that the state and counties had not presented any testimony supporting their claim that marketing by Teva or any of its affiliates improperly influenced doctors to prescribe opioids.
""The governments have not shown you a single prescription, let alone a considerable number, of our client's medicines in Nassau, Suffolk or New York that should not have been written,"" he said.
Bartle also said that the increase of opioid prescriptions in the 2000s was driven by changing medical standards, endorsed by government regulators, that emphasized treating pain more aggressively.
The state and counties are expected to present their closing arguments later this week or next.
The case is one of more than 3,300 filed by state, local and tribal governments across the country accusing drugmakers of minimizing the addictiveness of opioid pain medications, and distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that they were being diverted into illegal channels.
More than 100,000 people died from drug overdoses during the 12-month period ending April 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report in November, a record driven largely by opioids.

The three largest U.S. drug distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in July agreed to pay up to $26 billion to resolve the lawsuits against them.
A bankruptcy judge in September approved a settlement by OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, including about $4.5 billion from its wealthy Sackler family owners.

(Reuters) - Rohingya refugees from Myanmar are suing Meta Platforms Inc, formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), for $150 billion over allegations that the social media company did not take action against anti-Rohingya hate speech that contributed to violence.
A U.S. class-action complaint, filed in California on Monday by law firms Edelson PC and Fields PLLC, argues that the company's failures to police content and its platform's design contributed to real-world violence faced by the Rohingya community.
In a coordinated action, British lawyers also submitted a letter of notice to Facebook's London office.
A Meta spokesperson said in a statement: ""We're appalled by the crimes committed against the Rohingya people in Myanmar. We've built a dedicated team of Burmese speakers, banned the Tatmadaw (Myanmar military), disrupted networks manipulating public debate and taken action on harmful misinformation to help keep people safe. We've also invested in Burmese-language technology to reduce the prevalence of violating content.""
The company has previously said it was ""too slow to prevent misinformation and hate"" in Myanmar.
A Myanmar junta spokesman did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment on the legal action against Facebook.
In 2018, U.N. human rights investigators said the use of Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fueled the violence.
A Reuters investigation that year, cited in the U.S. complaint, found more than 1,000 examples of posts, comments and images attacking the Rohingya and other Muslims on Facebook. Almost all were in the main local language, Burmese.
The invective included posts calling the Rohingya or other Muslims dogs, maggots and rapists, suggested they be fed to pigs, and urged they be shot or exterminated.
The posts were tolerated in spite of Facebook rules that specifically prohibit attacking ethnic groups with ""violent or dehumanizing speech"" or comparing them to animals. 
Facebook has said it is protected from liability over content posted by users by a U.S. internet law known as Section 230, which holds that online platforms are not liable for content posted by third parties. The complaint says it seeks to apply Myanmar law to the claims if Section 230 is raised as a defense.
Although U.S. courts can apply foreign law to cases where the alleged harms and activity by companies took place in other countries, two legal experts interviewed by Reuters said they did not know of a successful precedent for foreign law being invoked in lawsuits against social media companies where Section 230 protections could apply.
Anupam Chander, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said that invoking Myanmar law wasn't ""inappropriate."" But he predicted that ""it's unlikely to be successful,"" saying that ""it would be odd for Congress to have foreclosed actions under U.S. law but permitted them to proceed under foreign law.""
More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar's Rakhine state in August 2017 after a military crackdown that refugees said included mass killings and rape. Rights groups documented killings of civilians and burning of villages.
Myanmar authorities say they were battling an insurgency and deny carrying out systematic atrocities.
The International Criminal Court has opened a case into the accusations of crimes in the region. In September, a U.S. federal judge ordered Facebook to release records of accounts connected to anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar that the social media giant had shut down.
The new class-action lawsuit references claims by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who leaked a cache of internal documents this year, that the company does not police abusive content in countries where such speech is likely to cause the most harm.
The complaint also cites recent media reports, including a Reuters report last month, that Myanmar's military was using fake social media accounts to engage in what is widely referred to in the military as ""information combat.""

Mohammed Taher, a refugee living in the camps in Bangladesh that are home to more than a million Rohingya, said Facebook had been widely used to spread anti-Rohingya propaganda.
""We welcome the move,"" he said by phone.

The COVID-19 shutdown last year and the subsequent chip shortage reduced vehicle inventories, but also resulted in strong profits for most companies. VW Group of America Chief Executive Scott Keogh is optimistic the industry can maintain those profits without returning to past bad practices.
    ""When the market springs back, it's not going to hold obviously exactly the way it is,"" he said in an interview. ""It will grow more competitive, but directionally the trend that started with the housing crisis, that carried through COVID and the chip shortage, will hold true.""
""There's probably no better industry at destroying margin value than the automotive industry,"" Keogh added. ""They get into these price wars and everything goes to seed. I lean more optimistic.""
    He thinks executives don't want to return to the days of high new-car inventories, massive retail discounting and flooding the rental market. 
    ""Granted, one rogue actor can certainly throw a wrench into the machine,"" Keogh said. ""Companies are looking at their factories and looking at their balance sheets and saying, 'We figured out a way to make it work'.""
VW brand new-vehicle sales in the United States were up more than 21% through November as the industry rebounded from the shutdown last year, but growth will be lower in 2022 at the more normalized rate as the chip shortage lasts at least through the third quarter, Keogh said.

He said the U.S. auto industry rebound will be more gradual, which will encourage carmakers to maintain their discipline on production and pricing. That being said, he does see the increase in new-vehicle prices moderating as chip production stabilizes and carmakers ease their focus on their highest-margin sellers. ""Pricing is not infinite,"" Keogh said.
Another factor that will force carmakers to maintain pricing discipline is the rollout of electric vehicles, where companies must drive down prices to attract buyers while at the same time maintaining a profit margin, he said.

(Reuters) -BioNTech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said on Wednesday a three-shot course of their COVID-19 vaccine was able to neutralise the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test, an early signal that booster shots could be key to protection against infection from the newly identified variant. 
The German and U.S. companies said two doses of their vaccine resulted in significantly lower neutralising antibodies but could still be protective against severe disease.
""The first line of defence, with two doses of vaccination, might be compromised and three doses of vaccination are required to restore protection,"" BioNTech Chief Medical Officer Ozlem Tuereci said at a press conference. 
The companies also said they could deliver an upgraded vaccine targeted specifically at the Omicron variant in March 2022 if one is needed.
BioNTech and Pfizer are the first manufacturers of a COVID vaccine to issue an official update on the efficacy of their shot against Omicron.
In samples of blood taken around a month after the third shot the Omicron variant was neutralised about as effectively as two doses neutralised the original virus identified in China.
The Omicron variant, first detected in southern Africa and Hong Kong last month, has triggered global alarm about another surge in infections. Cases have already been reported from Japan to the United States and across Europe.
""The new data from Pfizer on vaccine effectiveness against Omicron is encouraging,"" U.S. President Joe Biden tweeted on Wednesday. ""Anyone who is eligible and has not been boosted should go get a booster today.""
BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin suggested that countries might consider shortening the time period between second and third doses of the vaccine to combat the new variant.
He cited recent moves by countries including Britain to bring the third shot forward to three months after the second shot, from six months previously. 
""We believe this is the right way to go particularly if the Omicron is now spreading further, to enable a better level of protection in the winter season,"" Sahin said.
Dr. Walter Orenstein, a professor at Vanderbilt and former director of the U.S. CDC's immunization programs, said he found the data encouraging because it suggests that the current vaccines are still usable against the Omicron.
""We may not have to change the vaccine,"" he said. ""We may be able to get by with the current vaccine, at least for repression of severe disease.""
OMICRON-SPECIFIC VACCINE
The World Health Organization classified Omicron on Nov. 26 as a ""variant of concern"" but said there was no evidence to support the need for new vaccines specifically designed to tackle the variant and its mutations. 
Nevertheless, the companies said they would continue efforts to bring an Omicron-specific COVID-19 vaccine to market. Work started on Nov. 25.
They said their planned production of 4 billion doses of the Comirnaty vaccine in 2022 was not expected to change if an adapted vaccine was required. BioNTech said that even if an adapted vaccine was available in March, it would not be broadly available for some time, noting that perhaps 25 to 75 million doses of the new vaccine would be ready at first.
Pfizer scientist Kena Swanson said the company is considering also testing two doses of an Omicron-specific vaccine in currently unvaccinated people. 
Pfizer and BioNTech's findings are broadly in line with a preliminary study published by researchers at the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa on Tuesday, which said Omicron could partially evade protection from two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and suggested a third shot might help fend off infection.
Research on the new variant is still at an early stage. Laboratory (NYSE:LH) analysis at University Hospital Frankfurt in Germany found the ability to mount an antibody response to Omicron in people who had three shots was up to 37 times lower than the response to Delta.
Even so, two shots of the vaccine may still protect against severe disease, Pfizer and BioNTech said.
The vast majority of surface structures on the Omicron spike protein targeted by the T-cells, which typically emerge after vaccination, are not affected by Omicron's mutations, they said.
T-cells are the second pillar of an immune response, alongside antibodies, and are believed to prevent severe disease by attacking infected human cells.

For their analysis, the two companies used a virus that was bio-engineered to have the hallmark mutations of Omicron, known as a pseudovirus, and blood was collected from subjects three weeks after a second vaccine dose or one month after a third.
There is no significant data yet on how vaccines from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and other drugmakers hold up against the new variant but they are expected to release their own data within weeks.

59,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2021 01:52PM ET</span>",Analysis: Omicron is a wake-up call for COVID-19 vaccine developers,"By Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) - Arrival of the highly-mutated Omicron variant is a wake-up call to develop vaccines less susceptible to the rapid changes of the coronavirus, leading virologists and immunologists told Reuters.
Most first-generation COVID-19 vaccines target the spike protein on the outer surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus used to infect human cells. Omicron has prompted alarm among scientists because it has far more mutations than earlier variants, including more than 30 on its spike.
Research to determine the extent to which Omicron evades immunity from existing vaccines or prior infection is underway.
New data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine show some degree of reduced protection with the two-shot regimen.
Even if current shots remain effective for now, the dramatic evolution of the virus highlights the need for vaccines targeting parts of the virus less prone to mutate.
""One thing that is clear from Omicron is that the virus... is not going to go away,"" said Dr. Larry Corey, a virologist at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who is overseeing U.S. government-backed COVID-19 vaccine trials. ""There's a need for better vaccines.""
Since the beginning of the pandemic, the coronavirus has morphed several times including into the more transmissible, globally dominant Delta variant. Still, COVID-19 vaccines have largely maintained their ability to protect people against severe illness and death.
As rapid response tools, the current COVID-19 vaccines are ""outstanding,"" said Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an international coalition formed to prepare for infectious disease threats that has invested in many COVID-19 vaccines.
But more work - and money - is needed to manage the long-term risk. In March, CEPI called for $200 million in funding to develop vaccines that offer broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants, and other viruses in the same family such as MERS and SARS. ""We need to keep investing as a hedge against a future that we can't predict,"" Hatchett said.
World Health Organization chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Friday at the Reuters Next conference that next-generation vaccines are needed.
“We're working hard to support that research and development,"" Swaminathan said.
Most of the leading COVID-19 vaccines exclusively target parts of the spike protein that provoke strong immune responses, representing an early bet aimed at blocking infection.
The most dramatic of these are the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, which initially had 95% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19, far exceeding expectations. Their success has added billions in revenue and valuations for developers  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
An exception are COVID-19 vaccines produced in China by Sinovac Biotech and state-owned Sinopharm, which use an inactivated version of the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus, instead of singling out specific genes. Early studies suggested that antibody protection from those vaccines wanes rapidly, and protection may be limited in the elderly.
French biotech Valneva, whose vaccine uses an inactivated version of the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus, in October said its shot outperformed AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s, which targets the spike protein.
More recently, a British study showed Valneva's was the only shot out of seven that offered no immunity boost when given after two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.Valneva's vaccine is under review with the European Union's drug regulator.
For the immediate Omicron threat, most companies are working on new versions of their existing vaccines targeting the variant. AstraZeneca said it will soon have initial trial data on a vaccine focused on the Beta variant, which shares similarities with Omicron.
'A WORTHY EFFORT'
Several research groups and companies have started work on more broadly protective vaccines, such as those that target parts of the virus too essential for its survival to change. Experts caution it will likely take more than a year and generous funding to succeed.
""It's definitely a worthy effort,"" said Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine. ""It is not the answer for Omicron..., but it is potentially the answer for the next variant.""
Moderna is researching how to target parts of the coronavirus less prone to mutate. Such a vaccine would need large-scale clinical trials that take months to complete, company President Stephen Hoge said.
Moderna is working on an Omicron-specific version of its vaccine and considering one that could address up to four variants. 
""Realistically, I don't think those second-generation vaccine approaches are going to come to fruition in the next six to 12 months,"" Hoge said. 
CEPI is providing $4.3 million to MigVax Corp, an affiliate of Israel's Migal Galilee Research Institute, which is developing an oral vaccine, and up to $5 million to the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization. Both are in early development of potentially variant-proof vaccines.

CEPI is also investing up to $26 million to support work on a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine from Gritstone Bio aimed at fighting variants. Gritstone also has backing from the Gates Foundation and the U.S. government, with early-stage trials underway or soon to start.
Said Gritstone CEO Andrew Allen: ""It's just a little naive to think that the vaccines that we made in the first few hot minutes of the pandemic are the best vaccines that we can make.""

So, against this backdrop, we think it would be wise to bet on low-beta stocks Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), ResMed (RMD), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) (ERIC), and Canon (CAJ). We think they could provide stable returns in the current environment. Read on to learn more.Last week, the equity market experienced a roller-coaster ride due to fears about the rapidly spreading COVID-19 omicron variant, lower-than-expected November jobs data, and uncertainties over the timing of monetary policy tightening. The major benchmark indexes ended the week with losses of 1% or more.
Last week, the IMF suggested ways to address inflationary pressure and uncertainties around global economic prospects. And with a new coronavirus strain rapidly spreading across the country, analysts are concerned about the pace of domestic economic recovery. So, the situation might drive higher market volatility in the coming weeks.
Amid these rising uncertainties, building a portfolio of low-beta stocks is important because these securities will generate steady returns and protect against choppy market conditions. So, we think low beta stocks Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN), ResMed Inc. (RMD), Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ) (NASDAQ:ERIC), and Canon Inc.

Investing.com — Shares of Montreal-based electronic payments company Nuvei Corp (NASDAQ:NVEI) plunged 37% after Spruce Point Capital Management — an activist investment fund manager — issued a strong sell rating on the stock.
The short-seller outlined several reasons for the move, including fraud allegations from customers. It issued a report titled ""fool me once, twice, but not three times,"" stating it sees a 40% to 60% long-term downside risk.  
A Nuvei representative wasn't immediately available for comment.
The hedge fund said in a report: ""After conducting a forensic financial and accounting review, Spruce Point believes shares of Nuvei Corp. (TSX and Nasdaq: NVEI), a highly promoted payments processing technology company, has covered up a pattern of business failures, lack of organic growth, and a web of relationships with individuals connected to major Ponzi Schemes and alleged fraudulent activities.""
They added: ""Buyer beware: Nuvei's financial disclosures are weak and we believe results are being temporarily enhanced from concentrated exposure to high risk gaming and eCommerce.""
Other claims included declining North American organic growth. 
Since the release, Nuvei's shares fell to a low of $43.10.
However, Citron Research, which is no longer a short seller, said Nuvei shares were oversold, and it is buying the stock. In addition, Citron said there was ""no proof of fraud."""

(Reuters) - Farmers have asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate whether recent spikes in fertilizer prices are attributable to market manipulation by fertilizer companies, according to a letter sent Wednesday by the Family Farm Action Alliance.
The group, which has more than 6,000 farmer and rural members, alleges fertilizer companies are setting prices “not based on basic supply and demand, but rather on the price the farmer is paid for their commodity crops.”
Global fertilizer prices have reached record highs this year, in part due to soaring prices for the natural gas used to produce them, and severe storms in the United States that disrupted production. 
But the farm group alleges fertilizer firms could also be hiking prices in response to high commodity prices. 
Since the 1980s, consolidation in the U.S. fertilizer industry has shrunk the sector from 46 firms to 13. Two companies,  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) Ltd and Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS), control 93% of the North American potash market, according to a 2020 report by the Federal Trade Commission. Other dominant firms include Yara-USA and CF Industries (NYSE:CF).
""There’s a potential in the way this industry is structured to really exploit farmers,"" said Dr. Philip Howard, associate professor at Michigan State University and expert on food industry consolidation. 
Ben Pratt, senior vice president for public affairs at Mosaic, denied that fertilizer companies set prices and said the current spike is due to ""curtailed exports from certain nations, including China, and strong global demand, among many factors.""
The other three top fertilizer companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The DOJ also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Biden administration has pledged to take action on agriculture sector consolidation, which farmers have long said squeezes their profits. 

The DOJ recently investigated allegations of price-fixing by the largest poultry companies, leading to several indictments, and price manipulation in the cattle market. 
Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack recently said that his department would also look into seed patents.

BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - French waste and water management companies Veolia and Suez are set to secure EU antitrust approval for their 13 billion euro ($14.7 billion) tie-up, which will help them compete with Chinese rivals, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The deal, agreed in April, followed a months-long bitter spat which included a court clash and Suez setting up a foundation to ring-fence its French water business from Veolia, later abandoned after the two reached an agreement.
Veolia shares doubled gains after the Reuters story was published, and were up 1.2% in late trade. Suez shares also rose and were 0.3% higher.
To allay European Commission competition concerns, the companies will spin off Suez's French water and waste activities and some international assets into a new entity called ""New Suez"". 
New Suez, whose shareholders are Meridiam and Global Infrastructure Partners, state-backed Caisse des Depots and CNP Assurances, is now being reviewed by the EU competition enforcer as a simplified merger deal, meaning approval is very likely to be a foregone conclusion.
Additional remedies include the sale of some Veolia small industrial water treatment assets and mobile units to assist customers as well as Suez's assets in the field of industrial hazardous waste treatment, the sources said.
The Commission, which is scheduled to decide by Dec. 14, declined to comment.

The deal hit a hurdle in Britain on Tuesday after the country's antitrust watchdog warned of less competition and higher bills for regional authorities and gave the companies five days to offer remedies to address its concerns.
Still, the companies have already secured regulatory clearances in 14 out of 18 countries worldwide.

(Reuters) - YouTube and  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc announced on Wednesday a multi-year pact to end a battle that dragged for months over accusations of anti-competitive conduct and threatened to strip the internet's biggest video streaming service from tens of millions of TV devices.
""Roku and Google have agreed to a multi-year extension for both YouTube and YouTube TV,"" the companies said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""This agreement represents a positive development for our shared customers, making both YouTube and YouTube TV available for all streamers on the Roku platform.""
YouTube owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and streaming platform Roku had publicly feuded since April over technical and financial terms for distributing YouTube's flagship app and its YouTube TV service.
Roku had opposed what it described as unfair terms such as favoring YouTube in search results and updating its hardware. YouTube had described its efforts as consumer-friendly, and said Roku was the one using its market power to force a better deal.
Public fights over distribution agreements and splitting ad revenue have become common in the broadcast and streaming video fields.
Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its channel store after the agreement for that app expired. YouTube, which has more than 2 billion monthly users, threatened to pull its main app from Roku on Thursday, when the deal for the service was to end.

Major apps such as YouTube being built into devices such as Roku televisions and streaming media players are a major selling point for the hardware. And though its users could access the YouTube services in other ways, the multi-year agreement staves off a threat to Roku's business.
Roku said last month it has 56.4 million active accounts.

(Reuters) -European stocks ended a volatile session lower on Wednesday after marking their strongest two-day gain in more than a year, with tech and luxury stocks reversing strong gains as investors pitted vaccine reassurances against COVID-19 curbs. 
After jumping 3.8% over the past two days, the region-wide STOXX 600 index closed down 0.6%. 
While defensive buying kept it buoyed in morning trade, worries about the effectiveness of existing vaccines against the Omicron COVID-19 variant and possibilities of tougher restrictions this week in Britain weighed on sentiment.
The index got some respite when BioNTech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said a three-shot course of their COVID-19 vaccine was able to neutralise the Omicron variant in a laboratory test.
That lifted travel and leisure stocks, with online gambling company Evolution jumping 7.3%, cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CUK) adding 4% and holiday firm TUI rising 2%, even as it reported an annual operating loss of over 2 billion euros. 
U.S. investment bank JP Morgan predicted on Wednesday that 2022 will mark the end of the pandemic and see a full global economic recovery.
""European equities are in a sweet spot,"" said  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in a 2022 outlook note.
""European stocks offer attractive valuations relative to their U.S. counterparts... (and) currently boast the strongest earnings and growth expectations across developed markets.""

Recently, insurance company Lemonade (LMND) agreed to purchase MILE in an all-stock transaction, which is expected to bolster MILE’s overall performance. However, considering MILE’s weak bottom line and bleak profit margins, is the stock an ideal investment now? Read on.Data science-powered auto insurance company Metromile, Inc. (MILE) provides pay-per-mile car insurance services in the United States and internationally. The shares of the San Francisco-based concern have declined 80.7% in price over the past year and 84.2% year-to-date to close their last trading session at $2.46. The stock is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and just slightly above its 52-week low of $2.09, which it hit on December 6.
In November, artificial intelligence (AI) powered insurance company Lemonade, Inc.

According to the agreement, MILE shareholders will receive LMND common shares at a ratio of 19:1. The deal is expected to close during the second quarter of 2022. “Joining forces with Lemonade Car will create the most customer-centric, fair, and affordable car insurance, and is a great outcome for Metromile shareholders, who will benefit as shareholders of the combined company,” said Dan Preston, CEO of MILE.

However, based on its dividend growth history, the company is a popular holding among investors that are seeking stable returns and a hedge against market volatility. But the company’s trailing-12-months levered free cash flow was negative in its latest quarterly report. So, is VZ an ideal dividend stock to buy now? Let’s discuss.With a market capitalization of $213.20 billion, New York City-based  Verizon Communications  Inc. (NYSE:VZ) offers communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental entities worldwide. VZ shares have slumped 17% in price over the past year and 13.1% year-to-date to close its last trading session at $50.79. The stock is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving average and near its 52-week low, which it reached on December 1.
VZ’s $2.56 annual dividend yields 5.01% at the current share price. On December 2, the company declared a 64-cent quarterly dividend, the same as the previous quarter, payable on February 1, 2022. VZ’s dividend payouts have increased at a 2.1% CAGR over the past three years. The company has a record of eight consecutive years of dividend growth. “Our disciplined strategy and execution continue to create short- and long-term value for our shareholders,” said Hans Vestberg, VZ’s Chairman and CEO.
VZ recently announced the acquisition of TracFone Wireless, Inc. and TracFone’s family of brands, aiming to strengthen its wireless network. However, the acquisition led to a $3.13 billion cash payment along with 57,596,544 shares of Verizon stock. The deal also requires an additional $650 million cash consideration. Considering the company’s negative $24.47 billion trailing-12-months levered free cash flow, the acquisition, along with the company’s venture into C-Band spectrum for 5G wireless, could hamper its cash position. Furthermore, VZ reported declining cash flow from operating activities in its latest financial report.

LONDON (Reuters) -French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) on Wednesday received a blow for its popular Zoe electric model, as the European New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) gave it a zero-star safety rating in tests that are standards for Europe.
The carmaker, which is cutting costs and working to turn around its performance after overstretching itself over years of ambitious global expansion, also received a one-star rating for its lower-cost electric Dacia Spring model.
""Renault was once synonymous with safety,"" Euro NCAP secretary general Michiel van Ratingen said in a statement. ""But these disappointing results for the ZOE and the Dacia Spring show that safety has now become collateral damage in the group's transition to electric cars.""
Renault said in a statement the Zoe was a safe vehicle, which met all regulatory safety standards.
""These standards are constantly evolving and are becoming more and more strict in all areas, especially in terms of security,"" the company added. ""Renault is therefore continually improving its offer in order to comply with the regulations applicable where its vehicles are sold.""
The Euro NCAP ratings are not binding as it does not certify vehicles for road use. But European consumers do pay attention to Euro NCAP's tests and carmakers aggressively market good ratings.
This is only the third time Euro NCAP has given a car a zero-star rating and if it hurts sales of the Zoe it could pressure Renault into a swift upgrade or accelerate the launch of the next version of the car.
Euro NCAP said the latest Zoe had a worse seat-mounted side airbag than earlier versions. Euro NCAP noted the Renault Laguna had been the first car ever to receive a five-star rating in 2001. 
Renault did not address the airbag issue in its statement.
In the year through October, the Zoe was the third top-selling fully-electric car in Europe, behind Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model 3 in top place and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s ID.3.
The Dacia brand said the Spring goes above and beyond European safety regulations, but does not add advanced features that customers will not pay for.
In a press release titled ""Hero to Zero,"" UK insurance group Thatcham Research noted the Zoe had initially received a five-star rating back in 2013.
""It's a shame to see Renault threaten a safety pedigree built from the inception of the rating,"" said Matthew Avery, Thatcham's chief research strategy officer and a Euro NCAP board member.

Eleven cars received ratings in Euro NCAP's final round of tests for 2021, which did not include Tesla models. 
A number of other vehicles received five-star ratings, including BMW's electric iX, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s electric Mercedes-Benz EQS, Nissan (OTC:NSANY)'s Qashqai and Volkswagen's VW Caddy.

SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus is closing towards a possible breakthrough at Dutch airline KLM, potentially displacing Boeing (NYSE:BA) as its supplier of medium-haul jets, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The European planemaker has taken the lead in a bid to supply A321neo jets to the Dutch national carrier, beating rival Boeing's 737 MAX, the people said.
Boeing remains in contention to keep its spot as supplier to the group's low-cost carrier Transavia, the people said, asking not to be named. Talks on the widely watched pair of deals could go down to the wire, they cautioned.
Air France-KLM said it had made no decision on a tender announced earlier this year. Airbus and Boeing declined comment.
The Franco-Dutch airline launched a tender earlier this year to renew and expand the medium-haul Boeing 737 fleet at KLM and the French and Dutch operations of Transavia.
Chief Executive Ben Smith has said combined the deal could involve a firm purchase of 80 aircraft with options for another 60 to 80 in what would be the group's biggest single fleet transaction.
Analysts have previously said the competition is Boeing's to lose after a long association with KLM, but Smith stressed in September the group was talking to both major suppliers and holding parallel talks with engine makers.

Factors weighing in Airbus's favour in recent months have included a gradual thawing of relations between French and Dutch arms of the airline group, which have different suppliers, and tensions over recent Boeing 787 delays, the people said.
None of the companies agreed to comment on details of negotiations.

The company said its “goal is to be solidly profitable in 2022, including all quarters”. It said incremental benefit from its new Chase co-brand agreement is also helping its topline.
The company also revised its revenue guidance for October through December, and now expects operating revenue to be down 10% to 15% compared with the 2019 quarter, a pre-pandemic time. The previous guidance called for an erosion of 15% to 25%.
Southwest said leisure travel demand was strong for the Thanksgiving holiday. Based on current trends, leisure bookings continue to come in above expectations for December travel, and managed business revenue is expected to recover to down 55% to down 60% in December versus 2019 levels, the U.S.-focused carrier said.
After an initial scare owing to Omicron, people are mostly sticking to their travel plans, encouraged by governments resisting lockdowns. The airline, leisure and travel industry were among the hardest hit in the pandemic. But with a few billion people vaccinated and greater understanding of the treatment, people are now taking to travel.
Southwest also slightly lowered its fuel-cost forecast for the quarter to no more than $2.25 a gallon, down from the $2.25 to $2.35 range it guided earlier.

Shares of Apple were up 1.6% at $174. They need to trade at $182.85 to hit the mark and cap a strong rally that has been powered by investors betting on its brand and viewing it as a comparative safe haven.
The stock has jumped about 30% this year on top of an 80% surge in 2020. In comparison, the S&P 500 has risen 25% for the period. 
Its peers in the trillion-dollar club - Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) - have all gained between 10% and 70%.

When the video-game retailer holds its earnings call postmarket on Wednesday, the Reddit crowd will tune in hoping to get an update on its ongoing transformation from brick-and-mortar store into e-commerce giant. If Cohen himself gives the update, even better. But the GameStop chairman, who is also the co-founder of online pet supplies retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc., hasn’t been talking much. 
After announcing efforts to shake up operations and hire a new management team earlier this year, Cohen has provided scant detail on what lies ahead for GameStop. Other than a few cryptic tweets over the past few months, the last time Cohen addressed investors was during an appearance at the company’s annual meeting in June, when he said his team was “putting the right pieces in place.” Over the last three earnings calls, in March, June and September, the GameStop team took no questions.   
“The only thing that can matter is if Cohen reveals his strategy,” said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter who rates the stock as a sell. Still, Pachter said he doesn’t expect much of an update during the call since the company hasn’t scheduled a separate conversation with him, which it has done “every quarter of their existence” until this year.
A representative for GameStop didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Cohen will address investors after the release of quarterly results. The company is expected to report a third-quarter adjusted loss per share of 52 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, but Pachter said the earnings “don’t matter at all” at a time when the focus is on the strategy for the future.
Pachter is among the three Wall Street analysts who still have ratings on the stock, down from nine a year ago. Ascendiant Capital Markets’ Edward Woo also has a sell recommendation on GameStop, while Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Steph Wissink has a hold. Their average 12-month price target is $88. 
Will They or Won’t They?
Baird analyst Colin Sebastian, who suspended his rating in June, has raised the question of whether management would take any questions. In a Dec. 7 note titled “Will they or won’t they?” he wrote that he expects an upbeat tone in the release that will reflect healthy demand for key hardware platforms.
The Grapevine, Taxas-based GameStop is a poster child of the so-called meme stock phenomenon that has captivated Wall Street this year, but the lack of clarity on the turnaround strategy, combined with a broad selloff in risk assets, has weighed on GameStop shares. The stock is down 29% from the most recent high on Nov. 22. 
This year, though, bets on the company have paid off handsomely, with a 844% rally that far exceeds the 61% gain for a basket of 37 meme stocks tracked by Bloomberg. The stock was trading 1.6% lower to $175 on Wednesday morning in New York.

Investing.com –  Roku  stock (NASDAQ:ROKU) climbed 9% Wednesday as the company signed a multi-year pact to extend its partnership with YouTube.
“Effective today, we have agreed to a multi-year extension with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for YouTube and YouTube TV. This agreement represents a positive development for our shared customers, making both YouTube and YouTube TV available for all streamers on the Roku platform,” Roku tweeted.
The two companies had been dueling for several months now over accusations of anti-competitive conduct, and threatened to strip the biggest video streaming service from millions of TV devices.
Roku had called Alphabet-owned Google’s terms unfair and said they favored YouTube in search results. YouTube had described its efforts as consumer-friendly and accused Roku of misusing its market power to force a better deal.
Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its channel store after the agreement for that app expired. YouTube, with more than 2 billion monthly users, threatened to pull its main app from Roku on Thursday, when the deal for the service was to end, according to Reuters. Roku said last month it has over 56 million active accounts.
The conclusion of the deal is a relief for Roku and its stakeholders. While users can access apps on TVs through various devices, having popular apps like YouTube on its TVs and streaming devices is a major selling point for a platform company and a franchise like Roku.  "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Expressing concern about distraction-affected vehicle crashes, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Wednesday it is discussing with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc the electric carmaker's software update that lets users play video games on a touch screen mounted in front of the dashboard.
Tesla added the games in an over-the-air software update sent to most of its vehicles this summer, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.
""Distraction-affected crashes are a concern, particularly in vehicles equipped with an array of convenience technologies such as entertainment screens. We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer,"" NHTSA said in a statement provided to Reuters by email.
The agency said distracted driving accounts for a significant number of U.S. road deaths - 3,142 in 2019 alone. Safety advocates have said official figures underestimate the problem because not all distracted drivers admit the issue after crashes.
The Times said the Tesla update added three games - solitaire, a jet fighter and conquest strategy scenario - and said the company has a warning reading: ""Playing while the car is in motion is only for passengers."" The Times reported that a button asks for confirmation that the player is a passenger, though a driver could play simply by pressing the button.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In 2013, NHTSA issued guidelines to encourage automakers ""to factor safety and driver distraction prevention into their designs and adoption of infotainment devices in vehicles."" The guidelines ""recommend that in-vehicle devices be designed so that they cannot be used by the driver to perform inherently distracting secondary tasks while driving,"" the agency said.

NHTSA's guidelines ""specify a test method to evaluate whether a task interferes with driver attention, rendering it unsuitable for a driver to perform while driving.""
The agency in August opened a safety investigation into Tesla's driver-assistance system Autopilot after a series of crashes involving the system and parked emergency vehicles.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) will provide $250 million of low-cost, short-term loans over five years in the United States as part of an effort to boost diversity among its franchisees.
The Chicago-based company also said it will increase its franchisee recruiting and development efforts globally as it seeks to draw new operators from underrepresented backgrounds.
The burger chain has come under fire from current and former Black U.S. franchisees, who have filed lawsuits claiming they were steered to underperforming stores in low-income areas.
McDonald's has denied treating Black owners differently from other owners, and has repeatedly pledged its commitment to diversity and inclusion.
Last week, a U.S. judge threw out a $10 billion lawsuit by the media entrepreneur Byron Allen, who accused McDonald's of racial discrimination for not advertising with Black-owned media.
This year, the fast-food chain pledged to increase national ad spending with Black-owned media, tied executive bonuses to diversity goals, released workforce demographic details for the first time and launched an effort to increase diversity among its suppliers.
McDonald's and other companies laid out broad new diversity goals amid a national reckoning over race prompted by the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer.
McDonald's restaurants are so expensive to buy that people from disadvantaged backgrounds often struggle to access the capital they need to own one.

Normally, McDonald's requires franchisees to have at least $500,000 of liquid assets before they can even enter the applicant program. The total investment for a traditional location ranges from $1 million to just over $2.2 million.
People from historically underrepresented groups, including Asian, Black and Hispanic, made up nearly 30% of all U.S. franchisees in 2020, the company said. Women also comprised nearly 30% of franchisees.

Nevertheless, the company's shares have declined 20% in price over the past month because SPCE is struggling amid the rising competition in the industry. So, given SPCE's poor fundamentals and lofty valuation, is it worth betting on the stock at its current price level? Let's discuss.Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE) is an integrated aerospace company that focuses on spaceships and related technology for tourists and researchers. The Las Cruces, New Mexico-based company, rose to prominence after founder Richard Branson and a crew of five people flew to the edge of space on July 11 aboard SPCE's rocket plane.
However, despite the company's long-awaited accomplishment, SPCE’s share price has declined 55% over the past six months and 20% over the past month, closing yesterday's trading session at $15.62.
In addition, SPCE is currently trading at a premium valuation considering its poor growth prospects. In terms of its forward EV/Sales, the stock is currently trading at 822.41x, which is 41465.2% higher than the 1.98x industry average.

Investing.com -- A cluster of stocks were under pressure as speculation mounted that the U.K. government was poised to introduce stricter Covid restrictions to control the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.
Airline stocks were hit, with IAG's (LON:ICAG)’s share price falling 3.44% to €1.62 while shares of EasyJet (LON:EZJ) fell 3.75% as Prime Minister Boris Johnson mulled introducing a stronger “Plan B” to deal with the variant.
Rolls Royce (LON:RR), which is exposed to the air travel market through its engine maintenance division, was down 3.09% and ABF (LON:ABF), which owns the budget clothing retailer, Primark, fell 1.3%. Primark is more exposed to lockdowns than other fashion retailers because it does not have an online sales channel of its own.
Under the U.K. government’s Plan B, government messaging would be strengthened, there would be a return to working from home, and face masks would be mandated in various public settings. There is also a possibility that vaccine passports could be introduced, though the move faces stiff opposition from some members of Johnson’s cabinet.
An announcement is thought to be imminent. Johnson will chair a cabinet meeting later today."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will give customers more leeway on overdrafts before charging fees, giving up revenue in a bid to keep up with competitors and attract customers, it said on Wednesday.
Beginning next year it will give customers a full day to restore overdrawn balances and will allow them to tap funds from direct deposits of paychecks two days early, the bank said.
The moves, together with changes the bank initiated in August, will have a ""not insignificant"" impact on bank revenue, said Jenn Piepszak, co-CEO of the Chase segment of JPMorgan, who declined to be more specific in an interview.
JPMorgan's announcement comes after  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF) said last week that it will stop charging accounts for not having sufficient funds to cover drafts, a practice which has drawn scrutiny from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other Washington officials.
About 1% of JPMorgan's revenue has come from overdraft fees, according to estimates by analysts, who have been expecting more banks to reduce the charges because of pressure from competitors and public officials.
At the least, banks are revising their overdraft rules to try to look better.
""We believe this set of changes puts us in a leadership position competitively,"" Piepszak said.
JPMorgan will still charge for advancing funds on overdrawn transactions that exceed its limits as long as customers have agreed to pay for the service and the bank believes it will be repaid.
JPMorgan could eliminate all fees on all overdrafts but that would come with bouncing more checks written by clients, Piepszak said.
Capital One said it will cover overdrafts for free for those who show a pattern of steady deposits and who don't go overdrawn frequently.
Banks have found, Piepszak noted, that many customers knowingly choose to overdraw accounts and incur fees because doing so is better than, for example, being late to pay a bill with its own late fees, such as a utility bill. 

In August, JPMorgan began easing up on charges. The bank eliminated fees for bounced checks and it allowed customers to overdraw their accounts by $50 before charging to cover the transactions.
Before those changes, JPMorgan was covering about 90% of overdraft transactions it received and charging fees on about two-thirds of those. Now half are incurring fees, Piepszak said.

Investing.com –  SentinelOne  stock (NYSE:S) plummeted 13% Wednesday as the company reported a wider quarterly loss compared to a year ago owing to higher operating expenses and stock-based compensation to staff.
The adjusted loss in the third quarter was $40 million compared with $26 million a year ago, a reflection of higher headcount and increased operating costs as a result of being a listed entity.
In the past year, the company has grown its headcount to over 1,080 from about 600. Its operating expenses in the third quarter rose 135% year-on-year.  
The cybersecurity firm debuted on the NYSE on June 30 as the highest-valued cybersecurity IPO ever. Shares were issued at $35 apiece, carrying an implied valuation of around $9 billion.
Business for cybersecurity firms like SentinelOne, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) and Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has boomed as the world has moved to cloud computing, and both corporates and individuals are asking for digital solutions for almost every activity, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. With work-from-home an accepted reality for many now, demand for cybersecurity solutions has only increased, from both institutional and retail segments.
SentinelOne’s total revenue rose 128% to $56 million while annualized recurring revenue increased 131% to $237 million as of October 31, the company said.
That also allowed the company to raise its annual revenue forecast to $200 million from a high of $190 million guided in September.

LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s push to recruit big-rig contractors to haul goods across its web of warehouses is colliding with a trucker shortage as the e-commerce company moves what are expected to be record numbers of packages this holiday season.
Its project, called Amazon Freight Partners (AFP), enlists independent trucking companies to move goods between Amazon facilities. The companies, or AFPs, all of which are exclusive Amazon contractors, also move packages to and from the company's fleet of 85 owned or leased North American airplanes.
Since 2019, Amazon has recruited 250 AFPs around the globe, and made it possible for the companies ""to start and scale their own transportation businesses and create job opportunities for thousands of drivers,"" an Amazon spokeswoman said. This trucking network - separate from the army of home-delivery contractors that drop Amazon packages on shoppers' doorsteps - puts small AFPs in fierce competition for drivers against Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS). ""There's a shortage of drivers, especially the good drivers,"" said Ebony McKinley, owner of family-run Seven Strong Trucking. The Phoenix-area firm was among the first to join the AFP program in April 2020. It now has 20 Amazon-branded semi-truck tractors as part of AFP and employs 45 drivers. 
Amazon's logistics unit has bought 1,395 Amazon-branded big-rig tractors to pull trailers of goods in the United States, according to Department of Transportation data seen by Reuters. Filling seats in those vehicles falls largely to independent contractors like McKinley at a time when the industry has a record shortfall of 80,000 big-rig drivers. ""Everybody's feeling the heat,"" she said.
Labor woes are particularly acute for big-rig trucking firms because their drivers need more credentials: Government agencies require them to have commercial drivers' licenses, and insurers increasingly demand two years' experience. Skilled drivers can hop to a new job with better compensation amid record demand for consumer goods. 
Seattle-based Amazon in October said that higher wages, more worker incentives and inflation in services such as trucking contributed to $2 billion in extra expenses in the prior quarter. Amazon expects those costs to for the current holiday quarter, threatening to erase profit in its biggest selling period. 
Truckers' pay has not kept pace with inflation, leaving ""real"" earnings at 70% of what they were in the 1970s, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Federal limits on daily working hours, the COVID-19 pandemic and other hurdles prompted many truck drivers to quit.
At Seven Strong, new drivers start at $22 an hour. Perks include a $1,500 hiring bonus and overtime pay. Base pay is roughly in line with the median wage for all U.S. truck drivers, which is $47,130 per year, or $22.66 per hour, according to BLS. Owner McKinley said that payments from Amazon cover driver compensation. 
RECRUIT, RETAIN
AFPs across the United States advertise pay of $18-$27 per hour before benefits, with many nights at home, according to a Reuters review of dozens of help-wanted postings on Indeed, ZipRecruiter and other online sites. Signing bonuses ranged from $1,000 to $2,000, according to the postings.
Amazon told Reuters it recommends a minimum contractual wage for AFP drivers, but it also encourages contractors to pay above that to find and retain talent. 
If Amazon were to dictate trucker wages, it could run afoul of rules for independent contractors at a time when some states want such workers classified as employees, legal and trucking experts said. 
Two current AFPs, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, told Reuters the work is steady and predictable - although they said other, less-experienced operators could be overwhelmed with overtime and unexpected expenses.
While stability and reliability offered by established trucking employers like Walmart or UPS may appeal to older, experienced drivers, small trucking company owners may be lured by opportunities to grow with Amazon.
""Hitching your wagon to the Amazon train - that's hard to turn down,"" said Page Siplon, chief executive of TeamOne Logistics, a third-party logistics firm with 700 drivers in 43 states that does not work with Amazon.
COMPETITION HEATS UP
Amazon forecast fourth-quarter net sales of $130 billion-$140 billion, up 4-12%, which could translate into a jump in the number of packages it handles. This year, that could mean it handles 32 million packages in the United States on a peak day, said Marc Wulfraat, president of consultancy firm MWPVL International.
Amazon's former shipping partner FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) also reported a quarterly profit hit from unexpected costs - primarily from its Ground delivery unit that depends on contract drivers. 
Trucker employers UPS and Walmart were not immune to the pressure, but did not report the same level of cost woes. 
UPS, which counts Amazon as its top customer, spent more on its well-paid unionized workforce that appears to be providing profit-sheltering labor stability.

Walmart, which has more than 11,000 big-rig drivers on its payroll, said higher supply-chain costs reduced its U.S. gross profit rate by 12 basis points in the latest quarter. 
Walmart is hiking pay and sweetening bonuses for its decades-old in-house trucking operation that uses 8,400 owned and leased tractors to move goods for its more than 5,300 U.S. Walmart and Sam's Club stores. Walmart - which employs mostly long-haul truckers - advertises immediate truck driver jobs with starting salaries of $87,500, not including signing bonuses of $8,000 or $12,000. Peak season bonuses for working an extra day sometimes jump to $250 a day from $150, a Walmart spokesperson said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Wednesday, the relief rally of recent days stalling as  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech acknowledged that most people will need a third shot of their vaccine to protect themselves against the fast-spreading Omicron variant of Covid-19.
The market was arguably due a breather after a riotous rally in the last couple of days, driven by relief at reports that the new variant, while more transmissible than Delta, appears to cause a milder form of sickness. By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 17 points, or less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up by comparable amounts.
Pfizer and BioNTech said earlier that only a third dose of its vaccine will generate the same degree of protection against Omicron as is currently enjoyed by those who have been jabbed twice. There is, naturally, no evidence yet on how long a third dose will stay effective. Previous studies - and the recent rise in case rates across the Northern hemisphere - have shown that the effectiveness of the double-jabbing regime wanes after around five months. 
Pfizer stock fell 1.0% in early trading, while BioNTech stock fell 2.4%.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock also fell 2.5%
Data about the Omicron variant is still being accumulated. Evidence from South Africa, where it was first detected, suggests that the disease is 'almost certainly' not more likely to cause acute illness than the previously dominant Delta variant, Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, said on Wednesday. However, the speed of its spread - infections have risen more than 40-fold in South Africa since it was first detected - suggests that it still has the potential to put pressure on public health systems and consequently generate fresh restrictions on economic and social life. 
Earlier, the Labor Department's monthly survey of job openings and labor turnover saw vacancies rocket to within a whisker of August's record high, while last month's number was also revised significantly higher. The data illustrate a nationwide labor shortage that is also driving a number of high-profile company level disputes. Unions at cereal-maker Kellogg have rejected a new offer by management, which is looking to replace 1,400 staff who have walked off the job. Kellogg (NYSE:K) stock was up 0.1%.
Elsewhere,  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock surged 9.4% after striking a peace deal with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube that will keep the latter's content on Roku's streaming devices. One of the biggest winners of the pandemic due to the accelerated spread of streaming, Roku stock has fallen more than 50% from its July peak and hit a 14-month low at the end of November. "

Shares of U.S. airlines - including Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co - rose between 0.95% and 2.26% in premarket trading.
Their shares were also helped by Southwest's forecast of posting a profit in the fourth quarter as opposed to its earlier projections of a loss on a rebound in travel across the United States and higher fares.
Hotel chains Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) Corp, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc, and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) Inc were up between 0.30% and 1.17%, while travel booking websites  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group Inc and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) Inc rose more than 2% each.

""Just because the variant is more vaccine resistant doesn't mean vaccines are now useless. That is building a more positive picture than what we were facing last Friday,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.

So, let’s discuss these names.The homebuilder industry has grown significantly amid a solid housing market as the demand for new homes remains high. With mortgage rates falling to record lows, homebuyers can secure homes at a lower cost.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Omicron-fuelled market swings appear to have made November the worst month for global hedge fund performance since the virus first shut down economies at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hedge funds are down an estimated 1.6% to 2% in November, according to early data from industry research firm PivotalPath, their worst monthly performance since March 2020. 
The potential losses are a setback in what has so far been a steady year for performance. The average hedge fund is up 11.4% in the first 10 months of 2021, data from HedgeFund Research (HFR) showed. That compares to 11.8% last year and 10.5% in 2019.
The losses are “quite widespread"", said Robert Sears, chief investment officer of London-based Capital Generation Partners, which invests in hedge funds. ""A few of our managers got a little bit of positive performance but I think, in aggregate, it's going to be down."" 
The S&P 500 fell 3.9% from its record high in November as Omicron worries hit stocks in the month’s final days, and notched a nearly 1% loss for the month as a whole. Some areas of the market, however, were harder hit, with the S&P’s energy sector losing 6.2% last month and financials losing 5.9%. 
November also saw volatility rise across asset classes, with uncertainty over Federal Reserve monetary policy driving swings in bond and currency markets, as well as stocks.
The market swings wrongfooted some equity-focused funds, which were hit by losses in bearish bets against stocks that unexpectedly rebounded. 
Jean Baptiste Berthon, senior strategist at Paris-based Lyxor Asset Management, which invests in hedge funds, said European and U.S. long-short strategies lost around 1.5% to 2% between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1. 
Shares of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), for example, which Sears said some hedge funds had bet against, jumped 30% between Nov. 18 and Nov. 30. Prior to Nov. 18, short interest in Moderna amounted to 14.4 million shares, or 4.1% of the float, according to data from S3 Partners. 
Computer-driven trend-following hedge funds, meanwhile, suffered a ""significant"" performance drop of 4% to 5% between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, with losses in fixed income, commodities and equities, creating a ""perfect storm"", said Berthon. 
So-called 'macro' hedge funds, which bet on macroeconomic trends, lost closer to 2%, mainly from bond positioning, while merger-arbitrage funds, which make calls on deals, were marginally up, he added. 

Some hedge funds are likely to pull back on risk this month, in an effort to preserve returns in what has for many been a solid year, Berthon said. 
""We're now three weeks before the end of the year, so it's unlikely we'll see funds trying to be heroes and trying to re-instate major play to capture the rebound,"" he said.

Investing.com –  Toll Brothers  stock (NYSE:TOL) rose nearly 2% in premarket trading Wednesday as the luxury home builder continued to ride the housing boom in the fourth quarter to deliver solid earnings while guiding for strong growth in the current year and going into 2023.
After the start of trading, the shares were up 0.2%.
The company reaped the benefits of a roaring equity market as wealthy buyers liquidated part of their stocks to enjoy some luxury properties while also diversifying their investments.
As a result, it also improved its margins and closed October with a record backlog value of $9.5 billion, up 49% year-on-year. The number of homes in its backlog were 10,302, up 32%.
The average price of homes in that backlog was $922,100, up around 13% from $818,200 a year earlier.
Purchase contracts during the quarter were down 13% from a year earlier to 2,957 units. Contracted value was up though, by 10% at $3 billion.
“We, like the rest of the industry, continue to be challenged by significant supply chain and labor constraints that are extending delivery times for our homes. Notwithstanding these issues, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future, we project 20% revenue growth in FY 2022,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Douglas C. Yearley, Jr, said in a statement.
Home sales revenue rose just over 21% in the financial year that ended October 31. It rose 18% during the fourth quarter to $2.95 billion.
Adjusted profit per share nearly doubled to $3.02.
The company increased its community count by 7% to 340 by the end of the financial year. It projects 10% growth in the count in the current year and said it owns or controls enough land for additional meaningful growth in the next financial year as well.
According to Yearley, peak lumber prices from the spring of 2020 should flow through its first half deliveries.

Campbell, which like its peers Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) has raised product prices over the year to offset cost inflation, said the benefit from higher prices will materialize only at the end of the current quarter. 
The Prego pasta sauces maker, which reaffirmed its full-year sales and profit forecast, said it expects core inflation in high-single-digits for the year and it will have ""a more pronounced impact"" in the second half.
Campbell, however, added that some of the supply pressures were easing and forecast current-quarter sales to rise sequentially.
Shares of Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell, which have fallen about 15% this year, were flat in premarket trade.

Excluding one-time items, the Cape Cod potato chips maker earned 89 cents per share in the first quarter ended Oct. 31, beating analysts' estimates of 81 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
However, net sales declined 4.4% to $2.24 billion, below estimates of $2.28 billion, as at-home dining trends waned with consumers heading out to restaurants after COVID-19 curbs eased.

Investing.com -- SSP Group (LON:SSPG) stock defied another heavy full-year loss and fresh bad news from the U.K. economy to grind out a 1.7% gain by mid-session in London Wednesday.
The company, which operates a portfolio of food and drink outlets principally at rail and airport hubs, posted a 42% revenue drop in the year through September, against a backdrop of volatility and disruption in the Covid-hit travel sector. 
SSP said the emergence of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 hadn't changed its medium-term assumptions, which foresee a slow return to pre-pandemic conditions. It expects comparable sales and margins to return to 2019 levels only in 2024. 
Revenue increased from 21% of 2019 levels at the end of the first half of the year to 53% of 2019 by the end of the second half. It's been running at 66% of 2019 levels in the nine weeks since the start of the new fiscal year, at a time when 72% of its units have been open.
The group's operating loss narrowed marginally to 309 million pounds in the year to September, thanks to a recovery in the second half driven by a rebound in domestic and short-haul leisure traffic.
The group, which recently announced that Patrick Coveney would take over as group chief executive in March 2022, reopened around 800 units since the beginning of June 2021 as demand has bounced back.
SSP expects to open another 200 units by 2024, expanding its network by 15%. It recently announced a new joint venture with Aeroports de Paris (PA:ADP) to run outlets at Paris' Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, and is also expanding in Thailand and Malaysia."

(Reuters) -  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V), the world's largest payment processor, launched a global crypto advisory service for its banking clients and merchants on Wednesday, as the adoption of digital currencies gains steam.
The move is aimed at financial institutions eager to attract or retain customers with crypto offerings, retailers looking to delve into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or central banks exploring digital currencies, the company said.
Visa's services include educating institutions about cryptocurrencies, allowing clients to use the payment processor's network for digital offerings, and helping manage backend operations.
A new global study by Visa showed nearly 40% of crypto owners surveyed said they would likely or very likely switch their primary bank to one that offers crypto-related products in the next 12 months.
Visa is set to launch services this year that will allow buying, selling and custody of digital currency through its banking partners.
There are also a number of Visa card programs that let users earn bitcoin on purchases and the network will also allow its client the use of USD Coin, a stablecoin cryptocurrency whose value is pegged directly to the U.S. dollar, to settle transactions on its payment network.
However, for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to be used as a medium of exchange, price stability is needed, Visa's chief financial officer, Vasant Prabhu, told Reuters.

""If the price is going to fluctuate from $60,000 to $50,000 in a few hours, it's a very difficult thing for a merchant to accept (bitcoin) as a currency,"" Prabhu said.

107,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2021 07:42AM ET</span>",Nestle sale of L'Oreal shares pleases investors on both sides,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic and Silvia Aloisi
PARIS (Reuters) -Shares in Nestle and L'Oreal rose on Wednesday after the Swiss food group trimmed its stake in the French beauty giant, a deal that pleases investors on both sides while keeping ties between the two companies broadly intact - at least for now.
The Nescafe maker has been a major shareholder in the owner of brands like Lancome since 1974, when L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt entrusted nearly half her stake to Nestle for fear it would be nationalised if Socialists came to power. 
The presence of Nestle, which is cutting its stake to just over 20% from 23% by selling shares worth about $10 billion, alongside the L'Oreal founding family helped insulate the French group from unsolicited takeover bids. 
For Nestle, it has proved a great investment. L'Oreal shares yielded a total return of 11% on an annualised basis since then, excluding dividends, according to analysts at Vontobel. 
They hit a record high of 433.65 euros on Wednesday, having more than trebled in value since Nestle first sold an 8% holding in 2014.
The stake Nestle is selling will be bought back by L'Oreal, increasing the Bettencourt Meyers family holding to 34.7% from around 33%. 
""Good business for both,"" said broker Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). ""It reduces Nestle's exposure to L'Oreal, which at about 16% of its market cap pre-transaction was becoming troublingly high. It makes L'Oreal's balance sheet somewhat more efficient, while keeping ownership 'in the family'."" 
Shares in both companies opened more than 1% higher on Wednesday. 
"" BEST  (NYSE:BEST) OF BOTH WORLDS""
Nestle's holding in L'Oreal has been the subject of intense scrutiny over the years as Chief Executive Mark Schneider pivoted the company towards nutrition and wellness, and activist investor Third Point in 2017 urged the Swiss group to sell out.
According to a source with knowledge of the negotiations, Tuesday's announcement was the result of two months of talks that involved the chairmen of both companies. Nestle was keen to maintain a holding above 20%, allowing it to consolidate the investment on accounts.
The source said Nestle was unlikely to sell more of its stake for now, unless it decided to go for a big acquisition. 
""When your financial investment reaches all-time highs, it is not surprising that you monetise some of it, especially when there is no strategic partnership and when it can continue to fuel your equity story of strong cash returns,"" analysts at Bernstein said. 
Nestle, which retains two members on L'Oreal's board, ""can keep doing this several times in the next decade,"" they said.
A spokesman for Nestle said the stake sale left the company in a ""best of both worlds"" situation.
""On the one hand, we monetise around 9.3 billion Swiss francs (8.9 billion euros). On the other hand, it keeps us involved with a very successful company,"" he said.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Toymaker Lego said on Wednesday it plans to build a new factory in Vietnam to keep up with rapidly growing demand for its coloured plastic bricks among children across Asia.
The privately-owned Danish firm said it will invest more than $1 billion in the project, which will be its second Asian factory after it opened one in China in 2016. Lego has achieved double-digit growth in the region since 2019. 
Demand is now on track to outstrip supply from its Chinese plant in the mid to long term, Lego's Chief Operations Officer Carsten Rasmussen told Reuters. 
""Growth in China and Asia is fantastic and we can see that over time that we will need more capacity,"" he said, pointing to a growing middle class and high number of births in the region compared to more mature European and North American markets. 
The move is the latest in Lego's decade-old strategy of placing production close to key markets, which has helped rein in costs and shield it from external factors.
""It gives us shorter delivery time to our customers and make us able to react quickly on demand but it of course also makes us more resilient,"" Rasmussen said.
He added that the decision to build in Vietnam had not been accelerated by recent global supply chain disruptions.
It will also be Lego's first carbon neutral factory as it plans to match the energy consumption with solar power from panels on its roof and from a nearby farm.
Although Lego still makes bricks out of oil-based plastic, it has pledged to replace these with ones made from sustainable materials by the end of the decade.

The factory, which is set to start production in 2024 and will employ as many as 4,000 people, would add a ""significant addition"" to Lego's annual production of roughly 100 billion bricks, Rasmussen said, declining to give more detail. 
Lego, an abbreviation of ""leg godt"" meaning ""play well"" in Danish, is also expanding capacity in Mexico, Hungary and China and adding machinery at its Danish and Czech plants, he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, continuing the recent rally after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said its booster shot, in conjunction with the previous two doses, can nullify the Omicron variant.
At 7:25 AM ET (1225 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 100 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 14 points, or 0.3%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 45 points, or 0.3%.
Fresh gains are expected on Wall Street Wednesday after the U.S. drugmaker, and its partner BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), stated Wednesday that three doses of their vaccine are effective at neutralizing the Omicron variant.
In the first official statement from vaccine manufacturers on the likely efficacy of their shot against Omicron, BioNTech and Pfizer said in a joint statement that two vaccine doses resulted in significantly lower neutralizing antibodies but that a third dose of their vaccine increased the neutralising antibodies by a factor of 25. Preliminary findins from South Africa, where the variant was first detected, earlier showed a significant drop in neutralizing antibodies in patients with only two vaccine doses.
The major indices closed firmly higher on Tuesday, adding to Monday’s gains, as public health officials said it appeared the new Omicron strain was not as deadly as previous variants. This is seen as reducing the chances of further lockdowns in the U.S. which would damage the current rebound in economic activity.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied almost 500 points, or 1.4%, on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted their best days since March, gaining 2.1% and 3%, respectively. The DJIA is now 2.3% from its record peak, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are just 1.2% and 3.2% from their all-time highs, respectively.
That said, the news surrounding the Covid virus was not all good Wednesday, with reports suggesting that the U.K. government is about to reintroduce social distancing restrictions prompting more uncertainty.
Away from Covid news, investors are likely to start focusing once more on the Federal Reserve’s intentions ahead of next week’s meeting, especially after the central bank recently signalled a faster monetary tightening.
Last week’s nonfarm payrolls number disappointed, and this means close attention is likely to be paid to the release of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, at 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT). 
The number of job openings is likely to have fallen again in October, with economists calling for 10.369 million in the month, down from 10.438 million in September. 
In terms of corporate news, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is likely to be in the spotlight Wednesday after thousands of users of the online retail giant’s services suffered an outage during the previous session. 
Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) will also be in focus after the online trading platform announced it is seeking a termination of the resale of its shares by certain investors, potentially removing a near-term overhang.
Crude prices pushed higher Wednesday, continuing the week’s strong gains, ahead of the release of the latest crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due at 10:30 AM ET.
The equivalent numbers from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed a draw of a surprisingly large drop in crude stocks of over 3 million barrels last week.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $72.18 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $75.73. Both benchmarks posted gains of just under 5% on Monday and over 3% on Tuesday.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,785.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1280.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Israeli lab-grown meat startup Aleph Farms and German chemicals maker Wacker Chemie will work together to improve production processes for growth proteins to remove one of the biggest obstacles to large-scale cultivated meat production.
Cultivated meat, which is grown from animal muscle cells in a lab, has been getting a lot of attention as a way to address climate change by cutting energy, land and water use in the meat industry.
But unlike plant-based substitutes, popularised by the likes of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and Impossible Foods, the technology remains niche due to hurdles including expensive production.
As part of the deal announced on Wednesday, Wacker and Aleph will work to ramp up production of so-called growth medium proteins that can promote cell growth and which are the main costs in synthetic meat production.
""The proteins are either not available on the market at all or only in R&D quantities. The costs are currently up to a factor of 1,000 higher than the value we are aiming for,"" Wacker Chemie told Reuters.
The agreement is non-exclusive, so any cultivated meat company will be able to buy the proteins from Wacker at the same price, the companies said.
Rivals include Israel's Mosa Meat and Future Meat Technologies, U.S.-based Upside Foods and dozens of smaller companies, but only the California-based Eat Just has regulatory clearance to sell lab-grown meat, and the approval is only valid in Singapore.
Aleph, which is working with regulators around the world, plans to start selling its thin-cut beef steaks to restaurants by end-2022 and reach the mass market within the next four to five years, Chief Executive Didier Toubia told Reuters in an interview.
""We expect our product to be a few tens of percent more expensive for the consumer than slaughtered meat when reaching the market. We will actually lose money at this stage,"" Toubia said.
However, Aleph should still break even before it reaches the price levels of conventional meat production as it will be able to cut costs faster than companies developing plant-based products, the CEO said.

Wacker said it was already producing small quantities of some proteins to supply Aleph Farms during their development and would share more details about the timeline of the project as it gets closer to market.
The companies declined to give financial details of the agreement.

Investing.com – Blackstone stock (NYSE:BX) traded 3.5% lower in Wednesday’s premarket as the company revealed a sale of shares by Hamilton E. James, its executive vice chairman.
James sold 3.71 million shares of the private equity giant for around $500 million. The sale constitutes around 0.3% of the company's equity. 
According to the company’s statement to the SEC, James has attributed the transactions to family trusts which sold them for his heirs for estate planning and necessary diversification.
Of his personal Blackstone shares held outside those trusts, he is selling only enough shares to partially fund the taxes owed on the exchange and is retaining 80% of his personal shares of the company, the statement said.
James wants to remain a long-term Blackstone shareholder, the statement noted.
James joins a long list of CEOs and Fortune 500 executives including Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Apple’s Tim Cook and Tesla’s Elon Musk who have used the record highs in the stock market to liquidate part of their holdings for various reasons in recent months. "

(Reuters) - Residential solar company SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) Corp on Wednesday said it would launch a new financial services division aimed at making rooftop panels affordable for more U.S. homeowners.
The creation of its own financing arm, SunPower Financial, is part of a commitment the company made in September to expand access to residential solar for low-income Americans and push back on the perception that it is a luxury for the rich. 
The company's pledge is aligned with a Biden administration initiative to direct clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities.
SunPower Financial will offer interest-free loans, higher credit limits, and expanded loan eligibility to borrowers with lower credit scores, the company said. It will also offer products for shared roofs, mobile homes and more. 
Home solar has grown rapidly in recent years and is forecast to expand 21% this year in large part because solar companies have worked with lenders to offer loans and leases with no upfront costs and monthly payments that can be lower than for electric utilities. 
But fewer than 5% of U.S. homes have panels installed, representing a large opportunity for residential solar companies to win new customers.
In an interview at the Reuters Events Energy Transition North America conference, SunPower Chief Executive Officer Peter Faricy said research has shown that many consumers still think they couldn't afford solar or wouldn't qualify for financing.
""This perception that people can't afford solar is really an awareness problem,"" Faricy said. ""The facts are going to bear out that this is very affordable for people at different (credit) scores and different income levels.""

Because it will be offering the financing in-house, the company's products aren't constrained by terms required by other financial providers, SunPower said.
""It's actually not a very risky loan or lease,"" Faricy said, noting that default rates on solar loans and leases are ""extremely low.""

Speculation about a Porsche listing, which could be a record-breaking IPO, has surfaced over the year, but no decision has been made due to a complex stakeholder set-up, the sources said, adding it was unclear whether a listing would happen.
Reports about a possible listing of the unit have included estimates of a standalone Porsche AG valuation of between 45 billion and 90 billion euros ($101 billion).
Earlier, Handelsblatt reported that the Porsche and Piech families, who control Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s largest shareholder Porsche SE, are considering selling part of their VW stake to fund a substantial stake purchase in a possible Porsche IPO.
The families, who own 31.4% of Volkswagen shares and have 53.3% of voting rights via Porsche SE, could sell enough shares to raise roughly 15 billion euros, the German newspaper said.
They would remain the largest shareholder in Volkswagen, Handelsblatt added, ahead of the state of Lower Saxony, which holds a 11.8% equity stake and 20% of voting rights. 
Porsche SE called the report ""pure speculation"", without giving further comment. Volkswagen declined to comment.
Volkswagen preference shares, which have fallen significantly in recent weeks due to a leadership tussle, closed up 8.6% at the top of Germany's benchmark DAX index.
Porsche SE shares closed 8.5% higher.
People familiar with the matter told Reuters in May that the families were prepared to take a direct stake in Porsche https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/porsche-piech-families-weigh-direct-stake-possible-porsche-ipo-sources-2021-05-31 AG should the luxury carmaker be separately listed.
Such a move would loosen the grip of the families on Europe's largest carmaker Volkswagen, in favour of direct ownership of the sports car brand founded by their ancestor Ferdinand Porsche, which dates back to 1931.
Asked about a potential listing of Porsche in October, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said that Volkswagen was constantly reviewing its portfolio, but gave no further comment.

Diess will probably stay on as VW CEO although he will cede some responsibilities after a clash with labour leaders, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Investing.com – HelloFresh stock (DE:HFGG) traded 6% lower in Germany as the company’s outlook for 2022 indicated a sharp slowdown in the growth it priced in during the pandemic.
The company said the outlook is “indicative only” but did not go into reasons behind its estimates.
Companies like HelloFresh (OTC:HLFFF), a meal-kit provider, saw record revenue growth during the pandemic as people stayed indoors and used online platforms for ordering food and groceries.
The appetite for online activities has waned as economies have reopened this year, causing it to give market share back to the restaurant business. This trend seems unlikely to be halted entirely by the threat from the new Omicron variant of Covid-19, despite the spread of fresh lockdown measures across the northern hemisphere. 
HelloFresh expects revenue in the new financial year to grow between 20% and 26%, down from 57%-62% growth in for the current financial year. The company had raised its guidance for the ongoing year from 45%-55% only last month.
It now expects full-year adjusted EBITDA of $540 million at the midpoint of its guidance range.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group's shares hit a record low on Wednesday after a missed debt payment deadline put the developer at risk of becoming the country's biggest defaulter, even as hopes of a managed debt restructuring calmed fears of a messy collapse. 
So far, any Evergrande fallout has been broadly contained, and with policymakers becoming more vocal and markets more familiar with the issue, consequences of its troubles are less likely to be widely felt, market watchers have said.
Failure by Evergrande to make $82.5 million in interest payments due Nov. 6 on some U.S. dollar bonds would trigger cross-default on its roughly $19 billion of international bonds, with possible ramifications on China's economy and beyond. 
While the 30-day grace period is over, Evergrande has not announced if the bonds have formally defaulted.
The developer did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
""Without the official announcement, the market will want to wait and see and not give up yet; otherwise Evergrande's share and bond prices should have tumbled a lot more,"" said Steven Leung, director of UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.
""The market also wants to wait and see what can be done with local government stepping in now,"" Leung added, referring to the move by Evergrande's home province to help contain the risk. 
Evergrande was once China's top property developer, with more than 1,300 real estate projects. With $300 billion of liabilities, it is now at the heart of a property crisis in China this year that has crushed almost a dozen smaller firms.
Trading in shares of embattled smaller peer Kaisa Group Holdings was suspended on Wednesday, after a source with direct knowledge of the matter said it was unlikely to meet its $400 million offshore debt deadline on Tuesday.
Kaisa, China's largest holder of offshore debt among developers after Evergrande, had not repaid the 6.5% bond by the end of Asia business hours, the person said, which could push the notes into technical default, triggering cross defaults on its offshore bonds totalling nearly $12 billion.
Kaisa declined to comment.
Bondholders owning over 50% of the notes in question sent the company draft terms of forbearance late on Monday, a source previously told Reuters. 
Even in the case of a technical default, Kaisa and offshore bondholders would continue the discussions, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. 
SHARES HIT RECORD LOW
Evergrande's shares, which have given up more than 20% this month, were down 6% in the afternoon at HK$1.72 - lowest since their November 2009 debut. The broader market was steady.
Its notes due last month, one of two tranches with a coupon payment deadline that passed on Monday, traded at 18.613 cents on the dollar, Duration Finance data showed, versus 18.875 from the close of Tuesday Asia hours.
Kaisa's bond due April 2022 traded at 36.397, little changed from the day earlier but down from 37.89 last week. 

The government has repeatedly said Evergrande's problems can be contained and moves to boost liquidity in the banking sector along with the firm's plans to forge ahead with a restructuring of its overseas debt have helped reassure global investors. 
The provincial government of Guandong, where Evergrande is based, stepped in last week to help manage the fallout, reinforcing the view that its failure would be managed.

In Thailand, Ford is able to produce around 270,000 vehicles annually, Director of Communications Thailand and ASEAN Markets, Kamolchanok Prasertsom, said.
About 60% is exported Asia-Pacific markets like Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines where its pickup trucks are popular.
""If demand increases in the future, the proportion is adjusted on a monthly basis,"" she said, adding that its export market is robust.
The factory upgrades will allow the company to better customise production for vehicles such as open cabs and four-door pickups to match demand. 
The move contrasts with the closures of three of its plants in Brazil this year, part of a $11 billion global restructuring and its strategy to achieve 8% global operating margins. It is also pulling out of production in India where it has long struggled to make profit.
Thailand is Asia's fourth-largest auto assembly and export hub, accounting for about 10% of the country's GDP and manufacturing jobs. 
Last year, General Motors (NYSE:GM) sold its Thai factories to China's Great Wall Motor, which has begun producing SUVs and plans to make electric vehicles in the country. 

Thailand's state-owned energy firm PTT Pcl has said it will invest $1 billion to $2 billion in an EV plant with Taiwan's Foxconn (TW:2317).

Investing.com --  TUI Group (LON:TUIT) shares were down 4.7% by mid-session in Europe as the emergence of the new Omicron variant stalled its vaccine-driven recovery from the pandemic as winter holiday bookings took a hit from the development. TUI posted end of year results showing that winter 2021/22 bookings are 62% of winter 2018/19 levels. Before the recent news coverage, they had been returning to normal levels, the travel group said.
“The increased media coverage of rising incident rates and the emergence of new Omicron variant has weakened this positive momentum, particularly for Winter,"" the group said in a release to the stock exchange.
The success of vaccination programmes and rebound of leisure travel had driven a recovery for TUI with fourth quarter revenues up €2.1 billion compared to Q4 2020. The fourth quarter saw the holiday group deliver its first positive quarterly EBITDA since the pandemic started, at 160 million euros.
If sentiment continues to be hit by the new Covid variant, winter season capacity is likely to be modified towards the lower end of assumptions of between 60% to 80%, TUI said. However, the group also forecast a bounce back in the summer 2022 season, where bookings have increased. The U.K., which books summer holidays earlier, is already 52% sold for May with total markets and airlines bookings for the key August holiday period up 17%. 
TUI said it expected that Summer 22 volumes would recover close to normalized summer 2019 levels, supported by the stronger starting position and a travel environment underpinned by the continued success of vaccination campaigns. The holiday giant forecast that world arrivals would show a strong increase in 2022 and return to normal in 2023 and 2024."

Investing.com – Robinhood stock (NASDAQ:HOOD) traded nearly 5% higher in Wednesday’s premarket, benefiting from the removal of a a near-term overhang on the stock coming from early backers who wanted to cash out.
The online trading platform said Tuesday it is seeking a termination of the resale of its shares by certain investors including affiliates of venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Ribbit.
As part of its initial public offering, the company was under a contractual obligation to let those early shareholders dispose of some of their stake. With that obligation having now expired, it has sought to terminate the relevant part of the contract.
The shares accrued to their holders upon automatic conversion of some of the company’s debt in connection with the IPO. The company went public on July 29 with each share issued at $38.
According to an August 5 filing with the SEC, Robinhood registered the sale of around 98 million shares - over 10% of the group's overall capital - by early shareholders. Robinhood wouldn't have received any of the proceeds.
The termination will take effect as soon as the SEC declares the amendment effective, Robinhood said in a statement.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2021 04:54AM ET</span>",Wellness check: Can better benefits help companies retain workers?,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When companies think about the financial health of their employees, they might consider basic issues like salary, retirement benefits and health coverage.
All good – but not good enough.
These days true “financial wellness” gets into broader issues like planning help, student debt, tuition reimbursement, and dozens of other potential stress points.
As head of financial wellness at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Krystal Barker Buissereth is steering companies toward a more holistic understanding of where workers might be hurting – and how a few financial lifelines can help people in trouble while also boosting an employer's talent attraction and retention efforts.
She spoke with Reuters about the ways benefits can change employees’ lives.
Q: How do you define financial wellness, exactly?
A: Helping individuals put pen to paper on what matters to them. What is getting in the way of achieving their financial goals, and how do you figure out a plan to tackle that? 
Most people don’t even have a financial plan, so it’s like playing a game of darts without a dartboard.
In this age of COVID and the Great Resignation, people need help beyond just retirement. It could be helping them with short-term needs like budgeting. It could be helping them set up emergency savings in case they have a healthcare crisis. It could be help with paying down student debt. Financial wellness is all-encompassing.
Q: One of the biggest trends right now seems to be help with employee student loans. Why?
A: The fastest-growing portion of household debt is student debt. Why that is so concerning is that it gets in the way of planning for other financial milestones. 
If I’m stressed out about student debt, that may delay my retirement saving. So companies are looking to alleviate some of that stress, either with one-on-one coaching, or direct contributions, or both.
Q: Can this also be seen as a diversity issue?
A: Diversity and inclusion is part of this, because if you look at people with the most outstanding debt, it is often women and underrepresented minorities. 
If you are a company looking to attract a diverse workforce, you want to make sure your benefits are helping the most vulnerable.
Q: Some companies like  Target  (NYSE:TGT) are grabbing headlines for tuition benefits?
A: Almost 50% of companies have some sort of tuition reimbursement or professional development program, but what we are seeing more of now is full tuition coverage. 
Competition for talent is very high, and if my company is looking to stand out in a competitive workplace, benefits can be that differentiating factor. It’s one of the best tools in your arsenal.
Q: I imagine you have seen a lot of data, so how are people doing right now financially?
A: People have absolutely been rattled. What COVID highlighted is that certain populations have been disproportionately affected more than others. 
But no matter where you are on the continuum, this period has been a wake-up call. One stat found that 65% of households have lost some income. When you ask people what is causing them stress, the number-one answer is financial concerns – more than health, or work, or family.
Q: There is upward pressure on wages, so will that help with the financial wellness picture?
A: An extra boost in salary can go a long way, especially for those just starting out, but it’s just one piece of the equation in the broader overall picture.
Q: There are a lot of changes happening in this arena, so what’s next?
A: There is no one-size-fits-all program, so we do anticipate more ‘cafeteria’-style plans, with a menu of different benefits that employees could pick and choose from. That’s the gold standard, but many companies haven’t even started with the first items on the menu. They have a retirement benefit, and that’s about it. 
Employees are suffering, they need help, and what we envision is that companies are going to start filling in more financial gaps.
Q: What financial lessons are we going to take away from the last couple of years?

A: Just like 2008-2009, this has been an eye-opener for many of us. We might not have the financial buffer that we thought we did. 
For employers, they have learned that attracting and retaining talent is not just about salary. Their benefits packages need to be tied to their goals and their (human resources) objectives, so that employees can bring their best selves to work.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's domestic airline industry, held back during the pandemic by state border closings, is gearing up for a price war as new entrants into the jet market challenge dominant incumbents Qantas Airways Ltd and Virgin Australia. 
Regional Express Holdings Ltd (Rex) is expanding on major routes while low-cost start-up Bonza will target thinner leisure routes that are unserved or underserved from next year. 
The companies are bringing fresh competition to the market for the first time since Virgin bought independent budget carrier Tigerair Australia in 2013. Lower fares, like Rex's A$69 ($49) one-way tickets on its new Sydney-Brisbane route, are leading others to drop prices. 
""This market has never even had three large jet players in it for a sustained period,"" CAPA Centre for Aviation Chairman Emeritus Peter Harbison said at a conference hosted by his firm. ""Who are the winners out of all of this? The Australian travelling public."" 
The domestic market, down to 17% of pre-COVID passengers in October, when Sydney and Melbourne were locked down, is on its way back as states are so far sticking with plans to open borders despite the threat of the Omicron variant. 
The airlines are scrambling for a piece of now-closed Tigerair's 7% market share in a domestic market that historically produced a profit pool of A$1 billion ($711.80 million) a year, according to Qantas data. 
Qantas expects to return to pre-pandemic domestic capacity by January and surpass it by April. It is now aiming for 70% market share, up from 62% previously. Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said the airline would ""be competitive to defend our turf"" with the best products and fares. 
Australia's competition regulator said on Tuesday that it was closely monitoring capacity and pricing, but analysts say the unusual trading environment could make it more difficult to prove whether activity is anti-competitive or part of a recovery plan. 
Qantas says that it wants to generate cash and get idle planes and staff back in the air rather than turn immediate profits and that it has natural advantages such as a strong loyalty programme. 

It has launched nearly 50 new domestic routes during the pandemic. Virgin is also adding routes like Perth-Launceston as it looks to keep around one-third of Tigerair's market share, according to chief executive Jayne Hrdlicka. Rex Deputy Chairman John Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) said his airline would add planes and expand to more big cities, while Bonza Chief Executive Tim Jordan said he believed there would be a profitable niche as an independent budget carrier given Jetstar is owned by Qantas. 
""It is about new growth, new opportunities, new markets,"" Jordan said of Bonza's plans. ""It is not about stealing share from anybody.""($1 = 1.4049 Australian dollars)

Its analysis of the Swiss office property market showed supply was outstripping demand during the coronavirus pandemic. The home working trend ""is likely to cast its shadow over the office property market for several more quarters,"" it said.
But prospects are more upbeat in the long run, it said, based on a study the Swiss government commissioned on what is likely to happen by 2060.

The average proportion of workers in Switzerland carrying out office-based activities rose from 34% to 45% between 2000 and 2019, and should reach 60% by 2060, the study found. 
""Over time, this effect should offset the decline in demand caused by home working, resulting in a significant increase in demand for office space in the long term,"" it said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese social media giant Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) Corp's shares closed 7.2% below their issue price in Hong Kong on Wednesday, as it became the latest U.S.-listed China stock to seek out a secondary listing closer to home.
The Hong Kong debut was in line with a fall in Weibo's primary listing in New York after a torrid week for U.S.-listed China shares, which are facing greater U.S. regulatory scrutiny and also under pressure from Chinese authorities.
Weibo, which raised $385 million for its Hong Kong listing, opened at $256.20 and closed at HK$253.2 after a volatile debut session.
The stock had been priced at HK$272.80 each in its secondary listing in which 11 million shares were sold.
""For Weibo, it's a matter of timing. The Hong Kong market had started to rebound this week and now we are seeing some softness emerging in the market,"" said Louis Tse, Wealthy Securities director in Hong Kong.
Weibo's fall came as Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed Wednesday up 0.06% while the Tech Index was 0.03% higher. 
Some major stocks such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holdings, down 4.35%, were off sharply as sentiment towards tech majors remains fragile.
""The listing market in Hong Kong is very lukewarm right now,"" said Dickie Wong, Kingston Securities executive director.
""Plus, there is regulatory pressure from the (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) on Chinese companies to disclose basically everything within three years.
""So there is a major trend that most of the U.S.-listed Chinese companies will seek secondary or dual primary in Hong Kong so they can exit the U.S. market if they need to.""
Ride-hailing giant Didi Global decided last week to delist from New York, succumbing to pressure from Chinese regulators concerned about data security and denting sentiment toward Chinese stocks.
Hong Kong and China's mainland STAR Market have attracted $15.2 billion worth of secondary listings from U.S. listed Chinese companies so far this year, according to Refinitiv data. 
""The moves are probably based on the increasing recognition that the U.S.-China decoupling will not stop and will proceed steadily,"" said LightStream Research analyst Mio Kato, who publishes on Smartkarma.
""I would expect a continuous flow of listings from New York to Hong Kong over the next year or two.""

The U.S administration is progressing plans to delist Chinese companies if they do not meet the country's auditing rules, which could affect more than 200 companies.
Chinese companies that list on U.S. stock exchanges must disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a government entity, and provide evidence of their auditing inspections, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said last week.

(Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) on Wednesday announced key partnerships to secure raw materials Europe's largest carmaker needs to realise its ambitious electric vehicle strategy, eager to close a gap with rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) .
At the core of the three agreements, which are part of VW's 30 billion euro ($34 billion) plan to build battery plants and procure materials, lies a planned joint venture with Belgian chemicals and recycling company Umicore.
The venture aims to supply cathode materials to Volkswagen's European battery cell factories, which it plans to build by 2030. It will start production in 2025 with 20 gigawatt hours (GWh) for VW's plant in Salzgitter, Germany, which it plans to build with China's Gotion High-Tech.
The joint venture's goal is to reach annual production capacity of up to 160 GWh by the end of the decade, enough capacity to power approximately 2.2 million battery-powered electric vehicles.
""Volkswagen is implementing its battery strategy very consistently and at a high pace,"" board member Thomas Schmall said. ""Teaming up with Umicore enables us to establish a state-of-the-art supply chain in Europe.""
At a later stage, both parties aim to include refining and battery recycling in the scope of the partnership.
""We are very pleased to become a long-term partner for Volkswagen in achieving its ambitious e-mobility strategy in Europe and in bringing our long-standing and proven expertise in rechargeable battery materials to this unique joint venture,"" Umicore CEO Mathias Miedreich said.
Volkswagen also struck an agreement with lithium developer Vulcan Energy Resources for lithium extracted from Germany's Upper Rhine Valley region by means of geothermal energy.
The agreement has an initial term of five years with commercial delivery to start in 2026, Volkswagen and Vulcan said, without providing contract details.

In a bid to develop improved production technology for its planned cell plants, Volkswagen is also investing in battery start-up 24M, a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, aiming to scale up 24M's semi-solid process.

Investing.com – Stocks of L’Oreal (PA:OREP) and Nestle (SIX:NESN) were both trading higher in European markets as the two reached a deal that will see the former repurchase its own shares held by the Swiss company.
L’Oreal stock was 1.4% higher in Paris while Nestle was up 1.7% in Zurich.
Propsects of improved per share earnings -- the French beauty firm will cancel the stocks it buys back by August 29 next year -- were boosting L'Oreal stock. EPS will rise by more than 4% on a full-year basis, a L'Oreal statement said. Nestle, meanwhile, will get 8.9 billion euro ($10 billion) from the sale.  
The transaction is part of L’Oreal’s share repurchase program and will reduce Nestle’s stake in it to just over 20.1% from 23.3%, L’Oreal said.
About 22 million shares or 4% of L’Oreal’s capital will exchange hands at 400 euro apiece.
The strike price at which the deal is happening is 7% lower than the stock’s prevailing level.
The share buyback will be financed through a mix of cash-in-hand and new debt, according to L’Oreal.
L’Oreal’s Bettencourt Meyers family will see their stake rise to 34.7% from 33.3%, and as approved by the regulators, will not need to launch a takeover offer, as is normally required when one entity's ownership rises above one-third of capital."

The binding purchase agreement with Volkswagen for lithium extracted from Germany's Upper Rhine Valley region by means of geothermal energy has an initial term of five years with commercial delivery to start in 2026, Vulcan said in a statement on Wednesday, without providing contract details.
German-Australian company Vulcan last month signed a preliminary lithium supply deal with carmaker Stellantis, shortly after agreeing a similar deal with rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) amid a surge in demand for electric vehicles. 
Vulcan, which has supply agreements with Belgian recycling group Umicore and South Korea's LG Chem, says its direct lithium extraction method uses less land, groundwater and energy than the most-common existing methods of open-pit mines and brine evaporation ponds.
Geothermal lithium from the Upper Rhine Valley along the French-German border has also attracted interest from utility EnBW.

Other players in the field include mining group Eramet, which is extracting lithium from geothermal salt water in a pilot scheme at a geothermal power plant in eastern France.
Volkswagen plans to build six large battery cell plants in Europe by the end of the decade as part of its ambition to overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and become the world's top electric vehicles seller.

The U.S tech giant had already announced in February it would stop all entities linked to the military, known as the Tatmadaw, from advertising on its platforms.
""This action is based on extensive documentation by the international community and civil society of these businesses' direct role in funding the Tatmadaw,"" said Rafael Frankel, Meta's Pacific director of public policy for emerging countries, Asia Pacific.
Myanmar's military overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's democratically elected government in a coup in February, prompting widespread protests.
A spokesman for the military junta, which itself banned Facebook in February, did not answer calls seeking comment.
Frankel said Meta was identifying the companies based on a 2019 report from a U.N. Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, research from activist groups Justice for Myanmar and Burma Campaign UK, as well consultations with civil society.
He told Reuters it had already taken down over 100 accounts, pages, and groups linked to military-controlled businesses.
Facebook plays an outsized role in Myanmar as the dominant internet channel and remains widely used by both protesters against military rule and soldiers. 
After coming under heavy international criticism for failing to contain online hate campaigns, Facebook has pushed back against the military and since the coup introduced measures to protect Myanmar users. 
The platform is also facing a $150 billion lawsuit from Rohingya refugees over allegations it did not take action against hate speech targeted at the Muslim Rohingya minority that contributed to violence.

In 2018, U.N. human rights investigators said Facebook allowed the platform to be used by radical Buddhist nationalists and military members to fan a campaign of violence towards the Rohingya, 700,000 of whom fled an army crackdown in 2017.
Frankel declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said: ""We're appalled by the crimes committed against the Rohingya people in Myanmar. We’ve built a dedicated team of Burmese speakers, banned the Tatmadaw, disrupted networks manipulating public debate and taken action on harmful misinformation to help keep people safe.""

Investing.com - European stock markets posted small gains Wednesday, adding to the recent sharp rally driven by hopes that the Omicron Covid-19 variant is less virulent than previous versions.
At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.5%. 
A South African study suggested on Tuesday that booster doses produced by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), and German partner BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), could help fend off infection from Omicron, although the study showed the new strain can partially evade protection from two doses. BioNTech stock fell 0.7%.
An earlier study showed that GlaxoSmithKline's (LON:GSK) antibody-based therapy, made in conjunction with Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR), was effective against it.
Still, whatever the news surrounding Omicron, the countries in Europe are still battling to stop a fourth wave of the pandemic, with Germany recording the highest number of deaths from Covid-19 since February on Wednesday.
Wednesday also sees the end of an era in Germany as Olaf Scholz is sworn in as chancellor, replacing Angela Merkel. 
In corporate news, L’Oreal (PA:OREP) stock rose 1.2% and Nestle (SIX:NESN) rose 1.7%, after the world’s largest food company said late Tuesday it would cut its stake in the French cosmetics company to about 20%, reducing its holding for the first time in seven years.
L’Oreal said the deal will have an accretive effect on the company's earnings per share of more than 4% in a full year.
Tui (DE:TUIGn) stock fell 2.8% after the tour operator posted an annual loss of over 2 billion euros ($2.26 billion) and warned that the news around Omicron had slowed bookings, while HelloFresh stock slumped 6.9% as the meal-kit provider offered up underwhelming 2022 guidance.
Umicore (BS:UMIb) stock fell 5.1% after the Belgian chemicals and recycling company announced plans to establish a battery materials venture to supply Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), as the German carmaker expands its electric vehicle output. VW stock was up 1.6%, continuing its advance on the back of a German newspaper report that the controlling Porsche/Piech family may spin off its luxury Porsche brand to help finance the shift to e-mobility.
Crude prices edged lower Wednesday, consolidating after two days of strong gains, as investors reprice the threat posed to global oil demand by Omicron.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a draw of just over 3 million barrels last week, and investors now await crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration later in the day for confirmation.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $71.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.6% to $74.97. Both benchmarks posted gains of just under 5% on Monday and over 3% on Tuesday.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,787.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1285.

Note too that trading in shares of embattled smaller peer Kaisa Group Holdings was suspended, after a source with direct knowledge of the matter said Kaisa was unlikely to meet a $400 million offshore debt deadline. 
Hopes of a managed debt restructuring at Evergrande are somewhat calming the angst. But even if the fallout so far has been broadly contained, fears linger of how the crisis might impact the world's second-biggest economy.
But as the trading baton passes from Asia to Europe, it's hope that's taking hold. 
Already Asian shares have risen to near two-week highs on optimism that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus may be less disruptive than initially feared. 
U.S. stock futures are trading higher, European futures are flat. That sentiment boost also lifted the Aussie dollar to its strongest level in a week.
Markets have shown themselves remarkably resilient to political crises, and they appear to be shrugging off President Joe Biden's warning that Russia risked ""strong economic and other measures"" if it invaded Ukraine. 
Possibly news of a two-hour Biden-Putin chat is being seen as a positive.
Finally, Wednesday brings the end of an era in Germany, where Olaf Scholz will take over as Chancellor, bringing an end to Chancellor Angela Merkel's 16-years as head of Europe's biggest economy. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: 
- Australia joins diplomatic boycott of Beijing Winter Games
- India's c.bank holds rates as inflation, Omicron risks loom
- Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) shares fall 6% below issue price on Hong Kong listing
- Japan downgrades Q3 GDP on deeper hit to consumer spending

133,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>",Some hedge funds may have lost millions on bets on China's Didi Global,"By Maiya Keidan
TORONTO (Reuters) - Several hedge funds may have been bruised by bets on Didi Global Inc, filings showed after the shares tumbled since the Chinese ride-hailing company announced plans to withdraw from the New York Stock Exchange.
Didi’s shares have tumbled 56.8% from their June 30 IPO price. The slide accelerated after the company said on Friday it planned to delist from the New York Stock Exchange and pursue a listing in Hong Kong, bending to Chinese regulators angered by its U.S. debut.
Hedge funds were invested in 94.4 million shares of Didi at the end of September, down 13.2 million shares from the previous quarter, according to U.S. 13F filings compiled by industry tracker Symmetric.
It is not known if hedge funds had further reduced their investment since that time, but Reuters calculations show the 7.9% fall in Didi’s shares between the end of September and Dec. 7 would have wiped a combined $60.9 million of value from those positions.
As of the end of September, 27% of the value of the company was held by institutional investors owned by managers classified as hedge funds by Symmetric.
Symmetric notes that stocks with a high percentage of ownership by hedge funds may be susceptible to liquidations by those funds during stressed periods.
Among hedge funds that bought shares in the third quarter, Bridgewater Associates purchased almost 9 million, according to filings.
Penserra Capital bought 5.4 million in Didi's stock while Owl Creek Asset Management purchased 1.7 million and Seven Eight Capital 537,145 shares, the filings showed. They showed that Paulson & Co added 1.6 million shares at the end of the third quarter while Seven Eight Capital purchased 537,145 shares. 
Bridgewater, Penserra, Owl Creek, Paulson and Seven Eight did not respond to requests for comment.
Tiger Global Management and billionaire George Soros’ fund also held sizeable stakes in Didi at the end of the third quarter, together accounting for 4.7 million shares at end-September.
Singapore’s state fund Temasek reduced its position in Didi by 3.6 million shares as of Sept. 30, but maintained a stake of 29.4 million shares.
Tiger and Soros did not respond to requests for comment while Temasek declined to comment on the position.
It is not known if these firms are still invested but an executive at a large U.S. based hedge fund, which had a small position in Didi that it exited recently, said a lot of people are pulling out even if they plan to possibly get back in later.
""There is also a problem that retail investors and even some mutual funds may not be able to easily own Hong Kong listed shares and will be forced to sell, so there would be more pressure,"" said the executive.

Among the public pension plans that held shares of Didi were Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Montreal-based Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS).
A spokeswoman for Caisse declined to comment while CPP and CalPERS could not be immediately reached for comment.

Financial markets went into a tailspin in the final week of November with U.S. stocks losing nearly 4% in the last five trading sessions of the month, after news of the variant hit headlines. Currency and bond market volatility also jumped.

137,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 08, 2021 02:01AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Edge Lower; Nestle Reduces Stake in L'Oreal,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally lower Wednesday, taking a breather after a sharp rally driven by hopes that the Omicron Covid-19 variant is a dud.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. also fell 0.1%.
Global stock markets rallied strongly on Tuesday as investors shook off some anxiety about the latest coronavirus variant, buoyed by reports that the new variant may produce a milder reaction in patients and thus could be less disruptive to the world economy than previous strains.
A South African study suggested on Tuesday that booster doses produced by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), and partner BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), could help fend off infection from Omicron, although the study showed the new strain can partially evade protection from two doses.
An earlier study showed that GlaxoSmithKline's (LON:GSK) antibody-based therapy, made in conjunction with Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR), was effective against it.
Still, whatever the news surrounding Omicron, the countries in Europe are still battling to stop a fourth wave of the pandemic, with Germany recording the highest number of deaths from Covid-19 since February on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, investors will also be looking to see if tensions between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden are reduced after Tuesday’s video call, with the threat of new sanctions against Moscow lingering as Russia gathers troops near the Ukraine border.
Wednesday also sees the end of an era in Germany as Olaf Scholz is sworn in as chancellor, replacing Angela Merkel. 
In corporate news, Nestle (SIX:NESN) will be in the spotlight after the world’s largest food company said late Tuesday it would cut its stake in L’Oreal (PA:OREP), selling shares worth 8.9 billion euros ($10 billion) back to the French cosmetics company. This holding has been under scrutiny for years, and Nestle has cut the weight of its holding for the first time in seven years.
Crude prices edged lower Wednesday, consolidating after two days of strong gains, as investors reprice the threat posed to global oil demand by Omicron.
Oil prices rebounded earlier this week from a collapse last week on rising optimism that the new variant will not cause major economic damage.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a draw of just over 3 million barrels last week, and investors now await crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration later in the day for confirmation.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $71.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.6% to $74.97. Both benchmarks posted gains of just under 5% on Monday and over 3% on Tuesday.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,788.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1294.

In a statement, the company said an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders approved resolutions backing its dual primary listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX), adding that the next step was to seek approval from the HKEX.
""The proposed listing is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2022,"" the world's largest manufacturer of medical gloves said.
In October, Top Glove slashed for a second time the amount it aims to raise from the Hong Kong listing to HK$3.68 billion ($473 million), or less than a quarter of its initial target.
The company could raise about HK$4.24 billion if the over-allotment option is fully exercised, it said. Top Glove initially planned to raise $1.9 billion but nearly halved the target in April.

Top Glove said it was raising capital for business growth, geographic expansion, strategic investments, accretive M&As, automation, facilities and machines upgrades as well as strengthening ESG practices and initiatives.
Its listing plan was over a struggle to resolve a year-long import ban by the U.S. Customs over accusations of forced labour. The ban was lifted in September after a review showed Top Glove addressed all indicators of forced labour.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2021 01:17AM ET</span>",Analysis-Wall St hits reset after market 'froth' but Fed fears loom,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors who used the stock market's recent swoon to scoop up shares are hoping the last weeks of the year bring renewed strength to equity prices, even as worries over the Omicron variant and a more aggressive Federal Reserve continue to loom.
A two-day surge has put the S&P 500 back near record highs and nearly erased the more than 4% loss the index suffered after the emergence of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus and a potential hawkish pivot from the Federal Reserve.
Uncertainties remain over Omicron even as optimism it may cause milder illness has helped boost markets, while next week's Fed meeting could bring unwelcome news for investors worried that the central bank may begin to normalize monetary policy at a faster-than-expected pace to fight surging inflation.
Some investors, however, believe the recent pullback may have tempered a market that had grown frothy after weeks of steady upward movement, potentially setting the stage for more gains going into the end of December - typically a strong month for stocks.
""As a result of the pullback, we saw a healthy reset of investor sentiment. And this suggests still some room for positive surprises into year-end,"" said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, in emailed comments to Reuters.
Extremes in investor sentiment are sometimes viewed as potential turning points in markets, and therefore opportunities to buy or sell stocks.
After a period of placid trading, some indicators of investor sentiment and positioning had swung towards caution during last week's selloff.
Among those was the Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" which hit 35.32 last week, its highest level since January. The index has eased in recent days and stood near 22 late on Tuesday.
Several other options market measures, including put-call ratios, volatility futures prices and skew, showed that a lot of ""froth/downside"" had left the market during the recent pullback, Susquehanna International Group's Chris Murphy said in a note.
Meanwhile, investor bearishness on the market's direction hit its highest level of the year in last week's survey from the American Association of Individual Investors.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s measure of investor equity positioning saw its largest decline since March 2020.
BUYING INTEREST
At the same time, the Omicron-fueled pullback attracted its share of buyers. As stocks fell last week, BofA Securities clients were ""big buyers of the dip,"" buying $6.7 billion worth of equities on a net basis, the largest weekly amount since 2017, according to BofA Global Research.
Among recent buyers was Baker Avenue Asset Management, which added shares of Airbnb Inc and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as markets tumbled, said King Lip, Baker Avenue's chief strategist.
""We actually think this Omicron situation is likely going to be more modest than ... the market was expecting,"" Lip said. 
Deltec Bank and Trust, a private bank and multi-asset portfolio manager in the Bahamas, also ""selectively"" added to equity positions during the pullback, including in  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) and Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI), said Deltec's chief investment officer Hugo Rogers (NYSE:ROG).
""We do think that the demand remains very good in terms of economic activity in the (United States),"" Rogers said.
Still, plenty of investors believe there could be more volatility to come, especially if it appears a more aggressive Fed will speed up the taper of its monthly government bond buying program and eventually raise rates sooner, denting the allure of stocks and other comparatively risky investments.

As of late on Tuesday, investors saw a roughly 60% probability that the Fed will raise its benchmark overnight lending rate from current levels by May 2022, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch program. That compares with a roughly 24% chance a month ago.
""Given the major change in policy by the Federal Reserve, we believe the suckers will be the ones who do not take advantage of this bounce to raise some cash,"" wrote Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak.

The two firms are testing 20 robotaxi vehicles in Shanghai's Jiading district to further gauge their viability for commercial use in a trial that will expand to a second Chinese city next year, said Momenta, whose technology is used by SAIC Mobility.
SAIC Mobility, a SAIC Motor unit dedicated to robotaxi services, was not immediately available for a comment. 
Beijing-based Momenta said the two companies are exploring the application of fully autonomous so-called ""Level 4"" driving technology in urban travel scenarios through the trial.
Riders can summon a robotaxi through the SAIC Mobility App with one click, the statement said.
Momenta and SAIC Mobility plan to boost the test fleet in Jiading next year by adding 20 vehicles and to expand trial rides to the neighbouring Chinese city of Suzhou with an additional 20 vehicles.

Investing.com –  Weibo  Corp (HK:9898) shares fell as they debuted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Tuesday, with investor caution amid China’s regulatory crackdown on the internet sector set to continue.
Shares were trading at HK$254.2 ($32.6) by 10:58 PM ET (3:58 AM GMT) after falling as low as HK$253.6 earlier in the session. However, the Chinese social media giant raised $385 million through the offering.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Citic Securities Co. and China International Capital Corp. were joint sponsors.
Despite Weibo’s weak debut comes, global technology shares are enjoying a recent rebound as China pledged to increase economic support as the economy continues its recovery from COVID-19. Receding fears that the new omicron COVID-19 variant will impact the global economic recovery also boosted investor sentiment.
Weibo's U.S. shares (NASDAQ:WB) were up 4.69% to $33.48 at the end of Tuesday’s session, halting a four-day fall.
Weibo’s Hong Kong debut compares with a 15% average gain on the first session for 52 Chinese companies that started trading in the city in 2021 after raising more than $100 million each, according to Bloomberg data.
“China’s internet sector will continue to be weighed by regulatory uncertainty in 2022 after the rapid and broad-reaching moves by authorities in 2021 across a wide spectrum of companies,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Kanterman said in a note.
“The increased threat of delisting of U.S. shares by both U.S. and Chinese regulators as well as the broader regulatory overhang may keep valuations depressed,” the note added.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said on Wednesday 18 charges were filed in Melbourne County Court and are listed for sentencing on June 1, with each offence carrying a maximum penalty of A$180,000 ($128,484.00).
The unit, Avanteos Investments, was a part of wealth manager Colonial First State, in which CBA divested its majority shareholding last year.
ASIC said between Jan 6, 2016, and May 1, 2018, Avanteos issued defective disclosure statements for superannuation products, an organisational pension program in Australia, where it failed to tell the fund members they would be charged adviser service fees after their death.
As a result, 499 deceased members with funds in these superannuation products were charged almost A$700,000 in fees by Avanteos.
The company, which self-reported the issue to the regulating body in 2018, has since remediated all affected customers, ASIC, CBA and Avanteos said in separate statements.
Investment platform operator Avanteos came under the scanner during an investigation into the ""fees for no service"" conduct as part of the broader Royal Commission into the country's financial sector in 2018.
The inquiry unearthed widespread shortcomings across the industry, with charging the dead among the most common revelations.  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp admitted to civil penalty proceedings related to that charge just last week.

The social media giant's new ""office deferral program"" will ensure that its employees have flexibility in returning back to offices, Meta said.
Meta, formerly known as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), said it will also stick to its earlier plans that employees who can work remotely can request for full-time remote work.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co said on Wednesday it planned to invest 40 billion rupees ($530 million) to launch six electric vehicles in India by 2028, making a clean driving push in a country with some of the world's most polluted cities. 
Hyundai, India's second largest carmaker, will launch affordable and premium electric models including sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and sedans, starting with its first electric vehicle (EV) in 2022, said Tarun Garg, director sales and marketing for Hyundai Motor India.
""We want to be a key contributor to the EV story in India,"" Garg told Reuters.
The investment will be sunk into research and development to launch the six vehicles, Hyundai's Indian arm said in a release.
Stricter emission regulations by governments are propelling automakers globally to invest in EVs, sales of which are expected to increase to about a quarter of total global vehicle sales by 2030 from about 2% today.
In India, EVs account for less than 1% of total car sales, but the government is aiming for a share of 30% by 2030. 
Hyundai's plans also come as the world's biggest electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is preparing to launch its cars in India and has been lobbying the government reut.rs/3hWd2Ok to lower import duties on EVs.
Hyundai joins rivals  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) and Mahindra & Mahindra in throwing its weight behind EVs at a time when India is pushing automakers to go electric as it looks to reduce pollution and fuel imports. The country's top carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, however, is betting on alternate fuels and hybrid technology, and expects to launch EVs starting only in 2025. 
Hyundai's EVs will either be built on its dedicated electric global modular platform (E-GMP), which it plans to bring to India, or on a modified platform on which it currently builds its gasoline cars, Garg said. 
The cars built on its dedicated electric platform will have a range of up to 800 kilometres, whereas the others will be able to run for 350-400 kilometres on a single charge, he said.
The company in 2019 launched its Kona EV in India but sales were tepid as the price was high and charging infrastructure was negligible at the time. 
Garg said Kona taught the company the need to make its EVs affordable, while also providing different charging solutions. 

Hyundai is in talks with suppliers to locally source and manufacture components for its EVs, which will help it make the cars more affordable. In addition to providing home chargers, Hyundai is also looking to form strategic tie-ups to provide public charging facilities, Garg said. 
""Kona was about testing the waters in India. The learnings from it have given us the confidence to make this push,"" he said.

“This anecdotal evidence appears to have calmed financial markets, for now, as evidenced by the recovery in risk assets,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Carol Kong said in a note.
“But we caution against drawing conclusions from these early reports,” and unless omicron proves resistant to vaccines, “we expect the global economy will largely continue with its pre‑omicron recovery path,” the note added.
Other investors also warned that market volatility might not be done quite yet. Geopolitical tensions are also on the rise, with U.S. President Joe Biden warning Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin of “strong” measures if Russia invades Ukraine.
DoubleLine Capital LP CEO Jeffrey Gundlach predicted “rough waters” ahead for financial markets as the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to accelerate asset tapering and hike interest rates earlier than expected. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also warned dip buyers to proceed with caution amid the Fed’s hawkish stance as omicron spreads.
In other central bank news, the Reserve Bank of India will hand down its policy decision later in the day."

Gu Gang, an official appointed by the local government to resolve years-long debt risk at HNA, will no longer serve as the conglomerate's Communist Party secretary as the reorganisation had made progress, HNA said in a statement on social media. 
In the 2010s, HNA went on a $50 billion global acquisition spree, mainly fuelled by debt, to build an empire with stakes in businesses as varied as Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) to  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) Inc.
But its spending drew scrutiny from regulators at home and abroad. As concern grew over its mounting debt, it sold assets such as airport services provider Swissport and electronics distributor Ingram Micro to focus on airlines and tourism.

After creditors filed a petition, a Hainan court placed HNA into bankruptcy administration, and in September, Hainan Airlines said Fangda Group would become a strategic investor. 
Fangda Group is a conglomerate involved in carbon, steel and pharmaceutical sectors, with listed units such as Fangda Carbon New Material Co Ltd, Fangda Special Steel Technology Co Ltd and Northeastern Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd.

Microsoft asked job applicants for unnecessary immigration documents to prove they could work for the company without needing its sponsorship for work visas, the department said.
It said an investigation found that Microsoft discriminated against at least six lawful permanent residents based on their immigration status by asking them to show a Permanent Resident Card to prove they had permission to work without employer sponsorship.
Under the settlement, Microsoft will overhaul parts of its hiring process to ensure the company is following U.S. law, which prohibits employers from asking for documents when they are not required, the Justice Department said. 

“We hire and confirm employment eligibility for tens of thousands of people, and a handful were mistakenly asked for extra information or documentation,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. 
""We appreciate we need to prevent these mistakes and have worked to address these issues and improve our internal processes as part of our commitment to compliance,"" the spokesperson said.

""Many services have already recovered, however we are working towards full recovery across services,"" Amazon said on its status dashboard https://status.aws.amazon.com.
Amazon's Ring security cameras, mobile banking app Chime and robot vacuum cleaner maker iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), that use Amazon Web Services (AWS), reported issues according to their social media pages.

The company faced repayment on a $400 million dollar bond that came due Tuesday after it failed last week to win approval for a debt swap that would have extended its repayment deadline. A group of Kaisa noteholders sent the company a formal forbearance proposal on Monday, people familiar with the matter said, but the outcome was uncertain. No reason was provided for the trading suspension, which is its second halt in just over a month. 
Kaisa, which became first Chinese developer to default on dollar debt in 2015, now risks reneging on its debt obligations again. Its the nation’s third-largest issuer of dollar notes among property firms, and its stumble adds to contagion risk just as investors grapple with an escalating crisis at China Evergrande Group. 
Like Evergrande, Kaisa has been a frequent borrower in the offshore market with some $11.6 billion of dollar notes outstanding, even as it ranks just 27th among China’s property developer by sales. It had attracted strong demand from global investors after it returned in 2016 following a hiatus amid its restructuring.

The suspension comes after a source with direct knowledge of the matter said Kaisa was unlikely to meet its $400 million offshore debt deadline on Tuesday.
Non-payment by Kaisa would push the 6.5% bond of Kaisa, China's largest holder of offshore debt among developers after Evergrande, into technical default, triggering cross defaults on its offshore bonds totalling nearly $12 billion.
To avoid default, bondholders owning over 50% of notes due on Dec. 7 and Kaisa notes worth a total of $5 billion sent the company draft terms of forbearance late on Monday, a separate source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Even in the case of a technical default, Kaisa and offshore bondholders could discuss forbearance terms, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.

Kaisa, whose shares rose 1.1% on Tuesday, said it was open to discussion on forbearance, without elaborating.
Larger rival China Evergrande also did not make payments on some U.S. dollar bonds at the end of a month-long grace period, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday, setting the stage for a massive default by the world's most indebted property developer.

(Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) is adding Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) as custodians for its $2.3 trillion U.S. iShares exchange-traded funds, diversifying beyond long-time partner  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). 
The world's largest asset manager is also expected to add new service providers next year for the Ireland-based book of business for iShares.
BlackRock's decision to add custodians was telegraphed earlier, and State Street acknowledged in February that the company intended to move a ""significant portion"" of its ETF assets to other providers to diversify. The business State Street expected to move represented about 1.5% of its fee revenue, or roughly $140 million.
BlackRock said Citigroup will care for about 40% of the funds while JPMorgan handles 30% and BNY Mellon and State Street each take 15%.
BlackRock's iShares are the largest provider of ETFs with some $3 trillion in assets. 
Its decision to add more service providers underscores the surging popularity of ETFs. Assets in iShares, for example, have grown by roughly $1 trillion during the pandemic as investors poured record amounts of money into financial markets. 
The growth has made servicing these assets, a low-margin business that includes holding assets and processing trades, more attractive for banks, prompting more of them to try to get bigger pieces of the market. Competition has pushed down fees and could cut costs for consumers.
State Street said in a statement it will continue to provide services to iShares and ""a diverse set of BlackRock funds.""
Citigroup and JPMorgan said BlackRock's move endorsed their businesses.
JPMorgan's business has grown to more than $32 trillion of assets under custody from $20.5 trillion in 2016.
Roman Regelman, BNY Mellon’s chief executive of asset servicing and head of digital, said BlackRock’s move to add service providers is positive for the industry because it adds resiliency, encourages transparency and promotes innovation. 

Regelman said he was optimistic BNY Mellon would become a service provider for a substantial portion of the iShares’ European business to be awarded next year. That business, he said, has higher margins than the U.S. work.
""We already have a proposal in,"" he said, adding that he expected BlackRock to add fewer partners in Europe than it did in the United States.

PARIS (Reuters) -Nestle SA said on Tuesday it would cut its stake in L'Oreal to about 20% by selling shares worth 8.9 billion euros ($10 billion) back to the French cosmetics brand, moving to reduce the weight of the beauty giant on its books for the first time in 7 years.
The Nescafe maker's holding in the beauty giant has been subject of intense scrutiny over the years, and the Swiss company has maintained its interest was both financial and strategic, even when activist investor Third Point urged disposal in mid 2017. Since then, L'Oreal shares have more than doubled.
Seeking to reduce the weight of its L'Oreal holding while maintaining a level above 20%, allowing it to consolidate the investment on accounts, Nestle approached L'Oreal two months ago, kicking off a flurry of negotiations that involved chairmen of both companies, according to a source with knowledge of negotiations.
Following the deal, Nestle said it would own 20.1% of L'Oreal, down from 23.3% previously. L'Oreal, meanwhile, would buy back shares representing 4% of its capital and cancel them at the latest on Aug. 29.
L'Oreal, which is paying 400 euros per share, said the deal will have an accretive effect on the company's earnings per share of more than 4% in a full year. The beauty company is paying with cash and debt.
As a result of the transaction, which is expected to close in the coming days, the Bettencourt Meyers family, will see their stake rise to 34.7% from 33.3%, but will not be required to launch a takeover offer, as normally required for passing ownership thresholds above one-third of the capital.
L'Oréal (PA:OREP) stock ended Tuesday up 3.96% at 424.8 euros while Nestle gained 0.1% to 121.9 Swiss francs.
The packaged foods maker also said its board had decided to buy back 20 billion Swiss francs ($21.6 billion) worth of its shares between 2022 and 2024, adding that it would adjust this program should it make sizable acquisitions.
Nestle said it would terminate its current share repurchase plan by the end of the year, having bought back shares for 12.7 billion Swiss francs or almost two-thirds of the program volume.
L'Oreal around four years ago underscored https://reut.rs/3GqHqcP its readiness to buy Nestle's 23% stake if the Swiss shareholder was to sell it.
Nestle in October 2019 closed the sale of its skin health business for 10.2 billion Swiss francs, as the group moved to ditch underperforming businesses.
In 2014, Nestle reduced its holding from 31%. 
Centerview acted as lead adviser to L'Oreal for the transaction announced Tuesday.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s announcement of plans to take its self-driving car unit Mobileye (F:0ME) public in the United States next year pushed his shares to a 3% gain and cheered chip investors across the board. 
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index closed up 4.97% after hitting a near one-month low on Tuesday.
Investors were also reassured by positive news about the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which had helped send them fleeing from risky bets last week. 
Before market open, British drugmaker GSK said an antibody-based COVID-19 therapy it is developing with Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) was effective against all mutations of the Omicron variant.
That news added to the relief rally along with infectious disease official Anthony Fauci's comment on Tuesday that preliminary evidence indicates while Omicron likely has a higher degree of transmissibility, it appears to be less severe. Fauci had made similar comments on Sunday. 
""A week ago we saw a big scare because of Omicron and over the following week it appeared to be very contagious but less severe than people were worried about,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. 
Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, said the  Glaxosmithkline  (LON:GSK) headline was already ""instrumental to people's sentiment.""
He also cited the Intel news and investor bets that the market would see its traditional December boost, known as the Santa Claus rally.

(Reuters) -New Mexico has agreed to join a proposed nationwide settlement worth up to $21 billion resolving claims that the three largest U.S. drug distributors fueled a deadly opioid epidemic, the state's attorney general said on Tuesday.
The state was one of eight that until now was not participating in the landmark accord with McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH).
New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas said in a statement the settlement funds will ""allow us to move forward and start to rebuild our communities decimated by this crisis.""
The exact amount that will flow to New Mexico will depend on to what extent its local governments opt to join the deal.
The state did not agree to join a related $5 billion proposed settlement with the drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
AmerisourceBergen said in a statement it believed maximum settlement participation ""is in the best interest in all parties in order to expedite the delivery of meaningful relief to affected communities.""
Other distributors did not respond to requests for comment.
More than 3,300 lawsuits largely by state and local governments have been filed seeking to hold companies responsible for a drug abuse crisis the U.S. government says led over two decades to nearly 500,000 opioid overdose deaths by 2019.
The lawsuits accuse drugmakers of downplaying their painkillers' addictive risks and distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that the drugs were being diverted for illicit uses. The companies deny wrongdoing.
Several state attorneys general announced the proposed nationwide settlement in July. The distributors in September said 42 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., had joined it.
Cities and counties within participating states have through Jan. 2 to join as well. The state of Washington recently took the distributors to trial seeking billions of dollars more than it could recoup in the settlement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers sought to increase aircraft and Navy ship purchases in an effort to field a robust military and send a signal to Russia and China in a massive annual defense bill released on Tuesday.
The fiscal 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorizes nearly $770 billion in national defense and adds to the Pentagon's request for ship and aircraft purchases and increases troop pay.
The Biden Administration's original budget request from May was debated over the course of the year and the U.S. Congress released its compromise NDAA after Democrat and Republican leaders of the House of Representatives and Senate Armed Services committees negotiated what should be included in the bill.
The NDAA, which normally passes with strong bipartisan support, is closely watched by a broad swath of industry and other interests because it is one of the only major pieces of legislation that becomes law every year and because it addresses such a wide range of issues.
Jet maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) saw the bill increase F-15EX fighter jet funding to allow for the purchase of 17 planes. The Pentagon had requested 12 in May. Congress put funding for 12 Boeing-made F/A-18E/F Super Hornets into the bill, after the Pentagon requested zero.
Breaking a trend, the bill did not increase funding for the number of F-35 fighter jets made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT). 

The bill funds the procurement of 13 battle force ships including two Virginia-class submarines made by Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and three DDG 51 Arleigh Burke destroyers also made by General Dynamics.
Lawmakers included a range of efforts to push back against Russia and China in the massive annual defense bill including $300 million for Ukraine's military and a statement of support for the defense of Taiwan.

(Reuters) - Instagram said on Tuesday it will be stricter about the types of content it recommends to teens in the photo-sharing app and will nudge them toward different areas if they dwell on one topic for a long time.
In a blog post, the social media service announced a slew of changes for teen users. Instagram head Adam Mosseri is to testify in a congressional hearing on Wednesday about protecting kids online. 
Instagram and its parent company Meta Platforms Inc, formerly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), have been under scrutiny over ways their services could cause issues around the mental health, body image and online safety of younger users.
In the post, Mosseri also said Instagram was switching off the ability for people to tag or mention teens who do not follow them on the app. He said that starting in January, teen Instagram users would be able to bulk delete their content and previous likes and comments.
He said Instagram was exploring controls to limit potentially harmful or sensitive material suggested to teens through its search function, hashtags, short-form video Reels and its 'Suggested Accounts' feature, as well as on its curated 'Explore' page. 
The blog post also said that on Tuesday, Instagram was launching its 'Take a Break' feature in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, which reminds people to take a brief pause from the app after using it for a certain amount of time.
It said Instagram in March next year would launch its first tools for parents and guardians to see how much time their teens spend on the app and set time limits.
Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn criticized the company's product announcement as ""hollow,"" saying in a statement: ""Meta is attempting to shift attention from their mistakes by rolling out parental guides, use timers, and content control features that consumers should have had all along.""
An Instagram spokeswoman said it would continue its pause on plans for a version of Instagram for kids. Instagram suspended plans for the project in September amid growing opposition to the project.
The move followed a Wall Street Journal report that said internal documents, leaked by former Facebook employee Frances Haugen, showed the company knew Instagram could have harmful mental health effects on teenage girls, for example on their views of body image. Facebook has said the leaked documents have been used to paint a false picture of the company's work. 

State attorneys general and lawmakers had also raised concerns about the kids-focused app.
Last month, a bipartisan coalition of U.S. state attorneys general said it had opened a probe of Meta for promoting Instagram to children despite potential harms.

160,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 06:40PM ET</span>",Intel CEO aims to build chip plants with money raised from Mobileye IPO,"By Nivedita Balu and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) -Intel Corp will keep most of the money it raises next year when it sells a stake in its Mobileye (F:0ME) self-driving-vehicle components unit in a planned initial public offering, targeting some of those funds to build more Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) chip plants, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said on Tuesday.
Intel shares were up 4.1% at midday Tuesday after surging as much as 8% during the session, as Wall Street cheered the chip giant's move to take Mobileye public. Gelsinger said the IPO will allow Mobileye to grow more easily as global carmakers spend billions of dollars to accelerate their transition to electric and self-driving vehicles. 
""This is the right time,"" he said on a conference call. ""This is a unique asset and we're going to make the right moves to fully realize that potential."" 
Gelsinger said Intel will retain a majority stake in Mobileye and will also receive ""the majority of the proceeds"" from the IPO. He declined to specify the size of the stake that would be sold or a fundraising target, but said that ""certainly it will be helpful in our overall aggressive buildout of plants."" 
Intel has said it plans to build two chip plants in Arizona, and add other plants in the United States and Europe at sites that have not been announced.
A chip shortage has afflicted industries globally including the auto sector. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration wants Congress to approve $52 billion to expand U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.
Before Tuesday's gains, Intel shares had barely budged this year, vastly underperforming a more than 40% rise in the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index, as the chipmaker struggles to ramp up its technology as rivals have been making more energy-efficient microprocessors.
Mobileye, an Israeli company that Intel bought for about $15 billion five years ago, could be valued at more than $50 billion during its U.S. IPO in mid-2022, a source previously told Reuters. Gelsinger said that value would be set closer to the IPO and he declined to say how much of Mobileye will be sold, repeating Intel would retain a majority stake.
Mobileye has a rich roster of clients, including BMW, Audi, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Honda and General Motors (NYSE:GM). 

Its technology has been deployed by automakers as they equip their cars with driver-assistance systems or experiment with self-driving technology in their shift toward electric vehicles. Intel expects Mobileye's revenue to grow over 40% this year.
WestPark Capital analyst Ruben Roy liked the deal for the cash and greater strategic focus it could bring Intel. Roy said Mobileye should see compound annual growth of around 25% to 30% over the next several years.

(Reuters) - New travel restrictions prompted by the Omicron coronavirus variant have set back the nascent recovery in international flights, creating delays and headaches in some regions, according to airline and airport officials.
The flurry of new testing rules and border closings has raised concerns ahead of the important Christmas travel season, but some airline bosses said they hope any backward moves will be short-lived. Global airlines have blamed a patchwork of shifting rules for depressed demand for international travel, which is critical for their return to profit following steep COVID-19 pandemic-related losses in 2020.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) incoming Chief Executive Robert Isom told Reuters the Texas-based carrier's return to profitability is contingent on a full-scale recovery in travel demand. American has the largest debt stock in the U.S. airline industry.
""If there's anything (in the way), it just delays recovery,"" he said. 
He said the airline's domestic business remained strong but the new travel restrictions had dampened demand in some international markets.
Airline stocks have recovered some ground following a sell-off last week. While investors are taking heart from anecdotal evidence that suggests the new variant might not be as lethal as originally feared, it could take weeks, even months to know its effect on the course of the pandemic. 
U.N. agencies specializing in aviation and tourism pleaded on Tuesday for travel restrictions in response to new coronavirus variants to be imposed only as a last resort. 
Japan has banned foreigners, the United States is requiring a COVID-19 test 24 hours before flying, and travellers to Singapore now must be tested daily for seven days after arrival.
""We were seeing accelerating openings until Omicron,"" Campbell Wilson, chief executive of Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) budget offshoot Scoot, said at an event held in Sydney by market-intelligence company CAPA Centre for Aviation.
""We have seen basically a pause since then,"" Wilson added.
Airlines and travel agencies are hopeful that rising vaccination rates and new medicines would make a difference.
""This is not the spring of 2020,"" said Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) Inc's Chief Executive Glenn Fogel. ""Absolutely not.""
But Sue Carter, head of Asia Pacific at booking technology firm Travelport, said she has seen some searches go down week on week, adding that traveller confidence tends to be closely linked to government announcements. 
EVER-CHANGING RULES CAUSE CONFUSION 
A spokesperson for trade group Airports Council International (ACI) World said the global patchwork of travel rules is challenging airport operations and called for better coordination between countries. 
At Calgary International Airport, the line upon arrival is longer than it had been before the introduction last week of a plan by Canada to eventually test all passengers arriving from countries other than the United States, an airport spokesperson said.
The Public Health Agency of Canada did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
A Reuters reporter departing from a U.S. airport to Montreal last week had to repeatedly inform airline agents of an update that exempted Canadian passengers returning to the country after less than 72 hours abroad from needing a COVID-19 test. 

Rules brought in after the discovery of Omicron are just the latest in ""a constant state of change,"" said Leslie Dias of Unifor, the union that represents customer service workers at Air Canada among other carriers. In Australia, fully vaccinated travellers to Sydney and Melbourne must now isolate at their home or a hotel for 72 hours after arrival. An earlier policy of no isolation led Hawaiian Airlines to add five weekly Honolulu-Sydney flights starting this month, rather than an initial plan for three, its chief executive Peter Ingram said.
Qantas Airways Chief Executive Alan Joyce said his hope is that once more is known about Omicron, the 72-hour isolation requirement would be removed. ""We still haven't figured out whether this is a spanner in the works or a fly in the ointment,"" Association of Asia Pacific Airlines Director General Subhas Menon said of Omicron. ""From what we see now, it looks more like a fly in the ointment that is still good for using.""

The holiday-quarter is one of the busiest for the company as many consumers seek to buy its products as gifts, weeks ahead of Christmas.
However, after launching the iPhone 13 range and new iPads in September, a major threat looms over Apple as it scrambles to keep up with the global chip shortage and supply chain disruptions.
Chief Executive Tim Cook had told Reuters in October that the impact of supply chain challenges would be worse during the holiday sales quarter than it was in the previous quarter.
In October, for the first time in more than a decade, iPhone and iPad assembly was halted for several days due to supply chain constraints and restrictions on the use of power in China, Nikkei reported. 

Through September and October, the reallocation of the shared components squeezed iPad assembly even more, leading to about 50% less production volume than planned, while the production forecast for older generations of iPhones also dropped around 25%, Nikkei added. 
Additionally, Apple had told its parts suppliers demand for the iPhone 13 lineup has slowed, Bloomberg News reported last week.

Shares in the Menlo Park-based company were up 2.9% at $23.39 in extended trading.
Robinhood said it had been under a contractual obligation to let those early shareholders exit some of their stake but was now seeking a termination as the obligation had expired. 

In a regulatory filing in August, Robinhood had registered for the sale of nearly 98 million shares by early shareholders including ICONIQ Capital and Index Ventures, and noted that it would not receive any of the proceeds.
That had angered some retail investors, who groused in online forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has restricted employees' use of workplace messaging app Slack, hampering workers' ability to engage in protected speech and organizing, a former employee alleged in a complaint to a U.S. labor regulator filed on Tuesday. 
Slack, which allows individuals to create on-the-fly group conversations, was rolled out a few years ago by Apple and has become increasingly popular as a discussion forum during the pandemic, multiple employees have said. 
Apple employees who advocate for pay equity, remote work and other causes in the company have used it as well. On Oct. 25, according to the complaint by former worker Janneke Parrish to the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, Apple introduced moderation rules for the platform. 
""It gives the appearance of surveillance of employees' protected speech activities,"" said the complaint, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters. 
An Apple spokesperson declined to comment. The company has previously said it does not discuss specific employee matters but is ""deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace,"" taking ""all concerns"" from employees seriously. 
Apple's policy holds that workers cannot create new Slack channels ""without management's knowledge and support,"" according to the complaint, which includes a screenshot of a message detailing the policy. 
Posts about workplace concerns must be directed to a manager or the ""People Support"" group, according to the complaint. 

Parrish says she was fired in October after playing a leading role in employee activism. 
The charge comes amid a broader push by Silicon Valley workers to speak out about their working conditions and the impact of technology on society. The employee activism has been particularly striking at Apple, which is known for its secretive culture.

Below is the status of the cases, as well as government probes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Meta:
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a new complaint against Facebook in mid-August 2021, adding more detail on the accusation the social media company crushed or bought rivals and once again asking a judge to force the social media giant to sell Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency did so at the invitation of Judge James Boasberg, who had said that its previous effort fell short. Facebook has asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed with prejudice. 
Boasberg, however, threw out a related state lawsuit, saying the attorneys general had waited too long. 
Four lawsuits against Google:
The U.S. Justice Department sued Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google in October 2000, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals. A trial date was set for Sept. 12, 2023.
The government is preparing to file a second lawsuit focused on the company's digital advertising business.
A lawsuit by 38 U.S. states and territories accuses Google of abusing its market power to try to make its search engine as dominant inside cars, TVs and speakers as it is in cellphones. This was consolidated with the federal lawsuit for purposes of discovery. 
Texas, backed by other states, filed a separate lawsuit against Google in December 2020, accusing it of breaking antitrust law in how it runs its online advertising business.
Dozens of state attorneys general sued Google on July 7, alleging it bought off competitors and used restrictive contracts to unlawfully maintain a monopoly for its app store on Android phones.
Justice Department investigates Apple:
This probe, revealed in June 2019, appears to focus on Apple Inc's app store. Some app developers have accused Apple of introducing new products very similar to existing apps created by other developers and sold in the Apple Store, and then trying to banish the older apps from the store because they compete with Apple's new product. Apple says it seeks to have only the highest-quality apps in the app store.

Federal Trade Commission on Amazon:
In its investigation of, the FTC is likely looking at the inherent conflict of interest of Amazon competing with small sellers on its marketplace platform, including allegations that it used information from sellers on its platform to decide what products it would introduce.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Global equity markets and oil prices surged on Tuesday after a timely shot of Chinese stimulus helped spark a rally that was further fueled by views that the Omicron COVID-19 variant will not cause major economic damage. 
The Nasdaq jumped 3% as technology shares bounced back, helping the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European companies post its first back-to-back run of more than 1% gains since February.
Tech stocks climbed 5.6% in Europe, while the S&P information technology sector rose 3.5%, driving almost half of the S&P 500's gains. Semiconductors advanced 5.0% and all 11 of the S&P sectors rose. Growth rose 2.7%, outpacing value's 1.3% gain. 
Asia overnight cheered record bounces by some of China's beaten-down tech giants, including e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and other technology majors, including JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).
Portfolio managers did not want to be left behind in an impressive rally, helping drive equities higher, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""Did the seasonal Santa Claus rally, which we typically have at some point in December, start yesterday?"" he said. ""There's certainly fear of missing out.""
An easing of Omicron fears also emboldened investors to have a little more of a ""risk-on"" mentality, James said.
Preliminary evidence indicates that Omicron likely has a higher degree of transmissibility but is less severe, top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday.
MSCI's all-country world index advanced 2.1% in its biggest percentage gain since November 2020. The FTSEurofirst 300 in Europe closed up 2.42%.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.40%, the S&P 500 gained 2.07% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 3.03%.
Easing Omicron worries and the Chinese stimulus lifted riskier currencies, with the Australian dollar leading the charge, gaining 1.0%.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, pulled back at the session's end, up 0.03% to 96.324. The euro fell 0.19% at $1.1263, while the yen edged up 0.05% at $113.52. 
Expectations the Federal Reserve will accelerate the tapering of its bond-buying program when it meets next week in response to a tightening labor market also supported the dollar.
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 4.4 basis points to 1.479%.
Investors believe the Fed will do more, and sooner, to fight inflation, said David Petrosinelli, senior trader at InspereX, referring to a flattening of the yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes.
""The front end is focused on the Fed tightening policy because they need to, and the back end is more recognition that this economy probably is going to slow down in the first quarter,"" he said.
The equity gains came after China's central bank injected its second shot of stimulus since July by cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve.
Uncertainty about its property sector remained, however, as embattled China Evergrande teetered on the brink of a massive default. Evergrande failed to make payments on some U.S. dollar bonds at the end of a month-long grace period, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Australia's S&P/ASX200 rose nearly 1% as its central bank left interest rates at a super-loose 0.1% and Japan's Nikkei advanced 1.9% as the yen dipped. (T)
Oil prices climbed more than 3% on easing concerns Omicron will reduce demand and as the prospect of an imminent rise in Iranian oil exports receded.
Brent crude rose $2.36 to settle at $75.44 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up $2.56 to $72.05 a barrel.
Gold prices inched higher as attention turned to U.S. inflation data due on Friday, which could influence the pace at which the Fed hikes interest rates. 

U.S. gold futures settled up 0.3% at 1,784.70 an ounce.
Bitcoin rose 0.31% to $50,697.01.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and seven states on Tuesday settled claims accusing Vyera Pharmaceuticals of trying to block generic versions of its life-saving drug Daraprim, but are preparing for a Dec. 14 trial against accused mastermind Martin Shkreli.
Tuesday's settlement, worth up to $40 million, addressed claims in a Jan. 2020 lawsuit that Shkreli and co-defendant Kevin Mulleady launched Vyera with a goal of buying an important drug, raising the price, and using illegal anticompetitive strategies to thwart cheaper generics.
Vyera, then Turing Pharmaceuticals, allegedly protected its dominance of Daraprim by ensuring that generic drugmakers could not obtain samples for cheaper versions, and kept potential rivals from buying a key ingredient.
Shkreli gained notoriety in 2015 when he boosted the price of Daraprim overnight to $750 from $17.50 per tablet.
Daraprim is used to treat toxoplasmosis, a common parasitic infection that threatens people with weakened immune systems.
The settlement calls for Vyera to pay $10 million upfront plus up to $30 million over 10 years, and halt anticompetitive practices.
Mulleady, who like Shkreli was also a Vyera chief executive, agreed to a seven-year ban from most roles in the pharmaceutical industry.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan approved the accord. She would oversee Shkreli's trial.
Mulleady's lawyer Marc Kasowitz said his client ""vehemently"" denied the claims against him, but believed the resolution was best for him and the companies.
Vyera, its lawyers and Shkreli's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Shkreli is serving a seven-year prison term after his 2017 conviction for cheating investors in two hedge funds and trying to prop up the stock price of another drug company he led, Retrophin (NASDAQ:TVTX) Inc. He is eligible for release in October 2022.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose state co-led the lawsuit, welcomed the proposed settlement.
Alluding to a common nickname for Shkreli, James said the defendants ""shamelessly engaged in illegal conduct that allowed them to maintain their exorbitant and monopolistic price of a life-saving drug -- letting Pharma Bros get rich, while others paid the price.""

The S&P 500 rose 2%, and now is just about 1% below its all-time highs, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4%, or 492 points, the NASDAQ climbed 3%.
Tech jumped 4% as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) soared to a record high after Morgan Stanley hiked its price target on tech giant to $200 from $164.
Apple’s foray into new product categories including augmented reality and virtual reality, which will bolster its valuation, aren’t yet priced into its shares, according to Morgan Stanley.
Chip stocks were also in favor, underpinned by a surge in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as the chipmaker detailed plans to take Mobileye, its self-driving car business, public in 2022. Reports suggest the self-driving car business could fetch a valuation of about $50 billion, but some on Wall Street said that may be somewhat optimistic.
“We do struggle somewhat to understand why Mobileye (F:0ME) should command a $50B valuation,” Wedbush said in a note.
While the move is a positive for Intel, the transaction isn’t expected to change the company’s broader trajectory as its “struggles to maintain share in its core operations,” Wedbush added.
Sentiment on tech was also strengthened by a melt-up in cloud-related stocks following a 20% rally in  MongoDB  (NASDAQ:MDB) as the database reported a narrower than expected loss.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), meanwhile, held the bulk of its gains as the e-commerce behemoth said it had identified the cause of problems with its cloud services that caused outages across the internet, including Disney Plus, and Netflix.
Cyclicals corners of the market such as energy and financials racked up gains as investors cheered positive updates on Omicron.
The new variant is “almost certainly not more severe than the Delta [variant],” Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser said Tuesday.
In another positive development, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) said its monoclonal antibodies treatment was effective against the heavily mutated Omicron variant.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), meanwhile, was up 1% after data from South Africa indicated the company's vaccine provided partial protection against the omicron variant, Bloomberg reported.  
Energy followed oil prices higher as positive updates on Omicron and expectations that supply of Iranian crude isn’t likely “anytime soon” amid considerable differences on nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran, Commerzbank said in a note.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 03:51PM ET</span>","Uber, Deliveroo could be hit by draft EU rules for gig workers","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Uber (NYSE:UBER), Deliveroo and other online platform companies may have to reclassify some of their workers as employees under draft European Union rules meant to boost their social rights, according to an EU document seen by Reuters.
The proposal from the European Commission, the first in the world, comes as countries and courts around Europe try to address shortcomings in the gig economy, with judges in most cases backing the rights of workers to labour rights available to those working in brick-and-mortar shops.
The document estimates some 15 companies and between 1.7 million to 4.1 million workers out of 28 million could be affected by the rules, which set out five criteria for determining employees.
Gig economy workers could be classifed as employees if online platforms determine their pay, set conduct and appearance standards, supervise the performance of work through electronic means, restrict their ability to choose their working hours or tasks, and prevent them from working for third parties.
A platform company is considered an employer if it meets two of the criteria, the paper said.
The rules will also require ride-hailing, food delivery apps and other companies to provide information to employees on how their algorithms are used to monitor and evaluate them as well as for allocation of tasks and setting of fees. Employees can ask for compensation for breaches.
The rules place the burden on online platforms to provide evidence that these do not apply to them. They can also challenge their reclassification either via an administrative process or in a court.
EU countries could see an annual boost of between 1.6 billion and 4 billion euros in tax contributions from reclassified employees, the paper said.
The draft rules will need to be thrashed out with EU member states and EU lawmakers before they can be adopted, with the Commission estimating a 2025 time frame.
Sanctions for non-compliance, which can include fines, will be set by EU countries while national authorities which fail to put in place the necessary measures can face legal action by the Commission.
In a series of setbacks for online platforms, Britain's Supreme Court ruled in February that Uber drivers are entitled to workers' rights, such as the minimum wage, while a Spanish court said last year riders for Barcelona-based food delivery app Glovo were employees, not freelancers. 
Trade unions say the gig economy is exploitative while companies say the business model gives workers flexibility.

Estonian ride-sharing and food delivery startup Bolt said the draft rules could result in job losses. ""This will lead to one out of two drivers losing their job, which is close to at least 140,000 people across the EU,"" said Aurelien Pozzana, head of Public Policy Western Europe at Bolt.
Deliveroo voiced the same concerns. ""These proposals will increase uncertainty and will be better for lawyers than self-employed platform workers,"" a spokesperson said.

Investing.com —  AeroVironment  Inc (NASDAQ:AVAV) stock plunged 29% Tuesday on the back of its fiscal second-quarter 2022 results. Despite reporting earnings above expectations, the message from the company was one of cautiousness, with revenue failing to match or beat the consensus. 
""While we achieved second quarter and first-half results in line with our expectations, headwinds to our business have intensified in recent months, requiring us to reduce our full year outlook,"" said Wahid Nawabi, AeroVironment president and CEO.
AeroVironment announced adjusted earnings per share of 78 cents on revenue of $122 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated an adjusted EPS of 62 cents on revenue of $130.83 million.
The defense contractor, primarily involved in unmanned aerial vehicles, has seen its shares continuously slide since February this year, with today's fall to $56.70, exacerbating the decline.
There had been concerns about the company's performance in recent months due to a change in the competitive landscape. However, in October, RBC Capital analyst told investors that those concerns were overdone. 
One of, if not, the primary driver for today's share price fall is the company lowering its 2022 sales outlook to between $440 million and $460 million, from the previous $560 million to $580 million. Furthermore, its forecasted EPS for the period was also lowered to between $1.23 and $1.37 from $2.50 to $2.70. 
Nawabi said it was based on ""the negative impact from supply chain delays, extended procurement cycles due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, slower decision making in Washington tied to Continuing Resolution related budget uncertainties and staffing shortages have prevented us from realizing the growth and bottom line results expected at the start of this fiscal year. We are diligently working to manage expenses and other challenges in light of our revised outlook but are realistic regarding the lack of visibility within this ongoing environment.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 was in rally mode Tuesday, as easing fears about the impact of the Omicron Covid-19 variant and an Apple-led surge in tech pushed the broader market higher.
The S&P 500 rose 2.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.5%, or 516 points, the NASDAQ climbed 3.1%.
Tech jumped 4% as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) soared to a record high after Morgan Stanley hiked its price target on tech giant to $200 from $164.
Apple’s foray into new product categories including augmented reality and virtual reality, which will bolster its valuation, aren’t yet priced into its shares, according to Morgan Stanley.
Chip stocks were also in favor, underpinned by a surge in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as the chipmaker detailed plans to take Mobileye, its self-driving car business, public in 2022. Reports suggest self-driving car business could fetch a valuation of about $50 billion, but some on Wall Street suggest that may be somewhat optimistic.
“We do struggle somewhat to understand why Mobileye (F:0ME) should command a $50B valuation,” Wedbush said in a note.
While the move is a positive for Intel, the transaction isn’t expected to change the company’s broader trajectory as its “struggles to maintain share in its core operations,” Wedbush added.
Sentiment on tech was also strengthened by a melt-up in cloud-related stocks following a 20% rally in  MongoDB  (NASDAQ:MDB) as the database reported a narrower than expected loss.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), meanwhile, gave up gains as the e-commerce behemoth said it had identified the cause of problems with its cloud services that caused outages across the internet, including Disney Plus, Netflix, and Coinbase.

(Reuters) - Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co said on Tuesday a majority of its U.S. cereal plant workers have voted against a new five-year contract, forcing it to hire permanent replacements as employees extend a strike that started more than two months ago.
Temporary replacements have already been working at the company's cereal plants in Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Tennessee where 1,400 union members went on strike on Oct. 5 as their contracts expired and talks over payment and benefits stalled.
""Interest in the (permanent replacement) roles has been strong at all four plants, as expected. We expect some of the new hires to start with the company very soon,"" Kellogg spokesperson Kris Bahner said.
Kellogg also said there was no further bargaining scheduled and it had no plans to meet with the union.
The company said ""unrealistic expectations"" created by the union meant none of its six offers, including the latest one that was put to vote, which proposed wage increases and allowed all transitional employees with four or more years of service to move to legacy positions, came to fruition.
""They have made a 'clear path' - but while it is clear - it is too long and not fair to many,"" union member Jeffrey Jens said.
Union members have said the proposed two-tier system, in which transitional employees get lesser pay and benefits compared to longer-tenured workers, would take power away from the union by removing the cap on the number of lower-tier employees.

Several politicians including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have backed the union, while many customers have said they are boycotting Kellogg's products.
Kellogg is among several U.S. firms, including Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co, that has faced worker strikes in recent months as the labor market tightens.

By Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it plans to retire up to $5 billion in high-interest debt and tap into the fast-growing market for ""green"" bonds to help it finance new electric vehicles and expand credit to customers with lower scores.
Ultimately, the automaker aims to regain an investment grade rating for itself and Ford Credit, its captive financing arm, which in turn would lower the cost of future borrowing.
In a media briefing, Treasurer Dave Webb said the company is making a cash tender for ""covid bonds"" at 8% to 9.5% interest that it issued in April 2020, at the start of the global pandemic. 
Ford expects initially to offer a $1 billion green bond at 3.5% to 4% interest, to replace some of the high-coupon bonds and to supplement the zero-interest convertible debt it issued earlier this year.
Part of the money will help fund the automaker's ambitious plan to convert a significant portion of its global production from fossil-fueled combustion engine vehicles to battery-powered electric vehicles.
The company has said it plans to spend at least $30 billion through 2025 to design, engineer and manufacture a broad range of EVs in North America, China and Europe.
Ford is a leading seller of full-size pickup trucks and SUVs -- hugely profitable combustion engine vehicles that are still popular with U.S. customers.
A ""sustainable financing framework"" announced Thursday will provide Ford with access to new sources of capital, including investors supporting environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives. 
New green bonds would enable Ford Credit to extend financing to customers with lower credit scores, but would require them to buy electric or hybrid vehicles.
Thursday's announcement coincides with the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland and the fifth anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement.

Spain's two largest soccer clubs together with Athletic Bilbao - which are all owned by their members instead of by corporates - accused LaLiga's administrator of exceeding the organisation's legal authority and acting coercively.
""The clubs are sovereign members of LaLiga, not prisoners of its managers,"" they said in an open letter.
""All these issues are so serious that they oblige the clubs to take the necessary legal steps to protect their legitimate interests,"" they added, after listing several aspects of the CVC arrangement, such as those related to the clubs' audiovisual rights, they said were illegal.
The three clubs took legal action in September to challenge LaLiga's CVC deal.
The deal is, however, due to receive final approval on Dec. 10 and has been backed by 38 of the 42 clubs comprising LaLiga in a first round of voting. It would see the fund receive 11% of the league's television rights over the next 50 years in exchange for a one-off payment of 2.7 billion euros ($3.04 billion).
Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bilbao reject the deal and have advanced an alternative proposal which would see JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and HSBC jointly lend 2 billion euros in exchange for a fixed annual payment of 115 million euros for 25 years, a document seen by Reuters last week showed.
The three say their proposal would cost Spanish clubs around 900 million euros and clubs would retain control of their audiovisual rights. They say the CVC deal would have a price tag of 13.1 billion euros. 

LaLiga president Javier Tebas has strongly criticised the alternative proposal.

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co on Tuesday named former Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell to the newly created position of chief corporate affairs officer, overseeing corporate communications, government relations and global public policy.
Morrell is currently the executive vice-president of communications and advocacy at oil and gas company BP (NYSE:BP), and is credited with helping repair the company's reputation after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon industrial disaster. He assumes his new role at Disney on Jan. 24, joining the media company as it navigates the disruptions of a global pandemic and the streaming media revolution.
""Just as we have re-imagined how we bring our creativity to the world with new platforms, we must also continually evolve how we tell the story of our great company,"" CEO Bob Chapek wrote in a memo Tuesday to Disney staff announcing Morrell's appointment. 
Morrell will also hold the title of Senior Executive Vice President, replacing Zenia Mucha who will be retiring from Disney shortly after the year-end.
The appointment marks a homecoming for Morrell, who worked as a desk assistant at Disney-owned ABC News in New York and Washington, D.C., while attending college and graduate school. He began his reporting career in 1992, covering the presidential campaign of Bill Clinton, and later re-joined ABC News as White House correspondent from 2004 to 2007. 
From 2007 to 2011, Morrell served as Pentagon press secretary and as the chief spokesman for Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and the U.S. military. He was appointed by President George W. Bush and continued to serve in that role under President Barack Obama.
Morrell joins Disney in a period of transition for the entertainment giant. 

Bob Iger, who stepped down as Disney's CEO in 2020 after 15 years in the role, will leave the company by the end of this month. The Mouse House also recently tapped Susan Arnold to become its first woman chair.

The billionaire entrepreneur is escalating criticism about the administration and Democrats for a proposal to give union-made, U.S.-built electric vehicles an additional $4,500 tax incentive. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and foreign automakers do not have unions at their U.S. factories. 
""Honestly, it might be better if the bill doesn't pass,"" Musk said at the WSJ CEO Council Summit. 
""I'm literally saying get rid of all subsidies,"" he said, adding that the government should ""get out of the way and not impede progress.""
Tesla has benefited from a variety of government aid and programs.
Since 2019, Tesla generated more than $3 billion revenue from selling regulatory credits to other automakers falling short of meeting government emissions standards. The rise in the income helped Tesla start making annual profits last year.
The company acquired its Fremont, Calif., assembly plant from the government as it restructured General Motors (NYSE:GM). Tesla also received a $465 million low-cost loan from the Department of Energy, which it repaid early. 
Tesla also benefited from a $7,500-per-vehicle federal tax credit. That credit applied in full to the first 200,000 Teslas sold, and then phased out.
In his comments on Monday, Musk also reiterated opposition to a proposal by Democrats to tax billionaires.
""It does not make sense to take the job of capital allocation away from people who have demonstrated great skill ... and give it to, you know, an entity that has demonstrated very poor skill in capital allocation, which is the government.""

Musk said his brain-chip startup, Neuralink, hopes to begin human trials next year pending approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
""I think we have a chance with Neuralink of being able to restore full body functionality to someone who has a spinal cord injury,"" he said.

The analyst believes that given Ambarella's auto business has higher growth and an expanding opportunity funnel, investors are likely to re-assess Ambarella's current share price.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department's crime fighting arm on Tuesday moved to expand reporting requirements for certain domestic and foreign companies as part of a broader push to crack down on corruption and shell companies.
A new rule would implement reporting provisions under the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, aimed at expanding data on who actually owns or controls a company and closing loopholes in existing U.S. law.
The proposed rule would require affected companies to report their identity to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), as well as the name, birth date, address and a unique identifying number for each of its owners. 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the rule marked a ""major step toward addressing the gaps in our corporate transparency framework that allow corruption to flourish and illicit funds to flow into the United States.
""The rule will help close the loopholes that undermine U.S. national security, bolster economic fairness and protect the integrity of our financial system,"" she said.
FinCEN said the proposed rule reflected the Biden administration's push to crack down on shell companies used to launder the proceeds from corruption, drug and arms trafficking or terrorist financing.
U.S. officials will highlight these efforts at a Summit of Democracies that President Joe Biden is hosting this week and work closely with foreign countries to enact tougher rules, a Treasury official said.
The agency on Monday unveiled plans to improve authorities' ability to monitor and stem the growing use of all-cash real estate transactions to launder illicit funds.

Tuesday's proposed rule would establish a framework for all affected companies to report on the ""beneficial owners"" of entities formed in the United States, as well as foreign entities registered to do business here. 
The official said examples of criminal proceeds and ill-gotten gains being laundered though shell companies include a Russian arms dealer nicknamed the ""Merchant of Death"" who allegedly sold weapons to a terrorist organization, a Venezuelan treasurer who received over $1 billion in bribes, and executives from a supposed investment group that carried out a Ponzi scam.

(Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc CEO Doug Parker will hand over the reins of the No. 1 U.S. airline to president Robert Isom on March 31, the company said on Tuesday, sending its shares up 2% in morning trade.
Parker will continue as chairman, while Isom will join the carrier's board after he takes over as CEO. 
Isom, a longtime airline industry executive, took over as president in 2016 and has overseen operations, planning, marketing and pricing.
The leadership change comes as the industry recovers from the lows hit during the pandemic but faces operational challenges due to the threat posed by the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Isom faces the challenge of repairing American's balance sheet as the pandemic has left it with the largest debt stock in the U.S. airline industry. He will also have to work on improving relations with the company's labor unions.
In an interview, Isom said American would focus on returning to profitability as soon as possible and delivering a reliable service. He also aims to pay down a lot of debt.
""We're going to be really focused on making sure that we have an appropriate level of leverage,"" Isom told Reuters.
Returning to profitability, however, is contingent upon a full recovery in travel demand. Isom said while the airline's domestic business remained strong, new travel restrictions following the Omicron variant's discovery had dampened demand in some international markets.
""If there's anything, it just delays recovery,"" he said.
Isom, 58, has been playing a key role in developing American's strategy before and through the pandemic.
Analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said he would bring broad experience to the job and the leadership change was unlikely to result in a deviation from the strategy, focused on fleet renewal and alliances, under Parker.
""Given Mr. Isom's lengthy history with Mr. Parker, this transition was likely in place for a significant period of time,"" they wrote in a note.
A 'THOUGHTFUL AND WELL-PLANNED' SUCCESSION
In a letter to employees, Parker said the transition was the result of a ""thoughtful and well-planned multi-year process"", dating back to Isom's elevation to president in 2016.
Parker, 60, said the transition would have happened sooner if it was not for the pandemic, which brought the airline industry to its knees.
""While we still have work to do, the recovery from the pandemic is underway and now is the right time to make the transition,"" he said.
Parker, one of the longest-serving chief executives in the airline industry, is known for overseeing consolidation in the industry as well as leading it through crises.
He took the reins at America West Airlines just 10 days before the 9/11 attacks. When America West merged with US Airways in 2005, Parker continued as CEO of the combined company. 
He was named chairman and CEO of American Airlines in 2013 after its merger with US Airways.
He was also instrumental in negotiating a COVID-19 relief package for the industry, which carriers say has saved thousands of jobs, prevented bankruptcy and put it in a position to support the economy's recovery from the pandemic.
Under Parker, American expanded overseas and took on low-cost carriers at home, sparking a fare war. He formed strategic partnerships with Alaska Airlines and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp to compete in markets where other carriers had an advantage.

The alliance with JetBlue, however, has invited lawsuits from the U.S. Justice Department and six states.
In June, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co named company veteran Robert Jordan as CEO in place of Gary Kelly, who will step down next year.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) will begin overhauling how users report harmful tweets in an effort to make it easier for people to describe what is wrong with the content they are seeing, the social networking site said on Tuesday.
The move, which will begin with a small test of Twitter Web users in the United States, comes amid widespread criticism that tech companies including Twitter, Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube are doing too little to shield users from harmful or abusive content online.
Instead of requiring users to report how a tweet violates Twitter's rules, which presumes knowledge of the company's policies, users will be asked whether they felt they have been attacked with hate, harassed or intimidated with violence or shown content related to self-harm, among other concerns.
Users will also be allowed to describe in their own words why they are flagging the content, Twitter said.
The process is akin to a doctor asking a patient about their symptoms and ""where does it hurt?"" rather than ""is your leg broken?"" the company said.
""In moments of urgency, people need to be heard and feel supported,"" Brian Waismeyer, a data scientist on Twitter's health user experience team, said in a statement. 

Twitter added that the new process will allow it to gather more granular information on tweets that do not explicitly violate its rules, but that users might nonetheless find problematic or upsetting, which will help the company update its policies in the future.
It is the latest of recent changes that Twitter has made to improve user safety. Last month, the company said it would begin prohibiting the sharing of ""personal media"" such as photos and videos without the consent of the person.

PARIS (Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) proposed raising book delivery charges in France to around 2 euros from almost nothing if parliament withdrew a bill that would make it more difficult for the e-commerce group to undercut local bookshops, a French senator told Reuters.
Senator Laure Darcos said Amazon had made the proposal for a minimum delivery charge of 1.80-2.00 euros ($2.03-$2.25) when its vice president for Books and Kindle content, David Naggar, met Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot on Aug. 25 in Paris.
""They were ready to increase shipping costs to 1.80-2.00 euros outside of premium subscription costs to align more closely with the delivery charges of other goods on one condition: that we withdraw our bill so that it did not benefit bookstores,"" Darcos told Reuters.
The proposal, details of which have not previously been reported, was part of a months-long lobbying push by Amazon to kill the bill, Darcos and five other lawmakers said.
Amazon declined to confirm the meeting took place. When asked what was said at the Aug. 25 meeting Amazon did not comment.
Independent bookshops are held with special affection in France, the land of Victor Hugo and Simone de Beauvoir. But they are under pressure from online retailers like Amazon, Fnac and Leclerc, which have eroded their market share. Of 435 million books sold in France in 2019, more than 20% were bought online.
The bill would fix its own minimum price for shipping books in France with the aim of going someway to levelling the playing field for independent book stores.
Free delivery of books is currently banned in France. Amazon currently charges a single centime (cent) compared with 5-7 euros ($5.82-8.15) for local bookstores. 
Darcos, who drafted the bill, was not present at the Aug. 25 meeting but was briefed by an official in the room. 
A second lawmaker briefed by a person with first-hand knowledge of the meeting confirmed a proposal in the region of 2 euros had been made. A third lawmaker informed of the meeting said the figure ""sounded right"".
Bachelot's office confirmed the meeting with Seattle-based Naggar had taken place but declined to comment on the exchange.
HIGHER PRICES
Darcos said the proposal was repeated to her at a separate meeting by Yohann Benard, Amazon's public affairs director for southern Europe.
She said the company was concerned that the French legislation - which does not name Amazon - might set a precedent. Amazon did not comment.
President Emmanuel Macron's government refused to budge, and parliament is expected to pass the bill on Dec. 19, after which a minimum shipping price for books must be agreed with the regulator before it becomes law. 
Amazon says the legislation would make books more expensive for French consumers, especially those in rural areas far from any bookstore.
An Amazon spokesperson told Reuters more than 40% of its book deliveries in France went to postal codes without a bookstore. A raised minimum shipping fee would cost French consumers an estimated 250 million euros a year, the Amazon spokesperson added.
The law would only increase Amazon's margins, company officials told the second lawmaker aware of the Aug. 25 meeting, who requested anonymity because Amazon's operations are a sensitive matter in her constituency.
The same lawmaker said Amazon had proposed the price floor for the period until April 2022, when France elects its next president.
Amazon did not comment.
The Ministry of Culture previously told Reuters that Amazon's pricing strategy had resulted in a single operator taking a growing market share. 

French bookstore owners widely attribute their survival to a 1981 law that prohibits price discounting of new books.

(Reuters) - Chat platform Discord will launch a pilot test to let content creators sell subscriptions for access to their online communities, the company said on Tuesday, as it aims to keep up with the burgeoning creator economy.
Social media personalities in worlds as varied as entertainment, fashion and cryptocurrencies are increasingly earning money from their fans by gatekeeping content behind subscriptions sold through sites like Patreon or charging for access to their YouTube videos. 
Discord, which lets online communities or ""servers"" talk with each other over calls, video or text, now aims to offer this feature natively on its service.
""Naturally we want creators to be successful, and we need to make running communities (on Discord) more sustainable,"" said Derek Yang, lead product manager at Discord.
Creators can offer up to three tiers of membership to their Discord community and set the price between $2.99 and $99.99 per month.
Creators will also be able to see analytics data so they can better understand how their business is performing, such as how much revenue they are earning per membership tier, Discord said.

The pilot test will begin with a small group of creators to start, before it is made more widely available. 
(This story corrects fifth paragraph to show membership price can go up to $99.99 per month, not $9.99)

So, we think it could be wise to scoop up quality cybersecurity stocks NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK), Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS), and Radware (NASDAQ:RDWR) because they are well-positioned to benefit from the industry tailwinds. Furthermore, the dip in their share prices offers an attractive entry point. Read on.The economy was gradually recovering when the reports of a new variant of COVID-19 named omicron, first discovered in South Africa, posed a new concern for investors. The markets have remained volatile because investors have been treading carefully over the past few weeks due to rising COVID-19 infections in Europe and record-high U.S. inflation data for October. However, initial reports suggest that the fears related to the COVID-19 omicron variant may have been exaggerated because the variant has so far been found to cause mild illness.
With digitization sweeping across various industries, the need for cybersecurity has grown significantly. With data now being considered the new oil, it has become increasingly important for enterprises to spend on cybersecurity to protect their data from breaches. According to a Research and Markets report, the global cybersecurity market is expected to grow at a 9.7% CAGR to $345.40 billion by 2026.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to buy the dip in quality cybersecurity stocks NortonLifeLock Inc. (NLOK), Qualys, Inc. (QLYS), and  Radware Ltd.  (RDWR), given their impressive growth potential.

However, with analysts expecting a market correction soon, many recent IPOs that are not backed by solid fundamentals could witness significant declines in their share prices. Thus, we think it might be best to avoid recently listed stocks DiDi Global (DIDI), Toast, Inc. (TOST), Full Truck Alliance (YMM), and Marqeta (MQ), which have already plunged more than 40% in price since being listed. Let’s discuss.The total exit value of United States’ public listings surpassed$1 trillion after the automotive company Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) went public in November. The figure, while emphasizing the market’s warm reception for recent initial public offerings (IPOs) and other new entrants, also underscores concerns about the disconnect between the valuations and fundamentals of these companies, which lack historical data.
Market bull Jim Paulsen of the investment management firm Leuthold Group has predicted a 10% to 15% market correction due to high valuations and federal policies becoming less accommodating. In addition, smaller companies are bearing the brunt of the recent market swings.
Given this scenario, we think it might be best to avoid the recent IPOs of companies with weak fundamentals, such as DiDi Global Inc. (DIDI), Toast, Inc. (TOST), Full Truck Alliance Co. Ltd.

After a brief dip, oil prices have rebounded sharply as concerns about the COVID-19 omicron variant have eased. Wall Street analysts expect oil & gas stocks Crescent Point (CPG) and TransGlobe (TGA), which are currently trading at less than $10, to rally by more than 25% in the near term. So, read on for details on these names.The United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated in its short-term energy outlook report that 98.90 million b/d of petroleum and petroleum and liquid fuels were consumed internationally in October, which is about 4.50 million b/d greater than October 2020. Furthermore, EIA predicts that global consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels will increase by 3.30 million b/d in 2022.
For the first nine months of this year, the 24 most significant oil and gas companies posted a combined profit of $174 billion. They also registered a $74 billion profit in the third quarter alone, due to skyrocketing gasoline prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. government agencies said on Tuesday that they and the European Commission have launched a dialogue focused on competition policy and enforcement in the technology sector.
The U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced the latest initiative, after Washington and Brussels in September launched the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council.
The council aims to deepen transatlantic cooperation, strengthen semiconductor supply chains, curb China's non-market trade practices and take a more unified approach to regulating big, global technology firms. 
With the United States and Europe trying to restrain the growing power of American tech giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), such cooperation has become vital to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic who want to make it harder for the U.S. tech industry to fight new rules. 
The latest effort, called the EU-U.S. Joint Technology Competition Policy Dialogue, was launched on Tuesday by Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager of the European Commission, Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan and Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of DOJ's Antitrust Division.

It will ""include sharing insights and experience with an aim towards coordinating as much as possible on policy and enforcement,"" the statement said.
The joint dialogue will include high-level meetings as well as regular staff discussion focused on the shared competition enforcement and policy issues arising in technology markets, the statement said.

Investing.com — Evgo Inc (NASDAQ:EVGO) said Tuesday that it has been selected by the State of California for proposed awards of various grants from the California Air Resources Board to install new high-powered direct current fast chargers.
The installation of the chargers will help the state meet its transport electrification goals. In addition, the push to boost EV charging infrastructure across the U.S. aims to accelerate EV adoption, which has resulted in a race between EV charging firms to become dominant players in the market. 
It has also resulted in shares of these companies rallying on any announcement of new deals. Today's news saw EVgo shares climb to a high of $12.49 before retracing to around the $11.70 mark. 
The five proposed awards are funded by the California Volkswagen Mitigation Environmental Trust and support, which provides around $423 million to mitigate excess emissions caused by the dieselgate scandal, which saw VW use illegal emissions testing defeat devices.
EVgo currently has over 330 sites and 820 fast-charging stations throughout California. The new sites will add five more fast-charging locations and 38 charging stalls, including one large site in Los Angeles. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Starbucks Corp on Tuesday lost its bid with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to delay a union election at three of the coffee chain's locations in Buffalo, New York.
Workers received ballots in the mail in November and began sending them in. The NLRB will count them up on Thursday, but the company had tried to delay the tally with its objection to parts of the election process. The NLRB decision means that a vote count will go forward.
A union win at any U.S. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) location would be a blow to the company's image as it has touted itself as a progressive, worker-friendly employer. 
It could also spur workers at more locations to organize, especially in a tight labor market that has forced restaurant chains to increase pay and benefits in an effort to attract more employees.
When asked for comment, Starbucks referred to remarks released earlier Tuesday by Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson, who addressed employees in a letter.
""We respect the process that is underway and, independent of any outcome in these elections, we will continue to stay true to our Mission and Values,"" he wrote.

Richard Bensinger, an organizer with Workers United, the union organizing Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors, said in a statement that ""the bullying and intimidation by Starbucks will not work."" Workers United is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union.
Starbucks had contested some election rules. It argued that the NLRB should have allowed workers at all approximately 20 Buffalo area locations to vote in one election, instead of letting each store decide on its own.

Shares of the planemaker rose 2.5% in morning trade following the announcement.
The order is a boost for Boeing, which said last month that it had delivered 212 737 MAX jets this year, as it tries to recover from the fallout of the pandemic and a safety scandal caused by two fatal crashes of the planes.
Boeing has stepped up deliveries of the aircraft this year on an air-travel rebound that helped the company book massive orders, including a deal to sell 200 737 MAX jets to United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc.
Its larger 787 Dreamliner aircraft, however, has been hobbled by production problems.

777 Partners, which owns a stake in Canadian low-cost carrier Flair Airlines, had in March placed an order for 24 737 MAX jets, with an option to purchase 60 more.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian banks may struggle to see an immediate boost to their net interest margins next year even as interest rates tick up due to their outsized reliance on mortgages, particularly if growth in that more profitable business and credit card lending is hindered by supply bottlenecks and surging inflation.
With interest rates near record lows, the average net interest margin (NIM) at the six major lenders' Canadian banking units fell 10 basis points to 2.34% from a year earlier, with executives attributing the declines largely to loan books dominated by mortgages. 
Despite their lower returns, mortgages now account for about 67% of domestic loans, from 64.5% two years ago. The six top banks, which reported their fourth-quarter results last week, posted mortgage growth of 11% in Canada in the period from a year ago, with the pace accelerating in each of the past several quarters. Lending outside of home loans increased 5.9% in the past quarter, which, while improving, still lags the pace of growth before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
With money markets expecting the Bank of Canada to hike interest rates five times next year, net interest margins should rise at a pace similar to that of past cycles. 
But ""an interest rate increase would take a little bit more time to work through the banks' margins, given the composition"" of loans, said Rob Colangelo, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service.
Banks and investors have been lamenting the pressure on NIMs resulting from the central bank's pandemic-related rate cuts, which have narrowed the gap between what they paid out in deposits and the interest they earned on loans. That has weighed on interest income, making the banks more reliant on fee income to drive profits.
COST PRESSURES
Banks are likely to face further cost pressures from higher expenses, driven by surging inflation and planned business investments.
""It's a significant challenge, and highlights the importance of revenue growth,"" said James Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones. ""They have to generate some loan growth and margin expansion or they're going to have a difficult time outgrowing their operating expense growth."" 
Banks including Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect NIMs to stabilize over the next few quarters and rise alongside interest rates. CIBC also hopes to get an additional boost from its acquisition of the Canadian Costco (NASDAQ:COST) credit card portfolio, which is expected to close early next year.
The recent jump in variable-rate mortgages, which reprice higher when the central bank lifts interest rates, could mitigate some of the weight of home loans in banks' portfolios, Colangelo said. 
But while variable-rate loans accounted for more than 54% of new mortgages in September, they made up only a quarter of all outstanding home loans, according to Bank of Canada data, so the benefits are likely to be limited.
If the central bank were to raise its key interest rate by 100 basis points next year, BMO executives said the bank's net interest income would increase by C$384 million in fiscal 2022. They added that the figure could double if BMO retains its current deposit levels, and forecast that margins will stabilize, and rise, if rates trend higher. 

Mike Clare, portfolio manager at Brompton Group, is hopeful of a margin recovery as interest rates rise, but warned the additional complications from the pandemic could delay a recovery in business lending. 
""The biggest uncertainty is around the new variant and what that may do to business activity,"" he said, referring to the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant. ""We could potentially have an environment where growth isn't as high as expected but inflation remains elevated.""

ZURICH (Reuters) -ABB unveiled higher sales and profitability targets on Tuesday as the Swiss engineering company expects to benefit from higher demand from rebounding economies and trends such as decarbonisation and shrinking workforces.
The maker of industrial automation and factory robots expects annual sales to increase in a range between 4% and 7% over the economic cycle, up from the 3% to 5% annual growth rate it previously targeted.
In the new goals, announced ahead of its capital markets day on Tuesday, ABB also raised its profitability target from 2023.
Still, the new goals failed to appease Cevian Capital, the activist investor which previously campaigned for the separation of ABB's power grids business, and which recently said ABB should further streamline its operations.
ABB said it was well placed to benefit from trends like the demand for increased energy efficiency, and rising labour costs and shrinking working age populations were also driving demand for industrial automation and robots.
""Our technology leadership in electrification and automation, aligned with sustainability and the global megatrends ... gives us a competitive edge,"" said Chief Executive Bjorn Rosengren.
ABB also sharpened its goal for profit margin as measured in operational earnings before interest, tax, and amortisation (EBITA) to ""at least"" 15% from its previous goal of 13% to 16%. During pandemic-hit 2020, ABB posted a margin of 11.1%.
ABB shares finished the day 1% higher.
ABB also said it would float its E-mobility electric vehicle charging business, with an initial public offering planned for Switzerland in the first half of 2022.
Reuters previously reported the business could be valued at around $3 billion.
CEO Rosengren said ABB had made progress implementing his plan to decentralise the company's sprawling operations, but could still do more.
""Over the last 24 months, ABB has made solid progress in implementing its decentralised organisation and improving quality of revenues,"" the former Sandvik CEO said in a statement. ""But we are still not where we want to be.""
Cevian, ABB's third biggest shareholder with a 5.16% stake according to Refinitiv data, was not satisfied.
""We see significantly greater potential in ABB beyond the company's new stated targets,"" said Cevian managing partner Christer Gardell.

""We see no reason why ABB should not perform at least in line with its main competitor, Schneider - which has an organic growth target of more than 5% and a margin target of 18-19%, and expect ABB to close the significant valuation gap to its more focused competitors,"" Gardell added.
ABB declined to comment on Gardell's statement.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The five-year agreement was made when Cook made visits to China in 2016 to quash a host of regulatory action against the company, the report said, citing interviews and internal Apple documents.
Cook lobbied Chinese officials, who believed the company was not contributing enough to the local economy, and signed the agreement with a Chinese government agency, making concessions to Beijing and winning key legal exemptions, the report added.
Some of Apple's investment in China would go toward building new retail stores, research and development centers and renewable energy projects, the report said, citing the agreement.

China is one of Apple's largest markets with annual sales growth of 83% in the country in its fiscal fourth quarter.
As part of the agreement, Apple promised to use more components from Chinese suppliers in its devices, sign deals with Chinese software firms, collaborate on technology with Chinese universities and directly invest in Chinese tech companies, the Information report said.

208,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 12:38PM ET</span>",China's Evergrande edges closer to default after missing debt deadline,"By Clare Jim, Scott Murdoch and Andrew Galbraith
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China Evergrande did not make payments on some U.S. dollar bonds at the end of a month-long grace period, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday, setting the stage for a massive default by the world's most indebted property developer.
Adding to a liquidity crisis in China's once bubbling property market, smaller peer Kaisa Group Holdings was also unlikely to meet its $400 million offshore debt deadline on Tuesday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
Failure by Evergrande to make $82.5 million in interest payments due last month would trigger cross-default on its roughly $19 billion of international bonds and put the developer at risk of becoming China's biggest defaulter – a possibility looming over the world's second-largest economy for months.
Non-payment by Kaisa would push the 6.5% bond of Kaisa, China's largest holder of offshore debt among developers after Evergrande, into technical default, triggering cross defaults on its offshore bonds totalling nearly $12 billion.
Evergrande did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. Kaisa, which in 2015 became the first Chinese developer to default on an offshore bond, declined to comment.
No holders of two bonds issued by China Evergrande Group's unit Scenery Journey Ltd had received overdue coupon payments as of 1400 GMT on Tuesday, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. 
Another four sources holding the bonds confirmed they had not received payment. All declined to be named as they were not authorised to talk to the media.
""From our point of view it has been a question of when, not if - the scale of the interest payments and then early next year redemption payments has made this (default) seemingly inevitable,"" said one bondholder, declining to be named. 
Evergrande was once China's top property developer, with more than 1,300 real estate projects. With $300 billion of liabilities, it is now at the heart of a property crisis in China this year that has crushed almost a dozen smaller firms.
The government has repeatedly said Evergrande's problems can be contained and moves to boost liquidity in the banking sector along with the firm's plans to forge ahead with a restructuring of its overseas debt have helped reassure global investors. The provincial government of Guandong, where Evergrande is based, stepped in last week to help manage the fallout, reinforcing the view that its failure would be managed.
Evergrande has not issued any communication to bondholders about the missed payment, one of the five sources said.
The developer had said on Monday it had established a risk-management committee that included officials from state entities to assist in ""mitigating and eliminating the future risks"".
That came after it said creditors had demanded $260 million and it could not guarantee funds to repay debt, prompting the authorities to summon its chairman and reassure markets that broader risk could be contained.
Rating agency S&P said on Tuesday the $260 million repayment demand showed Evergrande's liquidity remained ""extremely weak"", with a default looking inevitable especially given maturities totalling $3.5 billion in March and April 2022.
China's property market has for years been an engine of growth for the world's second-biggest economy. Investors, policymakers and central bankers are now trying to calculate the global knock-on effects if the major developer defaults.
BUSINESS MODEL SCUTTLED
So far, any Evergrande fallout has been broadly contained in China and with policymakers becoming more vocal and markets more familiar with the issue, consequences of its troubles are less likely to be widely felt, market watchers have said.
State involvement and hope of managed debt restructuring helped lift Evergrande stock as much as 8.3% a day after diving 20% to a record closing low. Still, it ended Tuesday up only 1.1% while its bonds continued to trade at distressed levels.
Notes due on Nov. 6, 2022, - one of two tranches with a coupon payment deadline that passed on Monday midnight in New York - traded at 18.282 cents on the dollar, Duration Finance data showed, little changed from a day earlier.
Founded in 1996, Evergrande epitomised a freewheeling era of borrowing and building. But that business model was scuttled by hundreds of new rules designed to curb developers' debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.
Evergrande became one of several developers subsequently starved of liquidity, prompting offshore debt default and credit-rating downgrades, and a plunge in the value of developers' stocks and bonds.
A string of developers have scrambled to raise funds by selling shares and assets. Only some have found takers.
Shimao Group and Logan Group both announced on Tuesday a top-up share placement to raise around $150 million each, while Guangzhou R&F Properties said it had agreed to sell a 30% stake in a Guangzhou logistics park.
For Kaisa, the risk of defaulting emerged after it failed to make a notes exchange deal with bondholders last week.
To avoid default, bondholders owning over 50% of notes due on Dec. 7 and Kaisa notes worth a total of $5 billion, sent the company draft terms of forbearance late on Monday, a separate source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Even in the case of a technical default, Kaisa and offshore bondholders could discuss forbearance terms, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Kaisa, whose shares rose 1.1% on Tuesday, said it was open to discussion on forbearance, without elaborating.

Sources previously said bondholders had offered Kaisa $2 billion in funding last month but the offer had not progressed.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 12:38PM ET</span>",U.S. bank executives worried about sustained high inflation,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. bank executives on Tuesday raised concerns about the impact of a sustained period of higher inflation, adding to pressure on the Federal Reserve to accelerate plans to wind down the pace of its asset purchases.
Senior bankers are increasingly concerned that higher inflation could impact borrowers' ability to pay back loans, slow U.S. economic growth and destabilize stock markets.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said at a conference that the U.S. central bank may need to move quicker to address inflation concerns. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) CEO David Solomon said he anticipated a period of higher inflation. 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan said his bank was running internal health checks to ensure its portfolios could withstand a return to 1970s-style inflation.
""We've been doing that for three or four quarters now figuring that we'd be at this place where inflation is real and out there,"" Moynihan said at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference. 
Annual U.S. inflation increased from 1.4% to 13.3% from 1960 to 1979, while the country's economic growth stagnated.
That had a marked impact on people's lives, with the value of savings and the purchasing power of fixed incomes like pensions being undermined.
U.S. inflation is running at more than twice the Fed's flexible 2% annual target.
The International Monetary Fund last week warned of intensifying inflationary pressures, especially in the United States, and said U.S. central bankers should focus more on inflation risks.
""There's a case to be made that they (the Federal Reserve) should be moving faster than they've been moving,"" Scharf said.
""Inflation is very, very real,"" he said. ""Prices are significantly higher for inputs across most industries. Labor shortages and wage increases are extremely real. Whether that continues for several years is not all that relevant, but it certainly will have an impact over the next year or so.""
PANDEMIC'S SHADOW
The U.S. central bank needs to be ready to respond to the possibility that inflation may not recede in the second half of next year as most forecasters currently expect, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week.
""My guess is now that there will be a quicker path to appropriate actions,"" Scharf said.
Goldman Sachs' Solomon anticipates inflation will be higher for a period but doesn't expect a repeat of the cost rises of the 1970s, he said in an interview with CNBC.
""There's a reasonable chance that we're going to have inflation above trend for a period of time, but that doesn't mean it has to be like the 1970s,"" he said. ""You've got to be cautious and manage your risk appropriately.""
Solomon acknowledged ""uncertainty"" in global financial markets due to factors including the emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant and question marks over the pace at which the Fed and other central banks will reduce asset purchases.
The Fed has begun reducing its $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities on a pace that would put it on track to complete the wind-down in mid-2022. There is growing pressure on the central bank to accelerate the end of the bond-buying program, which was unveiled in 2020 to stem the economic fallout from the pandemic.

""We're still not completely out of the pandemic. There's uncertainty that comes from that and that uncertainty is going to affect economic activity,"" Solomon said.
""On top of that, we have shifts going on in fiscal and monetary policy to try to balance that. There's no question that this has been an unprecedented period, so it's very hard to predict how we're going to come out of this.""

210,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 12:37PM ET</span>","As U.S. short-term rates rise, fund managers see some opportunities","By Karen Brettell
(Reuters) - With the Federal Reserve likely to accelerate the removal of its unprecedented stimulus, some short-term rates have moved higher and offered money fund managers rare opportunities to generate yield.
For example, three-month commercial paper rates that financial companies use to fund short-term cash flows, have jumped to 17 basis points, from 11 basis points a month ago. The three-month Libor rate, a market benchmark that is being phased out, has increased to 20 basis points, from 13 basis points in late October, and yields on one-year Treasuries have hit one-and-a-half-year highs, even as shorter-dated yields remain relatively moribund.
Very short-dated Treasury bill yields are being held down by low issuance as the government keeps its cash balance low due to constraints imposed by the debt ceiling.
Tighter funding conditions as banks and investors pare back risk taking for year-end has sent yields of some short-dated assets higher, though in large part the rates have increased as investors price in the likelihood that the Fed will speed up the reduction of its bond purchases and that rate hikes may begin in mid-2022.
“The expectation will be a much-faster taper once we calendar flip into 2022,” said Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer for global liquidity markets at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI).
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that U.S. central bank policymakers will discuss whether to end their bond purchases a few months earlier than had been anticipated at the bank's Dec. 14-15 meeting.
With few high-quality investments available, money funds are taking advantage of the higher yields on some assets such as commercial paper.
It is “very opportunistic. I think it’s where the market would be in Treasuries and agencies as well were it not for what is still happening from a debt ceiling standpoint,” Cunningham said.
In large part money funds are relying on the Fed's reverse repurchase agreement facility to eke out returns.
Peter Yi, director of short-duration fixed income and head of credit research at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Asset Management, expects demand in that facility to continue to grow in the coming weeks. “I would say over year-end we’re going to see a pretty big pop in terms of adoption of it.""
Demand for the facility, wherein money funds can lend overnight to the Fed, is currently around $1.5 trillion per day, after hitting a record $1.6 trillion at the end of the third quarter.
The jump in yields on longer-dated Treasury bills, including one-year maturities, may also provide opportunities as Yi sees the Fed being less hawkish in hiking rates than some expect.
“We don’t think the Fed’s going to be as aggressive in raising rates as what the market is pricing today,” he said. “Whenever we see these quick jumps on some of these longer maturities like a year we’re being opportunistic, and we think those are good buying opportunities.”
One-year Treasury yields have increased to 29 basis points, up from around 20 basis points last week and 10 basis points in late September. Traders in the fed funds futures market are pricing in three rate hikes by December 2022.
Some of the increase in rates comes as concerns grow about reduced market liquidity, which has been made worse by year-end.
""There’s a lot of nervousness going around generally, which is probably why you’re seeing front-end funding rates actually drift higher,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities.
Meanwhile the phase-out of Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate) could impact the supply of floating-rate notes, which are typically based on Libor and can be popular in a rising rate environment, said Cunningham.
“I think that represents a little bit of a risk just because funds don’t have as much in floating-rate securities and in a rising rate environment that has been a strategy that has been very successful historically,” she said.

Companies will no longer be able to base new loans on Libor from year-end, through the rates will continue to be published through mid-2023.
Most new trades and loans will be based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is based on the overnight repo market. Some issuers and investors are also seeking a rate with a bank credit spread, though so far alternative credit indices to Libor have failed to gain much traction.

Investing.com — Tessco Technologies Incorporated (NASDAQ:TESS) stock jumped 36% after Lakeview Investment Group & Trading Company said it offered to acquire the company for $7.50 per share.
The cash offer represents a 45% premium to the technology firm's most recent closing share price. Tessco shares closed at $5.17 on Monday.
Lakeview already owns approximately 14.9% of the outstanding shares of Tessco, making it the company's second-largest stockholder.
The investment firm has, for the second time, called upon the company to conduct a ""full and fair"" process for its sale. Lakeview stated that the Tessco board ""inexplicably continues to cling to the status quo,"" and that a previous private offer was met with a lack of constructive engagement. 
They added: ""We are fully prepared to stand behind our conviction that the Company should be sold, and today are proposing to acquire 100% of the shares of the Company not already owned by Lakeview at a price equal to $7.50 per share in cash.""
In a scathing assessment of the company, Lakeview said Tessco has suffered from a range of value-destroying decisions made by unfocused leadership with no clear strategy for improving its performance.
Today's announcement isn't the first time Lakeview has expressed its frustration at the Tessco board. It issued a statement back in June, also urging the company to conduct a ""full, fair"" sale process. In July, Tessco told investors it may consider a sale, but it was not their focus at the time."

And with the COVID-19 omicron variant now posing a threat, many companies are again delaying their return-to-office plans. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is the latest large company to do so. This trend could lead to increased demand for cloud storage solutions for the foreseeable future.

The S&P 500 staged its biggest rally since March to wipe out losses from the past week. The speculative fringe that was a smoldering wreck Friday was soaring Tuesday. An index of meme stocks rallied more than 4%, while one composed of airlines added 1.6%. A gauge of newly public companies advanced more than 4%, SPACs jumped more than 2% and even cryptocurrencies rallied, with Bitcoin powering back above $51,000.
It’s a stunning about-face for risk assets that went into a tail spin after the Federal Reserve chair suggested he favored accelerating the removal of monetary support. What follows are takes from market-watchers on why the market is looking past the Fed’s potential change in policy:
Aoifinn Devitt, chief investment officer at Moneta Group Investment Advisors, said last week’s turbulence owed more to the omicron variant than the Fed’s changed view on the nature of inflation, when Powell told lawmakers “transitory” is no longer an appropriate description:
“It was the variant’s negativity compounded by his statement. But equally we’ve all known that it hasn’t been transitory for some time. They’re not going to take a radical move, they’re just bringing forward the rate rises slightly. My sense is that that was just, it was compounding the fragility of the markets with the variant and now that that’s been factored in, the variants didn’t seem as bad, markets have kind of digested that.”
U.S. investors woke up Tuesday to some decent news on the virus front, with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Plc saying its vaccine was 71% effective against the new strain. That followed data Monday from South Africa that suggested omicron effects were relatively mild.
“I strongly believe that the data coming in from Omicron is totally driving the market,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
“Over the weekend I noticed more of the mainstream media publishing reports of mild cases, though the market was poised for recovery. The supply chain woes, especially around autos, seems to be receding quickly and I am noticing more people staffing businesses that had been under pressure, especially restaurants. Santa Claus looks ready to rock.”
Joe Gilbert, portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management:
“The market was definitely in a shoot-first, ask questions later mode after the discovery of omicron. The knee-jerk reaction was to sell everything risky and seek safety in Treasuries. We got dramatically oversold very quickly and as more Covid news emerges, investors are more comfortable owning risk again as we have adequate vaccines and antivirals to not stall the recovery.”
Economic data has been light so far this week after the softer-than-expected jobs report. The biggest report is the latest reading on consumer prices, due Friday. Some investors speculated that will give the Fed some pause in its move to accelerate winding down asset purchases.
Francois Savary, investment officer at Prime Partners SA, which oversees about $4 billion, said the Fed’s new stance doesn’t mean tightening is imminent.
“There was an immediate reaction that was very negative in the market but people at the end of the day are thinking that OK, the Fed is just getting some room for maneuver. People are now thinking maybe we went too far in terms of how many rate hikes there are going to be next year. Two is OK. We’re not so sure about the third one. At the end of the day it’s not a game-changer in monetary policy.
Cate Faddis, Grace Capital President and CIO, suggested the market remains unconvinced the so-called Fed put will ever go away.
This means the market does not believe that the Fed has truly pivoted from its decades-long dovish stance. It has concluded that ultimately it may be irrelevant to fundamentals. The inflation we see today is not due to cheap money, so raising rates will not have any impact. Raising rates will not solve the supply chain problem or resolve pent up demand from an economy that is finally opening up.
Part of the support came from institutional clients, according to data from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC):
“Clients were big buyers of the dip last week, with inflows from all client groups and into both single stocks and ETFs. Inflows were the largest in Tech, Discretionary & Financials; only Industrials, Health Care & Utilities stocks saw outflows. Buybacks picked up to their highest level since March. YTD buybacks still tracking below 2019 (pre-COVID) levels.”
Not everyone was certain the rally would last. The S&P 500’s 2% gain has it on track for a move of at least 1% for the seventh time in eight sessions, a bout of turbulence not seen so far this year. Matt Maley of Miller Tabak + Co. had this to say:
“There is no question that things have changed in recent weeks. Whenever the stock market has seen a big one-day decline for most of this year, the market has bounced-back very quickly -- and kept on rising pretty much each time. This has changed in the last week and a half. Don’t get us wrong, the stock market has been able to bounce back quickly after the big down days recently, but it has not been able sustain those bounces like it has for most of this year. Instead, more severe declines have ensued shortly after those bounces.”
Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, says:
“To be fair, I would expect the same pattern next time, whether it’s something with the Fed, fiscal policy, tech stocks, or geopolitics. The tricky part may be if we get into a tough slog in 2022 if stocks revert back to historical trends of 5-10% total returns per year. Three years of shoot-the-lights-out performance may be lulling investors into a sense of complacency.”

Furthermore, advanced farming techniques and the increasing use of bio-fertilizers are driving the growth of the fertilizer industry. Therefore, we believe recent price dips could be an opportune time to bet on fundamentally sound fertilizer stocks CVR Partners (NYSE:UAN) and Intrepid (IPI). Read on.Surging energy costs, scarcity of supply, imperfectly competitive and shallow market structure and trade policies have driven fertilizer prices near-record highs this year. According to a report by DTN, the average price of nitrogen, which is the most widely used category of fertilizer, was $1,308 per ton for the first time ever last month.
Furthermore, the World Bank reported that fertilizer prices on average would be 25% higher in 2021 than last year. In addition, the development of advanced farming techniques, expanding trade activities, and increasing use of bio-fertilizers are fueling the growth of the fertilizer industry. The global fertilizer market is expected to grow at a 4% CAGR through 2026.
Therefore, we think fundamentally strong fertilizer stocks CVR Partners, LP (UAN), and Intrepid Potash, Inc. (NYSE:IPI) could be ideal picks now to capitalize on the industry’s solid growth prospects. The recent price dips in these stocks offer a perfect entry point to lock in potential gains in the coming months.

So, let’s discuss them.The heavy construction machinery industry plays a vital role in constructing mechanical irrigation systems, heavy tractors, and other equipment for the farming industry. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the farm and heavy construction machinery sector has suffered huge losses. But with heightened demand for farm mechanization, the industry is now expanding due to the integration of advanced technologies and growing food demand.
More than 80% of AEM members anticipate rising demand for construction and agriculture equipment over the next year. Furthermore, the U.S. infrastructure bill is expected to significantly boost the industry’s growth because it promises a better and more modernized farming industry. According to a Research and Markets report, the global agricultural machinery market is expected to grow at a 5.4% CAGR through 2026.
Thus, we think it could be wise to add quality farm and heavy construction machinery stocks Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), CNH Industrial N.V. (CNHI), Terex Corporation (TEX), and REV Group, Inc. (REVG) to one’s portfolio now.

Investing.com – Palantir stock (NYSE:PLTR) rose 5% Tuesday as the company sealed a joint venture with Germany’s Merck KGaA to optimize data mining for servicing the semiconductor industry.
This Merck, based in Darmstadt, uses the name EMD Electronics for its North American electronics business to avoid confusion with the unaffiliated pharmaceutical company of a similar name. The joint venture, Athinia, will be housed within another Merck KGaA subsidiary called EMD Digital that is separate from its electronics business, Reuters said.
Merck supplies chemicals that go into chip-making. The Athinia platform will use artificial intelligence and big data to solve challenges such as chip shortages, improve quality and supply chain transparency, and time to market, a Merck release said.
Athinia will bring semiconductor manufacturers and materials suppliers together to share, aggregate, and analyze data, a tough task in an industry with firms unwilling to share their trade secrets. The platform will also enable industry players to understand on a deeper level the interaction between materials and processes at semiconductor fabrication plants, the release said.
The joint venture comes amid a surge in demand for Cloud services, computers and electronic gadgets for a connected lifestyle, all of which have chips servicing them. Cars are also now a product of technology, adding to the unprecedented demand for chips.

And the company expects to reverse its pandemic-related losses and return to profitability by the end of 2022. However, the newly identified COVID-19 omicron variant could depress the company’s growth trajectory as governments re-impose travel restrictions. So, will NCLH’s shares soar, or will they retreat on omicron concerns? Read on.
Shares of Miami, Fla.-based cruise operator  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd . (NCLH) have slumped 23.8% in price over the past year and 21.2% year-to-date. The stock is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The cruise line company was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, losing billions of dollars as ships were anchored in ports due to travel restrictions and other public health mandates.
Cruise line stocks, including NCLH, declined last week over concerns regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 omicron variant on the global economy. Investors grappled with fears concerning a travel pullback as governments again restrict travel and tighten testing requirements. However, NCLH stock bounced back in its last trading session, gaining 9.5% in price intraday to close at $20.03. The rally was fueled by news regarding the possibility that the new COVID-19 variant might cause milder symptoms than previous COVID-19 strains. However, the World Health Organization warned that it is too early to understand the severity of the variant. “There was initial reports that it tended to be more mild, but it’s really too soon,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on COVID-19.
Previously, NCLH expected to return to profitability in the second half of 2022, because pent-up demand for leisure travel and the vaccination program were helping the cruise line operators recover from the pandemic. However, if the omicron variant drives another COVID-19 wave or current vaccines turn out to be less effective against the strain, it could take longer for NCLH to reverse its losses and improve its margins.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said Tuesday it plans to launch a new subscription software service aimed at small businesses, in collaboration with enterprise software company Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM).
The software service, called VIIZR, will be offered starting next year by the automaker's Ford Pro commercial vehicle and services unit. Based on Salesforce technology, the system will digitize paperwork for contractors, repair technicians and other trades people, and start at $39 per month per user, Ford said.
VIIZR customers don't have to drive Ford vehicles, but the target small-business market overlaps with a key market for Ford trucks and commercial vans.
Ford, like rival automakers, is working to build sources of steadily recurring subscription revenue to supplement revenue from vehicle sales that can get hit by economic downturns or disruptions like the recent shortages of semiconductors. 

Salesforce and other software-as-a-service companies tend to command higher stock valuations than manufacturers. Salesforce has a market capitalization of nearly $253 billion, compared to $76 billion for Ford.
Ford said it will offer businesses free, trial use of the VIIZR system ahead of the launch in the first half of 2022.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>","Top producer EQT backs U.S. natural gas exports, calls Warren's criticism ""misguided'","(Reuters) - The United States should produce and export more natural gas to tackle climate change, the country's top producer EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT) said in response to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren's recent criticism of the energy sector for spiraling gas prices.
""LNG exports have the potential to be the biggest green initiative on the planet,"" Chief Executive Toby Rice said on Tuesday as it could replace dirtier fuels like coal.
Last month, Senator Warren had written to 11 of the nation's big gas producers asking them to explain their decision to export record amount of heating fuel, while imposing massive prices increases on consumers who are struggling to pay their bills.
Natural gas futures have this year shot up to levels not seen since 2014 as a return to pre-pandemic activities and stockpiling in Asia and Europe ahead of winter drove up energy demand faster than supply.
Warren's letter to companies including EQT,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) had expressed concern over the extent of price increases and accused them of ""corporate greed and profiteering"".
However, EQT CEO Rice called her concerns as ""misguided"" and said it is because of the shale gas boom and companies like EQT that the U.S. consumer continues to benefit from some of the lower natural gas prices in the world.
""The average price of natural gas for 2021 is significantly below the 20-year average of approximately $5.70 per mcf (thousand cubic feet),"" he said.
""Yes, the price of natural gas has increased rapidly relative to 2020, but natural gas prices in 2020 were the lowest in over two decades.""

Warren had said the gas producers are putting their massive profits, share prices and dividends for investors, and millions of dollars in CEO pay and bonuses ahead of the needs of American consumers.
Shale producers have been putting their profits into dividends and shares buybacks, rather than investing in production, under increased investor pressure as years of supply additions had hurt prices.

Mimecast said it has the right to terminate the agreement with Permira to enter into a superior proposal.
The agreement includes a 30-day “go-shop” period expiring on January 6.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Telecoms operator VEON (NASDAQ:VEON) on Tuesday launched a digital ID authentication system that Chief Executive Kaan Terzioglu said could rival those used by U.S. technology giants in simplifying mobile logins without sacrificing privacy.
The new tool allows users to log into systems like retail or banking websites using their phone numbers and one-time password authentication, rather than using separate passwords, or those attached to existing domains like Google or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Veon wants to roll out the system to its 212 million customers in nine countries following a nine-month trial with over 1.2 million monthly active users in its main market, Russia, he said.
Terzioglu told Reuters Veon's system was a simpler alternative to those offered by the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Facebook.
""We had this unique opportunity to simplify all these interactions by allowing people just to use their telephone numbers and we tokenise the credentials including certain personal information which it is not necessarily desirable to share with everyone,"" Terzioglu said in an interview.
Foreign tech companies have come under increasing pressure from the Russian government over the content shared on their platforms, along with demands they set up offices on Russian soil.
TOWER STRATEGY
Veon also unveiled a new strategy focused on digital assets, double-digit local currency revenue growth and the divestiture of its tower assets, which Terzioglu expects it to complete in the next two years as part of plans to lower debt.
Faced with straitened revenue growth and stubbornly high debt built up during the last network upgrade, telecoms companies across Europe are looking to raise cash by selling their tower portfolios, or creating future income streams through spinning off those assets.
The company, which has more than 50,000 towers, last week signed a deal to sell its tower assets in Russia for about $1 billion.
""I would like to see more of these deals... in the next quarters and by 2022, 2023 we will hopefully complete the entire series,"" Terzioglu said.
""It's been about nine months (since) we pushed the button on our physical assets monetisation strategy,"" he said.
The company is also in talks with independent tower operators in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Veon's consolidated debt was $7.7 billion as of Sept. 30 and tower sales can bring in several billion.
The company's shares were up 3.4% as of 1345 GMT.

MILAN (Reuters) - Automaker Stellantis rolled out its software strategy on Tuesday including a 2030 target of 20 billion euros ($22.54 billion) in annual revenue from related products and subscriptions as it takes aim at rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
CEO Carlos Tavares said the world's fourth largest carmaker expected to have 34 million connected vehicles on the road by then, up from 12 million now.
As part of its software push, Stellantis said from 2024 it would deploy three new technological platforms powered by artificial intelligence (AI). 
""This is something that will put Stellantis among the leaders, if not the leader, in software and electronics,"" said Chief Software Officer Yves Bonnefont, adding that these platforms would match those of competitors.
One platform, called STLA Brain, will provide over-the-air (OTA) software updates, something Tesla already offers. 
Software was part of a plan announced by Stellantis this year to invest more than 30 billion euros through 2025 to execute its electrification strategy.
Bonnefont said the group would move its vehicles from their current dedicated electronic architectures to an open software platform, leveraging partnerships.
""We don't want to do everything by ourselves,"" he said. 
Stellantis has strategic partnerships with companies including BMW, iPhone maker Foxconn and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo, to enable it to ""continue to drive innovation, efficiency and shared know-how"", it said. 
Bonnefont said Stellantis should finalise a joint venture with Foxconn by the end of 2021 to supply in-car and connected-car technologies across the auto industry.
Stellantis also announced on Tuesday a preliminary agreement on a separate partnership with Foxconn to design purpose-built semiconductors to support the carmaker and other customers.
PLAYING CATCH-UP
Investors and analysts see Stellantis playing catch-up in advanced technology investment not only to Tesla but to traditional rivals such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and GM.
Tesla's market cap of over $1 trillion reflects in part the importance of software capabilities in automakers' valuations.
Software is playing an increasing role in vehicles from managing electric motors and batteries to supporting functions such as autonomous driving, entertainment and navigation.
Volkswagen expects some 1.2 trillion euros of software enabled sales in the car industry by 2030, or about a quarter of the global mobility market, which is expected to more than double to 5 trillion euros.
Self-driving software systems and other services like high-definition mapping and electric charging services are seen generating future revenue for carmakers.
Volkswagen, for instance, is considering charging for self-driving features starting at 7 euros per hour.
GM is among those aiming to convince investors it can top Tesla in technology and profitability. 
In October, GM told investors it aimed to double its revenue by 2030, including adding $80 billion from technology-driven new businesses such as its Cruise autonomous vehicle unit. 

Ford this year hired the former head of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s car project, Doug Field, to lead its advanced technology and embedded systems efforts while France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) is teaming up with Google to help design its infotainment systems.

ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB will accelerate its acquisition drive, Chief Executive Bjorn Rosengren told Reuters in an interview, as the Swiss engineering group seeks to grow faster by tapping into mega-trends like shrinking workforces and decarbonisation. The maker of factory robots and charging stations for electric cars unveiled higher sales and profit goals at its capital markets day on Tuesday. ""We are absolutely going to accelerate M&A,"" Rosengren said. ""Otherwise I would be very disappointed. ""The target will be more on the small to medium size, maybe around a billion dollars in transaction size. We are looking at five to 10 acquisitions per year."" ABB has so made only two deals this year, but was looking to strengthen its offerings in robotics, motion and electrification, the former Sandvik CEO added.
ABB picked up $2.9 billion from selling its Dodge power transmission business. It is also divesting its power conversion division as well as potentially selling its turbo charging business. The company is also pressing ahead with its plans to float its e-mobility electric vehicle charging business, which it hopes to list in Switzerland in the first half of 2022. The business had revenue of $263 million in the 12 months to September and has been growing sales by nearly 60% per year. ABB, which competes with Germany's Siemens and France's Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN), would keep a majority stake after the initial public offering. ""It is a core part of ABB. But it needs a different kind of management to the rest of the group,"" Rosengren said. ABB has made an offer to a potential chairman of the new company, he added.
He rejected a report from activist shareholder Cevian which called for further streamlining of ABB.

""I don't believe in conglomerates and ABB is not a conglomerate,"" Rosengren said. ""The board is of the same opinion on the strategy we have for ABB at the moment."" ABB was positive about market developments next year, particularly in areas like robotics and automation where its customers are facing high wage inflation and difficulties finding enough workers. Supply chain constraints would continue during the fourth quarter and early next year, but he expected the difficulties of getting parts like semiconductor chips to ease.
""We have an extremely strong demand in the market. We believe the demand will continue to grow in 2022. We still don't have any cancellations at all,"" Rosengren said.

The deal is labeled the largest to date for Gevo, with the company set to supply 45 million gallons per year of renewable, energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons. 
Gevo shares opened the session at $6.25, $1.15 above Monday's close.  
Gevo transforms renewable energy and carbon into energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons used for transportation fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel.
Kolmar is a subsidiary of Kolmar Group AG, a service provider, manufacturer, and marketer of renewable fuels in Switzerland.
The hydrocarbons — which include sustainable aviation fuel and isooctane, a key part of renewable premium gasoline — are expected to be produced from Gevo's second Net-Zero production facility, Net-Zero 2, which is currently being developed in the U.S. Midwest. 
Gevo stated that deliveries to Kolmar represent the entire plant output based on the production facility's current design, with the deal generating approximately $300 million per year of gross revenue, including revenue from environmental benefits. The eight-year agreement is expected to generate roughly $2.8 billion in gross income.
""With this agreement, Kolmar is investing in the future, and this kind of foresight makes for another excellent partner and should make clear to our investors that we have traction in the market,"" said Dr. Patrick R. Gruber, Gevo's CEO. "

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors managing $12.4 trillion in assets on Tuesday called for governments and companies to accelerate the shift to promoting healthier food and drink to help fix what they described as a ""global nutrition crisis"".
Poor-quality diets are a leading cause of death and disease and carry individual, societal and economic costs that impact the value of their holdings, 53 investors said in a pledge at the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit 2021.
The investors, including PIMCO and UBS Asset Management, urged policymakers to use fiscal and regulatory measures to help support healthy packaged food and do more to meet the nutrition targets laid out by the World Health Organisation.
Food and drink companies, meanwhile, were called on to commit to three actions, including reporting annually on the percentage of their sales generated by healthy products and their share of the overall product mix.
The companies should also use an independently developed system to define what constitutes a healthy product, and adopt the commitments laid out in the document 'Investor Expectations on Nutrition, Diets and Health' produced by the investors with the support of non-profit the Access to Nutrition Initiative.
The investors said they would engage with the 20 listed companies in the ATNI Global Index 2021, including Nestle and Unilever (NYSE:UL), as appropriate, or ask fund managers which invest on their behalf to do so.
They said they would share information about their talks with companies through quarterly or annual reports and use the information to guide their investment decisions.
""The investor pledge illustrates the urgent action required from companies, investors and governments to accelerate progress on global nutrition,"" said Frank Wagemans, Senior Engagement Specialist at Achmea Investment Management.

""Investors understand not only the macroeconomic drag posed by nutrition, but also the profound societal impact of malnutrition which we see as a financial and societal material risk.""
The costs of poor nutrition are estimated to amount to around 5% of global income a year, or around $3.5 trillion, ATNI said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply higher on Tuesday as traders rushed to buy the recent dip, in the hope that the new variant of Covid-19 that caused it will not, after all, be economically disruptive.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 409 points, or 1.2%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up a whopping 2.2%.
Data emerging so far from South Africa, where the Omicron variant was first identified, suggest that it causes a milder form illness than the Delta variant that has been responsible for most of the 5.3 million deaths attributed worldwide to Covid-19 in the last 21 months. A strain that becomes dominant by virtue of its higher infectiousness, but which causes less strain on public health systems around the world, has the potential to speed up the progress toward herd immunity and bring the pandemic to an earlier end.  
Among early movers, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock stood out with a gain of 5.0% after it confirmed it will spin off its Mobileye (F:0ME) venture, helping it to raise cash as it embarks on an expensive expansion of manufacturing capacity. A Reuters report said Mobileye could be valued at over $50 billion, more than triple what Intel paid for it only four years ago.  That would also imply that Mobileye, whose specialty is in developing chips for the autonomous vehicle segment, now accounts for around a quarter of Intel's overall market value.
One of Intel's biggest rivals was also in the news earlier: Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) said it would revamp its structure and appoint a third co-CEO, in an effort to revive its flagging mobile business. Samsung (KS:005930) too is spending heavily on new chipmaking capacity, having committed last month to a new factory in Texas that will cost $17 billion.

Investing.com – AutoZone stock (NYSE:AZO) traded 1.8% higher Tuesday as the company reported strong sales and earnings in the first quarter, driven by growth in both retail and commercial segments.
Net sales at the auto parts distributor rose more than 16%, to $3.7 billion in the 12 weeks ended November 20, and beat estimates. Domestic same-store sales increased about 14%.
Pressure and rewards for the company’s business have come from different directions. A shortage of semiconductors globally has crippled production of new cars, extending waiting lines and forcing people to opt for second-hand vehicles or stick with their current vehicles longer.
The older vehicles need higher maintenance and repairs, for which spare parts are needed, and those have been in short supply, too, as factories have been shut for long. Deliveries are also delayed as ships have been stuck at ports due to congestion and labor shortages.
The company closed the period with 3% more inventory, driven by new stores. During the quarter, AutoZone opened 15 new stores in the U.S., two in Mexico and one in Brazil.
Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was about 32%, an improvement of 170 basis points driven by strong sales growth. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
Beating estimates, adjusted profit per share rose 38%, to $25.69, led by strong topline growth and operating expense leverage.

The hawkish tilt from the Federal Reserve just as the omicron variant spreads will continue to create all manner of trading challenges in the near-term, according to Christian Mueller-Glissmann, managing director of portfolio strategy and asset allocation at the firm.
After a selling wave that brought down everything from big tech to Bitcoin, the Goldman Sachs Risk Appetite Indicator is below zero, but it could still fall farther, according to the firm. 
“Without any view on better macro you would want the RAI closer to -2 before adding risk,” said Mueller-Glissmann in an interview. “A drop below or near -2 could create a very good opportunity to re-risk and position more procyclical, especially if growth stabilizes post-omicron.” 
His caution contrasts with a big turnaround in risk assets this week on signs the new strain won’t be as virulent and deadly as feared and won’t drive the economic recovery off-course.
Meanwhile, a Deutsche Bank AG gauge signals risk assets may be closing in on a bottom.
Volatility markets show fragile sentiment. Investors are paying up to hedge against wilder swings than what they’ve experienced already. Last week’s run of turbulence was the worst in a year, with the S&P 500 notching up or down moves of at least 1% on five straight days through Friday. 
At 27, the VIX still sits seven points above its average for the year and the front-month futures contract is higher than ones in subsequent months, a signal that investors anticipate near-term turbulence to persist.

All the same, a Deutsche Bank cross-asset momentum measure is firmly negative and already near historic lows.
“The breadth is now approaching a place where it does usually turn around so we’ll expect some asset classes to find a bottom here,” Parag Thatte, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in an interview. “The turnaround should be in the short term, it should be in the next three-four weeks.”

(Reuters) -ViacomCBS Inc and Seoul-based CJ ENM, the distributor of Oscar winning movie ""Parasite"", have signed a content partnership agreement, the companies said on Tuesday, marking the Asia debut for the U.S. company's Paramount+ streaming service.
The partnership will include co-productions for original series and films, content licensing and distribution across ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC)' and entertainment company CJ ENM's streaming services.
As part of the deal, ViacomCBS will launch its Paramount+ streaming service in South Korea in 2022 as an exclusive bundle with TVING, CJ ENM's streaming service.
As the U.S. streaming market saturates, industry leaders are looking outside the United States for growth. ViacomCBS is relying on partnerships for some of that growth.
South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, has established itself as a global entertainment hub with its vibrant pop-culture, including the seven-member boy band BTS and movies such as Oscar winners ""Parasite,"" and ""Minari.""

The hit Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) series ""Squid Game"" from South Korea has gone viral across the world.
In August, ViacomCBS and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announced they will launch the streaming service SkyShowtime in Europe, bringing content from Nickelodeon, Paramount+, Sky and others as they team up to take on heavyweights Netflix and Disney+. SkyShowtime will be streamed in smaller European markets including Spain, Portugal, the Nordic countries, Netherlands and Central and Eastern Europe. Sky is also distributing Paramount+ streaming service in larger European markets, ViacomCBS announced earlier in July - part of an effort to expand Paramount+ into 45 markets by the end of 2022.

So, let’s take a close look at these names.Strong consumer spending and favorable government policies have aided a growth stock rally so far this year as the global economy recovers from its pandemic-led slump. Though most European nations have re-imposed lockdowns and restrictions in the wake of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, the White House has said that it has no intention of shutting down the U.S. economy because 82% of the U.S. population is vaccinated. This should instill confidence in the markets and allow growth stocks to gain momentum in the coming months.

The company transports people and cargo through its mainline and regional fleets.
UAL's shares have declined 22.7% in price over the past six months and 16.5% over the past month due to the rising fears surrounding the newly discovered COVID-19 omicron variant.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd will merge its mobile and consumer electronics divisions, the firm said on Tuesday, naming new co-chief executives in the biggest reshuffle since 2017 to simplify its structure and focus on the logic chip business.
Two co-chief executives, instead of three, will lead the South Korean firm as it pivots on the two business pillars of chips and consumer devices, including smartphones, to help lead the next phase of growth and boost competitiveness.
Samsung (KS:005930), whose Galaxy flagship brand helped it become the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume, is seeking to revive slowing mobile growth, whose profit contribution shrank to 21% last quarter from nearly 70% at its peak in early 2010s.
Instead, its component business, led by chips, has become the most profitable, helped by a boom in data storage and a recent shortage of global semiconductor supplies.
The business generated nearly three-quarters of Samsung's 15.8 trillion won ($13.4 billion) operating profit last quarter.
Samsung said Han Jong-hee, the head of visual display business, will become a co-CEO, leading the newly merged division spanning mobile and consumer electronics as well as continuing to lead the television business. 
Han has risen through the ranks in Samsung's visual display business, without experience in mobile.
It is not immediately clear what changes or divisions of labour were expected under Han, but analysts said the reshuffle could help Samsung tackle challenges such as offering seamlessly connected services between its smartphones and home appliances.
""In the long term, the biggest challenge is forming a platform of Samsung's own,"" said Lee Jae-yun, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea.
""Those businesses have to keep increasing connectivity between devices, but so far it hasn't been able to create a lasting platform with presence."" 
More immediate problems are a shortage of chip supplies, rising raw material prices, logistics difficulties, and competition from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Chinese rivals amid concerns about a slowing mobile market, analysts said.
PROMPT DECISION-MAKING
Kyung Kye-hyun, chief executive of component affiliate Samsung Electro-Mechanics and a former head of the flash memory chip and technology team, was named co-CEO to lead the chip and components division. 
Other high-profile promotions included naming as vice chairman Chung Hyun-ho, the head of a ""task force"" that analysts said co-ordinates decision-making in Samsung Electronics and affiliates, and which media have said works closely with Lee. 
The re-organisation is the latest sign of centralised change at Samsung after Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee was paroled https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/samsung-leader-jay-y-lee-released-prison-parole-2021-08-13 in August after a bribery conviction. 
""There may be more prompt execution of funds or decision-making,"" said Kim Sun-woo, an analyst at Meritz Securities.
Samsung Electronics last named new division heads in late 2017.
The group is focusing on areas from semiconductors, artificial intelligence and robotics to biopharmaceuticals, with plans to invest 240 trillion won ($206 billion) in these areas over the next three years.
Group flagship Samsung Electronics aims to overtake TSMC to become No. 1 in chip contract manufacturing by 2030 by investing about $150 billion in logic chip businesses, including foundries. 
Late last month, Samsung chose the U.S. city of Taylor in Texas for a planned $17-billion chip plant after months of deliberation, coinciding with Lee's first business trip to the United States in five years.

Shares of Samsung Electronics rose 1.6%, outperforming a rise of 0.4% in the benchmark index.

248,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 08:31AM ET</span>",Lacklustre trading thwarts London's tech IPO ambitions,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - London's bid to transform its stock market into a haven for fast-growing technology companies to compete with New York is facing obstacles as trading volumes slide and some big-ticket initial public offerings fall flat. 
Britain brought in new rules last week to make it more attractive for technology companies to list, tearing up the strict ""one share, one vote"" regulation and enabling founders to complete a premium listing - which gives access to the prestigious FTSE indices - while retaining significant control. [L8N2SN25Q]. 
Finance minister Rishi Sunak pledged earlier this year that the new rules would make London more competitive after Britain left the European Union and a number of companies floated on London's market in anticipation of a smoother listing process.
In the first eight months of this year 38 companies listed on London's main exchange to raise $16.87 billion, the highest since 2015, Refinitiv data shows. 
However, some high-profile initial public offerings (IPOs) such as Deliveroo and last year's debut from THG are trading well below their listing prices, as some investors steer clear of companies in which the founders have outsized voting rights.
These companies used a so-called ""standard"" listing, which for now precludes access to the FTSE indices, rather than a premium listing.
(Graphics: Mixed bag: Major London IPOs in 2021, https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-IPO/jnpweayoapw/chart.png) 
""Broadly investors are keen for the UK market to be vibrant and to prosper, and since the global financial crisis we have had a lacklustre IPO market and that has changed this year,"" said James Ayre, co-head of investments at CCLA Investment Management.
""But I think one has to read the tea leaves - investors also care a lot about governance and ESG (environment, social and governance), and some of the IPOs we have seen this year have sparked some concern in those areas.""
Ayre cited THG and Deliveroo, the meal delivery company, as examples of listings where unequal voting rights enjoyed by their founders put off some investors.
Shares in THG have fallen 65% since listing in 2020. Meanwhile Deliveroo - championed by Sunak at the time of its IPO as ""a true British success story"" - is down 35% from where it listed. Chipmaker Alphawave is down 52.4%. 
Some other big listings - without dual-class shares - are also lower, with online card retailer Moonpig down 5% and Made.com 21%. 
In the case of THG, Deliveroo and Alphawave, corporate governance concerns weighed on the stocks, with THG founder Matthew Moulding giving up his golden share in a bid to placate investors after the company's plans to split its THG Ingenuity division came under scrutiny.
Deliveroo fell on its market debut in the face of worries around the dual-class share structure and a perceived lack of protection for its workers and has struggled to recover ever since. On Monday it fell 6% on reports the EU will reclassify workers of such apps as employees.
Alphawave fell on its market debut and then crashed again after a media report raised fears about related party transactions.
Analysts say some IPOs also fell as several of them were e-commerce companies that based their valuations on pandemic-era demand, which fell as Britain came out of lockdown in 2021. 
Spokespeople for Deliveroo, THG, Alphawave, Made.com and Moonpig declined to comment. 
A lack of liquidity is another frequently cited obstacle, with some saying that the London main market does not generate the mass appeal of Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange IPOs. 
Average monthly turnover for U.S. stocks was about $560 billion so far this year. That compares with $78 billion on average in European stocks and $16 billion monthly for British stocks, according to data from Rosenblatt securities. 
While European and UK numbers have improved, U.S. numbers are rising more steeply.
(GRAPHIC: ADVT, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjvqkyjobvx/ADVT.JPG)
The same goes for performance: over the last five years, the FTSE 100 has risen 18.34% compared with a 26.42% for the European Stoxx 600 and an astonishing 126% for the S&P 500. 
""Pension funds are still investing (in London) but from the retail investor there is less appeal to invest in the stock market, which is affecting the liquidity of shares,"" said Howard Womersley Smith, a fintech and data lawyer at Reed Smith 
While London main market IPOs have hit their highest levels since 2015 at $16.88 billion, Amsterdam and Stockholm are slowly increasing their share, with $9.1 billion and $8.98 billion of IPO volumes, according to Refinitiv data. 
(GRAPHIC: Fierce competition for London post-Brexit, https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-IPO/klvykngrrvg/chart.png) 
LEAVING LONDON
UK shares' relative underperformance has caught the eye of cash-rich private equity funds, who have spent $36.9 billion taking British-listed companies such as W Morrisons and TalkTalk private in 2021 so far, according to Dealogic.
Meanwhile, Ryanair and BHP Billiton (NYSE:BBL) have announced their intention to delist from the LSE.,
All of this adds to the need to attract new companies, but bankers and analysts believe that easier regulations have attracted companies that were looking to ride a trend that will not last. 
One senior equity capital markets banker said that the performance this year will inevitably hurt the market for IPOs in 2022 and beyond, saying that investors will be even more sceptical when they return in the new year. 

""It won't happen overnight, but the risk is that we gradually lose companies to New York, where investors are more tolerant of companies that haven't turned a profit yet. Or even worse - to Amsterdam,"" he said.

Investing.com – Microsoft stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded 1.6% higher in Tuesday’s premarket on a CNBC report that the company is planning a big price hike for some Microsoft Office subscriptions.
According to the network, the software giant is telling partners customers will soon be charged 20% more for its flagship suite of applications if they pay by the month.
The move is intended to improve revenue predictability and reduce churn, according to the CNBC report.
Microsoft has already said it will raise prices for the Microsoft 365 suite of applications by as much as 20% from March 1. That hike covers only commercial products. Prices of education and consumer products will remain unchanged.
The Microsoft 365 suite, earlier known as Office 365, had sales of $53.9 billion in financial year 2021, almost a third of Microsoft's overall $168.1 billion in sales.
According to an August blog post by Corporate Vice President for Microsoft 365 Jared Spataro, the suite had over 300 million commercial paid seats.

LONDON (Reuters) -France’s richest man Bernard Arnault and former UniCredit head Jean Pierre Mustier will publicly list a second blank cheque vehicle in Amsterdam, raising 200 million euros ($226 million), the bookrunners on the deal said.
Earlier this year, the duo raised half a billion euros from their special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Pegasus Acquisition Company Europe B.V., which is searching for takeover targets in the financial sector. 
On Tuesday, the same group of backers announced they would list a second vehicle with an entrepreneurial focus, Pegasus Entrepreneurial Acquisition Company Europe, in Amsterdam.
SPACs are listed on a stock exchange by a group of entrepreneurs, who use the money raised to target a private company - allowing the target to get a stock market listing without the arduous process of launching a public listing.
Mustier is working together with former Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) banker Diego De Giorgi and SPAC operating partner Pierre Cuilleret, an entrepreneur and investor, in launching the 200 million euro listing. 
Cuilleret said he would focus on family or entrepreneur-led companies.
Several SPACs have listed in Amsterdam, potentially boosting the Dutch financial capital's credentials as a hub for fast-growing companies. London has only hosted one major SPAC in 2021, after updating its rules to make them easier. 

Pegasus is backed by institutional sponsors Tikehau Capital and Financière Agache and by sponsors De Giorgi, Cuilleret and Mustier. Citi, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) are the bookrunners on the deal.

The initial routes will be chosen partly based on which airports offer better financial incentives.
""From our initial expression of interest to 46 different airports across the country we received positive feedback from between 35 and 40 airports,"" Jordan said. ""That response has given us the confidence to make the announcement today.""
Some analysts have expressed scepticism about the airline's ability to fill 186-seat 737 MAX planes on thin routes in a market dominated by flights between Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, where regional routes are often flown by small turboprops.
""These are big aircraft for small markets that are going to have to be flying very frequently … to keep them in a way that is economic,"" CAPA Centre for Aviation Chairman Emeritus Peter Harbison said in October.

Jordan said Bonza, whose parent's investment portfolio includes Canadian-low cost carrier Flair Airlines, would keep its aircraft utilisation high by operating a large number of routes. 
777 Partners in March placed an order for 24 737 MAX planes with purchase rights for 60 more.

Investing.com – American Airlines stock (NASDAQ:AAL) traded 3% higher in Tuesday’s premarket after the carrier said chief executive Doug Parker will step down at the end of March.
He'll be replaced by Robert Isom, currently the company's president.
Parker had gained fame for claiming to have broken the grip of the business cycle on the air travel business, using that argument as the pretext for a rapid increase in stock buybacks and dividends in the last five years. That left the company short of capital and dependent on government handouts when the pandemic struck in early 2020. 
Isom will also join the airline’s board of directors on the same date, while Parker, who led the airline for 20 years, will continue to serve as chairman.
Named president of the airline in 2016, Isom has more than three decades of experience across finance, operations, planning, marketing, sales, alliances, pricing and revenue management.
Isom takes over at a juncture when the entire industry is still reeling from the pandemic. A nascent recovery, marked by the lifting of restrictions on inbound transatlantic flights, has been threatened in the last week by the discovery of the new Omicron strain. That has prompted many countries, including the U.S., to bring back restrictions on air travel, albeit in a more limited way.
American Airlines returned to profit in the third quarter and said it will add capacity to cater to rising demand.
Third-quarter profit was $169 million compared to a loss of $2.39 billion in July-September last year. Excluding special items, the company posted a third-quarter net loss of $641 million.
The airline said in October that it expects its fourth-quarter capacity to be down no more than 13% from the fourth quarter of 2019. It expects fourth-quarter revenue to be down around 20%."

(Reuters) - A German supplier of chemicals and materials used in making semiconductors said on Tuesday that it is investing $1 billion in its U.S. operations and forming a joint venture with data analytics firm Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) to solve chip industry supply chain problems.
Merck KGaA of Darmstadt, Germany - which uses the name EMD Electronics for its North American electronics business to avoid confusion with the unaffiliated pharmaceutical company of the same name - supplies a range of chemicals used by chip factories, which are expected to expand if U.S. lawmakers pass a $52 billion aide package to bolster domestic manufacturing.
The company plans to spend $1 billion through 2025 for sites in Arizona, California, Texas and Pennsylvania.
""The chip shortage needs industry-wide cooperation to resolve the supply chain issues consumers are currently facing,"" Kai Beckmann, chief executive of the German firm's electronics unit, said in a statement.
Merck KGaA also said Tuesday it is forming a joint venture with analytics firm Palantir. The joint venture will aim to pull in data from material and chemical suppliers on one side and chip factories from the other and analyze it to improve efficiency.
Both the suppliers and the chip factories have extensive trade secrets and have historically been reluctant to share data beyond their own organizations, said Laura Matz, who will oversee the new joint venture, which will be called Athinia. Athinia will be housed within another Merck KGaA subsidiary called EMD Digital that is separate from its electronics business.

""That has been the hurdle of solving this problem (of supply-chain inefficiency) for years,"" Matz said of the hesitance to share data. ""Until we came up with the concept of how we're structuring the data in a way that there's no (intellectual property) contamination, we couldn't get over it.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Pay launched in Israel on Tuesday, with Israel's major banks and credit card companies saying they had signed agreements with Google to offer the new payment service.
The service will allow Android mobile phone users to pay for products in stores that allow contactless payments.
Some 70% of Israelis have Android based phones - according to Israeli media, potentially providing a big market for Google Pay, which has about 150 million users in more than 40 countries worldwide.
In May, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Apple Pay launched in Israel, where 30% of people have iPhones.
An estimated two-thirds of payment terminals in Israel support the wireless payment standard that allow payments by mobile phone, smart watch or credit card, Bank of Israel data shows. 
Shva, the company which processes credit card payments in Israel, said 58.1% of credit card purchases in October were contactless and through digital wallets, reaching 373.8 million shekels ($118.5 million).
Shva said the volume of purchases via digital wallets has risen 20 times in the past half year since Apple Pay entered the market.
""The entry of Google Pay will lead to a further increase in digital wallets,"" said Shva chief executive Eitan Lev Tov.

Israel's large banks and credit card companies, which issue Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) cards, said in individual statements that they had signed the agreements with Google to offer Google Pay, with some banks giving cash back to customers for using the service.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening firmly higher Tuesday, continuing to rebound as investors reassess the perceived risks associated with the Omicron Covid variant.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 355 points, or 1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 60 points, or 1.3%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 295 points, or 1.9%.
The major indices roared back on Monday, after last week’s hefty losses, after comments from public health officials indicated that illnesses associated with the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus may be less severe than the previous versions. That raises the tantalizing possibility of a variant that accelerates natural immunity to the disease without creating a fresh crisis in hospitals around the world.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 650 points, or 1.9%, on Monday, one of its best days this year, while the broad-based S&P 500 jumped 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite ended 0.9% higher.
Over the weekend, the White House’s chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, called the initial data on the variant “encouraging,” and this optimism is supporting the market in a week that is light in terms of major data and also a quiet spot on the earnings calendar.
Adding to the return of confidence has been the loosening of Chinese monetary policy, in the shape of China’s reserve ratio cut late on Monday.
In terms of corporate news, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) traded sharply higher premarket after the chip giant announced plans to take its self-driving car unit Mobileye (F:0ME) public, probably in the middle of next year.
Intel will remain the majority owner of Mobileye, and the two companies will continue as strategic partners, a statement by the chipmaker said.
 MongoDB  (NASDAQ:MDB) will also be in focus after the database provider lifted its forecast for the third time in the year after strong growth in the August-October period.
Elsewhere, U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are due to speak later Tuesday in an attempt to defuse the tension on the Ukrainian border. A Russian invasion would likely lead to the U.S. and its European allies imposing sanctions targeting the country’s banking sector. 
Crude prices rose Tuesday, adding to the previous session’s strong gains as worries over the impact of the omicron Covid variant on global demand eased. 
Also, the chance of Iranian exports returning to the global market fell after Germany urged Iran on Monday to present realistic proposals in talks over its nuclear program. This suggests a nuclear deal is still a long way off. 
Investors now await the release of the U.S. government’s Short-Term Energy Outlook at 12 PM ET, as well U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, at 4:30 PM ET.

Investing.com – Stocks of companies linked to Donald Trump's new media business were trading higher in premarket Tuesday as the plans of the former U.S. President for a strong social media play gather steam.
According to the latest development, Congressman Devin G. Nunes, who is currently a sitting U.S. House Representative, will join Trump Media & Technology as its CEO next month.

Trump Media is merging with SPAC  Digital World Acquisition  Corp (NASDAQ:DWAC), whose stock traded 5% higher in premarket. It had fallen 2.6% on Monday after confirming it had received requests from the Securities and Exchanges Commission for certain information predating its listing. Analysts said reports of meetings between Trump and the SPAC's sponsor Patrick Orlando early in 2021 raised questions about whether the company had provided full disclosure to investors when it listed.
Meanwhile, shares in CF Acquisition (NASDAQ:CFVI), a SPAC merging with social media platform Rumble (which counts Trump as a member), were up 4%.
Barred from big global platforms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Trump is reportedly now looking for a platform from which to launch another run at the presidency in 2024.

The Financial Times on Tuesday reported that the proposal, under development for years, will as expected put the burden of proof on companies, rather than workers, to show when their delivery people are self-employed.
A spokesperson for the European Commission declined to ment until its publication on Thursday.
Shares in the Netherlands' Just Eat Takeaway.com rose 6.3% by 1030 GMT, Germany's Delivery Hero rose 4.5, and Britain's Deliveroo was up 1.9%, reversing similar declines on Monday, in an apparent relief rally to recover some on Monday's losses. Uber (NYSE:UBER) shares closed at $38.49 in the United States.
Analysts for Citi said in a note that Deliveroo is most heavily exposed to the proposed rule change, while larger European rival Takeaway already uses an employment model. Delivery Hero and Uber have larger operations in non-European markets.
At present, gig economy workers in Europe have typically been considered self-employed, relieving companies of the obligation to pay them minimum wage or giving them sick leave or holiday pay.
However, court decisions in the Netherlands, Britain, Italy and Spain in the past two years have challenged that.
The FT, citing from the unpublished proposal, said it could mean the reclassification of 4.1 million contractors as employees, leading to 484 million euros ($545 million)in extra annual pay and entitling them to the same ""rights and protections"" as other employees under European law.

A study by Copenhagen Economics commissioned by an industry group for the platform companies published last month argued that the new European rules might lead to the loss of 75,000 jobs.

The database provider said it sees its current-year revenue around $848 million at the midpoint of its guidance range, about $40 million higher than its projections three months ago. The company’s first estimate, given in March, had guided for $755 million in annual revenue.
It also projected a much narrower adjusted loss from operations. It now sees that at $36.4 million on the higher side, after previously guiding for at least $62 million. Adjusted net loss in the third quarter more than halved from a year ago to $7.2 million.
The company said its customer count crossed 31,000 by the end of October, and that helped its subscription revenue jump 51% to $218 million.
Total revenue climbed 50% to $227 million, propelled by sales of MongoDB Atlas (NYSE:ATCO). Sales of the company’s flagship product jumped 84% amid competition from the likes of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).

262,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 05:45AM ET</span>",Evergrande’s Epic Restructuring Puts Onus on Xi to Limit Fallout,"(Bloomberg) -- The question has loomed over China Evergrande Group (OTC:EGRNY) for months: Is the world’s most indebted developer too big to fail? 
Investors finally have their answer. With a flurry of announcements that sent Evergrande bonds tumbling to record lows this week, the company and Beijing have made it clear that billionaire Hui Ka Han’s property giant is headed for one of China’s largest-ever debt restructurings. 
Barring a last-minute shock, holders of $19.2 billion in Evergrande dollar notes face deep haircuts as the company overhauls its mammoth balance sheet without a government bailout -- a process that promises to be long, contentious and potentially risky for Asia’s largest economy.
While ratings companies have yet to declare an official default, holders of two bonds issued by an Evergrande unit hadn’t received overdue coupon payments by the end of a 30-day grace period on Monday. S&P Global Ratings said on Tuesday that a default by the developer was “inevitable.” Evergrande didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Read more: Evergrande Bondholders Yet to Be Paid as Grace Period Ends
The developments mark the beginning of the end for the sprawling real estate empire started 25 years ago by Hui, setting off a lengthy battle over who gets paid from what remains. Evergrande said in a brief exchange filing on Friday that it plans to “actively engage” with offshore creditors on a restructuring plan. The company is planning to include all its offshore public bonds and private debt obligations in the restructuring, people familiar with the matter said Monday.
Evergrande, which disclosed more than $300 billion of total liabilities as of June, becomes the biggest victim of President Xi Jinping’s efforts to crack down on the free-wheeling real estate sector and curb property speculation. Beijing’s reluctance to bail out the developer sends a clear signal that the Communist Party won’t tolerate massive debt build-ups that threaten financial stability.
The question now is whether the government can limit the fallout. Already, the stocks and bonds of smaller, lower-rated real estate firms have plunged. At least 10 have defaulted on onshore or offshore bonds since concerns about Evergrande’s financial health intensified in June.  Kaisa Group  Holdings Ltd (HK:1638), a major issuer of dollar bonds, has also been pushed to the brink in recent days. Junk dollar bond yields have soared above 20%, making it prohibitively expensive for cash-strapped firms to borrow offshore. Home sales and prices have cratered, adding another headwind for an economy grappling with sluggish growth.
“They’re playing with fire,” said Cathie Wood, the head of Ark Investment Management, which pared its China holdings earlier this year.
For now, Chinese authorities are signaling that they plan to ring-fence Evergrande and limit contagion rather than orchestrate a rescue as they’ve done during past crises. 
The People’s Bank of China reiterated on Friday that risks posed to the economy by Evergrande’s debt crisis can be contained, citing the developer’s “own poor management” and “reckless expansion” for the problems it faces. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said in a separate statement that loans for real estate development and acquisitions should be issued in a “reasonable” manner. 
The latest financial system support measures came on Monday, with China’s central bank releasing about 1.2 trillion yuan ($188 billion) of liquidity via a cut in the reserve requirement ratio for most banks. The government pledged to support the housing market to better meet “reasonable” needs, adding to signs it will ease real estate curbs.
Officials are also stepping in to help Evergrande run its business. Chairman Hui was summoned by the Guangdong government last week after the company said it plans to work with creditors on a restructuring plan. Authorities in Evergrande’s home province will send a working group to urge the builder to manage risks, as well as strengthen internal controls and ensure normal operations, according to a Dec. 3 statement.
So far, containment efforts haven’t assuaged investors. While pain has so far largely been contained to China’s smaller offshore credit market, that’s little consolation for developers that have relied heavily on international investors to raise funds. Borrowing costs have spiked for companies with the weakest balance sheets, including Kaisa and Fantasia Holdings Group Co. 
Read more: Kaisa Creditors Offer Forbearance to Avoid Bond Default
In all, Chinese borrowers have defaulted on a record $10.2 billion of offshore bonds this year, with real estate firms making up 36% of that total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
“There is extreme stress in the market,” with about half the developers in the country in deep financial distress and pricing in high default risk, said Jenny Zeng, co-head of Asia Pacific fixed-income at Alliance Bernstein. 
Still, China’s bigger, higher-rated developers such as Longfor Group Holdings Ltd. and Country Garden Holdings Co. are holding up much better than their lower-rated rivals. Country Garden, the largest developer by sales, has seen its 2031 bond rebound to 88 cents on the dollar, after dropping to 73 cents last month. A 2024 note sold by China Vanke Co., the second-biggest firm, has rallied to trade above par.
“We expect sector divergence to continue,” said Iris Chen, a credit desk analyst at Nomura Securities Co. “The high-quality survivors of the game will gain despite relatively high cash prices already, as they will have a better chance to restart normal refinancing, which will further strengthen their liquidity.”
China is also trying to limit the fallout on the broader housing market, in a country where real estate accounts for about a quarter of economic output and as much as 75% of household wealth. China’s housing slump has intensified in recent months after sales plunged and home prices fell for the first time in six years. Contract sales by the country’s top 100 developers plunged 38% in November from a year earlier to 751 billion yuan, sharper than the 32% drop in the previous month, according to preliminary data from China Real Estate Information Corp.
Any slowdown in real estate could have a ripple effect not only on China’s economy but on global growth. China’s growth slowed in the third quarter, with signs there will be more pain to come. The Federal Reserve last month warned that fragility in China’s commercial real-estate sector could spread to the U.S. if it deteriorates dramatically. China’s real estate sector makes up almost half of the world’s distressed dollar-denominated debt.
“Think about the cyclical risk out there if we lose China,” Ark Investment’s Wood said at a recent Milken Global Conference. “At the margin, China has been responsible for a tremendous amount of cyclical growth.”
China’s government isn’t standing pat. President Xi oversaw a meeting of the Communist Party’s Politburo on Monday that concluded with a signal of an easing in curbs on real estate. The leadership panel, gathering in advance of a broader annual economic session that sets goals for the coming year, pledged to stabilize the economy in 2022.
For global bondholders, an Evergrande default is likely to start a prolonged battle for repayment. Chinese authorities have made it clear the company should put homebuyers, suppliers, and retail investors -- who bought the firm’s wealth management products -- ahead of debtholders. Some 1.6 million homebuyers have put down deposits with Evergrande for properties that have yet to be completed.
“No matter what the outcome, offshore bondholders are last in line for payment and are certainly going to have to accept haircuts, possibly significant ones,” said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research Inc. in Hong Kong.
With Evergrande’s dollar notes trading at about 20 cents on the dollar, the market is already pricing in a haircut of around 80%. The key for bondholders is whether the company can speed up home sales and unload assets to raise cash so it can start settling its liabilities, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis SA.
Evergrande’s offshore noteholders included Ashmore Group Plc and UBS AG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even as Evergrande’s stock and bond prices have plunged, Ashmore bought another $100 million of bonds issued by the developer or its subsidiaries in the third quarter. The trades brought its holdings to more than $500 million at the end of September, the data show.
Further market reaction to Evergrande’s missed payments may be driven by how the restructuring process plays out, said Jim Veneau, head of Asian fixed income at AXA SA (PA:AXAF). 
“An orderly restructuring, where the company can run its operations as normally as possible and refrain from distressed asset sales will substantially help contain further damage across the sector,” Veneau said.
The single biggest loser in dollar terms may be Evergrande founder Hui, who once owned more than 70% of the company before recent stock sales. The plunge in Evergrande’s share price this year has cut the chairman’s wealth by 73%, or about $17 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Once the second-richest man in China, Hui now ranks 75th.
For years, the son of an impoverished wood cutter who built one of China’s biggest real estate firms and later branched out into electric vehicles, tourism and soccer clubs, has been able to count on the support of Beijing, or other tycoons to bail him out. This time, he appears on his own.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Macau's gaming regulator has ordered junket operators in the world's largest gambling hub to stop offering credit to customers, according to brokerage firm Bernstein.
Macau's Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau (DICJ) has ordered the operators, who bring big-spending clients from mainland China to VIP rooms in Macau casinos, often with loans to gamble with, to stop offering credit, Bernstein said in a research note on Monday, citing sources.
""Wynn and others are in the process of shuttering junket operations,"" Bernstein said in the note.
Separately, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing unidentified sources, that Wynn and Melco would close their junket rooms by Dec. 20 and Dec. 21.
Macau's gaming regulator did not respond to a request for comment. 
Casino operators  Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF), Sands China (OTC:SCHYY), Galaxy Entertainment, SJM Holdings (OTC:SJMHF) and Melco International Development also did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
The news comes days after embattled junket giant Suncity closed all of its VIP gambling rooms in Macau after its chief executive, Alvin Chau, was arrested over alleged links to cross-border gambling.
Authorities in mainland China, where gambling is illegal, see junkets as responsible for helping to siphon billions of yuan overseas, a risk to a country that has always had strict controls on capital outflows.

Carlos Lobo, a Macau-based gaming consultant, said if the Macau government did make junkets stop offering credit to clients, it would mark the end of an era.
""If this is true, the junkets will have to operate as a travel agency, through activities such as receiving fees for bringing rich clients to casino operators, rather than receiving commissions from VIP gaming rooms which has been the main business model for years,"" he said.

Around 70% of EVs sold so far were hybrids, board member Pieter Nota said in a roundtable with journalists, adding that the company believed hybrid models would continue to play an important role in particular for customers without easy access to chargers.
Continuing to modernise fossil fuel-burning cars was another important step towards making the industry more sustainable, he said: ""Only then can we make a difference across the customer base.""
BMW has long stood for investing in a range of technologies rather than focusing purely on battery-electric cars to reduce emissions, and opposes flat-out bans on purchasing combustion engine cars.
The carmaker aims for at least 50% of global sales to be fully electric by 2030, but has repeated on numerous occasions that lacking charging infrastructure was a major barrier to quicker consumer uptake of electric vehicles.

Sales in November were slightly below last year's levels, Nota said, as a lack of chips continued to restrict supply. However, the company remained confident that it would see absolute revenue growth compared to last year, he said.

267,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 05:11AM ET</span>","Samsung Closes Up on Plan to Merge Mobile, Consumer Units","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) stock (KS:005930) closed 1.4% higher Tuesday in Seoul trading as the company announced a revamp of its business structure as well as a reshuffle in top management.
The Korean giant will merge its mobile and consumer electronics divisions. It also has two new co-chief executives now, down from three earlier who were appointed in the last big shake-up in 2017.
The exercise is aimed at reviving growth in its slowing mobile phone business, capturing a higher share of the booming chip and component market, and creating a unified platform for its various devices and consumer appliances, from washing machines and air-conditioners to refrigerators.
The mobile phone business's contribution to Samsung’s profits has shrunk to 21% from nearly 70% in the last decade and it now trails the company’s component division, which also houses chip-making. The latter has benefitted from the surge in demand for digital and Cloud services. The mobile phone business has got sandwiched between Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone at the top end and cheaper products from Chinese rivals Xiaomi (OTC:XIACY) and Huawei.
Han Jong-hee, the head of Samsung’s visual display business, will become a co-CEO, leading the newly merged division that is also home to TV-manufacturing.
Kyung Kye-hyun, as the other co-CEO, will head the semiconductor division at a crunch time for the sector. The company is betting big on a sustained increase in chip demand and last month chose Texas for a new plant that will cost some $17 billion.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU antitrust regulator seeks input on Microsoft's $16 billion Nuance deal,"By Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - EU's antitrust regulator is taking a deeper look into  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $16 billion deal for transcription technology company  Nuance Communications  (NASDAQ:NUAN) Inc, asking customers and competitors to draw up a list of concerns, according to a questionnaire from last month seen by Reuters.
The previously unreported outreach is the most extensive by an antitrust authority since the companies announced the acquisition in April, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Microsoft declined to comment, and Nuance did not respond to a request for comment.
After minimal review, the U.S. Department of Justice in June and the Australian Competition Commission in October said they would not contest the deal. The companies filed for approval from the European Commission's competition bureau last month, and the regulator has until Dec. 21 to clear the deal or open a bigger investigation.
The companies had expected to close the deal by the end of this year, but said last month the timeline could slip to early next year.
The questionnaire asks whether Microsoft and Nuance are competitors and whether a tie-up could affect clients and rivals, including whether Microsoft could favor Nuance over competing services.
Nuance primarily sells transcription technology that is popular among doctors and call centers that want to automate note-talking. Analysts view the deal as bolstering Microsoft's presence in the healthcare market, and bringing it new voice and medical data to train artificial intelligence offerings in health, speech and biometric security.
Like other big tech companies, Microsoft for years has grown its business through acquisitions, such as in advertising and video gaming. But in the last decade, Microsoft has avoided the target that recently has dogged its competitors Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which are facing antitrust lawsuits and investigations on numerous issues. 
Steven Weber, a University of California Berkeley professor studying the intersection of technology and health care, said possible concerns about the pending deal could include Microsoft forcing its Office suite on Nuance customers by bundling them together. 
Nuance has said it serves 77% of U.S. hospitals.
A key to its success has been has ensuring in deals with customers that it could use their data to advance its voice recognition systems, according to former chief executive Paul Ricci and another former employee.
For instance, a Nuance contract with Augusta University Medical Center, obtained by Reuters this year through a public records request, reads, ""Customer shall provide Nuance access to voice and text data...and grants Nuance a perpetual, royalty-free license to copy, use and analyze such data for speech recognition research.""

Big cloud vendors such as Amazon and Microsoft typically do not have unfettered access to customers' data for research and development. But the opportunity to acquire those relationships and data explains Microsoft's interest in Nuance, the former employees said.
Other providers of health transcription technologies include 3M Co and Philips.

SEOUL (Reuters) -LG Energy Solution (LGES) is likely to raise up to 12.8 trillion won ($10.87 billion) in what could be South Korea's biggest initial public offering as the battery maker seeks funds to expand and meet booming demand for EV batteries.
Even at the low end of its pricing range, LG looks set to top the country's largest listing to date, Samsung (KS:005930) Life Insurance's 4.9 trillion won IPO in 2010. 
""Through this IPO, we are preemptively responding to the demand for the lithium-ion battery market, which is expected to see rapid growth,"" LGES Chief Executive Officer Kwon Young Soo said in a statement. 
LGES is LG Chem Ltd's wholly owned battery subsidiary and supplies Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, General Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co, among others.
It expects to offer 34 million new shares in an indicative range of 257,000 to 300,000 won per share, it said in a regulatory filing. 
LG Chem plans to offer 8.5 million existing shares in the same price range, according to a separate filing. 
In this range, LGES' valuation would be as much as 70.2 trillion won ($59.55 billion), the company said in a statement. 
The IPO could make it South Korea's third most valuable company after Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and SK Hynix Inc yet analysts still said the valuation was underrated. 
""It's too cheap,"" said Rho Woo-ho, analyst at Meritz Securities, adding that LGES' production capacity target for 2025 is similar to that of its bigger Chinese rival Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL). 
CATL's market cap is currently about 1.6 trillion yuan ($251.28 billion). 
""I think they lowered the price range on purpose, first to build a market consensus that it's good value, and second, because (parent) LG Chem intends to hold on to about an 80% stake, the amount of traded shares will be very small, which will drive up demand and the share price.""
The pricing is expected to be finalised in mid-January, with a listing in Seoul expected later that month. 
South Korea is seeing its hottest IPO market on record this year. More than 20 companies have gone public on the main KOSPI market, raising about 17 trillion won, beating the 8.8 trillion won raised in 2010, the biggest year on record, according to the Korea Exchange. 
Global EV sales, estimated at 2.5 million vehicles in 2020, are forecast to grow more than 12-fold to 31.1 million by 2030 and account for nearly a third of new vehicle sales, according to consulting firm Deloitte.
KB Securities and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) will lead the proposed deal. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Daishin Securities, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Shinhan Investment Corp have also been appointed as bookrunners.

Investing.com – Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) climbed 7.6% in Tuesday’s premarket trading on its plan to take its self-driving car unit Mobileye (F:0ME) public.
Intel plans an initial public offering for the unit Mobileye stock in mid-2022, according to a Wall Street Journal report published on Tuesday.
Intel will remain the majority owner of Mobileye, and the two companies will continue as strategic partners, a statement by the chipmaker said.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has been under pressure from activist investors such as Third Point to consider spinning off its costly chip manufacturing operations, while the company has gone on to commit billions of dollars toward advanced chip manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and Europe to address a global semiconductor shortage. It is investing $20 billion in two chip-making facilities in Arizona.
After dominating the chip business in computers and laptops until the early 2000s, Intel has lost ground in recent years, especially in the mobile and server segments. It ceded space to AMD in computers and lost out to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in gaming and servers and to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in mobile.
Expansion into self-driving mobility is a way of compensating for such declines. 
Intel bought Mobileye for over $15 billion in 2017 to take on rivals like Nvidia and Qualcomm which also see driverless systems as the next big revenue stream to put their chips inside."

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday, helped by China easing monetary policy while concerns about the economic impact of the Omicron Covid variant ease.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.8% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1.1%. 
Gig economy stocks were in the ascendant after new EU rules on worker classification stopped short of forcing companies to treat contractors as employees, with all the additional costs that that would bring. Instead, companies will only have to prove that contractors are indeed just that. Just Eat Takeaway (AS:TKWY) stock rose 6.9% while Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) stock rose 4.3%.
This positive tone has also been helped by the decision of the People's Bank of China to cut the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, reducing the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve.
This move, the second this year, is aimed at loosening liquidity conditions as China Evergrande and other big property developers face debt default risks.
Global equities bounced on Monday on receding worries about the impact of the Omicron variant after health officials from both South Africa, where the variant was first discovered, and the U.S. reported over the weekend that Omicron cases had only shown mild symptoms. 
In corporate news, ABB (SIX:ABBN) stock rose 1.5% after the Swiss engineering company unveiled higher sales and profitability targets on Tuesday, and BMW (DE:BMWG) stock rose 1.4% after the German carmaker said it has sold its one millionth electric vehicle and plans to reach two million total EV sales by 2025. Stellantis (PA:STLA) stock rose 2.1% after the owner of Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Fiat and Chrysler set out targets to generate 20 billion euros from software-related subscriptions by the end of the decade.
Ashtead (LON:AHT) stock rose 2.6% after the U.K.-based equipment rental company raised its guidance and dividend, while the likes of Rio Tinto (DE:RIO) and BHP Group (LON:BHPB) rose over 2.5% following a big jump in iron ore prices in China due to speculation that the government will lift steel production curbs. 
Turning to economic data, the main release will be the German ZEW economic sentiment index for December, which is expected to show falling confidence in the Eurozone’s most important economy after mobility restrictions were reintroduced to combat the latest Covid surge.
Crude prices rose Tuesday, adding to the previous session’s strong gains as worries over the impact of the omicron Covid variant on global demand eased. 
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.3% higher at $71.11 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2% to $74.54. Both benchmarks posted gains of just under 5% on Monday.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,783.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1279.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 03:41AM ET</span>",Intel plans to take self-driving car unit Mobileye public,"By Stephen Nellis and Jahnavi Nidumolu
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) said on Monday it plans to take self-driving-car unit Mobileye (F:0ME) public in the United States in mid-2022, a deal which could value the Israeli unit at more than $50 billion, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Chip giant Intel, the largest employer of Israel's high-tech industry with nearly 14,000 workers, expects to retain Mobileye's executive team and hold on to a majority ownership in the unit after the initial public offering (IPO) of newly issued Mobileye stock.
Intel has no intention to divest or spin off its majority ownership in Mobileye, the company said in a statement, adding that it will continue to provide technical resources to the automaker.
The partnership continues to yield strong revenue along with free cash flow to Mobileye that allows funding of the autonomous vehicle development, Mobileye Chief Executive Officer Amnon Shashua said in a release.
""Amnon and I determined that an IPO provides the best opportunity to build on Mobileye's track record for innovation and unlock value for shareholders,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in the statement.
Gelsinger has been under pressure from activist investors such as Third Point LLC to consider spinning off its costly chip manufacturing operations, even as the company has looked to expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity in the United States and Europe amid a global semiconductor shortage.
Intel bought Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017, putting it into direct competition with rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc to develop driverless systems for global automakers. 
Carmakers, including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford and Toyota, are racing to shift from gasoline-powered lineups to all electric power and have invested significantly on models with features such as driver-assist technology and self-driving system. 
Mobileye, founded in 1999, has taken a different strategy from many of its self-driving car competitors, with a current camera-based system that helps cars with adaptive cruise control and lane change assistance.
The company plans to eventually build its own ""lidar"" sensor to help its cars map out a three-dimensional view of the road and is using lidar units from Luminar Technologies on its initial robotaxis in the meantime.

Despite being owned by Intel, Mobileye has never used Intel's factories to make its chips, instead relying on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co for all of its ""EyeQ"" chips to date.
The Wall Street Journal first reported Intel's intent to list the shares.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 03:36AM ET</span>",Explainer-What's next for China Evergrande after missing coupon payments,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Some offshore bondholders of China Evergrande Group did not receive coupon payments by the end of a 30-day grace period, four people with knowledge of the matter said, pushing the cash-strapped property developer closer to formal default.
Failure to make $82.5 million in interest payments that were due last month would trigger cross-default on the firm's roughly $19 billion of international bonds and put the developer at risk of becoming China's biggest-ever defaulter.
WHAT IS EVERGRANDE?
Chairman Hui Ka Yan founded Evergrande in Guangzhou in 1996. It is China's second-largest property developer, with $110 billion in sales last year, $355 billion in assets and more than 1,300 developments nationwide. It listed in Hong Kong in 2009.
Evergrande grew rapidly through a loan-supported land-buying spree and selling apartments quickly at low margins. It employed 163,119 staff as of June-end, its interim report showed.
Slowing growth has seen it branch into businesses such as insurance, bottled water, soccer and electric vehicles (EVs).
HOW DID CONCERNS ARISE OVER DEBT?
In September last year, a leaked letter showed Evergrande pleading for government support to approve a now-dropped backdoor stock market listing. Sources told Reuters the letter was authentic; Evergrande called it fake.
In June, Evergrande said it did not pay some commercial paper on time, and in July a court froze a $20 million bank deposit held by the firm at the bank's request.
The firm in late August said construction at some of its developments had halted due to missed payments to contractors and suppliers. And in September, it sought payment extension for trust and bank loans.
Liabilities, including payables, totalled 1.97 trillion yuan ($306 billion) at June-end - equivalent to 2% of China's gross domestic product.
HOW HAS EVERGRANDE REDUCED DEBT?
Evergrande accelerated efforts to cut debt last year after regulators introduced caps on three debt ratios, dubbed the ""three red lines"". It has been aiming to meet those requirements by the end of 2022.
It offered steep discounts on residential developments to spur sales and sold the bulk of its commercial properties. Since the second half of 2020, it has had a $555 million secondary share sale and raised $1.8 billion by listing its property management unit, while its EV unit sold a $3.4 billion stake.
In September, it said asset and equity disposal plans had failed to make material progress. It has since sold new shares in the company and stakes in units such as HengTen Networks Group Ltd to raise capital.
WHAT'S THE RISK?
China's central bank said in 2018 companies including Evergrande might pose systemic risk to the financial system.
The firm's liabilities involved as many as 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions, the leaked letter showed.
Late repayments could trigger cross-defaults as many financial institutions are exposed via direct loans and indirect holdings through different financial instruments.
WHAT ABOUT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE MAINLAND CHINA?
In Hong Kong, Evergrande owns an office tower and residential developments, plus a vast undeveloped land parcel.
It has spent billions of dollars acquiring stakes in automobile technology developers, including Sweden's NEVS and the Netherlands' e-Traction. It also has joint ventures with Germany's Hofer and Sweden's Koenigsegg.
WHAT DO REGULATORS SAY ABOUT EVERGRANDE AND PROPERTY?
Authorities including Vice Premier Liu He, the central bank and the securities regulator have been assuring markets that risk to the property sector and economy were controllable, and that Evergrande's problems were mainly due to its ""own mismanagement"" and ""break-neck expansion"".
In coordinated statements on Friday, the People's Bank of China said short-term risk caused by a single real estate firm would not undermine market fundraising in the medium or long term, and that housing sales, land purchases and financing ""have already returned to normal in China"".
WHAT'S NEXT FOR EVERGRANDE? 
Evergrande said on Monday it had established a risk-management committee including officials from state companies to assist in ""mitigating and eliminating the future risks"".
That came after the provincial government of Guangdong said it would send a team to Evergrande at the developer's request, which analysts said signalled Evergrande would begin managed debt-asset restructuring.
WHAT WILL DEBT RESTRUCTURING LOOK LIKE?

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said such a process would involve coordination between authorities to maintain operations of property projects, and negotiation with onshore creditors to ensure financing for project completion.
Regulators would also likely facilitate debt restructuring discussion with offshore creditors after operations stabilise, Morgan Stanley said.

""I'm excited. I feel like an elementary school student about to go on a outing,"" Maezawa said at a news conference. ""I didn't think I would be able to go to space. I used to like the starry sky and heavenly bodies. I feel fortunate to have this opportunity and to finally fulfil my dream.""
The billionaire has been chronicling his preparations, including demonstrating his space suit and riding a centrifuge, in social media posts, with plans to post more from space.
During his 100 days in training, Maezawa said he had enjoyed parabolic flight, where weightlessness is induced for short periods on an adapted plane, but found training in a spinning chair tough.
The entrepreneur, who was wearing a blue flight suit with a badge reading ""world peace"", said he had struggled to learn Russian to communicate with his trainers and looked forward to eating sushi when he returns to Earth. 
Maezawa will become the first private passenger on the SpaceX moon trip, as commercial firms including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin usher in a new age of space travel for wealthy clients. The billionaire, who sold his online fashion business Zozo to SoftBank in 2019, is searching for eight people who will join him in his moon voyage in 2023, requiring applicants to pass medical tests and an interview.

Maezawa has become a household name in Japan through his penchant for private jets and supercars, cash giveaways to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followers and celebrity girlfriends in a country known for its conformist, corporate culture.
Maezawa will be the first Japanese private citizen in space since TV journalist Toyohiro Akiyama visited the Mir space station in 1990.

277,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 02:50AM ET</span>","Analysis-China Evergrande teeters again, but investors less fearful","By Marc Jones and Ross Kerber
LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Just three months after narrowly avoiding collapse, the world's most indebted developer China Evergrande Group is teetering on the brink again and investors are still unclear how much or for how long the problems could reverberate.
With over $300 billion of liabilities and more than 1,300 real estate projects, Evergrande has been the poster child of a property crisis in China this year that has already ripped down nearly a dozen smaller developers.
Evergrande could still pay an overdue $82.5 million bond payment which has now reached the end of its grace period, but it has warned it might not. Some offshore bondholders did not receive payments https://www.reuters.com/world/china/developer-china-evergrandes-shares-set-rise-66-restructuring-looms-2021-12-07 by the end of a 30-day grace period on Monday New York time.
At a time of slowing property sales in China, a disorderly Evergrande default could accelerate financial stress across the property sector, said Logan Wright, director of China markets research for consultant Rhodium Group. 
A resolution must account for billions of yuan due to contractors and suppliers.
""Right now there is very little clarity on the potential sources of this financing, even if there is more confidence that authorities will respond with some resolution to limit financial contagion,"" Wright said.
Having narrowly avoided becoming China's biggest default with 11th-hour payments at the end of a grace period in the last couple of months, Evergrande is once again back on the ledge.
But unlike a couple of month ago, the fallout has been broadly contained inside China and with policy makers in Beijing becoming more vocal and markets more familiar, the consequences of Evergrande's troubles will be less widely felt, investors say. 
Liqian Ren, a WisdomTree director who follows China, expects Evergrande will likely default.
Still, she pointed to Friday's central bank statement, and other official statements like it, pledging Evergrande was an individual issue and long-term funding functions would not suffer.
""Contagion happens when you have something where nobody knows who owns what,"" and events move quickly, she said. Rather, she added, a default by Evergrande would look more like the case of HNA Group, whose restructuring plan was approved by creditors in October. 
Tracy Chen, fixed-income portfolio manager for Brandywine Global Investment Management, also saw the broader risks of an Evergrande collapse as low.
""I think the systemic risk is very unlikely and regulators have been doing a decent job in making this what they call a ‘limited detonation’,"" Chen said.
China's central bank has pumped 1.2 trillion yuan ($188 billion) into the banking system, its second such move https://www.reuters.com/business/chinas-rrreminder-that-economies-remain-fragile-2021-07-09 since July, and the regional government where Evergrande is based has said it is now stepping in.
CONTAGION RISK 
Within China, the question for sector experts is whether this can prevent yet more contagion.
Since October's dodge, a clutch of Evergrande's smaller rivals have either gone under or restructured. Kaisa, China's first property default back in 2015 which has over $3 billion of debt to refinance next year, is also in serious strife.
""Generally speaking nothing much has changed (since October's Evergrande deadline) but the market mood has changed,"" said Seaport Global analyst Himanshu Porwal, pointing to the string of smaller defaults.
It was positive that provincial governments wanted to get involved in cases like Evergrande's, he said, but none of the state-owned property firms had taken part in the firm's projects to ease its liquidity crunch. (Graphic: Fitch China proper and land sales, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akvezomgdpr/Fitch%20China%20proper%20and%20land%20sales.PNG) 
In the meantime, the damage inside the country continues.
China real estate HY bonds have suffered their worst year on record this year, losing more than a third of their value on average, while Evergrande, Kaisa and defaulters like Fantasia are down at least 80%.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) counts a total of 11 defaults this year already and with land sales slumping over 55% year-on-year, and housing sales themselves down 25% in October, more are expected.
It thinks Beijing needs to be more direct with its support.

""To prevent contagion cascading up the credit curve, regulators would need to think about stabilising both physical demand and financial markets,"" the firm's head of Asia Corporate Research, Frank Pan, said.
""The concern is that if regulators fail to prevent wide-scale defaults within the sector, we could potentially see more bonds trading at distressed levels,"" adding that even ""better quality"" firms could find it harder to refinance.

278,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 02:45AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Omicron! What Omicron?,"A look at the day ahead from Saikat Chatterjee. 
That broadly seems to be the tone in global markets on Tuesday as investors ramped up bets that the new Omicron variant may not prove to be as deadly as previously feared. World stocks are on track for their biggest daily rise in nearly two months, money markets are back to pricing the U.S. rate hike by June 2022 and the dollar has clawed back half of its losses against the perceived safe-haven Japanese yen since the variant first hit the headlines. 
Even policymakers are optimistic. Australia’s central bank indicated the Omicron variant outbreak was unlikely to derail the current financial recovery while top U.S. infectious disease official Anthony Fauci told CNN, ""it does not look like there's a great degree of severity"" so far.
More good news also came from Beijing which cut the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve on Monday, its second such move this year, releasing about $188 billion funds in long-term liquidity to bolster slowing economic growth. Though questions remain over the future of China Evergrande Group with a number of bondholders in the heavily indebted property developer saying they did not receive coupon payments by the end of a 30-day grace period on Monday New York time.
Investors pushed European and U.S. stock futures higher, expecting the broader economic recovery won’t get derailed in 2022. 
Expectations that global central banks won’t rush to tighten policy immediately propped up Chinese shares and boosted the Australian dollar. Indeed, JPMorgan’s strategists postponed their call for the first UK interest rate hike to February from December earlier despite robust labour market data. Market gauges of volatility also slipped back with both European and U.S. gauges well below last week’s highs.
Oil prices ticked higher, consolidating a nearly 5% rebound the day before and cryptocurrencies resumed picking up the pieces after a bruising fall over the weekend.

281,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 01:59AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Higher; Chinese Rate Cut Helps Sentiment,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Tuesday, helped by China easing monetary policy while concerns about the economic impact of the Omicron Covid variant ease.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.7% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.9% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
This positive tone has been helped by the decision of the People's Bank of China to cut the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, reducing the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve.
This move, the second this year, is aimed at bolstering growth as the world’s second largest economy has lost momentum in recent months. It will also loosen liquidity conditions as some leading property developers face debt default risks.
Global equities bounced on Monday on receding worries about the impact of the Omicron variant after health officials from both South Africa, where the variant was first discovered, and the U.S. reported over the weekend that Omicron cases had only shown mild symptoms. 
Additionally, a British study showed that people had a better immune response when they mixed the different Covid-19 vaccines, offering some hope to poorer countries which may need to combine different brands if supplies run low.
In corporate news, ABB (SIX:ABBN) will be in the spotlight after the Swiss engineering company unveiled higher sales and profitability targets on Tuesday, expecting to benefit from higher demand from rebounding economies as well as plugging into trends like decarbonisation.
Turning to economic data, the main release will be the German ZEW economic sentiment index for December, which is expected to show falling confidence in the Eurozone’s most important economy after mobility restrictions were reintroduced to combat the latest Covid surge.
Crude prices rose Tuesday, adding to the previous session’s strong gains as worries over the impact of the omicron Covid variant on global demand eased. 
Also, the chance of Iranian exports returning to the global market fell after Germany urged Iran on Monday to present realistic proposals in talks over its nuclear program. This suggests a nuclear deal is still a long way off. 
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $70.55 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.3% to $74.06. Both benchmarks posted gains of just under 5% on Monday.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,783.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1293.

(Reuters) - Asian equities witnessed money inflows in November as demand for regional semiconductor products boosted foreign buying in South Korean and Taiwanese markets, although concerns over recovery amid the spread of the Omicron variant capped regional inflows.
    Cross-border investors last month purchased equities worth a net $2.04 billion in South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and India, compared with net selling of $6.05 billion in October, data from regional stock exchanges showed. 
Foreign investments in Asian equities https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/movanqjbrpa/Foreign%20investments%20in%20Asian%20equities.jpg 
    South Korea and Taiwanese equities attracted inflows worth $3.04 billion and $676 million, respectively.
South Korean exports in November grew at their fastest pace in three months due to a post-pandemic recovery in major trading partners, while Taiwan's exports climbed to a new high in October.
Philippine equities also saw marginal inflows of $5 million.
""The inflows into South Korea and Taiwan may be underpinned by the rally in the broader semiconductor industry,"" said Jun Rong Yeap, a Singapore-based market strategist at IG.
However, regional equities faced fresh headwinds by the end of last month after a rise in infections from the new Omicron variant raised uncertainties about global economic recovery momentum. 
""Some risk-off mood may drive foreign outflows from Asian equities, considering that previous upside has been built upon positive developments on economic reopening in the region,"" Yeap said.
Offshore investors sold Indian equities worth $790 million last month, marking a second straight month of outflows. Vietnamese equities witnessed outflows for a fourth consecutive month, worth $393 million.
Thai and Indonesian equities also faced outflows of $300 million and $204 million, respectively.

""Inflation data continues to surprise on the upside putting more pressure on tapering. In that regard, we might see renewed outflows from Asia,"" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at investment firm Natixis SA.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to accelerate the taper of its bond-buying programme and lift rates as soon as mid-2022 in order to address stalled workforce growth and inflationary risks.

(Reuters) - Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) computer software firm Cambridge Quantum said on Tuesday it was launching a platform that can generate super secure cryptographic keys and sell them as a commercial product.
The UK-based startup this year became a wholly owned subsidiary of Quantinuum, a quantum computer hardware and software company in which Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON) has a 54% stake.
Cambridge Quantum uses the quantum computer to generate a particularly random encryption key, said its head of cybersecurity Duncan Jones in an interview with Reuters. 
Quantum computers can generate a more random encryption key than classical computers which makes them more secure and less vulnerable to cyber attacks, he said.
Cambridge Quantum said it would target its ""Quantum Origin"" service to financial services firms and cybersecurity firms before expanding it to other high priority sectors, such as telecommunications, energy, manufacturing, defense and government.
""We have been working for a number of years now on a method to efficiently and effectively use the unique features of quantum computers in order to provide our customers with a defense against adversaries and criminals now and in the future once quantum computers are prevalent,"" Ilyas Khan, CEO of Quantinuum and founder of Cambridge Quantum said in a statement.

""Quantum Origin gives us the ability to be safe from the most sophisticated and powerful threats today as well threats from quantum computers in the future.""
Quantum computers are based on quantum bits, or qubits, that can be set to one and zero at the same time, creating exponentially more paths than classical computers whose bits are either ones or zeros. Researchers believe quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today’s advanced supercomputers.

Toyota's acceptance of good enough by using parts it would have thrown away in the past marks a significant change both for a company renowned for stringent quality control and for Japanese manufacturing practices that often prioritised perfection over speed to market. 
""We are careful about the outside of our vehicles, the parts you can easily see. But there are plenty of places that people don't notice unless they really take a good look,"" Takefumi Shiga, Toyota's chief project leader for vehicle development said during a press briefing. 
Toyota last month raised its operating profit outlook https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-second-quarter-quarterly-profit-climbs-2021-11-04 12% for the year ending March 31, helped by favourable currency rates. It warned, however, that a shortage of semiconductors which was curbing production and increasing material costs were hurting its underlying profitability. 
Shiga and other Toyota engineers are expanding a programme begun in 2019 to meet component suppliers, even third tier ones, to assure them that scratches or blemishes are acceptable as long as they do not affect vehicles safety and performance, and are unlikely to be noticed by car buyers. 

""It requires some courage on their part,"" Shiga said.

China's Communist Party’s Politburo concluded a meeting on Monday that signaled an ease in curbs on the real estate sector and vowed to stabilize the economy in 2022. The People’s Bank of China will reduce most banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points next week, releasing CNY1.2 trillion ($188.16 billion) of liquidity.
Premier Li Keqiang added that China has room for a variety of monetary policy tools, including cutting the reserve requirement ratio.
Also on investors’ radars is the country’s property sector, as China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) plans to include all its offshore public bonds and private debt obligations in a restructuring.

On the data front, China’s consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index are due on Thursday.
The Chinese moves could offer some calm in a market that has recently been hit by bouts of volatility. However, some investors predicted that further volatility could be up ahead, with countries tightening restrictive measures due to the omicron COVID-19 variant.
“Clearly the markets are concerned about a growth scare. We are entering year end, there is still some uncertainty,” Edward Jones & Co. senior investment strategist Mona Mahajan told Bloomberg.
“However, more clarity from the Fed at its next meeting and around omicron “could get a spark for perhaps a year-end rally or at least more optimism heading into 2022,” she added.
Minneapolis Fed Bank President Neel Kashkari will speak on Thursday, with U.S. data, including the CPI, following a day later."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s self-driving technology unit Cruise on Monday pushed back on claims from San Francisco authorities that its robotaxis are illegally double-parking, saying they have the right to block traffic for quick stops.
The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) last week challenged Cruise's application for a permit to deploy robotaxis in San Francisco on the grounds that it was illegally ""double parking"" during testing, creating safety and traffic concerns. The agency called for denying the permit until Cruise's technology could demonstrate greater competency.
The California Public Utilities Commission has ultimate say over whether Cruise gets the permit to begin charging the public for rides.
Cruise said state law permits commercial vehicles to park away from a curb when reasonably necessary to load or unload passengers. And San Francisco had no special restrictions in the areas cited in SFMTA's complaint about Cruise.
""Cruise’s operations thus are not only explicitly legally permissible under the Vehicle Code but are consistent with the lawful operation of other commercial vehicles registered in California,"" the company said in a letter to the CPUC on Monday.

SFMTA also criticized Cruise's plans for failing to dedicate service in low-income and minority neighborhoods or to accommodate wheelchairs. The organization Disability Rights California raised similar issues to the CPUC, Cruise said.
Cruise responded that its vehicles can fit in the backseat a foldable wheelchair and a passenger. It added that its longer-term plans call for serving all of San Francisco.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 07:46PM ET</span>",U.S. financial regulators investigate Trump social media deal,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) -Wall Street's top financial regulators are investigating former U.S. President Donald Trump's $1.25 billion deal to float his new social media venture on the stock market, a filing showed.
Digital World Acquisition Corp, the blank-check acquisition firm that agreed to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (TMTG), disclosed in a regulatory filing on Monday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) were probing the deal.
TMTG did not respond to requests for comment.
Digital World said the SEC asked for documents in early November relating to communications between Digital World and TMTG, meetings of Digital World's board, policies and procedures relating to trading, the identification of banking, telephone, and email addresses and the identities of certain investors.
The SEC stated in its request that its investigation does not mean the regulator has concluded that anyone violated the law, Digital World added.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren had asked the SEC to investigate TMTG's proposed merger with Digital World over potential violations of securities laws, including whether they had sufficiently disclosed when deal talks began.
The SEC declined to comment on Monday.
The investigations come amid excitement among Trump supporters and retail investors over the planned deal. Frantic trading of Digital World's shares has driven TMTG's valuation from $875 million in October to close to $4 billion. 
Digital World, whose shares ended trading on Wednesday down 2.6% at $43.81, said FINRA had asked for details in late October and early November about ""surrounding events,"" including a review of trading, that preceded the announcement of the merger.
A Reuters review of trading data showed unusual activity on Oct. 20 ahead of the merger's announcement later that day. Over 1 million warrants, worth a total of around $500,000, were traded, compared with only 119,000 warrants on Oct. 19, according to Refinitiv data.
FINRA said in its request that its inquiry should not be construed as an indication that any violations of Nasdaq rules or federal securities laws have occurred, Digital World added.
FINRA declined to comment.
TOTAL PROCEEDS 
TMTG said on Saturday it had entered into agreements to raise about $1 billion from a group of unidentified investors, bringing the deal's total proceeds to $1.25 billion. 
But TMTG will receive this money only if the deal is completed. A vote required for Digital World shareholders to approve the transaction has yet to be scheduled.
Some on Wall Street have been reluctant to associate with Trump, and the Digital World filings did not disclose which investors backed the $1 billion fundraising.
Trump was banned from top social media platforms after the Jan. 6 attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol amid concerns he would inspire further violence. 
The Capitol attack was based on unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in last year's presidential election.
With the exception of Trump being named TMTG chairman, the company had not identified any of its top executives until Monday, when it announced that Devin Nunes would step down as a U.S. representative to join as its CEO in January.
Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has been one of Trump's staunchest allies in Congress. 
In its first financial projections since the announcement of the merger, Digital World said it expected the average revenue per user of Trump's social media app, TRUTH Social, to grow to $13.50 in 2026, with 81 million total users.

That is despite the app not having reached even trial mode. TMTG plans to launch the beta version of Truth Social in the first quarter of 2022.
Digital World also said it expected TMTG to reach 40 million total subscribers by 2026. By comparison, social media platform  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) has over 200 million daily active users.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 07:45PM ET</span>","U.S. says Nvidia-Arm deal harms market for networking, self-driving car chips","By Stephen Nellis and Diane Bartz
(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday argued that competition in the nascent markets for chips in self-driving cars and a new category of networking chips could be hurt if Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp carries out its $80 billion purchase of Arm Ltd.
Last week, the regulator said it was suing to stop the deal in which Nvidia, the world's most valuable publicly traded chip firm, is vying to buy U.K.-based Arm from current owner Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp. Arm licenses out its computing architecture to semiconductor firms, which use it to design chips for devices like mobile phones.
On Monday, the FTC released a redacted version of its complaint. It said it believes Nvidia's purchase of Arm would hurt competition because hundreds of chip companies that rely on Arm would be hesitant to keep working closely with the British firm for fear of Nvidia gaining access to their product plans. 
Since announcing the deal, Nvidia has sought to frame its purchase as a way of making Arm into a more viable competitor to the ""x86"" architecture owned by  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) that dominates PCs and data centers. Arm is now used in the central processors for smart phones but not for data center servers.
Nvidia has argued that Intel's x86 architecture has 97.4% market share in data center servers, saying that it will invest in Arm to make it a more viable alternative.
But the FTC complaint on Monday focused instead on new markets where Arm is dominant and where x86 is not currently used. It said that Nvidia and rivals from Intel to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc rely primarily on Arm for emerging fields such as self-driving car chips and ""data processing unit"" chips: networking chips that add a layer of security to data centers.
""Nvidia will have the incentive to harm Arm-reliant
(self-driving chip) rivals as opposed to working collaboratively with them to help them succeed, as Arm does today, because Nvidia competes closely against these rivals for major business
opportunities,"" the FTC wrote.
Market definition often plays a large role in deciding antitrust cases.
Nvidia declined to comment beyond a statement issued last week saying it plans to ""work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition.""
Arm executives have told Reuters that Nvidia and Arm plan to create ""firewalls"" https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nvidia-arm/arm-exec-says-firewalls-will-protect-customer-info-after-nvidia-deal-idUSKBN26S3A1 to protect any information shared with Arm from being inappropriately used by Nvidia.

Herbert Hovenkamp, who teaches antitrust at the University of Pennsylvania law school, said any firewalls that Arm and Nvidia created would probably fall short.
""The agencies rightfully hate firewalls,"" he said.

293,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 07:35PM ET</span>",Wall Street regains some ground with help from easing virus fears,"By Devik Jain, Shreyashi Sanyal and Alden Bentley
(Reuters) - Wall Street's major averages closed higher on Monday with economically sensitive sectors and travel-related stocks advancing solidly as investors were encouraged by some optimistic comments from a top U.S. official on the latest COVID-19 variant. 
Of Wall Street's three major averages, the Dow rose the most while industrials and consumer staples, up around 1.6%, were the S&P's strongest sectors followed by energy and utilities, up 1.5%. But declines in COVID-19 vaccine companies diminished gains in the healthcare sector.
While the Omicron COVID-19 variant has caused alarm and some new restrictions around the world, investors appeared to be reassured by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, who told CNN that ""thus far it does not look like there's a great degree of severity to it."" However, he did say that more study is needed.
""People are less worried about the variant,"" said King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. 
Lip also cited a boost from news that China's central bank would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, potentially boosting overseas companies that sell products in China as well as China's economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 646.95 points, or 1.87%, to 35,227.03, the S&P 500 gained 53.24 points, or 1.17%, to 4,591.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 139.68 points, or 0.93%, to 15,225.15.
  The S&P 500 Value Index rose 1.5%, outperforming its growth counterpart, which gained 0.9%.
The economically sensitive Dow Jones Transportation index outperformed the broader market with a 2.3% gain while the small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 2%.
Wall Street's major indexes have been swinging wildly since Nov. 26 as investors digested news of the COVID-19 Omicron variant and then Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments last week about a speedier tapering of government bond-buying to tackle surging inflation.
The S&P's finish on Monday was 2.3% below where it traded before investors started reacting to the Omicron virus. 
""If today's strength in the blue chips can sort of sustain itself, that might give the rest of the market the ability to start to feel confident,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management.
Still, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Saturday cut its outlook for U.S. economic growth to 3.8% for 2022, citing risks and uncertainty around the emergence of Omicron. Investors had also been bracing for a potential hit to corporate earnings, particularly among retailers, restaurants and travel companies.
The industrials sector's three biggest percentage gainers were airlines led by United Airlines 8.3% gain while the S&P Airline's index closed up 5.5%. 
Other strong gainers in travel related stocks included Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings, which finished up 9.5%. Vacation rental company Airbnb added 8.5%. 
Big decliners included COVID-19 vaccine makers such as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, down 13.5%, and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), down 5%, as investors anticipated development of vaccines with protections specific to Omicron could take months. 
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) closed down 2%. Investors have been worried about the outcome of regulatory scrutiny of its deal to buy British chip firm ARM Ltd.
Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) shares closed up 5.4% after hedge fund Engine Capital LP said it was pushing the department-store chain to consider a sale of the company or separate its e-commerce division to improve its lagging stock price.
JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said investors may be preparing for a Dec. 17 expiration of options and futures. 
""You have a lot of firms that have a double mandate right now. You are trying to take off risk, expiration related, while the same time rebalancing your portfolio heading into 2022,"" he said. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.82-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.71-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 28 new highs and 600 new lows. 
On U.S. exchanges, 11.96 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.55 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

""Domestically we are seeing huge demand when borders open,"" he said at a CAPA Centre for aviation event. ""We have seen a surge in 24 hours in the Queensland market alone.""
Queensland on Monday brought forward the opening of its domestic borders to Dec. 13, from a previous estimate of Dec. 17.
Low-cost offshoot Jetstar should reach 120% of pre-COVID domestic capacity by April, while the premium Qantas brand should reach 115%, Joyce said.
He said the airline remained on track to decide by the end of the year on a preferred supplier for more than 100 planes to replace its ageing domestic fleet.

In the international market, it will take far longer to recover to pre-COVID levels, though Qantas will bring back some of its A380 super-jumbo planes for flights from Sydney to London and New York from next July.
Joyce said that although some decline in international business travel was expected, his airline relied on leisure travellers for 60% of premium revenue, large companies for 20% and small and medium businesses for 20%.

296,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 06:48PM ET</span>",Exclusive-SEC probes Tesla over whistleblower claims on solar panel defects,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Chris Prentice
SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has opened an investigation into Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc over a whistleblower complaint that the company failed to properly notify its shareholders and the public of fire risks associated with solar panel system defects over several years, according to a letter from the agency.
The probe raises regulatory pressure on the world's most valuable automaker, which already faces a federal safety probe into accidents involving its driver assistant systems. Concerns about fires from Tesla solar systems have been published previously, but this is the first report of investigation by the securities regulator. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed the Tesla probe in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Steven Henkes, a former Tesla field quality manager, who filed a whistleblower complaint on the solar systems in 2019 and asked the agency for information about the report.
""We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,"" the SEC said in a Sept. 24 response to Henkes, declining his request to provide its records. The SEC official said the letter should not be taken as an indication by the agency that violations of law had occurred. Reuters independently confirmed the SEC letter was legitimate.
Henkes, a former  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) quality division manager, was fired from Tesla in August 2020 and he sued Tesla claiming the dismissal was in retaliation for raising safety concerns. Tesla did not respond to emailed questions from Reuters, while the SEC declined to comment. 
In the SEC complaint, Henkes said Tesla and SolarCity, which it acquired in 2016, did not disclose its ""liability and exposure to property damage, risk of injury of users, fire etc to shareholders"" prior and after the acquisition.
Tesla also failed to notify its customers that defective electrical connectors could lead to fires, according to the complaint.
Tesla told consumers that it needed to conduct maintenance on the solar panel system to avoid a failure that could shut down the system. It did not warn of fire risks, offer temporary shutdown to mitigate risk, or report the problems to regulators, Henkes said.
Tesla shares on Monday fell as much as 6.4% at $950.5, the lowest level in more than two months, after the Reuters report. Tesla's stock was poised to end the session down 20% from its Nov. 4 record-high close, confirming by a common definition that it is in a bear market. 
EX-TOYOTA QUALITY MANAGER BLOWS THE WHISTLE 
More than 60,000 residential customers in the U.S. and 500 government and commercial accounts were affected by the issue, according to his lawsuit filed in November last year against Tesla Energy over wrongful termination. 
It is not clear how many of those remain after Tesla's remediation program.
Henkes, a longtime manager at Toyota's North American quality division, moved to SolarCity as a quality engineer in 2016, months before Tesla acquired SolarCity. After the acquisition, his duties changed and he became aware of the widespread problem, he told Reuters.
Henkes, in the SEC complaint, said he told Tesla management that Tesla needs to shut down the fire-prone solar systems, report to safety regulators and notify consumers. When his calls were ignored, he proceeded to file complaints with regulators. 
""The top lawyer cautioned any communication of this issue to the public as a detriment to the Tesla reputation. For me this is criminal,"" he said in the SEC complaint. 
Litigation and concerns over faulty connectors and Tesla solar system issues stretch back several years. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in a 2019 lawsuit against Tesla said the latter's roof solar system led to seven store fires. Tesla denied the allegations and the two settled. 
Business Insider reported Tesla's program to replace defective solar panel parts in 2019. 

Several residential customers or their insurers have sued Tesla and parts supplier Amphenol (NYSE:APH) over fires related to their solar systems, according to documents provided by legal transparency group PlainSite.
Henkes also filed a complaint with he U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which CNBC reported this year was investigating the case. CPSC and Amphenol didn't respond to request for comment.

(Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc is geared to eclipse rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in initial public offerings (IPO) this year, which has seen companies raise record levels of capital through fresh stock flotations in the United States. 
Nasdaq raised a total of $191.38 billion through IPOs in 2021, compared with $109.25 billion raised at the NYSE, according to data from Dealogic. 
Over the last couple of decades leading up to 2019, with the exception of a handful of years during the dot-com bubble, NYSE had been in the leading position for new listings. So far in 2021, 686 companies listed on the Nasdaq, while 265 listed on the NYSE. 
The rush at Nasdaq was led by a number of high profile stock market debuts, including that of Amazon-backed electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc, the largest IPO of the year.

Of the capital raised, special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) IPOs accounted for $96.76 billion of the haul at Nasdaq while traditional IPOs raised $94.63 billion. At NYSE, the figures were $56.27 billion and $52.9 billion respectively. 
SPACs are listed shell companies that are raised with the intention of merging with a private entity at a later date, in an effort to take it public by sidestepping a traditional IPO.
Nasdaq said it is on track to end the year with the highest number of U.S. exchange listings in the 20 years - 4,133 operating companies, SPACs and exchange traded funds (ETFs). 
The figure exceeds the exchange's 2001 milestone of 4,109 listings.

With weeks left to go till the turn of the year, U.S. IPOs have totaled $301.26 billion in 2021, scorching past last year's record of $168 billion, according to Dealogic.

303,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 05:11PM ET</span>","Stocks rally, dollar gains as Omicron fears ease","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar edged higher while U.S. and European shares rallied on Monday after easing concerns about the Omicron coronavirus variant led investors to buy stocks that will likely perform well in a rising interest rate environment. 
Yields on U.S. government debt surged, with the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbing back above 1.4% after sliding last week to its lowest level since late September. 
Gold prices slid on the firmer dollar and rising Treasury yields, but losses were limited on expectations that U.S. consumer price data due later this week will show the pace of inflation quickening.
Stocks on Wall Street closed a sea of green as economically sensitive value stocks, led by banks and energy shares, rose 1.46% compared to a 0.94% gain in growth stocks.
Federal Reserve policymakers are likely to accelerate the tapering of their bond-buying program when they meet next week in response to a tightening labor market. They also are likely to hike rates earlier than projected to keep inflation down. 
There have been roughly six periods since the 1990s marked by rising rates when value did better than growth, said Brian Pietrangelo, managing director of investment strategy at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.
""Looking at those six different eras, generally speaking value-oriented stocks performed better,"" Pietrangelo said.
On Wall Street stocks pared earlier strong gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.87%, the S&P 500 gained 1.17% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.93%.
MSCI's all-country world index advanced 0.81% and the broad STOXX Europe 600 index rose 1.28%.
Energy and banking were big movers in Europe, closing up 1.86% and 1.83%, respectively. Industrials and consumer staples were the S&P's strongest sectors, rising 1.64% and 1.60%.
The rebound after a recent sell-off shows investors are not giving up on the prospect of a ""Santa Claus rally"" as Omicron fears recede, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. 
""This Omicron variant, while still largely unknown, through anecdotal evidence points to something that will not be as ground-shaking as was originally thought,"" Stovall said.
Omicron has spread to about a third of U.S. states, but the Delta version remains the majority of COVID-19 infections in the United States, health officials said on Sunday.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, told CNN it does not look like Omicron has a ""great degree of severity.""
Earlier in Asia, the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1%. 
China's central bank said it would cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves in an attempt to revive economic growth. The region has seen a series of corporate setbacks after ride-hailing giant Didi decided to withdraw from its New York listing last week. 
Shares in China's Evergrande plunged about 20% after the developer said there was no guarantee it would have enough funds to meet debt repayments.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.095% to 96.292.
The euro was down 0.27% at $1.1283, while the yen traded up 0.62% at $113.5000. 
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes jumped 9.5 basis points to 1.436% after losing almost 13 basis points last week.
The market still expects aggressive Fed tightening to fight rising inflation. 
""By severely limiting the FOMC's ability to respond to downside risks posed by Omicron, inflation has effectively destroyed the Fed put,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said in note. 
Inflation is ""now the dominant driver of not only rates, but all risk assets,"" they added as traders wait for Friday's U.S. consumer price report. 
Bitcoin slid 0.63% to $49,124.70 after hitting a low of $41,967 over the weekend as profit-taking and macro-economic concerns prompted nearly $1 billion worth of selling across cryptocurrencies.
Oil climbed more than 4% on hopes Omicron will have a less damaging economic impact if its symptoms prove to be mostly mild and as the prospect of an imminent rise in Iranian oil exports receded.

Brent crude rose $3.20 to settle at $73.08 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up $3.23 at $69.49 a barrel.
U.S. gold futures settled down 0.3% at 1,779.50 an ounce.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing key revelations from the antitrust trial between Apple and Epic Games in May, according to the report, in which the ""Fortnite"" maker had argued that Apple had given a free pass to Roblox, whose app lets people pick from a selection of games to play. 
Following this, Roblox had removed reference to the word ""game"" and changed it to ""experiences"", the Information reported. 
The DOJ recently asked Roblox why it made the language change and also wants to know whether Apple's 2019 launch of its Arcade game app store made it more difficult for game developers to compete with the iPhone maker, according to the report. 

Apple, DOJ did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Epic Games declined to comment.
The tech news website had reported in late October that the DOJ was accelerating its two-year-old antitrust probe on Apple in the last several months, increasing the likelihood of a lawsuit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon completed military construction and will begin testing a long-range radar for a homeland missile defense system that can track intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as next generation threats such as hypersonic weapons, the Pentagon said on Monday. 
The 2015 U.S. Defense Department plan was to deploy a new long-range radar in central Alaska that would help the U.S. missile defenses better discern potential enemy missiles launched by Iran or North Korea and increase the capacity of interceptors in the ground in Alaska and California.
The Pentagon Missile Defense Agency's Director, Vice Admiral Jon Hill, said: ""The Long Range Discrimination Radar has finished construction, and we can now begin the testing phase that will lead to the full operational use of this vital system. LRDR will allow Northern Command to better defend the United States from ballistic and hypersonic missile threats."" 
Placed at Clear Space Force Station in Alaska, the massive arrays measure 60 feet high by 60 feet wide and use advanced gallium nitride technology to boost the power of the radar. The Pentagon held an official fielding ceremony for the system which has costs about $1.5 billion so far. 

""Once fully operational, LRDR will provide unparalleled ability to simultaneously search and track multiple small objects, including all classes of ballistic missiles, at very long ranges,"" the agency said in a statement.
The prime contractor on the system was  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co.

With rising prices of fertilizers and crop nutrients, economies are taking active steps to reduce exports and focus on domestic needs. Therefore,  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) and CF Industries (CF) are expected to benefit from the robust market demand. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Nutrien Ltd. (NTR) and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) are two prominent players in the global agricultural inputs industry. NTR is a Canada-based provider of crop inputs and services, operating through four segments — Retail Ag Solutions; Potash; Nitrogen; and Phosphate. It distributes crop nutrients, crop protection products, seeds, and merchandise products through approximately 2,000 retail locations. On the other hand, CF manufactures and sells hydrogen and nitrogen products for clean energy, fertilizer, emissions reduction, and other industrial applications. The company primarily serves cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, wholesalers, and industrial users.
High inflation and supply chain constraints have made food, energy, and commodity prices surge lately. Moreover, the rising consumer spending this festive season has been driving the demand for fertilizers and crop nutrients to get better crop quality and yield. However, rising natural gas prices (a key ingredient in making nitrogen-based fertilizers) have affected crop nutrient production. As fertilizer prices and supply shortages are expected to continue in 2022 and some countries have stopped exporting their crop nutrients to support their domestic availability, companies are expected to deliver better returns in the coming months. The global fertilizer market is expected to grow at a 5% CAGR and reach $323.38 million by 2028. So, both NTR and CF should benefit.
While NTR gained 37% in price over the past year, CF has surged 55.3%. CF is a clear winner with 30.3% gains versus NTR’s 10.4% in terms of their past three months’ performance. But which of these stocks is a better pick right now? Let us find out.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed higher Monday, as easing fears about the impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 renewed investor bets on cyclical stocks, while a intraday rebound in tech also pushed the broader market higher.
The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.9%, or 646 points, the Nasdaq climbed 0.9%.  
The latest updates on the Omicron variant suggest the new coronavirus strain is less deadly than feared, easing investor fears about a potential economic fallout.
""[A]lthough it’s too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like there’s a great degree of severity to it,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, on CNN on Sunday.   
Renewed optimism on the recovery pushed cyclical stocks including financials and energy higher.
Financials, mostly banks, were also boosted by a rebound in Treasury yields following a rout last week, with the United States 10-Year yield rising above 1.4%.
 First Republic Bank  (NYSE:FRC),  State Street  (NYSE:STT), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) were sharply up more than 3% as rising Treasury yields boosts the net interest margin of banks – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
As well as rising Treasury yields, Wells Fargo was boosted by an upgrade from Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley upgraded Wells Fargo to overweight from equal weight amid expectations for a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes.
Energy, meanwhile, was pushed higher by rising oil prices after Saudi Arabia hiked its selling prices for oil exports to U.S. and Asian customers.
""Today’s upswing was sparked by Saudi Arabia’s raising of its official selling prices at the weekend,"" Commerzbank said in a note. ""The world’s largest exporter will be charging a higher price premium for oil deliveries to Asia in January than in the previous month.""
Reopening sectors of the market including airlines, cruise lines, and hospitality stocks were in the ascendency. 
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Carnival (NYSE:CCL), and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) shares were sharply higher. 
Tech jumped, adding to the broader market melt-up as investors bought the dip in big tech.
Semiconductor stocks, however, weighed on tech as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) slipped about 3% adding to recent losses.
Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) was up more than 1% after Cowen hiked its price target on the stock to $99 from $80, as growing memory demand and tight supplies are expected to bolster the chipmaker's performance.
In electrical vehicle stocks Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) were among the biggest decliners following regulatory troubles.
Lucid Group fell 5% after receiving a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its special purpose acquisition company merger deal with Churchill Capital Corp.
Tesla cut losses to end flat even despite U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launching a probe into a whistleblower claims alleging the company had failed to notify its shareholders of solar panel defects, Reuters reported, citing a letter from the agency."

Investing.com —  Xpeng Inc  (NYSE:XPEV) shares are set to close Monday's session with gains of around 5%, recouping some of the losses seen last week.
However, that fall has prompted Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsaio to add the stock as a research tactical idea, believing it will rise over the next 15-days because its short-term valuation has become ""much more compelling.""
The analyst believes the recent correction is due to worries regarding potential Chinese ADR de-listings. Last week, reports said the U.S. government moved closer to removing Chinese companies from American exchanges for not adhering to the country's disclosure requirements. 
With XPeng also listed in Hong Kong, Hsaio said it ""should meaningfully hedge the risk of disruption to operations and funding access. Chinese ride-hailing app Didi saw its shares decline significantly Friday after it said it would begin the delisting process from the NYSE and move to Honk Kong.
Hsaio currently has a HK$275 price target (about $35) and an overweight rating on XPeng shares."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp announced on Monday it is building a new $1.29 billion battery plant in North Carolina as it moves to expand its hybrid and electric vehicle efforts.
The new plant, at a site in Liberty that will begin production in 2025, will initially be capable of supplying lithium-ion batteries for 800,000 vehicles annually, and will ""pave the way"" for  Toyota 's U.S. production of electric vehicles, said Chris Reynolds, chief administrative officer for Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) North America.
The investment will be made by a new company called Toyota Battery Manufacturing and is expected to create 1,750 new U.S. jobs.
In October, Toyota said it would establish a new company and build a new U.S. automotive battery plant with Toyota Tsusho, the automaker's metals trading arm and a unit of the Toyota Group. Toyota will hold a 90% stake in the battery company.
North Carolina said the new plant will initially produce batteries for Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and intends to produce batteries for EVs long term.
The state will reimburse Toyota for up to $79.1 million over 20 years and if Toyota expands the project to $3 billion it could receive up to an estimated $315 million.
The state approved additional support to help with final site preparations, including $135 million for road and other site improvements. If Toyota expands the project another $185 million in site development funds would become available.
Toyota said the North Carolina plant plans to eventually expand to at least six production lines for up to 1.2 million batteries annually.
The investment is part of Toyota's October announcement it would invest $3.4 billion (380 billion yen) on U.S. automotive battery development and production through 2030.
The funds are part of the $13.5 billion Toyota announced in September it planned to spend globally by 2030 to develop batteries.
Automakers around the world are investing billions of dollars to ramp up battery and electric vehicle production as they face increasingly stringent environmental regulations.
Toyota has mounted a lobbying campaign to try to convince U.S. lawmakers not to include an additional $4,500 tax incentive for union-made electric vehicles.

In August, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order setting a target to make half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles.
Biden’s 50% goal and the automakers’ 2030 goals includes battery electric, fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles that also have a gasoline-engine.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. hedge fund billionaire and philanthropist Michael Steinhardt has surrendered $70 million of stolen antiquities and accepted a first-of-its-kind lifetime ban on acquiring antiquities to resolve a criminal probe, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance said on Monday.
Vance said his probe, begun in February 2017, found ""compelling evidence"" that the 180 antiquities were stolen from 11 countries, with at least 171 passing through traffickers before Steinhardt's purchases.
""For decades, Michael Steinhardt displayed a rapacious appetite for plundered artifacts without concern for the legality of his actions, the legitimacy of the pieces he bought and sold, or the grievous cultural damage he wrought across the globe,"" Vance said in a statement.
Steinhardt denied criminal wrongdoing in resolving the matter, which ended a grand jury investigation into him.
His lawyers Andrew Levander and Theodore Wells in a joint statement said Steinhardt was pleased that the investigation has ended, and ""items wrongfully taken by others will be returned to their native countries."" They also said Steinhardt may seek compensation from dealers who misled him.
Steinhardt, who turns 81 on Tuesday, built his wealth running the hedge fund Steinhardt Partners, which he closed in 1995 to focus on Jewish philanthropic issues. He is worth $1.2 billion https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-steinhardt/?sh=4e51cf305466, according to Forbes magazine.
Vance said the antiquities will be returned to their rightful owners in Bulgaria, Egypt, Greece, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Syria and Turkey. Law enforcement in these countries assisted in the probe.
According to a 142-page statement of facts, 138 of the antiquities came from Greece, Israel or Italy, with Steinhardt once acknowledging that a majority of items he bought from one dealer ""did not have provenance.""
Among the antiquities was a 4th century B.C. wrought stag's head worth $3.5 million that Steinhardt loaned in 1993 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The stag's head had been ""Found in Western Turkey,"" according to undated handwritten notes in Steinhardt's records.

""Information from a seller identifying the find spot of an unprovenanced antiquity is often an indication that it has been looted,"" the statement of facts said.
Vance formed an antiquities trafficking bureau in December 2017. He leaves office after 12 years at the end of the month.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was headed to one of its best days of the year with about half-hour of trading left in the U.S. session.
Each of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors were positive, led by financials, industrials, and energy, according to Reuters.

(Reuters) -Members of the Sackler family on Monday said billions of dollars they collected from Purdue Pharma before the company filed for Chapter 11 was the result of extra cash, not part of a ""secret plan"" to abuse the bankruptcy system.
In court papers, lawyers for the Sackler family members, who controlled Purdue, rejected U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon’s suggestion that the more than $10 billion Purdue paid out in the years leading up to the 2019 bankruptcy could amount to an abuse of the Chapter 11 process. Around half of the money went to taxes or business investments, according to court documents.
The Sacklers are alleged to have drained Purdue of cash over several years. When it eventually filed for bankruptcy in the face of lawsuits over the epidemic, the company needed Sacklers' money to settle the billions of dollars of legal claims. In return, the Sacklers were able to demand protection from the lawsuits.
The Sacklers rejected the notion that there was any ""scheme"" to ""deliberately weaken Purdue so it could not reorganize without"" their financial contribution.
There is no evidence to suggest the payments “were made as part of a secret plan” to abuse the bankruptcy system, the Sackler lawyers said. They called the idea “pure fiction.”
McMahon is considering whether to overturn a bankruptcy court ruling that shields the Sacklers from liability over the opioid epidemic. If she finds that there is sufficient evidence of abuse, she could send the matter back to the bankruptcy court to reconsider the shield.
More than 500,000 people have died from opioid overdoses since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The payments, the Sacklers argued, were made as business grew, including increased revenue following the restoration of Purdue's patent for OxyContin in 2008. 
The Sacklers, who have denied wrongdoing and did not file for bankruptcy themselves, have contributed about $4.5 billion to a settlement of opioid-related litigation in exchange for protection against future lawsuits.
Purdue argued in a separate filing on Monday that the protections are necessary because the company cannot exit bankruptcy without resolving opioid-related claims against both Purdue and the Sacklers.
The U.S. Department of Justice’s bankruptcy watchdog, the U.S. Trustee, has long opposed this type of litigation shield and said on Monday in court filings that the law offers no such protections for people who have not filed for bankruptcy.

The U.S. Trustee accused the Sacklers of “piggybacking” off Purdue’s bankruptcy to protect themselves.
“If this is not abuse of the bankruptcy system, it is unclear what is,” the trustee said.

Gulf oil producers are looking at sales of stakes in energy assets and raising cash through long-term leases, capitalising on a rebound in crude prices to attract foreign investors.
Earlier this year Aramco sold a 49% stake in its oil pipelines to a consortium led by U.S.-based EIG under a similar structure for $12.4 billion.

In return, Aramco Gas Pipelines Co will receive a tariff payable by Aramco for the gas products that will flow through the network, backed by minimum commitments on throughput. 
Aramco will hold a 51% majority stake in Aramco Gas Pipeline Company and sell a 49% stake to investors led by BlackRock and Hassana, the asset management arm of the General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI).
Other bidders in the race included EIG and Brookfield, sources told Reuters earlier.
""The deal unlocks additional value from Aramco's diverse asset base and has attracted interest from a wide range of worldwide investors, highlighting the compelling investment opportunity,"" it said in a statement.
Aramco will continue to retain full ownership and operational control of its gas pipeline network, and the transaction will not impose any restrictions on its production volumes, it said. 
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a statement Aramco and Saudi Arabia ""are taking meaningful, forward-looking steps to transition the Saudi economy toward renewables, clean hydrogen, and a net zero future"". 

He added: ""Responsibly-managed natural gas infrastructure has a meaningful role to play in this transition.""
 Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) has increased its focus on hydrogen and renewables as it moves to net-zero carbon by 2050.

Investing.com —  Bolt Biotherapeutics  (NASDAQ:BOLT) shares tumbled after mediocre interim data from its early trial of a drug that is the company's lead immune-stimulating antibody conjugate. 
The data, on a drug called BDC-1001, was shared at the European Society for Medical Oncology Immuno-Oncology (ESMO I-O) Congress. 
Bolt shares are down over 50.6% in afternoon trading.
The company reported data from 57 subjects in the study across 16 different types of HER2-expressing solid tumors. Her-2 is described by cancer.org as a ""protein that helps breast cancer cells grow quickly."" 
According to the company, BDC-1001 demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability and showed early signs of clinical activity. Furthermore, early signs of clinical activity were seen in 13 of 40 tumor evaluable subjects.
In June, the company reported preliminary data from the first 20 patients of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, stating that there was one patient with a confirmed partial response. In today's update, Bolt said there is one durable partial response maintained through 52 weeks. 
“Bolt Biotherapeutics is committed to agile clinical development based on data. In this Phase 1/2 study of BDC-1001, we have gained tremendous insight into the ability of this novel candidate to mobilize the patient’s immune system in targeting the tumor and its microenvironment,"" said Edith Perez, Chief Medical Officer of Bolt."

Retail investors sold a net $3.37 million worth of Didi shares on Friday, data from Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research showed, and the stock tumbled 22.2% after the company said it planned to pursue a Hong Kong listing, a stunning reversal as it bends to Chinese regulators angered by its U.S. IPO.
On a net basis retail investors also sold shares of Didi on Wednesday and Thursday of last week, after mostly buying shares of the stock over the past month, according to Vanda's data.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed Monday, led by a surge in cyclical stocks and turnaround in tech as positive updates on the Omicron variant of Covid-19 renewed investor optimism about the economic recovery.
The S&P 500 rose 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.2%, or 744 points, the Nasdaq climbed 1.1%.
The latest updates on the Omicron variant suggest the new coronavirus strain is less deadly than feared, easing investor fears about a potential economic fallout.
""[A]lthough it’s too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like there’s a great degree of severity to it,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, on CNN on Sunday.   
Renewed optimism on the recovery pushed cyclical stocks including financials and energy higher.
Financials, mostly banks, were also boosted by a rebound in Treasury yields following a rout last week, with the United States 10-Year yield rising above 1.4%.
 First Republic Bank  (NYSE:FRC),  State Street  (NYSE:STT), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) were sharply up more than 3% as rising Treasury yields boosts the net interest margin of banks – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to depositors.
As well as rising Treasury yields, Wells Fargo was boosted by an upgrade from Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley upgraded Wells Fargo to overweight from equal weight amid expectations for a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes.
Energy, meanwhile, was pushed higher by rising oil prices after Saudi Arabia hiked its selling prices for oil exports to U.S. and Asian customers.
""Today’s upswing was sparked by Saudi Arabia’s raising of its official selling prices at the weekend,"" Commerzbank said in a note. ""The world’s largest exporter will be charging a higher price premium for oil deliveries to Asia in January than in the previous month.""
Reopening sectors of the market including airlines, cruise lines, and hospitality stocks were in the ascendency. 
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Carnival (NYSE:CCL), and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) were sharply higher. 
Tech jumped, adding to the broader market melt-up as investors bought the dip in big tech.
Semiconductor stocks, however, weighed on tech as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) slipped about 3% adding to recent losses.
Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) was up more than 1% Cowen hiked its price target on the stock to $99 from $80, as growing memory demand and tight supplies are expected to bolster the chipmaker's performance.

Lucid Group fell 4% after receiving a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its special purpose acquisition company merger deal with Churchill Capital Corp.

HAMBURG (Reuters) -Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess will likely stay on to lead Europe's largest carmaker as part of a solution that will see him cede some responsibilities following a clash with labour leaders, two people familiar with the matter said.
The solution would potentially end the carmaker's latest leadership tussle, which has caused uncertainty among investors and led the group's preferred shares to fall significantly in recent weeks.
After protracted negotiations led by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Supervisory Board Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, a way forward has been found under which 63-year-old Diess, who has led the company since April 2018, will likely keep his job, the sources said.
""It is going in the direction that the dispute will be settled and Diess will remain CEO,"" one of the people said. 
VW brand chief Ralf Brandstaetter is slated to join the management board - confirming what sources told Reuters last month - while Diess will focus on strategy, the sources added.
Diess already ceded responsibility for the Volkswagen brand to Brandstaetter last year after weeks of squabbling between the company's powerful labour leaders and managers over the pace and scale of cost-cutting plans.
Handelsblatt had earlier reported that Volkswagen was close to a deal that could see Diess stay on. Shares extended gains after the news and closed 3% higher on the day as one of the biggest gainers in Germany's blue-chip index.
Volkswagen and Porsche SE, the company's largest shareholder, declined to comment.

Diess's future has hung in the balance since he mentioned the risk of far-reaching job cuts in September, complicating the carmaker's efforts to draw up a five-year investment plan that will be discussed by the supervisory board on Thursday.
Diess struck an upbeat tone at a managers' meeting last week, stating that negotiations with unions were going well.

Investing.com — Blink Charging Co (NASDAQ:BLNK) and SG Blocks announced they will collaborate to use Blink's EV charging equipment and network in SG Blocks' modular designs, expanding on the previous agreement from last year.
The expanded deal now includes SGDC, SG Blocks' real estate subsidiary, with Blink's electric vehicle charging equipment used in all current and future development sites. The first project will see over 300 EV chargers deployed at an SGDC site in Lago Vista, Texas.
After falling as low as $30.12, Blink shares have regained most of those losses and are now down 0.33% from Friday's close. 
""We couldn't think of a better project to kick-off our relationship with SG Blocks than Lago Vista in Austin, Texas,"" said Michael Farkas, CEO of Blink Charging. ""Austin is a leading city in innovation and is positioning Texas at the forefront of EV technology and infrastructure.""
The deal to include SGDC sees Blink expand its residential offerings further as it looks to capitalize on the infrastructure bill, which is encouraging an increase in electric vehicle adoption. 
SG Blocks said it plans to use Blink EV's charging services for development projects in infrastructure and transit, with the two companies currently working on completing due diligence on a transit development project. 
“We intend to dedicate the time and resources to grow in this space,” said Paul Galvin, chairman & CEO of SG Blocks. “We will be opportunistic in public and transit-oriented developments.”"

A prolonged period of elevated prices for fuels such as natural gas “might jeopardize the development” of alternatives, TotalEnergies SE Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne told the World Petroleum Congress on Monday. 
“Some Asian countries about to switch from coal to gas might be discouraged by too high energy prices,” he said.
Pouyanne’s remarks came the same morning that  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) CEO Amin Nasser told the conference in Houston that renewable energy supplies are not yet robust enough to sideline fossil fuels. Aramco raised prices on Sunday for crude it’ll ship out next month in a signal that the world’s largest oil exporter is bullish on demand. 
Meanwhile, the chief of Norwegian oil giant Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) echoed some of Pouyanne’s concern. Recent spikes in energy prices from China to Europe illustrate the risks “we face in an imbalanced transition,” CEO Anders Opedal told the conference.

Let’s discuss.Cryptocurrencies are becoming more widely recognized as a method of exchange worldwide, with numerous multibillion-dollar corporations already accepting Bitcoin payments.

However, given the tech industry’s favorable long-term growth prospects, we think fundamentally sound tech stocks Amkor (NASDAQ:AMKR),  Teradata  (TDC), NetScout (NTCT), and Himax (HIMX) are well-positioned to deliver solid returns in the coming months. So. let’s discuss these names.The tech industry has been able to capitalize on the growing demand for its products and solutions from startups to large-scale enterprises and gain expanding reach since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, increasing concerns about high inflation, weak job growth reports for November, the Federal Reserve’s more hawkish monetary policy, and the rapid spread of a highly infectious COVID-19 variant, omicron, caused the broader market to pull back. Markets sold off last Friday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite losing 1.9%.
But because these factors are not likely to dissipate soon, analysts anticipate a significant market correction sometime soon. However, the continuation of remote and hybrid working structures amid the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, and the industry’s sound long-term growth, should allow tech companies to prosper, despite the market’s weakness. Thus, betting on fundamentally sound, undervalued tech stocks could hedge one’s investment portfolio against market fluctuations.
We think fundamentally sound tech stocks  Amkor Technology , Inc. (AMKR), Teradata Corporation (NYSE:TDC), NetScout Systems, Inc. (NTCT), and Himax Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIMX) have the potential to capitalize on their respective industry tailwinds and deliver stable returns.

New York-based BuzzFeed's stock opened up 14% at $10.95 but reversed course to trade as low as $8. At 1:10 p.m. ET, the shares were down 5% at $9.10.
The company was one of the 10 trending stocks on Stocktwits.com, a platform commonly seen as a measure of interest from retail investors.
After shareholders redeemed a majority of their stake, BuzzFeed said last week it would receive only 6%, or nearly $16 million, of proceeds from the trust account of the blank-check company 890 Fifth Avenue Partners Inc, named after the fictional Avengers mansion.
Special purpose acquisition companies typically sell shares at $10 apiece, put the cash in a trust account and then search for a company to buy. Its shareholders can choose to redeem their shares in return for cash.
Tightening scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and saturated demand have weighed on the SPAC market, which soared in popularity last year.
BuzzFeed's deal is a barometer of investor interest for peers like Vox Media, which is reportedly considering a SPAC merger. Magnum Opus Acquisition Ltd, the SPAC merging with Forbes, has been trading below its issue price of $10.
BuzzFeed also secured $150 million through a convertible note financing.
The company, which produces news, videos and online quizzes, was founded in 2006 by Jonah Peretti and John Johnson, and saw a rise in popularity among the youth.

In 2016, the company was valued at $1.7 billion after Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp-owned NBC Universal's investment.
BuzzFeed bought news website HuffPost last year and also acquired youth entertainment company Complex Networks in June this year.

332,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 12:46PM ET</span>",Evergrande moves toward restructuring; state swoops in to contain risk,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group has set up a risk management committee as the cash-strapped property developer inches closer to a debt restructuring that has loomed for months over global markets and the world's second-largest economy.
The real estate giant, which is grappling with over $300 billion in liabilities and is at risk of becoming China's biggest ever default, said on Monday that the committee included officials from state entities and would play an important role in ""mitigating and eliminating the future risks"" of the group.
On Friday, Evergrande said it would seek to restructure its offshore debt after acknowledging that it may no longer be able to meet its financial obligations, prompting the provincial government of the southern province of Guangdong, where it is based, to step in to help manage the fallout.
""Evergrande's been trying to sell assets to repay debt, but Friday's statement basically says it is going to 'surrender' and needs help,"" said Conita Hung, investment strategy director at Tiger Faith Asset Management. ""This sends a very bad signal.""
Evergrande shares slumped to a record low on Monday as it teetered, yet again, on the brink of default with the end of a 30-day grace period looming on dues totalling $82.5 million.
At the end of Asia business hours, two bondholders said they had yet to receive payments. 
Evergrande, which has made 11th-hour coupon payments in the past, declined to comment.
If Evergrande was declared in formal default it would trigger a wave of cross defaults that would ripple through the property sector and beyond, potentially rattling global investor confidence, already shaken by the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
""Until there is a further announcement everybody is waiting to see if this time will be the first real trigger event. This is also set against the anticipated febrile equities market this week,"" said Karl Clowry, a partner at Addleshaw Goddard in London.
(Graphic: Evergrande would be second biggest EM corporate default Evergrande would be second biggest EM corporate default, https://graphics.reuters.com/EMERGING-DEFAULTS/movanjdlrpa/chart.png) 
Chinese authorities have ramped up efforts to reassure markets that Evergrande's woes can be contained.
In the latest move, China's central bank said on Monday it would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, its second such move this year, releasing $188 billion in long-term liquidity to bolster slowing economic growth.
Evergrande's shares tumbled 20% on Monday closing at an all-time low of HK$1.81 after it said late on Friday that creditors had demanded $260 million and that it could not guarantee funds for coupon repayment, prompting authorities to summon its chairman.
Analysts said authorities' concerted efforts signalled Evergrande has likely already entered a managed debt-asset restructuring process.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said such a process would involve coordination between authorities to maintain operations of property projects, and negotiation with onshore creditors to ensure financing for project completion.
Regulators would also likely facilitate debt restructuring discussion with offshore creditors after operations stabilise, the U.S. investment bank said in a report.
The recent tumble in Evergrande's dollar-denominated bonds accelerated with the March 2022 issue dropping 4.35 cents in the dollar to 27.7 cents, while other issues like the 2024 and 2025 bonds tumbled to record lows below 20 cents, MarketAxess data showed.
LIQUIDITY SQUEEZE
The firm is just one of a number of developers starved of liquidity due to regulatory curbs on borrowing, prompting offshore debt defaults, credit-rating downgrades and sell-offs in developers' shares and bonds.
To stem turmoil, regulators since October have urged banks to relax lending for developers' normal financing needs and allowed more real estate firms to sell domestic bonds.
Still, the government may have to significantly step up policy-easing measures in the spring to prevent a sharp downturn in the property sector as repayment pressures intensify, Japanese investment bank Nomura said in a report on Sunday.
Quarterly dollar bond repayments will almost double to $19.8 billion in the first quarter and $18.5 billion in the second.
Easing measures such as the ability to sell domestic bonds are unlikely to help Evergrande refinance as there would be no demand for its notes, CGS-CIMB Securities said on Monday.
Evergrande's inability to sell projects - with almost zero November sales - also makes short-term debt payments ""highly unlikely"", the brokerage said.
On Monday, smaller developer Sunshine 100 China Holdings Ltd said it had defaulted on a $170 million dollar bond due Dec. 5 ""owing to liquidity issues arising from the adverse impact of a number of factors including the macroeconomic environment and the real estate industry"".
The delinquency will trigger cross-default provisions under certain other debt instruments, it said.
Last week, Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd, China's largest offshore debtor among developers after Evergrande, said bondholders had rejected an offer to exchange its 6.5% offshore bonds due Dec. 7, leaving it at risk of default.
The developer has begun talks with some of the bondholders to extend the deadline for the $400 million debt repayment, sources have told Reuters.
Smaller rival China Aoyuan Property Group Ltd last week also said creditors have demanded repayment of $651.2 million due to a slew of credit-rating downgrades, and that it may be unable to pay due to a lack of liquidity.
Aoyuan Chairman Guo Zi Wen on Friday told executives at an internal meeting to have a ""wartime mindset"" to ensure operation and project delivery and to fund repayments, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Such tasks will be priorities for the developer, which will leave bond repayment negotiation to professional institutions in Hong Kong, said the person, declining to be identified as the matter is private.
Aoyuan did not respond to a request for comment.

The developer's share price fell nearly 8% on Monday. Kaisa lost 2.2% and Sunshine 100 plunged 14%.

However, today, analysts at JPMorgan and KeyBanc gave positive commentary on the stock. 
 JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee said that his iPhone 13 series tracker has shown lead times on all of the models have expanded. According to the analyst, despite mixed trends and recent reports, demand remains ""healthy and robust."" As a result, Chatterjee is forecasting demand above investor expectations.
In addition, KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel initiated coverage of Apple with an overweight rating and a $191 price target. Nispel outlined three main reasons for the rating, which included iPhone unit sales not yet peaking, the company not being overly reliant on the iPhone, and his expectation that services will grow at rates many times faster than user growth. 
""We estimate AAPL will have 1.09B active installed iPhones, +7% y/y, and 1.8B active installed devices, +8% y/y, at the end of F1Q22. To us, it's all about AAPL's user base, which is among the largest in the world,"" Nispel told investors. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As details of a new COVID-19 variant emerge, investors are bracing for a potential hit to U.S. corporate earnings, particularly among retailers, restaurants and travel companies.
News of the Omicron variant comes in the middle of the holiday shopping period, and many businesses are already struggling with higher inflation and supply chain snags because of the pandemic.
That is putting the focus again on these companies affected by the reopening of the economy, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.
""Are we still going to see traffic into restaurants and retailers, or at least retailers that derive most of their revenue from in-store traffic as opposed to online?"" she said. ""The other area of vulnerability of course is supply chain disruptions.""
She and other strategists said it's too early to tell the extent to which the variant could affect earnings.
The Omicron variant that captured global attention in South Africa less than two weeks ago has spread to about one-third of U.S. states, but the Delta version accounts for the majority of COVID-19 infections as cases rise nationwide, U.S. health officials said on Sunday.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Saturday cited risks and uncertainty around the emergence of the Omicron variant as it cut its outlook for U.S. economic growth to 3.8% for 2022. While the variant could slow economic reopening, the firm expects ""only a modest drag"" on service spending, it said in a note.
U.S. companies have just wrapped up a much stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings season, and the rate of fourth-quarter earnings year-over-year growth has been expected to be well below the previous quarter's.
Analysts see fourth-quarter S&P 500 earnings up 21.6% from the year-ago quarter, while third-quarter earnings growth was at about 43%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
That fourth-quarter forecast has not changed since Nov. 26, just after the new variant became headline news. 
Omicron may be affecting travel plans. Airline shares have already come under pressure, with the NYSE Arca airline index down 8.3% since the close of the session before Nov. 26. 
For companies, ""the significance of the impact will depend on how long the Omicron measures last,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""There will be some short-term impact... It'll surely cause some short-term disruption to travel."" 
Colin Scarola, a vice president of equity research at CFRA, wrote in a Dec. 2 note on the airline sector that while details of the variant are still emerging, trends in U.S. air travel over recent months with the Delta variant may give some insight into what could happen to travel under the Omicron variant. 
""This recent history tells us that most people have already accepted the material risk of infection with a Covid-19 variant when fully vaccinated. But knowing that risk of severe illness remains very low, they've been comfortable flying on airplanes,"" he wrote.
Compounding concerns about the 2022 earnings outlook are higher costs for companies, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week signaling that inflation risks are rising and numerous companies citing rising costs during the third-quarter earnings season.

Even before the Omicron news, Tuz said investors were reading ""more and more about inflation and wages and other inputs,"" and that was expected to continue into 2022.
""I don't know if the ability to pass along these higher costs is going to exist as much,"" he said.

That saw travel and leisure stocks rejoice, with the index surging 3.9% and posting its best session since May.

338,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 12:22PM ET</span>","Google, Meta dominate as digital propels global advertising growth -forecasts","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -The global advertising industry will notch higher growth this year than previously expected and is likely to continue its streak in 2022 as brands are relying more heavily on search engine and social-media companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Meta Platforms Inc to reach customers during the pandemic, according to two ad industry forecasts released on Monday.
Despite a year marked by worldwide supply chain disruptions that delayed products from reaching shelves and a user privacy clampdown by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that many feared would disrupt mobile advertising, brands have continued to advertise online and promote ecommerce as in-store shopping has been slow to return due to the ongoing pandemic, said Jonathan Barnard, director of global intelligence at advertising firm Zenith, which published an ad expenditure forecast on Monday. 
New businesses formed during the pandemic needed to advertise to find customers, while others likely maintained ad spending to stay in front of consumers' minds, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad agency GroupM.
GroupM forecast global ad spending to grow 22.5% in 2021 from the previous year, while Zenith estimated growth of 15.6%. Both estimates were revised up from previous expectations.
""This is possibly the fastest-growing year ever in terms of the advertising industry,"" Wieser said during a UBS conference on Monday.
Global ad spending is expected to grow by about 9% in 2022, according to the reports.
The growth has been a boon for Alphabet, Meta and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), major sellers of digital ads and which now account for more than half of all advertising spending outside of China, an increase from closer to 40% in 2019, GroupM said.
It also comes as Alphabet and Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), both face antitrust investigations in the United States and Europe. 
The need for marketers to directly reach consumers has also led to the success of retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) to rapidly grow their own ad sales businesses, allowing brands to use their shopper data to target more customers. This form of advertising grew 47% this year to total $77 billion and is expected to grow to $143 billion by 2024, according to Zenith. 

Retail media networks have been established in China for more than a decade, but the growth in other markets has been remarkable, Barnard said.
""In the last five years, it has grown explosively out of nowhere outside of China,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said on Monday it would push its return-to-work hybrid plan to March as the state of the COVID-19 pandemic remained uncertain.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it will begin a pilot phase for select employees in February and March. The company had previously said it would not return to work under a hybrid work model - a combination of on-site and remote working - before January. Ford had required most of its U.S. salaried employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Jan. 4.
""The state of COVID-19 virus remains fluid, and despite the success of our ongoing safety protocols and increased vaccination rates, we are shifting the start date of the hybrid work model to March,"" Ford said in an emailed statement.
This covers Ford's non-site-dependent employees and does not include plant workers represented by the United Auto Workers union. The union and Detroit Three automakers have recommended vaccinations and boosters for those workers, but those are not mandatory. Wearing masks to curb the spread of COVID in plants remains mandatory, however.
Companies are beginning to consider changes to their return-to-office plans and work models overall for employees because of the emergence of the new coronavirus variant, Omicron. Companies are struggling to understand how the variant might affect their operations and profits, with many taking a wait-and-see stance as they assess its spread and potential harmfulness.
Last week, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said it was indefinitely pushing back its January return-to-work office plan globally amid concerns over Omicron and some resistance to company-mandated vaccinations.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said Monday it had not yet set a formal return to workplace date for salaried employees. In April, it put in place ""Work Appropriately,"" a plan under which ""teams have the flexibility to work where they can have the greatest impact.""
The largest U.S. automaker said ""in light of the Omicron variant, we are monitoring the situation closely and continue to engage with multiple internal and external stakeholders."" GM has not yet mandated vaccines for its salaried employees.

Stellantis NV, which is requiring all of its 14,000 U.S. salaried non-represented employees to be fully vaccinated by Jan. 5, said Monday the company was moving ""to a flexible and agile work environment that enables our team to meet the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead."" Dubbed the ""New Era of Agility"" pilot program for North America, it is expected to begin in early 2022.
Stellantis plans a hybrid working model, with employees spending about 70% of their time working remotely and 30% in offices.

(Reuters) -Early gains in a handful of companies tied to former U.S. President Donald Trump's social media venture fizzled out on Monday after the blank-check firm taking it public said it had received fact-finding inquiries from financial regulators.
Digital World Acquisition fell 2.9% after gaining as much as 22.3% in premarket trading.
The company said on Monday regulators had sought documents relating to communications between the blank-check firm and Trump's social media venture and other details.
Shares of Digital World and other related stocks had rallied earlier after Trump's new social media venture said on Saturday it had raised nearly $1 billion.
SPAC CF Acquisition Corp VI, which is taking video platform Rumble Inc public, rose 10.8% after jumping as much as 30% on Monday. Trump joined Rumble's platform in June.
Phunware, hired by Trump's 2020 Presidential re-election campaign to build a phone app, fell 2.7%.
""You're going to continue to find that these rallies are short lived for the simple reason that we're not in the type of market environment where people are speculating and taking as many risks as they were two or three months ago,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC.
The hype around the Digital World merger in October sent Phunware and Remark Holdings in a rally that traders have compared to this year's meme-stock frenzy.
Remark Holdings has been linked to Trump on social media forums, but Reuters could not independently verify the link between Trump and Remark Holdings yet.

CF Acquisition was the second-most traded stock on the Nasdaq, with more than 44 million shares traded, while investors traded 3.7 million and 5.1 million shares of Digital World and Phunware as of 1536 GMT.

Shares of the luxury electric-car maker fell as much as 19.5% on Monday after it disclosed it had received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Dec. 3.
""The investigation appears to concern the business combination between the Company (Churchill Capital Corp. IV) and Atieva Inc and certain projections and statements,"" Lucid said in a regulatory filing https:// Lucid's deal with veteran dealmaker Michael Klein's blank-check firm earlier this year gave the combined company a pro-forma equity value of $24 billion, making it one of the biggest deals with Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs).  The SEC declined to comment on its action against Lucid. Market listing via SPAC route has become popular among electric-vehicle (EV) makers that have a vision but no prototype in an already capital intensive industry.  ""The problem is a lot of these companies that have taken this approach are not far enough along to really be considered a viable company,"" Sam Abuelsamid, auto analyst at Guidehouse Insights, said. Shares in other EV startups that went public through SPAC deals, including Canoo Inc and Faraday Future Inc and Fisker Inc , also took a hit on Monday. Fisker said it was not under investigation for its SPAC merger last year. Canoo, Ree Automotive and Faraday could not be reached for a comment.  As EV makers rush to beef up production and try to catch up with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, many have come under scrutiny by federal agencies and regulators. Nikola is working with regulators to pay a penalty and settle a charge against founder Trevor Milton, while Lordstown Motors is being investigated for vehicle pre-orders and its SPAC merger. 
""Ever since the statements made by Nikola's founder and former CEO resulted in three federal criminal fraud charges, new EV manufacturers were bound to face greater scrutiny,"" CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said. Meanwhile, the SEC has opened an investigation into Tesla following a whistleblower complaint on fire risks associated with solar panel system defects.

So, we think it could be wise to avoid trucking stocks Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) and Yellow Corporation (YELL) now. Wall Street analysts expect the shares of these names to decline in the near term. So, read on.The trucking industry plays a significant role in transporting goods across regions. The $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law by the President on November 15 includes $550 billion in funding for transportation, broadband, and utilities. This could help boost the trucking industry’s prospects. However, supply chain issues pose a concern for the sector’s growth.
Pandemic-induced shortages have caused a jump in consumer prices, driving the highest surge in inflation in more than 30 years. Furthermore, just when supply chain issues were gradually easing, reports of a new coronavirus variant, omicron, are expected to be a spoilsport. In addition, a record truck driver shortage could further exacerbate the supply chain constraints.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to avoid trucking stocks Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (ODFL) and Yellow Corporation (YELL). Wall Street analysts expect them to decline in the near term. In addition, they look overvalued at their current price levels.

Thus, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound work from home stocks Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), and VMware (NYSE:VMW). Read on.The COVID-19 pandemic has given a significant boost to the performance of the work-from-home industry, which was booming well before 2020. While many employees resumed working from their offices this year after solid progress on the COVID-19 vaccination front, with the advent of a new, highly-contagious variant, omicron, many household name companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have postponed their return-to-office plans. Also, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) CEO Todd McKinnon recently asserted that “hybrid work will become more of the norm.” This is expected to drive the work-from-home industry’s growth.
According to a Small Business TRENDS report, 36.2 million Americans are expected to work remotely by 2025. Furthermore, 85% of Americans are estimated to enquire about remote/hybrid options before applying for jobs.
Given this backdrop, we think work-from-home stocks Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Workday, Inc. (WDAY), and VMware, Inc. (VMW) could be solid picks now. The Direxion Work From Home ETF (WFH), which has returned 110.8% year-to-date, holds these three stocks.

Investing.com – Boston Beer stock (NYSE:SAM) climbed over 7% Monday as Cowen upgraded it to market perform with a $500 target.
The brokerage earlier had an underperform with a $400 target for the stock.
The stock touched a high of $493.77 in the session still underway, having more than halved since July 1.
According to Cowen, with Nielsen trends reflecting signs of stabilization, lower expectations are now priced into the stock.
After first trimming its annual guidance in July, the brewer lowered it again in September as sales of hard seltzers worsened.
In a note to the Securities and Exchange Commission around three months ago, Boston Beer said the market for hard seltzer products had continued to decelerate. The company said it expected to incur hard seltzer-related inventory write-offs, shortfall fees payable to third-party brewers, and other costs that will be expensed during the remainder of the financial year.
Sales of hard seltzers were strong in the pandemic and the company stocked up to meet demand that it expected to only rise. A rude shock awaited the company as on-premise demand for hard seltzers was much slower than at-home consumption as the economy reopened. That outcome left it with huge inventory the company was forced to account for in the second and third quarters.
The company closed the third quarter in the red compared to a profit a year ago.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Anheuser-Busch InBev's new leadership set the company's first earnings target on Monday, forecasting 4% to 8% growth in core profit over the next four years based on rising beer sales and expansion in other drinks and even food.
Michel Doukeris, who has been chief executive of the world's largest brewer since July 1, told Reuters before an investor seminar on Monday that the beer market had expanded over the past four years, despite a false narrative that it was not growing. 
Beer was also forecast by Euromonitor to expand its share of the alcohol market in the next four at the expense of wine and spirits, he said.
AB InBev, which sells one in four beers sold globally, should benefit from that growth and accelerate it by pushing higher-priced 'premium' beers, Doukeris said, promoting non-beer products such as seltzers and canned wines and cocktails, and selling more online.
The group will also look closer at by-products of barley brewing such as proteins and fibres, which were now sold ""almost for free"", but could be incorporated into plant-based food.
Doukeris, AB InBev's former head of sales and of its North American business, replaced fellow Brazilian Carlos Brito, who built the brewer into the world's largest during 15 years at the helm.
Brito steered growth through acquisitions and cost savings. His successor is focusing more on boosting sales of over 500 brands, including seven of the world's top 10 beers, in an already concentrated market.

In the 10-year period from 2010 to 2019, AB InBev's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by an average 7.3%, then fell 2.4% in pandemic-hit 2020. The Belgium-based company is forecasting 10%-12% expansion this year.
Its target for ""organic"" EBITDA growth removes the impact of currency changes when converting earnings from foreign operations, and of acquisitions and divestments.

354,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 11:35AM ET</span>",European regulators propose check for anti-lightning flaw on some A350 jets,"By Tim Hepher and Rajesh Kumar Singh
PARIS/CHICAGO (Reuters) - European regulators have issued a preliminary warning that patches of lightning protection may have been wrongly fitted on over a dozen Airbus A350 jets, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has joined a list of carriers facing ""paint issues"".
The proposed safety warning marks the first time manufacturing has come under regulators' spotlight amid a growing commercial and industrial headache over flaws on the skin of the jets, which Airbus insists are safe to fly.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said in a proposed airworthiness directive that Expanded Copper Foil (ECF), designed to safely disperse lightning strikes, may not have been installed properly on the wing covers of 13 jets.
If a cocktail of factors comes together - including an adjacent fastener also being incorrectly installed - then a heavy lightning strike in the same zone could lead to fuel vapour igniting and ""consequent loss"" of the jet, EASA said.
The proposed directive calls for gradual inspections and where necessary repairs, enforcing a bulletin from Airbus, but does not call for any of the 13 planes to be grounded.
An Airbus spokesperson said the draft directive is a ""normal part of the continued airworthiness process"".
The call for checks comes as Airbus is locked in a dispute with the biggest A350 buyer, Qatar Airways, over what Airbus has called a ""surface paint"" issue and the airline describes as problems under the paint, affecting the ECF and composite shell.
EASA has said it has found no evidence of any airworthiness problem, while Qatar Airways says this has yet to be proven. It has grounded 20 of its 53 A350s as skin damage appears, saying it is acting on the orders of its own regulator.
The row widened last week when documents seen by Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/airbus-a350-insight-idTRNIKBN2IE0TB revealed that at least five other airlines had complained about paint or ECF flaws since late 2016. Airbus has until recently suggested the issue focused only on Qatar Airways.
DELTA TALKS
Now a further airline, Delta, has found problems with at least one aircraft, industry sources said. 
Delta declined to comment on specific jets but said for the first time that it had seen problems on a limited scale.
""We have not yet experienced any significant paint issues on our A350 aircraft,"" a spokesperson said, adding it was in discussions with Airbus on the issue.
An Airbus spokesperson said it understands the cause of the issue and is working with customers to provide enhancements.
Manufacturing problems first emerged internally in 2019 when Finnair engineers warned Airbus that the ECF protection was detaching from the wingtips of one A350 because of missing resin, according to the documents seen by Reuters.
Airbus last week confirmed the Finnair manufacturing incident and said it was an isolated production issue that had been resolved. It also confirmed a Reuters report that it was considering changing the design of the lightning protection.

It was not immediately clear whether the ""production quality issues"" on 13 different jets covered by EASA's draft directive were similar to those reported by Finnair previously.
The 13 A350s were delivered between 2016 and 2020 and represent just 3% of the fleet, but are operated by 10 airlines or 28% of the number of carriers currently flying the long-haul jet, according to Airbus data and online database Airfleets.

(Reuters) - A flash weekend bitcoin crash that wiped out a fifth of its value and caused $2 billion worth of positions to be liquidated has soured investor expectations of a massive run-up in the world's largest cryptocurrency into the year-end.
Cryptocurrency analysts were not quite sure what triggered the heavy selling, but pointed to the a plunge in margin borrowing, in fresh futures positions and to activity by large holders of bitcoin as evidence of mass liquidation.
Bitcoin fell as far as $41,967.5, levels that made it 40% cheaper than the Nov. 10 record of $69,000. By Monday, it was back above $47,000, with a lot of investors still nursing wounds.
""Q4 will be a hard month, the prospect of hitting $100,000 as a lot of people were hinting at due to various round numbers, technical analysis, that's out of reach now,"" said Matt Dibb at Stackfunds, a Singapore-based crypto fund distributor. 
""Our view is will be neutral-to-bearish over the short term. And recalibrate.""
While the cryptocurrency world is no stranger to volatility, Saturday's crash was the biggest since a 31% collapse in bitcoin's price on May 19. According to cryptocurrency analytics platform Coinglass, bitcoin's market capitalisation has fallen to about $931 billion from $1.25 trillion on Oct. 21.
Saturday also saw diehard bulls and the dip-buying investors make a play. 
According to another analytics platform, CryptoQuant, bitcoin's Korea premium index, or what is often referred to as the kimchi premium, hit 7.72. That index, which measures bitcoin's price gap between South Korean exchanges and other exchanges and shows how strong bids in that risk-loving population are, was negative a month back.
El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said the Central American country had acquired https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/bukele-steps-up-el-salvadors-bet-sliding-bitcoin-buys-another-150-coins-2021-12-05 an additional 150 bitcoins, on top of the 100 it bought a week earlier.
TOKENS AND BLOCKS
Other popular tokens including second-biggest cryptocurrency ether and solana were dragged down, last trading down 3.6% and 7.6% respectively. Both have significantly outpaced bitcoin's gains over the past year. 
The total market capitalisation of the cryptocurrency market now stands at $2.35 trillion according to CoinGecko, down after topping $3 trillion last month.
The slow wider adoption of digital assets has, however, not been interrupted by bitcoin gyrations or broader concerns about global policy tightening. Regal cinemas, operated by Cineworld, and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) last month announced partnerships with digital wallet companies for accepting cryptocurrencies for buying tickets and popcorn. 
Jack Dorsey-led payments giant Square's rebranding as ""Block"" also demonstrated more companies' willingness to board the blockchain train. 
Cryptocurrency fans and detractors alike will closely eye testimony from the top executives of eight major cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global chief financial officer Alesia Haas and FTX Trading CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Dec. 8.
One particular area of focus for regulators is ""stablecoins"", which are digital currencies whose values are pegged to a traditional asset such as the dollar. Stablecoins are used to facilitate trading in other cryptocurrencies.
Tether, the biggest stablecoin with a market cap of more than $75 billion, has come under fire recently over disclosures around its dollar reserves, causing some investors to grow wary.

""If (the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) cracks down hard on stablecoins, then algorithmic stablecoins such as TerraUSD will become king,"" said Will Hamilton, head of trading and research at digital asset-focused Trovio Capital Management. 
Bitcoin spot trading volumes into Tether decreased for the third consecutive month in November, according to data from CryptoCompare, while volume in the second-largest stablecoin, USD Coin, increased 11%.

Investing.com – FedEx stock (NYSE:FDX) rose 2% Monday as the company predicted a bumper holiday season.
A company official told CNBC that Monday will be its busiest day of the 2021 holiday season.
“We’ve seen a lot of people actually starting their Christmas shopping in the month of October, which is fundamentally different than we have seen traditionally in the past,” Ryan Kelly, vice president of global e-commerce at FedEx told CNBC.
According to the business news channel, FedEx estimates it will deliver 100 million more packages this time than it did from Black Friday to Christmas in pre-Covid 2019 and 10% more than the pandemic-driven record 2020 season.
Kelly told CNBC the “ship from store” trend, now being adopted with many retail chains like  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) now, has cut down the load on shipping networks.
FedEx had earlier said it would raise its shipping rates during the holiday season. The company’s first-quarter revenue came in at $19.3 billion, around 12% lower than a year earlier, affected by supply chain issues and a labor crunch.
The company had lowered its forecast in September, pegging the current-year EPS at around $18.87 at the midpoint of its guidance range, compared to a previous midpoint of $19.40."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Cinctive, a hedge fund that nearly tripled assets since its 2019 launch, is looking to capitalize on the market volatility stirred up by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and worries over a hawkish shift from the Federal Reserve.
Among the areas the fund believes are attractive are financial companies, which should benefit from rising interest rates, according to people familiar with the firm’s thinking.
The fund also believes that energy companies' strong balance sheets will allow them to buy back stock and pay higher dividends -- making them an attractive option -- especially after a selloff in oil hit many of their shares -- the people said.
The S&P 500 is down nearly 4% since the day before Thanksgiving, when Omicron fears initially began roiling markets. The index is still up 22% for the year, near record highs.
Cinctive pursues a market neutral or risk minimizing strategy where teams of portfolio managers try to exploit price differences by being long and short equal amounts.
Its managers reacted to recent volatility by betting against stocks that would benefit from the economy reopening even though executives are not expecting a new lockdown in the United States. They moved to utility shares, consumer staples and other so-called defensive stocks.
Healthcare, energy and technology bets have helped the firm return 9% over the last 12 months, a person familiar with the fund said. The firm launched in September 2019 with $1 billion in commitments.
The benchmark HFRI Equity Market Neutral Index gained 6.2% in the first 10 months of the year. The market neutral strategy helps diversify portfolios and has been popular as a bond replacement strategy at a time of low interest rates.
November however was a tough month for hedge funds with early data from PivotalPath showing that the average fund lost between 1.6% and 2%, marking the worst performance since March 2020.
People familiar Cinctive's portfolio said it navigated the extreme volatility spurred by the initial wave of the coronavirus in March 2020 by having tracked supply chain issues and the health impact early and having cut risk dramatically.
While investors added fresh cash to hedge funds this year after taking money out in 2020, industry analysts at eVestment note that the pace of inflows has begun to slow in the last weeks.
Earlier this year Cinctive launched a risk arbitrage strategy and reunited with former colleague Mitch Nordon. Companies are now searching for weaker rivals and M&A activity in the United States alone surged 139% to $2 trillion in the first nine months of the year, Refinitiv data shows.
Cinctive founders Richard Schimel and Larry Sapanski, who previously ran Diamondback (NASDAQ:FANG) Capital Management, wanted to give their investment teams more flexibility and let portfolio managers invest in smaller companies, executives and investors said.
Some 70% of the firm's returns were generated from investments in small and mid-sized companies.
The firm now employs 50 investment professionals and a total of 70 people, up from 38 when the firm launched.

""The looming fear of changes to the tax treatment for buybacks has likely accelerated the process.""
A surge in oil prices has boosted the energy sector, prompting companies to announce buybacks and dividends.
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) said this month it would buy back up to $1 billion of its stock, while  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) increased its share buyback guidance range to $3 billion-$5 billion per year, the level it used to pay before the pandemic.
Exxon (NYSE:XOM), the largest U.S. corporate repurchaser of shares until 2016, vowed to begin quarterly buybacks in 2022.
Banks have also announced higher share buybacks as they had to set aside lesser provisions for bad loans this year due to a fall in corporate defaults.
""Shareholder returns tend to lag earnings growth by a few quarters, so we should see more capital returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends in 2022,"" said Bimal Patel, fund manager at Canada Life. 
""We expect capex, M&A and dividends to grow in 2022, albeit more slowly than in 2021. We think buybacks will be the one area that accelerates in 2022.""
The companies that have announced buybacks have also outperformed the broader markets.
The S&P 500 Buyback Index has risen about 27% this year, compared with the S&P 500 index's 21%. A European buyback index compiled by Solactive(.BUYEU) has risen 25%, versus 16% gains for a benchmark of dividend payers' shares.
As a result, some companies have employed share buybacks to boost share prices and trading volumes.
SoftBank Group announced a buyback last month after it revealed a quarterly loss. French insurer Scor announced a $233 million buyback to offset the impact of floods and hurricane Ida which hit its third quarter earnings.

""There are the companies that have underperformed during the incredible rally over the past year who may want to artificially create demand for their stock in the market and give the impression that volumes are much higher than they really are,"" said SOL Global's DeFrancesco.
""That may work for a short time but is not a sustainable strategy.""

Bitcoin traded around $48,000 today, 2% lower. The crypto had fallen by around 20% last week before recouping most of the losses. Still, it is 30% down from its lifetime high of $68,990.6 that it hit November 10.
Other digital assets too fell sharply last week and are trading weak Monday. Ethereum ETH/USD fell 3% today while Dogecoin DOGE/USD, Shiba Inu SHIB/USD and Polkadot Polkadot fell around 5% each.
The recent selloff in crypto assets follows aversion to risky assets in the wake of the emergence of Omicron. That also led to equity unloading in many emerging markets and the strengthening of the dollar EUR/USD against major currencies."

Russia opened an antitrust case against Apple in late October, accusing it of failing to allow app developers to tell customers about alternative payment options when using its App Store. It said Apple could face a fine based on its revenue in Russia if found guilty.
In documents published on Dec. 1, the Moscow Arbitration Court listed Apple as a claimant and Russia's Federal Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) as a defendant in ""economic disputes over administrative legal relations."" 
Apple, which did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, demanded that additional documents be added to the case on Dec. 2, RIA reported. 
Forbes Russia cited a FAS representative as saying that the proceedings related to a warning it issued on Aug. 30 over Apple's alleged failure to inform users they could also pay for purchases outside the App Store. 

The FAS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Apple faced pushback over its App Store rules in the United States in September when a federal judge issued a ruling forcing the company to allow developers to send their users to other payment systems.

Investing.com — Fast food restaurant chain Jack In The Box Inc (NASDAQ:JACK) will acquire Del Taco Restaurants Inc (NASDAQ:TACO) in a deal worth around $575 million, the companies said Monday. 
Jack in the Box will pay $12.51 per share in cash for Del Taco, the second largest Mexican food chain in the US. Shares of Del Taco closed at $7.53 on Friday — they currently trade at $12.40 following today's news, up 64%. Jack in the Box shares are down 6% since the announcement.  
The company intends to finance the acquisition by issuing additional securitization notes. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.
Del Taco has approximately 602 locations in the U.S., mainly on the West Coast and Jack in the Box has 2,209, primarily in California. Combined, the companies will have over 2,800 locations, spanning 25 states. 
 Jack in the Box believes the deal will increase its earnings per share by mid-single-digit in the first year.
The company's CEO, Darin Harris, told investors: ""This is a natural combination of two like-minded, challenger brands with outstanding growth opportunities. Together, Jack in the Box and Del Taco will benefit from a stronger financial model, gaining greater scale to invest in digital and technology capabilities, and unit growth for both brands. This acquisition fits squarely in our strategic pillars and helps us create new opportunities for the franchisees, team members and guests of both brands.""

The one-time bonuses for 86,000 eligible Tyson employees will be based on tenure and range from $300 to $700, the company said.
U.S. meat processors have struggled to find enough workers this year due to the tight labor market and safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.
About 59,000 workers were infected with the COVID-19 through January at plants run by Tyson and competitors JBS USA, Cargill Inc, National Beef Packing Company and WH Group (OTC:WHGLY)'s Smithfield Foods, according to a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee report.
The meatpacking industry was especially hard hit by the pandemic in part because its workers tend to be in close quarters for long hours.

Tyson said it has spent more than $500 million in wage increases and bonuses for frontline workers over the past year. The average total compensation for its hourly workers tops $24 an hour, counting wages and other benefits like medical insurance, the company said.
In Canada, workers at a Cargill beef plant in High River, Alberta, last week voted on a new company offer backed by union negotiators, just days before a potential strike.

(Reuters) -Oil producer ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) said on Monday it expects to return 16% more capital to shareholders next year, and added a new variable return of cash to its plans, underscoring the energy industry's focus on shareholder returns over spending. 
Oil and gas companies have either raised their dividends or announced share buybacks, even as crude price are up about 38% this year, as they keep their pledges to hold output flat, a marked departure from previous boom cycles. 
ConocoPhillips also forecast average production of about 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022, a low-single-digit percentage growth from 2021.
The forecast from the largest U.S. independent oil producer comes after it made two sizable acquisitions this year in the heart of the U.S. shale industry—a $9.5 billion deal to buy Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa)'s Permian Basin assets and a $9.7 billion transaction for Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) Inc. 
ConocoPhillips said it expects to return capital of about $7 billion to shareholders next year, and added its first variable return of cash of 20 cents per share would be paid on Jan. 14. 
That would be on top of about $2.4 billion the company plans to pay in ordinary dividends and share repurchases of about $3.5 billion. 
The company also projected capital expenditure of about $7.2 billion in 2022. It had forecast annual capital expenditures of $8 billion, as part of a 10-year plan it announced in September.
The planned capital expenditure includes $200 million for projects that would reduce the company's emissions from its direct operations and from the power it uses.

Truist Securities analyst Neal Dingmann called the news ""quite positive"", saying the new return structure and tepid production growth are what investors have been calling for.
ConocoPhillips shares rose 2.2% to $72.63 amid a broader rise in crude prices.

372,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 09:48AM ET</span>","Wall Street Mixed at Open as Tesla, Lucid Fall Under SEC Pressure; Dow up 440 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday, with broad gains in industrials and reopening plays offset by sharp falls in some of the market's hottest tech stocks. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 442 points, or 1.3%, at 35,022 points. The Dow was lifted by commentary over the weekend from Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, that the new Omicron variant of Covid-19, appeared to be less virulent than feared. However, the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5% and the S&P 500 was up only 0.5% 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 2.5% and Lucid Motors stock fell 6.8% in early trading after both companies ran afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC is looking into whistleblower claims about defective solar panels made by Tesla's Solar City unit, while Lucid is under investigation for the way it presented itself to investors before merging with a special purpose acquisition company earlier this year - a deal in which investors pumped $4.4 billion into the company at a valuation of around $24 billion. That valuation is now at $67 billion, even after the morning plunge.
Tesla stock, for its part, has been under pressure in recent weeks from repeated block sales by CEO Elon Musk. That pressure has been compounded by continued outflows from the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) of investment guru Cathie Wood. Tesla is one of ARK's signature holdings of long-duration investments that aim to plug into the megatrends of coming years. ARK's suite of funds has seen outflows of over $2 billion in the last month. ARK Innovation fell below $100 for the first time since October 2020 last week as the outflows continued.
Another favorite stock of the year, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), fell 13.8% to its lowest in a month, as its intended takeover of chip designer ARM ran into ever stronger opposition from global regulators. Already the subject of a national security review in the U.K., the deal is now the subject of a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission aiming to stop it on antitrust grounds. 
Elsewhere, vaccine stocks suffered heavy outflows again, as hopes rose that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 will hasten the end of the pandemic. Omicron has displaced Delta, which has accounted for around two-thirds of the 5.26 million identified casualties from Covid-19, as the dominant strain of the disease in the parts of South Africa where it has been discovered. Early data from South Africa suggest that it has tended to cause milder illness than Delta. That may create an environment where natural immunity against the disease can spread quickly without health systems being overwhelmed by a fresh surge of cases. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 11.4%, while BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock fell 12.7% and its partner  Pfizer  's (NYSE:PFE) stock fell by 2.6%. Both vaccine makers and chipmaking stocks had been big beneficiaries of the first news of Omicron's spread last week.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is in talks with the management of its Middle East unit Careem to bring outside investors into the business, four sources familiar with the matter said.
Careem's ownership structure following the planned investment was not immediately clear, though sources said Uber would remain a shareholder while giving Careem's management greater decision-making power over its strategy.
The investment would help finance the further roll-out of Careem's so-called Super App, two of the sources said, which offers services outside its core ride-hailing business such as food delivery, digital payments and courier services.
One of the sources said Careem's management wanted to build on its Super App - of which co-founder and Chief Executive Mudassir Sheikha has long been a proponent - while Uber was focused on ride-hailing.
Uber and Careem both declined the comment.
The planned move comes just over two years after Uber bought its Dubai-headquartered rival, which operates predominantly in the Middle East, for $3.1 billion, keeping the brand and app intact.
Former McKinsey executive Sheikha co-founded Careem in 2012 and continued to serve as CEO following Uber's 2019 takeover. 
It was not immediately clear how much investment would be sought, though one of the sources said Careem would focus on growing its payments and delivery businesses with the new funds.
Eventually the new Careem business could be listed, one of the sources said.

Uber's 2019 acquisition of Careem gave the U.S. company market dominance across the Middle East and Pakistan ahead of its initial public offering in the same year that raised $8.1 billion from investors and valued the company at $82.4 billion. 
Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing and delivery firm Grab, which also describes itself as a super app, last week went public following a record $40 billion merger with a blank-check company.

Engine Capital, which owns about 1% stake in Kohl's, said on Monday the department store has underperformed both the S&P 500 and other retailers in recent years, despite its large retail footprint and real estate holdings.
Shares of the company, which were up about 4% on the news, have risen about 19% this year, while peer Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) has more than doubled. The S&P 500 index is up nearly 21% in 2021.
The New York-based hedge fund added that Kohl's should consider a strategic review of the whole company, including a sale, adding that it believes there are sponsors that would pay at least $75 per share or a 50% premium.
Engine Capital, known for being instrumental in a $2 billion sale of Ann Taylor brand parent Ann Inc in 2015, said Kohl's e-commerce business alone could be worth $12.4 billion or more. 
Kohl's in response said the company continues to examine all opportunities for maximizing shareholder value.
Engine Capital's proposal comes at a time when retailers have doubled down on their online businesses following the e-commerce boom during the COVID-19 pandemic that drove people to shop online as they avoided crowds at brick-and-mortar stores.

Last month, Macy's Inc said it was working with consulting firm AlixPartners after activist investor Jana Partners pushed for a sale of its digital business, while Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay Co-owned Saks Fifth Avenue has said it would spin off its e-commerce segment.
Earlier this year, Kohl's also faced pressure from a group of activist investors to add board members with retail experience, following which it added three new directors.

The news of DIDI’s delisting heightened investor concerns about other U.S.-listed Chinese stocks, and the prices of shares of Chinese electric vehicle stocks NIO (NIO), XPeng (XPEV), and Li Auto (LI) declined in the wake of DIDI’s delisting announcement. Considering the bleak growth prospects of these companies, we think investors are better off avoiding them. Read on.Beijing-based ride-hailing giant DiDi Global Inc. (DIDI) declared last week that it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange “immediately” and begin preparations for a separate listing in Hong Kong. Consequently, the U.S. shares will be converted into “freely tradable shares” on another international exchange. Shares of DIDI declined sharply in price after the announcement.
With DIDI’s delisting, the decades-long, trillion-dollar relationship between China and Wall Street may be coming to an end. The move raised further speculation regarding Chinese EV stock listings moving to Hong Kong. This would leave U.S. investors trading ADRs with underlying stocks in the ADRs being Hong Kong-listed.
Amid the rising uncertainties, we believe investors are better off avoiding Chinese electric vehicle stocks NIO Inc. (NIO), XPeng Inc. (XPEV), and Li Auto Inc. (LI). The shares of these companies plunged last week on the news of DIDI’s delisting.

Therefore, we believe recent price dips could be an opportune time to bet on fundamentally sound small-cap technology stocks  Mitek Systems  (NASDAQ:MITK), Benefitfocus (NASDAQ:BNFT), and Zedge (ZDGE). Let’s discuss these names.With the emergence of the omicron COVID-19 variant, several companies have delayed their return to their offices. Experts have called for a return to remote working to contain the spread of the new variant. Because cloud computing and advanced technology solutions are prerequisites for remote working and lifestyles, the global technology industry should get a boost.
The Consumer Technology Association expects consumer spending on tech products and solutions during the 2021 holiday season to reach $142.5 billion. Furthermore, because companies across industries are investing significantly in tech upgrades to keep up with rapid digitalization, the tech sector should continue to thrive. Investors’ interest in the technology industry is evidenced by the iShares Global Tech ETF’s (IXN) 29.3% returns over the past year versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 22.8% gains.

Investing.com – Lucid Group stock (NASDAQ:LCID) plunged 15% in Monday’s premarket trading as the company disclosed the SEC has asked for documents pertaining to the company’s merger with blank-check firm Churchill Capital.
The maker of luxury electric vehicles said the December 3 subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission pertains to certain projections and statements surrounding the combination. It said it is cooperating fully with the SEC in its review.
Lucid's deal with dealmaker Michael Klein's SPAC had given the combined company a pro-forma equity value of $24 billion and was completed in July.
Lucid Motors was founded in 2007 as an EV battery-maker called Atieva by former Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) executive Bernard Tse and entrepreneur Sam Weng. It aims to produce 20,000 vehicles in 2022 and 50,000 in the following year.
Less than three months ago, the Environmental Protection Agency certified that the range of the company's Air Dream Edition Range of cars outstrips any other in the EV space, including the most popular Tesla.
Lucid’s 19-inch wheel secured a rating of 520 miles on one full charge, making it the longest-range EV ever rated by the body. That title till then belonged to Tesla's Model S Long Range Plus.
Lucid joins EV-makers like Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) and Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) who also landed in the crosshairs of the regulators. Nikola is working with U.S. regulators to pay $125 million to settle a charge against its founder Trevor Milton that he misled investors. Lordstown is under probe by the department of justice.

The report said companies would be blocked only as a last resort, dialling back a little from last month's demands by regulator Roskomnadzor that 13 foreign and mostly U.S. technology companies set up in Russia by Jan. 1 or face possible restrictions or outright bans.
Russia has been slowing the speed of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) since March as punitive action for not deleting content that Moscow deems illegal. Twitter denies allowing its platform to be used to promote illegal behaviour. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), meanwhile, face Russian court cases this month for repeated violations of the same legislation. Neither company responded to requests for comment when the court dates were announced.
The law on setting up representation in Russia came into effect on July 1 and targets foreign social media giants and tech companies with more than 500,000 daily users.
""Slowdowns and blocking are not something we want to apply in principle,"" Roskomnadzor's deputy head, Vadim Subbotin, told Interfax. ""It is a last resort when other arguments no longer work.
""If companies do not manage to open representative offices in our country by the deadline, it does not mean that we will immediately start taking action against them. It does mean that from Jan. 1 we will start thinking about it.""
Subbotin said that Roskomnadzor is prepared to engage in dialogue with companies that show they are working to comply with the legislation.

Roskomnadzor's demand last month gave few details of what exactly the companies were required to do and targeted some that already have Russian offices. Analysts said the legislation lacked clarity.

PORT EDWARD, South Africa (Reuters) - South Africans took to their beaches on Sunday to protest against plans by Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) to do seimsic oil exploration they say will threaten marine wildlife such as whales, dolphins, seals and penguins on a pristine coastal stretch.
A South African court on Friday struck down https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-wins-court-case-start-seismic-surveys-offshore-south-africa-2021-12-03 an application brought by environmentalists to stop the oil major exploring in the eastern seaboard's Wild Coast, rejecting as unproven their argument that it would cause ""irreparable harm"" to the marine environment, especially migrating hump-back whales.
The Wild Coast is home of some of the country's most undisturbed wildlife refuges, and it's stunning coastal wildernesses are also a major tourist draw.
At least 1,000 demonstrators gathered on a beach near Port Edward, a Reuters TV correspondent saw.
""It's just absolutely horrendous that they are even considering this. Look around you?"" said demonstrator Kas Wilson, indicating an unspoilt stretch of beach. ""It's unacceptable and ... we will stop it."" 
Shell officials were not immediately available for comment, but the company said on Friday that its planned exploration has regulatory approval, and it will significantly contribute to South Africa's energy security if resources are found.
But local people fear the seismic blasting conducted over 6,000 square kilometres will kill or scare away the fish they depend on to live.
""I don't want them to operate here because if they do we won't be able to catch fish,"" said 62-year-old free dive fisherwoman Toloza Mzobe, after pulling a wild lobster from the ground. ""What are we going to eat?"" 
Environmentalists are urging Shell and other oil companies to stop prospecting for oil, arguing that the world has no chance of reaching net zero carbon by 2050 if existing oil deposits are burned, let alone if new ones are found.

Earlier this year, a Dutch court ordered Shell to reduce its planet warming carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels, a decision it plans to appeal.
South Africa's environment ministry referred Reuters to a statement late last month that ""the Minister responsible for environmental affairs is ... not mandated to consider the application or to make a decision on the authorisation of the seismic survey.""

It will form two new units - international digital commerce and China digital commerce which it said was part of efforts to become more agile and accelerate growth. 
The international digital commerce unit will include AliExpress which sells to retail buyers particularly in Europe and South America, its Southeast Asian e-commerce business Lazada and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).com which is more focused on selling to overseas business customers.
It will be headed by Jiang Fan, who had been in charge of its main Chinese retail marketplaces, and the change is seen in line with Alibaba's aim to make 'globalisation' a key focus area in addition to cloud computing and domestic consumer spending.
Globalisation ""helps Alibaba to get new traffic volume externally (and) seek new growth potential while China has been increasing supervision,"" said Hong Kong-based Guotai Junan analyst Danny Law.
The China digital commerce unit will include Alibaba's two main marketplaces, Tmall for established brands and Taobao which welcomes all kinds of merchants. It will be led by Trudy Dai, who has previously overseen a number of Alibaba platforms.
The new structure for domestic e-commerce puts Dai in charge of all China retail marketplaces, including Taocaicai - its community e-commerce service, Taobao Deals as well as Lingshoutong, a retail management platform for mom and pop stores, said 86research.com analyst Xiaoyan Wang.
""This could possibly unlock more synergies via cross-selling and integration of supply chain,"" she said.
Alibaba also announced that deputy chief financial officer Toby Xu will succeed Maggie Wu as CFO from April, describing his appointment as part of the company's leadership succession plan. Xu joined Alibaba from PWC three years ago.
The e-commerce giant's Hong Kong-listed shares slid 6% in early morning trade, tracking Friday declines made in the United States.
U.S.-listed shares of Chinese firms have tumbled on concerns about stricter regulatory scrutiny at home in the wake of plans by Didi Global Inc to delist from the New York Stock Exchange.
Hit by weaker growth for the economy and fierce competition from a plethora of rivals, Alibaba last month slashed its forecast for annual revenue growth https://www.reuters.com/business/chinas-alibaba-misses-quarterly-revenue-expectations-2021-11-18 to its slowest pace since its 2014 stock market debut. It also saw sales at its banner event, online shopping festival Singles Day, grow at their slowest rate ever https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-alibaba-kicks-off-final-hours-singles-day-shopping-event-2021-11-10.

Chinese regulators have also cracked down on the tech and other sectors, particularly on anti-trust issues that have seen Alibaba abandon a policy of requiring merchants to exclusively set up shop on its platforms. The company was fined a record 18 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) in April for abusing its dominant market position.

Investing.com – ADRs of Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) looked like extending the last session’s losses on Monday too as market players shun the ride-hailing company while it plans its next step in the NYSE delisting process.
The ADRs traded 6% weaker in the premarket. They had closed 22% lower Friday, jolted by the firm’s move to go off the exchange.
The company will now pursue a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, it said in a statement to the SEC on December 2.
The company’s assertion that it will ensure that ADSs are convertible into freely tradable shares on another internationally recognized stock exchange hasn’t impressed the market, given that the delisting news comes just over five months after the shares went public on June 30.
According to a Reuters report last week, listing in Hong Kong may prove complicated. Didi aims to complete a dual primary listing in Hong Kong in three months, too tight a deadline for a company with a history of compliance problems, Reuters said. Only 20%-30% of Didi's core ride-hailing business in China is fully compliant with regulations, the agency reported.
The company is also under pressure from Beijing to complete its U.S. delisting by June, Reuters said.

As a foreign company, Tesla would have been eligible for state aid of up to 40% of its investment under a European Union programme that encourages production within the bloc.
Under the programme, the U.S. company could have received up to around 1.1 billion euros ($1.24 billion).
Due to booming demand for battery cells, Tesla voluntarily decided in late November to start construction on a battery plant at its Gruenheide site outside Berlin without state aid and withdrew the corresponding application. 
Tesla is building its first European electric car factory as well as a battery plant at the site in the state of Brandenburg.

It is still waiting to receive final permit approval for the site from authorities, which is expected before the end of the year.

Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. lost a bid to challenge part of a landmark ruling on the working rights of its drivers, meaning the ride-hailing app and its London rivals will have to overhaul their business models and assume more responsibility for each trip booked on their app. 
U.K. judges ruled that the tech firm should enter into a direct contract with passengers when providing car journeys. Uber had sought clarity over comments made in a top court ruling given earlier this year. 
Uber and others “will need to amend the basis on which they provide their services,” after the court concluded that “in order to operate lawfully, an operator must undertake a contractual obligation to passengers,” the judges said Monday. They also said London’s transport regulator will need to reconsider its current guidance to reflect the ruling.

The labor group that led the Supreme Court case, which forced Uber to reclassify its drivers as workers, says Monday’s decision will help prevent Uber and others from dumping risk on its drivers.
Uber said it will comply with the ruling, but that the judgment applies to every private hire operator in London, not just it. 
“Every private hire operator in London will be impacted by this decision, and should comply with the Supreme Court verdict in full,” said an Uber spokesman.

Investing.com – Stocks of special purpose acquisition company CF Acquisition Corp VI (NASDAQ:CFVI) climbed 21% in Monday’s premarket trading on reports it will merge with Rumble, a social media platform that counts President Donald Trump as a member.
The video platform, popular with conservatives, also has a partnership with another SPAC linked to the former U.S. president.
Trump Media & Technology Group, a new outfit set up by the former President, is merging with SPAC Digital World Acquisition under a separate deal. DWAC traded 6% higher in premarket. 
CF Acquisition CEO Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg last week that Truth Social, as Trump’s social media platform is called, is their partner.
“The Trump Media Group and DWAC SPAC are using Rumble for distribution,"" he said. “I can confirm that they have an arrangement together.”
Trump Media Group is paying for distribution with Rumble on a non-exclusive basis.
Trump has been off social media as both Meta-owned Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and his then favorite, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), banned him from their platforms for his alleged role in inciting the January 6 Capitol riot. Since then, Trump has been exploring ways to restore his once-sizable social media presence.
As Trump’s plans take shape, stock associated with him -- Phunware (NASDAQ:PHUN) being another -- have been in the limelight. Phunware had provided technology services to the unsuccessful Trump 2020 campaign.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Monday, with tech stocks underperforming as investors reposition after the Federal Reserve’s hawkish turn.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 240 points, or 0.7%, S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 0.4%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 22 points, or 0.1%.
The major indices all slipped back last week as investors digested the potential economic damage from the Omicron Covid-19 variant as well as the Federal Reserve indicating it could speed up its tapering later this month given the high rate of inflation. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded a fourth straight negative week for the first time since September 2020, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both down for a second consecutive week.
The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has spread to about one-third of U.S. states, U.S. health officials said on Sunday, but early indications suggest the symptoms associated with this variant could be relatively mild.
President Joe Biden’s chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci told CNN in a weekend interview that “it doesn’t look like there’s a great degree of severity to it,” adding that existing vaccines appear to offer a still-high degree of protection against it. 
Strategists at Morgan Stanley indicated in a note that they are “not that concerned about omicron as a major risk factor for equities.” Instead, it’s the Fed that investors need to concentrate on as “tapering is tightening for the markets and it will lead to lower valuations like it always does at this stage of any recovery.”
In corporate news, Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) will be in the spotlight after a report in The Wall Street Journal said an activist investor is urging the department-store chain to consider a sale or a separation of its faster-growing e-commerce business.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) will also be in focus after the Chinese retail giant said it plans to reorganize its international and domestic e-commerce businesses. 
Crude prices climbed Monday after Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, raised the price for its oil heading to the U.S. and Asia by up to 80 cents from the previous month, an indication of its confidence in the strength of demand in the two regions. 
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.5% higher at $68.58 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 3.2% to $72.13. Both benchmarks fell last week for their sixth week in a row for the first time since November 2018 on concerns that the new coronavirus variant could hit fuel demand.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,780.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1293.

391,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",Evergrande Moves Toward Restructuring as Debt Deadlines Loom,"(Bloomberg) -- China China Evergrande Group's (OTC:EGRNY) long-awaited debt restructuring may finally be at hand, posing a fresh test for Xi Jinping’s government as it tries to rein in the country’s financial excesses without derailing economic growth.
The embattled developer said in an exchange filing late Friday that it plans to “actively engage” with offshore creditors on a restructuring plan, offering its most explicit acknowledgment yet that its $300 billion of overseas and local liabilities have become unsustainable. The stock plunged 20% Monday to a record low.
A barrage of statements from Chinese regulators -- several of which landed just minutes after Evergrande’s announcement -- suggested authorities are striving to contain the fallout on homeowners, the financial system and the broader economy rather than orchestrate a bailout.
The government of Guangdong, the southern province where Evergrande is based, summoned founder Hui Ka Yan to express concern over the company’s announcement and said it would dispatch a team to the developer to ensure “normal” operations. The People’s Bank of China blamed Evergrande’s problems on the company’s “own poor management” and “reckless expansion.”
The flurry of activity follows several weeks of relative calm for Evergrande, which has been making last-minute payments on its dollar notes since late October at the urging of Beijing. Friday’s statements signal the world’s most indebted developer may struggle to make further payments within their grace periods, even after a spate of personal asset sales by Hui that appeared designed to help Evergrande meet its near-term debt obligations.
Evergrande shares plunged to HK$1.81 in Hong Kong, bringing its decline on the year to 88%. Its 8.25% dollar bond due March 2022 is poised for its biggest fall on record, down 10.4 cents on the dollar to 23.2 cents. The property services provider and new-energy vehicle start-up in which the developer holds the biggest stakes were down 5.2% and 7% respectively. 
The company’s next test comes later Monday. That’s when a 30-day grace period ends on two dollar bond interest payments that were initially due Nov. 6: a $41.9 million coupon for a note maturing in 2022 and $40.6 million of interest on a security due the following year. Both bonds were issued by unit Scenery Journey Ltd.
The question for global markets is whether Beijing can coordinate a restructuring without upending the broader real estate sector, which accounts for nearly a quarter of economic output. Policy makers have a history of abandoning efforts to rein in developers when the risks to growth mount, though Xi appears more determined than his predecessors to stamp out the moral hazard that allowed companies like Evergrande to expand so rapidly. 
One risk is that Beijing may not have a full picture of how indebted Evergrande and its peers have become. The Shenzhen-based developer indicated in its exchange filing on Friday that it may not be able to fulfill its pledge to guarantee payment on a $260 million note issued by joint venture Jumbo Fortune Enterprises, an obligation that many Evergrande investors didn’t even know existed until a few months ago.
While it will be important to monitor how Evergrande’s restructuring progresses, the odds of renewed panic in Chinese credit markets are low, according to analysts at China International Capital Corp., one of the nation’s largest investment banks. Real estate companies with poor management and high financial risks will be “phased out,” but authorities are likely to ensure that higher-quality developers retain access to funding, CICC analysts Yan Xu and Eric Yu Zhang wrote in a report.
China is likely to ease restrictions on the real estate sector this month and into the first quarter of 2022, according to analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group Inc. Regulators on Friday signaled that they would expand mortgage support beyond first-time homebuyers, guide banks to provide loans to developers for acquisitions and further open funding channels including the asset-backed securities market, the analysts wrote. A reduction in banks’ reserve requirements is likely in the next few weeks after Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday a cut would come at the “proper time,” the analysts wrote.
Bond investors have been anticipating an Evergrande restructuring for months, with the company’s 2025 dollar notes trading below 30 cents since the end of September. Chinese high-yield dollar bonds rose by as much as 1 cent on the dollar Monday, as expectations the central bank may cut the required reserve ratio for lenders offset concerns about Evergrande’s potential debt restructuring, according to credit traders.
Investors are increasingly differentiating between the weakest and strongest borrowers after China’s government took steps to mitigate the cash crunch for higher-rated developers in recent weeks. Apart from Evergrande, money managers are bracing for a potential default by  Kaisa Group  Holdings Ltd (HK:1638), which faces a $400 million bond maturity on Tuesday after failing to swap the notes for new ones due 18 months later. Smaller Chinese developer Sunshine 100 China Holdings Ltd. defaulted on $179 million of debt and interest payments due Sunday.
For Evergrande, the next step may be to enter into an informal debt standstill as it continues to try to negotiate with creditors, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Daniel Fan.
“Extension of maturities, based on sustainability of debt, would be likely,” he said. “One option to sweeten the process is to link some of the repayment to its offshore assets,” such as its Hong Kong-listed electric vehicle unit, Fan added.
Evergrande’s offshore creditors are widely expected to fall near the bottom of the priority list in a restructuring, behind nearly 1.6 million homeowners who gave the developer down payments on properties, local suppliers, Evergrande employees, and individual investors who bought wealth management and trust products tied to the company. Several Evergrande-linked WMPs and trusts have already defaulted, restructured or fallen behind on payments.

Investors fear the business models of these companies might be jeopardized should the EU's executive arm require them to directly employ drivers and riders.
""The thorny question of whether or not delivery drivers are employees is about to be answered by the EU Commission later this week and reports suggest the answer will be yes"", commented Danni Hewson, a financial analyst at AJ Bell. 
""For food delivery businesses like Deliveroo and Just Eat that could mean a huge spike in costs, costs which many expect will be passed on to consumers across central Europe"", she added. 
At 1056 GMT, shares in Deliveroo, Just Eat Takeaway, Delivery Hero were down 6.3%, 5.5% and 4.5% respectively having all also suffered double-digit losses last week.
The regulatory uncertainty about gig economy stocks was illustrated last March when a number of investment funds declined to participate in Deliveroo's initial public offering adding pressure to the stock which plunged when it made its London debut. 

Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) said other factors were also weighing on tech stocks such as expectations of rising interest rates which typically make them financially less attractive for investors.
""Expectations that the restaurant trade won’t be dented so much by the new variant as first thought, is likely to have weighed further"", she also said, noting food delivery companies had seen their business and stock valuation increased during the pandemic.

While they are “not that concerned about omicron as a major risk factor for equities,” the strategists see headwinds building elsewhere, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the possible accelerated tapering of asset purchases. “Tapering is tightening for the markets and it will lead to lower valuations like it always does at this stage of any recovery,” the strategists led by Michael Wilson wrote in a note to clients. 
The comments echo the views of other strategists, including those at JPMorgan Chase & Co., who singled out a hawkish turn by central banks as the main risk to their outlook for stocks. But while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reiterated on Monday that its base-case scenario is for the equities rally to continue into next year, Morgan Stanley sees the S&P 500 trending lower, and valuations declining. 
“Equity markets are resuming their de-rating process that began over nine months ago for numerous reasons,” the Morgan Stanley strategists wrote. They forecast that the S&P 500 forward price-to-earnings ratio would fall by about 12%, with that decline potentially deeper “as equity investors start to demand much higher risk premiums in anticipation of considerably higher long-term interest rates.”
UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said Monday they “expect a period of heightened volatility ahead as investors attempt to assess the risks from omicron and the Fed, based on insufficient and patchy data.” While they advise investors to refrain from a hasty exit from risk assets, the strategists, led by Mark Haefele, said monetary tightening could present a bear case to their base scenario.

Logistics UK, which represents freight and haulage businesses, estimates the country lacks around 120,000 drivers, shortages that have disrupted supply chains and left gaps on supermarket shelves.
That reflects the tens of thousands who returned to the European Union after Brexit and the cancellation of 40,000 truck driver tests during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Logistics UK said the number of HGV drivers fell 44,000 in the third quarter of 2021 compared with the same time in 2019, leaving the workforce 14% smaller than it was at the outset of the pandemic.
However, that represents an improvement on the fall of 72,000, or 23.4%, in the second quarter.
""It is still at an acute level but we are beginning to see those little green shoots that we couldn't see before"" said Director of Policy Elizabeth de Jong.
Early signs of improvement included applications for provisional licences three times higher than pre-pandemic levels and a 25.6% increase in HGV driver testing in the third quarter versus 2019.
Pay increases of up to 29% were helping, as were promises to invest in improving driver facilities.
The government is also investing in ""Skills Bootcamps"" to train up to 5,000 people, while apprenticeships have been introduced to attract younger drivers.
In October the government announced 4,700 temporary visas for overseas drivers for food supply and 300 for fuel supply for a three-month period, following a fuel crisis.
De Jong said the government has not told Logistics UK how many of these visas have been issued. The industry group said in a report that much more needs to be done.

""Without further progress on training, visas rules and HGV facilities...shortages will exacerbate existing disruption to supply chains, further embed inflation above the Bank of England's 2% target and hamper the UK's development as a modern, digital economy,"" it said.
It said consumers may notice reduced ranges at online retailers and longer delivery times this Christmas.

LONDON (Reuters) - Up until a few days ago, the leadership of British North Sea producer Siccar Point was negotiating the sale of a stake in the promising Cambo oil development to another private equity-backed company, NEO, sources told Reuters.
But on Thursday Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Siccar Point's partner in the project, pulled its support for Cambo amid a wider public debate about the future of fossil fuels development in the North Sea. The deal with NEO, as well as the future of the 1.9 billion pound ($2.51 billion) project, were thrown into disarray, according to three industry sources.
Shell's decision sends a negative signal to other companies, investors and bankers who are thinking about putting money into the ageing basin, including by buying assets from majors, industry sources told Reuters.
The withdrawal from Cambo came several weeks after a British regulator rejected Shell's plans to develop another North Sea gas field, Jackdaw, whose future also remains in doubt unless Shell comes up with a revised plan that passes muster.
In its announcement on Thursday, Shell said Cambo was not economically viable. But company sources said the decision was also influenced by climate protests against developing new oil and gas resources in the North Sea, as well as public opposition to Cambo by Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
""It's an economic decision but that's not to say that the external environment doesn't impact the decision. It's about business risk,"" one Shell source said.
Siccar Point and Shell have delayed the decision on whether to develop Cambo several times in recent years, most recently due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, Siccar Point had been close to a deal with NEO, sources close to the matter said, although it was unclear what size stake was being discussed or what the value of the deal would have been.
""With the hurdles increasing for project approvals, the UK’s production decline is entirely predictable,"" said Yvonne Telford, senior analyst at Westwood Global Energy Group.
""There is a need for clear guidance on the future environmental requirements for developments. In addition, uncertainty around (Scottish) independence and the Scottish devolved Parliament position on future developments will not encourage companies to invest in new UK projects.""
NEO declined to comment. Siccar Point declined to comment when asked about talks with NEO.
'TOXIC' CLIMATE
Oil companies including Shell and BP (NYSE:BP) have been major investors in the North Sea for decades. Despite scaling back their presence in the basin in recent years, they still consider it as central to their future in oil and gas as well as offshore wind operations.
While hosting the COP26 climate summit last month, Britain decided not to join an alliance of countries vowing to stop new oil and gas projects on their territory.
Growing pressure from investors, governments and climate activists, however, has led oil majors to scale back spending on oil and gas projects and increase investments in renewable energy in order to slash greenhouse gas emissions.
And if the UK government fails to make clear its support for investment in the sector after Shell's move, output from the mature North Sea oil and gas basin could fall more rapidly than previously expected, industry sources told Reuters.
""At the moment it's toxic,"" said one North Sea oil and gas source, speaking about how Shell's decision has impacted the investment climate in the British North Sea.
Oil and gas fields require regular investment in drilling new wells and fields in order to offset the natural depletion in other fields. The more mature the fields, the more investment is needed.
British oil and gas production at about 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), or about 1% of global oil demand, has fallen from a peak of around 4.4 million boe/d in 1999.
While investments in wells near existing fields are expected to continue, companies will now hesitate before making decisions on big capital projects.
""For the UK North Sea it is a bit depressing,"" said one source.
SHELL'S EXIT WELCOMED
Climate campaigners and some investors welcomed Shell's exit from Cambo, after activists pointed to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) saying that no new oil and gas projects should be developed in order to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
Siccar Point and some politicians have said that halting new oil and gas development in the North Sea could leave Britain more reliant on higher-emissions imported fuel.
A spokesperson for the government said 75% of the UK’s primary energy demand comes from oil and gas at present and the decision on Cambo ""is a commercial decision that has been taken independently by Shell.""
Meanwhile, British courts have increasingly become an arena for climate activists trying to force an end to oil and gas production in Britain.
A Scottish court handed BP a win over Greenpeace in October in relation to a North Sea oilfield.But another case against the government and its Oil and Gas Authority is getting a judicial hearing at a High Court in London starting on Dec. 8 to determine whether tax breaks for oil and gas producers are legal. 
Britain's treasury received around 248 million pounds ($329 million) from oil and gas production in the tax year 2020/21, a drop of 71% on the previous year, according to official data, due to a plunge in oil and gas prices during the pandemic.

This compares with 400 million pounds which the government paid oil and gas producers in 2016/17 due to tax arrangements when the oil price is low.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 04:52AM ET</span>",Hong Kong developer to offer 300 homes at 50% discount to market price,"HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong property developer New World Development said on Monday it plans to sell 300 new homes at a discount of roughly 50% to the market price in the city's first subsidised private housing project. 
As part of a move to provide more affordable housing in one of the world's most expensive property markets, New World said it would require a downpayment of just 5% of the unit price.
The move comes after New World said in September it was launching a research project called New World Build for Good to tackle a chronic housing shortage in the city.
""This may be a small first step, but it is an important one that we hope will encourage other Hong Kong corporations to join us in creating similar projects and give back to the community,"" New World Development CEO Adrian Cheng said in a statement.
Once the proposal was approved by the government, New World would build 300 one- to three-bedroom flats ranging in size from 300 to 550 square feet in the New Territories West district. 
The estimated cost of each unit would be roughly HK$2.7 million ($346,287) to HK$4.95 million and priority would be given to Hong Kong residents aged between 25 and 45 who are first-time homebuyers. 
Making housing more affordable has been a priority for all of Hong Kong's leaders since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, although the prospect of owning a home is a distant dream for many.
In September, Reuters reported Beijing had given a new mandate to the city's powerful tycoons in a series of meetings this year that they should pour resources and influence into helping solve the destabilising housing shortage.

Beijing has partly blamed the conglomerates' ""monopolistic behaviour"" for the city's housing woes, which it believes played a big role in stirring discontent with the government and fuelling pro-democracy protests in 2019.

Investing.com – Kohl's stock (NYSE:KSS) was up over 3% in premarket Monday after a report in The Wall Street Journal said an activist investor is urging the department-store chain to consider a sale or a separation of its faster-growing e-commerce business.
According to the report, hedge fund Engine Capital has written to the company’s board urging it explore the two options to improve its lagging stock price. Engine owns around 1% in the retailer.
Kohl’s shares closed Friday at $48.45, giving it a market value of $6.74 billion. The stock has rebounded from its pandemic lows but but has essentially gone sideways for a whole decade.
Engine points out in the letter that assuming online sales revenue of around $6.2 billion, Kohl’s digital business alone would be worth $12.4 billion, the WSJ report said.
The hedge fund has argued that private-equity firms would pay at least $75 a share and that its interactions with potential buyers suggest they could do this by monetizing Kohl’s real estate. Kohl’s has earlier pushed back against the idea, saying that its e-commerce unit works in tandem with the stores.
For most retailers, digital is the faster growing business compared to their legacy physical stores. Financial investors thus see more value in them and consider the old businesses as dragging down the more lucrative piece, and hence the push for such sales.
Kohl’s has recently made efforts to position its stores as a beauty destination in order to attract a younger audience. The company’s total revenue in the third quarter was around 15% higher at $4.6 billion. It also raised its guidance last month for the third time when it said it expects net sales to rise by around 25% this year."

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Monday, starting the new week on a positive note despite weak German industrial orders amid hopes that the omicron variant of Covid-19 may be less dangerous than previous strains of the disease.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.7%. 
Equities around the world have been roiled by the emergence of the new Covid variant and the uncertainty over its economic impact as countries introduce new restrictions to combat its spread.
The International Monetary Fund warned Friday that it is likely to lower its global economic growth estimates due to the new variant.
In Europe, the week has started positively on hopes that the new variant could cause only a mild reaction, even if it’s more infectious than other versions. But any gains are likely to be tempered with caution as scientists try to discover if this is the case or what level of protection is provided by existing Covid-19 vaccines. 
There'll also be some likely drag from economic data, German factory orders fell 6.9% on the month in October, slumping after the previous month’s 1.3% gain, putting the Eurozone’s largest economy on a weak footing in the final months of the year. 
“Today’s industrial orders data is a cold shower for German industry,” said analyst Cartsen Brzeski at ING, “a reflection perhaps of ongoing supply chain frictions and companies simply delaying new orders or, worse, cancelling orders, knowing that delivery times are long anyway.”
In corporate news, Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI) stock rose 1% after the world’s largest brewer set a target under new CEO Michel Doukeris of delivering annual core profit growth of between 4% and 8% over the medium term.
Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) stock rose 1.3% after the French construction materials company announced the acquisition of GCP Applied Technologies (NYSE:GCP) in a deal that values the U.S.-based company at around $2.3 billion.
Elsewhere, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock fell 1.3% after JPMorgan cut its target price,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) stock rose 3.3% after JPMorgan upgraded the German bank to ‘overweight’, and Just Eat Takeaway (AS:TKWY) stock fell 4.3% after Bernstein downgraded the stock to ""market perform’. 
Crude prices climbed Monday after Saudi Arabia raised the price for its oil heading to the U.S. and Asia by up to 80 cents from the previous month, an indication of its confidence in the strength of demand in the two regions. 
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.3% higher at $67.77 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2% to $71.29. Both benchmarks fell last week for their sixth week in a row for the first time since November 2018 on concerns that the new coronavirus variant could hit fuel demand.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,781.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1290.

In a memo seen by Reuters, the bank said full-time employees up to executive director level would be eligible for the payments between now and the end of November 2022.
A UBS spokesperson in Hong Kong confirmed the contents of the memo.
Hong Kong requires 21-day compulsory hotel quarantine for arrivals from most countries which is paid for by the traveller.
The city last week banned https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kong-bans-non-resident-arrivals-13-more-countries-due-omicron-2021-11-30 non-residents from entering Hong Kong from a further four African countries and will expand that to travellers who have been to Australia, Canada, Israel and six European countries in the past 21 days due to fears over the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Hong Kong is one of the final places in the world pursuing a zero-COVID strategy and has some of the tightest travel restrictions. 
In coming months it hopes to partially reopen the border with mainland China, which also has no tolerance for coronavirus cases.
The strategy is a growing headache for major employers such as banks as they try to retain staff in Hong Kong.

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is granting some staff a one-off payment of up to $5,000 to cover their quarantine costs.

Buying the dip triggered by the Omicron COVID-19 variant across global markets has proven a costly strategy so far. But some investors seem determined to have another go. 
European and U.S. stocks futures are trading sharply higher after ending last week on a sour note and notwithstanding a dismal day in Asia where an MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost about 0.9%. 
The region has seen a series of corporate setbacks after ride-hailing giant Didi decided to withdraw from the New York stock exchange last week. 
Shares in China Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, plunged 14% after it said there was no guarantee it would have enough funds to meet debt repayments.
Another giant,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) dropped 5% after announcing it would reorganise its international and domestic e-commerce businesses. And U.S. regulatory opposition to the sale of Softbank-owned chip firm Arm pushed the Japanese conglomerate 8% lower.
But the mood is lighter already across Europe, allowing 10-year Treasury yields to claw back some of Friday's falls which took them below 1.4% for the first time since late September. 
There are five trading sessions left before Friday's U.S. consumer price report which some reckon will provide the green light for the Federal Reserve to accelerate its tapering of bond purchases.
Oil prices too rose by more than $1 a barrel after Saudi Arabia raised prices for its crude sold to Asia and the United States.
And if the market mood is perking up, there is no sign of that in Bitcoin which has fallen further and is now at $48,244 -- some $20,000 below peaks hit a month ago.

Equities around the world have been roiled by the emergence of the new Covid variant and the uncertainty over its economic impact as countries introduce new restrictions to combat its spread.
The International Monetary Fund warned Friday that it is likely to lower its global economic growth estimates due to the new variant.
In Europe, the week is expected to start positively, bouncing after last week’s losses, but any gains are likely to be tempered with caution as scientists try to discover the severity of the omicron variant or what level of protection is provided by existing Covid-19 vaccines. There'll also be some likely drag from economic data, German factory orders fell 6.9% on the month in October, slumping after the previous month’s 1.3% gain, weighed by global supply chain constraints.  
Additionally, it’s debatable how effective any restrictions will be as large sections of the public grow weary of their lives being disrupted. Tens of thousands of protesters marched through several northwest European cities on Saturday to demonstrate against the imposition of restrictions, while police in Brussels had to fire teargas and used water cannons on Sunday to disperse protesters.

Investing.com – Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.'s (HK:9988) shares slid on Monday after its U.S. shares slid on Friday. Investors remained concerned about stricter regulatory scrutiny in China following Didi Global Inc.’s plan to delist in the U.S.
Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares slid 5.36% to HK$113 ($14.149) by 12:11 AM ET (5:11 AM GMT).
Didi announced a plan to delist from the New York Stock Exchange and prep a Hong Kong listing on Friday. Tighter regulatory scrutiny, a slowing economy, and increasing competition are also posing challenges for Alibaba and provided the impetus for the company’s  reorganization of its international and domestic e-commerce business.
The new international digital commerce unit will now house Alibaba’s overseas consumer-facing and wholesale businesses, including AliExpress, Alibaba.com, and Lazada. The China digital commerce unit will house its domestic commerce businesses.
The reorganization also saw the appointment of a new chief financial officer, with deputy chief financial officer Toby Xu to succeed Maggie Wu in the post from April 2022 onwards.
Alibaba said it will focus on its three major strategies of domestic demand, globalization, and cloud computing moving forward.
Meanwhile, China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) debt woes continued as it hovered near a default.
The developer issued a statement on Friday saying its creditors had demanded $260 million and that it could not guarantee enough funds for coupon repayment, and the government of Guangdong summoned chairman Hui Ka Yan to express concern about the statement.
China Evergrande’s Hong Kong-listed shares tumbled 12.44% to HK$1.97.
The company has made three 11th-hour coupon payments in the past two months. A 30-day grace period ends on Monday for two dollar bond interest payments, a $41.9 million coupon for a note maturing in 2022, and $40.6 million of interest on a security due in 2023."
416,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2021 10:56PM ET</span>",Toshiba walked away from potential buyout talks and Brookfield offer -sources,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp walked away from potential private equity buyout offers at a substantial premium, as well as advanced talks for a minority stake from Canada's Brookfield, according to three people familiar with the matter. 
Toshiba's decision to not pursue either course - some details of which have not been previously reported - and instead focus on a plan to split itself in three, has widened the gulf between the conglomerate and a number of its hedge fund investors, according to the people, all of whom declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.
At least one private equity firm told the Toshiba committee tasked with its strategic review that a deal to take it private could be done at 6,000 yen a share or more, according to two people briefed on the review process.
Another private equity firm told the committee a deal could get done at around 5,000 yen a share, according to one of the people briefed on the review and another person.
A price of 6,000 yen would value Toshiba at around 2.6 trillion yen ($23 billion) and represent a 32% premium to its average price over the past 200 days, according to Refinitiv data.
""We are communicating with shareholders explaining the separation plan we announced on Nov. 12 as well as listening to their opinions,"" Toshiba said in a statement to Reuters. ""We will continue our communications with various stakeholders.""
Some shareholders have also taken issue with Toshiba's decision not to pursue talks with Canada's Brookfield Asset Management, one of the private equity firms, on a potential minority investment, according to several sources.

That could have seen Brookfield, which successfully turned around the conglomerate's bankrupt nuclear power business Westinghouse, take a minority stake and help overhaul the business, sources said.
Brookfield did not immediate respond to a request for comment.

The index’s decline prompted the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Sunday to play down delisting fears on Sunday.
Chinese trade data, including exports, imports, and the trade balance, will be released on Wednesday. Inflation data, including the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index, will follow a day later.
Investors continue to digest Friday’s mixed U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls. More U.S. data, including the CPI, is due later in the week, which could increase the pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to quicken asset tapering. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari is due to speak on Thursday.
U.S. Treasury yields climbed, trimming Friday’s fall that sent the benchmark 10-year yield closer to 1.30%.

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Ride-hailing giant Didi Global's plan to withdraw from the New York stock exchange may create an even deeper chill after this year's drop-off in Chinese firms' listings in the world's most liquid market, bankers and advisers said.
Chinese listings in the United States have fallen sharply since Didi https://www.reuters.com/technology/didi-global-start-work-delisting-new-york-pursue-ipo-hong-kong-2021-12-03 debuted in New York on June 30 - defying regulators' wishes to pause the listing - due mainly to concerns about an unprecedented regulatory crackdown on technology companies. 
Two days after Didi's $4.4 billion initial public offering, Chinese regulators ordered an investigation into the company which remains underway, ordered app stores to remove 25 of its mobile apps, and blocked the app for new users in mainland China.
The regulatory action, alongside the U.S. government's ongoing threat to delist Chinese companies not compliant with its auditing rules, has already prompted a sharp slowdown in Chinese listings.
The second half of this year has been the quietest six months for U.S. listings by Chinese firms since the first half of 2017, and so far in 2021, listings have totalled nearly $13 billion compared to $13.6 billion last year, Dealogic data showed.
Chinese companies that list on U.S. stock exchanges must disclose https://www.reuters.com/business/us-sec-mandates-foreign-companies-spell-out-ownership-structure-disclose-2021-12-02 whether they are owned or controlled by a government entity, and provide evidence of their auditing inspections, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Thursday.
""We're only going to see limited IPOs out of China into the U.S. now,"" one Hong Kong banker told Reuters, as the city's financial sector digested the impact the Didi decision would have on the listing pipeline.
The banker declined to be named, as the person was not authorised to speak to the media.
Independent research analyst Mitchell Kim, who publishes on the Smartkarma platform, said that already cautious investors would become more nervous about future Chinese IPOs in the world's largest economy.
""U.S. investors may fear investing in Chinese companies, which means Chinese companies may get choked off from accessing U.S. capital,"" Kim said. ""In particular, the Chinese techs could face a greater challenge because so many tech investors are based in the U.S.""
Golden Gate Ventures partner Justin Hall said while Didi's delisting might negatively impact global investor appetite for Chinese technology companies, it's too early to say the same for Chinese retail and institutional investors.
""It's important to note that simply because Chinese technology companies may no longer list as frequently in the United States, that's not to say they can't have wildly successful public offerings on Chinese exchanges,"" he said. 
""By the same vein, founders of Chinese technology companies may opt for safer exchanges in the future, given that all the time and resources required to list on the U.S.-based exchanges would be for naught if they're subsequently required to delist.""
Hong Kong has benefitted from the Sino-U.S. spat with a string of U.S.-listed Chinese firms carrying out secondary listings there in recent years, partly as a back-up in case they are delisted from New York, say market participants.
Another investment banker in Hong Kong was slightly more optimistic that Chinese companies not handling large amount of data could still opt for a New York listing.

Sources told Reuters last month that Chinese regulators had pressed Didi's top executives to devise a plan to delist from the New York Stock Exchange due to concerns about data security.
""Didi's issue is with data. If the data issue is resolved, then it will be ok,"" said the banker, who also declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's household goods salesmen have threatened to disrupt supplies to mom-and-pop stores if consumer companies provide products at lower prices to Reliance Industries, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Reuters reported last month https://reut.rs/3FAVZKK Indian salesmen representing companies such as Reckitt Benckiser, Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) said their sales had dropped 20-25% in the last year as mom-and-pop stores were increasingly partnering with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance.
Ambani's deeply discounted offerings were prompting more stores to order digitally from his JioMart Partner app, posing an existential threat to more than 450,000 company salesmen who for decades served every corner of the vast nation by going store-to-store to take orders.
Citing the Reuters story, the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation - which has 400,000 members - has written to consumer companies demanding a level playing field, saying they must get products at same prices like other big corporate distributors such as Reliance.
If the pricing-parity demand is not met, the group said in its letter, its salesmen will stop distribution of products to mom-and-pop stores, and will also not supply newly launched consumer goods if such partnerships continue beyond Jan 1.
""We have earned reputation and goodwill amongst our retailers by giving them good service for many years ... We have decided to call a 'Non-cooperation' movement,"" said the letter.
The group's president, Dhairyashil Patil, said the letter was sent to Reckitt, Hindustan Unilever, Colgate and 20 other consumer goods companies.
None of the three consumer companies, as well as Reliance, responded to requests for comment.
Mom-and-pop stores, or ""kiranas"", account for 80% of a near-$900 billion https://reut.rs/2OYLmMV retail market in India. About 300,000 such stores in 150 cities order goods from Reliance, with the company setting a target of 10 million partner stores by 2024.

Traditional distributors have told Reuters they have been forced to cut vehicle fleet and staff as their business has been suffering because they can't match Reliance's pricing.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in March estimated kiranas will ""steadily increase the share of procurement"" from Reliance ""at the cost of traditional distributors"". Such sales for Reliance could mushroom to $10.4 billion by 2025 from just $200 million in 2021-22, Jefferies estimates.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2021 07:26PM ET</span>",Beijing biotech firm banks on GM corn in race to be China's Monsanto,"By Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - As China prepares to open its $120 billion corn market to genetically modified (GM) seed, little-known Dabeinong Biotechnology hopes to reap the benefits of early biotech investments and a law keeping foreign firms on the sidelines.
The long-anticipated commercialization of GM corn in the world's No. 2 producer is set to significantly boost yields, reducing the need for imports. It may also spur hoped-for reform of a chaotic and oversupplied seed sector, industry experts say, creating a new multibillion dollar market that may eventually open up to global seed giants.
New regulations drafted last month lay out for the first time the steps needed in China for approval of corn varieties that integrate GM traits, paving the way for the market to open as early as next year.
Beijing has made clear it will champion home-grown leaders in seed technology, and Dabeinong is the larger of two local companies with an insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant corn already approved as safe by the agriculture ministry.
""For the first two years, because we're the first mover in the market, and we believe our technology is better, we'll have two thirds of the share,"" general manager Liu Shi told Reuters.
By the third year, even with more competition, it could generate around 1 billion yuan ($155 million) in royalties, he estimated. The company will rely on seed breeders using its traits to generate revenues. 
ME-TOO PRODUCTS
Dabeinong Biotechnology was founded in 2011 as a unit of large animal feed producer, Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group Co. Ltd.
The parent firm made headlines in the United States after a senior executive was among several people charged with stealing corn seed from fields in Iowa and Illinois. The executive, the brother-in-law of group founder Shao Genhuo, was jailed for three years in 2016.
Dabeinong strictly abides by the law and is trying to rebuild its image, said Liu, who joined the company earlier this year. He previously worked at  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), now part of Germany's Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), in the 1990s when the GM pioneer was trying to get its first products accepted.
Dabeinong, with a staff of 160, hopes to emulate the success of the U.S. seed giant, but above all wants to help farmers, Liu said.
For now, Dabeinong's corn traits use genes that were discovered and commercialised by other firms but are off-patent. The biotech firm is working on its own genes, although these are yet to be approved.
It may need to move quickly before its ""me-too"" products lose their value, said an executive at a multinational seed company who declined to be named.
To ensure its first-mover advantage, Dabeinong is hiring more commercial staff and in September invited seed companies to visit trial plots in Inner Mongolia and Henan province planted with corn containing its Fengmai brand traits. 
It has licensing deals with almost 200 seed firms.
COMPETITION COMING
Early demand is likely to be strong.
China harvested 261 million tonnes of corn in 2020/21 from some 41 million hectares, largely to feed its huge herds of pigs and chickens. Each hectare, however, yielded only about 60% as much corn on average as in No. 1 producer, the United States. 
Graphic: Average corn yields over the last five years in the world's top producers - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-GMO/DABEINONG/zdpxonlgrvx/chart.png 
About 70% of corn seed sold in China's northeast breadbasket is already illegally bred GM seed, said an October article in the state-backed China Seed Industry journal, highlighting its popularity with farmers.
But Dabeinong won't be alone for long.
Though global seed giants like U.S.-based  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) Inc and Bayer cannot enter China's GM market, Syngenta, the world's No. 3 seed producer owned by China's Sinochem Holdings, expects to become market leader, according to the prospectus for its upcoming IPO. 
Syngenta is a major player in GM grains, but as it was only bought in 2017 is still playing catchup in China in the drawn-out process to win biosafety certificates for its GM traits from regulators.
Hangzhou Ruifeng Biotechnology, a tiny firm founded by university professor Shen Zhicheng, has an insect-resistant, herbicide-tolerant trait approved as safe by Beijing. The company also uses some new genes.
Yuan Longping High-tech Agriculture Co Ltd, backed by state-owned conglomerate CITIC, is also developing GM traits.
Meanwhile, the exact timing of GM corn is still uncertain.
Under the new rules, seed varieties that integrate GM traits must undergo a one-year production trial, and it is not clear if Beijing will accept data already gathered by Dabeinong.

""We have two plans, a more aggressive one for commercial seed production in 2022, and another for 2023,"" said Liu. ""We're waiting for the government's message.""

The activist investor, which owns a roughly 1% Kohl's stake, wants the department-store chain to examine the two alternatives to improve its lagging stock price, the report said, citing a letter sent to Kohl's board on Sunday.
Engine argues that the company has underperformed both the S&P 500 and other retailers in recent years, the report said https://on.wsj.com/3yapXCV.
Kohl and Engine Capital did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. 

In the letter cited by the newspaper, the activist investor also said that assuming online sales revenue of around $6.2 billion, Kohl's digital business alone would be worth $12.4 billion. 
Engine also added it believes there are private-equity firms that would pay at least $75 a share and that interactions with potential buyers suggest they could do so by monetizing Kohl's real estate, the report said.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc has asked a U.S. court to affirm an arbitrator's recent decision dismissing a former engineer's claims that the automaker fired and defamed her for raising concerns about defective floormats and contracting practices.
In a petition filed in San Francisco federal court on Thursday, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said an arbitrator in a Nov. 3 decision found Cristina Balan's claims that the company falsely accused her of criminal conduct in response to a 2017 Huffington Post article about her firing were untimely. 
In March, a California-based appeals court ruled that Balan was required to arbitrate the defamation claims because they were directly related to her employment with Tesla. 
The company on Thursday asked the court to confirm the arbitrator's decision, which opens the door for Balan to challenge it.
Balan said in an email on Friday that she would seek to vacate the arbitration award ""due to fraud, corruption, bias ... and manifest disregard for the law.""
In a 2019 lawsuit, Balan said she was fired shortly after sending an email to Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk claiming contracts were being awarded based on friendships regardless of price or quality.
Balan had also raised concerns about floormats in Tesla's Model S curling up under the pedals.

In a statement provided to the Huffington Post about Balan's case, Tesla claimed she was fired for using company time to work on a personal project and illegally recording conversations with colleagues.
Tesla had lauded Balan's work prior to her firing, including crediting her with perfecting a design for a battery pack, according to court filings.

426,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2021 09:05AM ET</span>",Hawkish Fed boosts value stocks' appeal for some investors,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Some investors are preparing for a hawkish turn from the Federal Reserve by buying the cyclical, economically-sensitive names they gravitated to earlier this year, as expectations grow that the central bank is zeroing in on fighting inflation. 
The gap between growth stocks and their value-focused counterparts, which include companies like banks, financials and energy firms, has fluctuated throughout the year, driven in part by bets on how quickly the Fed will normalize monetary policy.
In recent days, signs that the central bank will move faster than expected in the face of surging consumer prices have slammed the shares of growth and technology companies, which have also been roiled by broader market volatility stemming from concerns over the spreading Omicron variant https://www.reuters.com/world/omicron-marches-biden-prepares-us-grim-winter-2021-12-03 of the coronavirus.
At the same time, some investors have been ramping up bets on so-called value stocks, expecting them to perform better in an environment of tightening monetary policy. Such stocks surged earlier in 2021 as the U.S. economy reopened but faltered later as investors gravitated toward tech shares.
“The Fed brings the punch bowl and they are the ones that remove the punch bowl,” said Michael Antonelli, strategist at Baird. “Markets are quickly repricing their view of the future.”
Futures on the federal funds rate, which track short-term interest rate expectations, late Friday reflected a roughly 50% chance that the Fed will raise rates from its current near-zero level by May, CME's Fed Watch tool showed. That compared with around 31% in early November.
Driving those bets are comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who earlier this week said the central bank will likely in its next meeting discuss speeding the unwind of its $120 billion-per-month government bond-buying program.
Powell also said the word ""transitory"" was no longer appropriate to describe the current high inflation rate.
Stronger-than-expected elements in Friday’s U.S. employment report reinforced the view of a more hawkish Fed and weighed on growth stocks.
Among the casualties was the Ark Innovation ETF, which outperformed all other U.S. equity funds last year due to its outsized bets on so-called stay-at-home stocks. Shares of the fund tumbled 5.5% on Friday to a 13-month low amid steep declines in many of the stocks it holds.
The Russell 1000 Growth index is down 2.4% in the first three days of December, while its value-focused counterpart has risen by nearly 0.9%. The indexes are up 21.1% and 16.6%, year-to-date, respectively. 
“The internals of the market are starting to reflect a faster rate hiking cycle and it's the longer-duration growth stocks that are really selling off,"" said Spenser Lerner, head of Multi Asset Solutions at Harbor Capital Advisors. 
Higher yields - which can result from expectations of more aggressive Fed policy - can weigh even more on tech and growth stocks with lofty valuations, as they threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows. 
At the same time, value and cyclical shares tend to benefit from a stronger economy - often a prerequisite for the Fed to tighten monetary policy.
Lerner is focusing on high-quality, cyclical U.S. large-cap companies that do not trade at high valuations and will benefit from what he expects will be a continuing strengthening of the dollar as the Fed gets closer to raising rates. 
Among the data points the Fed will be watching in the week ahead will be the release of consumer price index and core inflation readings next Friday.
Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist with Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said Powell's openness to accelerating the Fed's tapering program will likely bring more volatility in the coming months as investors position for the possibility of rising rates. He is betting the faster removal of Fed support will lift shares of energy firms and financials. 
Not everyone believes the Fed is getting set for rate increases in 2022. Burns McKinney, a senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group, is betting the Fed will not rush to hike rates after unwinding its bond buying but instead gauge the strength of the economy without any monetary support before tightening policy in 2023. 

Such an outcome could see the Fed allowing inflation to continue running hot for months, boosting the case for buying cyclical companies such as  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON), which have a history of growing their dividends and may benefit from the Democratic-led infrastructure deal that passed Congress in early November. 
""If the Fed hadn't retired the word 'transitory,' all the rest of us had,"" McKinney said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's Property and Building Corp said on Sunday it agreed to sell the HSBC Tower building in midtown Manhattan for $855 million to New York-based real estate firm Innovo Property Group, recording a net loss of $45 million. 
The Israeli company, which is 63% owned by Discount Investment Corp, said it had also sold property in Israel for 390 million shekels ($123 million).
Doron Cohen, chief executive of both Property and Building and Discount, said management was focusing on income-producing properties in Israel and that the amount it was receiving from both transactions would allow it to advance this policy.
""We are continuing the policy and examining the possibility of realising additional properties in the United States and in Israel,"" Cohen said, noting the sale of the HSBC building came despite ""gloomy"" predictions over U.S. commercial real estate market.
He cited Tivoli Village, an upscale apartment complex in Las Vegas that opened this year, which may be put up for sale as part of the company's efforts to boost liquidity and reduce debt.
Along with conglomerate Koor Industries, Property and Building, bought the 30-storey, 80,000 square metre HSBC Tower in 2009 for $353 million. In 2011, Property acquired Koor's stake in the tower which has an occupancy of 99%, it said. HSBC had bought the building in the 1990s.
Property and Building said the value of the HSBC Tower in its books was $864 million as of Sept. 30. After costs, it said it would record a net loss of $45 million from the sale. 
Completion of the sale is expected by April 1, 2022 subject to Innovo's right to advance the date while also receiving options to postpone the completion twice for 30 days each.
Property said after the sale it will have a net cash flow of $343 million.

Its shares were 0.7% lower in afternoon trading in Tel Aviv.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",China regulator says govt policies not necessarily linked to overseas IPOs,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's securities regulator said on Sunday that Beijing's recent policy moves were not aimed at specific industries or private firms, and were not necessarily linked to companies seeking to list in overseas markets. 
China has implemented a sweeping regulatory crackdown https://www.reuters.com/business/china-wall-street-regulatory-crackdown-not-aimed-restricting-private-firms-2021-09-20 in recent months on internet companies, for-profit education, and real estate developers, among others.
""The main purpose of (those moves) is to regulate monopoly, to protect the interests and data security of small- and medium-sized firms, as well as personal information security,"" the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement.
The cyberspace regulator had proposed companies with more than one million users in China undergo a security review before sending user-related data abroad or listing shares overseas.
Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global said on Friday it planned to delist from the New York Stock Exchange, just five months after its debut, and pursue a Hong Kong listing. 
The securities regulatory commission said it had taken note of new rules rolled out by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asking Chinese companies to detail their ownership structure and audits.
Some media reports stating that China will likely ban companies with a VIE (Variable Interest Entity) structure from U.S. listing is a case of ""total misunderstanding and (is) misreading"", the CSRC said.
The VIE structure, used widely by tech firms, was created two decades ago to circumvent rules restricting foreign investment in sensitive industries such as media and telecoms.
The CSRC policies are not meant to crack down on specific industry or private firms and ""have no necessary connections with companies' overseas listings,"" the commission said. 
It said the commission had learnt some Chinese companies are actively communicating with domestic and foreign regulators to go public in the United States. The CSRC will respect firms' choice of listing venues on the basis of compliance, it said. 
The securities commission said it has held candid, constructive communications with SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and has achieved positive progress in promoting cooperations on some key issues. 

It noted, however, that some forces in the U.S. have ""politicized"" capital market supervision and threatened Chinese companies to delist from the country in recent years, which goes against principles of a market economy and hurts global investors, according to the statement. 
The CSRC said it will continue to communicate with its U.S. counterpart to resolve remaining issues in audit and regulatory areas as soon as possible.

Authorities would support futures companies to widen and diversify their financing channels and allow them to compete with overseas players, Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, told an industry conference on Sunday, according to the statement. 
Leading futures firms should ""make due contributions"" to ensure China's energy and mineral security, Fang said. 
China's commodities market had been volatile this year amid the uneven global economic recovery, easing liquidity and speculation. Metal and coal futures, for example, surged to historical highs before plunging after government interventions.
The regulator will further support the development of futures risk management companies and to steadily expand traders groups, according to the association. 

Fang said China is expected to release its first futures law in 2022 after considering it for years, which will help further regulate the derivatives market. 
He also reiterated that China will allow more foreign traders to participate in domestic markets while deepening price influence of existing products such as crude oil, iron ore and PTA, the association's statement said.

The statement marks a shift in the stance of the French media group as TIM's investors get ready to evaluate a 10.8 billion euro ($12.2 billion) takeover plan presented by U.S. fund KKR for TIM.
Until now the French group has dragged its feet on the possibility that Rome gains control over TIM's fixed network.
A spokesperson for the French media group told Reuters that Vivendi was interested in any solution that ""promoted the efficiency and modernity of the network, while preserving the value of its investment"". 
""In this perspective, the hypothesis of a state control of the network, if it could lead to an institutionally guided strategic project, will certainly be evaluated with openness,"" the spokesperson added. 
TIM's fixed line business provides Italy's main telecoms infrastructure and plays a major role in broadband rollout efforts on which Rome plans to spend billions of euros of European Union funds to improve coverage.

State investor CDP has taken a 10% stake in TIM to oversee the network and is expected to play a key role in any plans to carve out the grid.

Marlene Amstad, head of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority's (FINMA) board of directors, told the SonntagsZeitung paper the agency would welcome new tools to hold bankers accountable for the mistakes they make.
While FINMA can now remove bankers who make grave errors, it lacks the kind of broader toolkit that Britain, for example, has with its Senior Manager Regime, she said in the interview.
""We cannot introduce such instruments ourselves, the legislature has to do that. Currently, there are political initiatives that address the need for action in this regard. We are interested in having as complete a toolbox as possible and are fundamentally open to new, effective instruments,"" she said.
Exasperation with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in particular is prompting Switzerland to rethink a system in which top bankers have been largely untouchable, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-scandals-prompt-switzerland-think-unthinkable-punish-bankers-2021-05-28 in May. 
Credit Suisse's heavy losses from the collapse of family office Archegos and the decimation of billions of client investments backed by insolvent British financier Greensill angered regulators and triggered a rare discussion among lawmakers about fining bankers.

On other subjects, Amstad said risks from the mortgage market had risen as red-hot property prices diverged from economic fundamentals, but she said it was not up to FINMA to decide whether to reimpose the anti-cyclical capital buffers that the government has suspended amid the pandemic. 
""What we can do is demand risk surcharges from individual banks if a bank takes too great a risk when granting mortgages. We use this instrument regularly, including recently,"" she said without giving further details.

China Evergrande, wrestling with debts of more than $300 billion, said on Friday that there was ""no guarantee"" it would have enough funds to meet debt repayments, prompting the country's top financial regulators to calm the market.
The regulators said any fallout was controllable, and that developers' normal funding needs would be met, but the sector is facing another year of tight funding conditions and refinancing risks, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said in a note last week.
Country Garden, the country's top property developer, said on Sunday that the company is considering applying for the issuance of supply chain asset-based securities (ABS) in the near term. 
""As an innovative financing tool, supply chain ABS products can support upstream suppliers' financing and ease financing difficulties for small and medium firms,"" the company said in a statement on its official WeChat account.
It also pledged to control company's risks via prudent operations, according to the statement.
Four other developers, including Huafa Industrial and Greentown China, have received regulatory feedback on their plans to issue ABS totalling nearly 16 billion yuan ($2.51 billion), the Shanghai Stock Exchange disclosed on Dec.3. 
The Securities Times reported that China Vanke is also planning to issue supply chain ABS worth 777 million yuan in the near run. 
""Restrictions on domestic real estate bond financing have eased, and the amount of bond issuance in November is about 3 times that of October,"" analysts with CICC wrote in a note, adding that bond financing is recovering in an orderly manner. 
China's property market, which accounts for a quarter of gross domestic product by some metrics, has been cooling sharply since May with sentiment shaken by intensifying liquidity stress that has engulfed some of the country's most indebted developers.
Analysts do not believe Beijing will ease up much on its campaign to rein in developers with high leverage levels, but they do expect some policy tweaks to ensure home prices and sales don't fall too quickly.

Regulators said they will support private firms, especially those affected by recent debt issues, to raise money ""properly"", Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday, citing an official from the securities regulator.

The Gulf Arab state on Friday ordered 80 Rafales made by Dassault Aviation and 12 Caracal military helicopters made by Airbus Helicopters in an arms contract worth 17 billion euros ($19.2 billion).
Major General Ibrahim Nasser Al Alawi, commander of the UAE Air Force and Air Defence, said in a statement on state news agency WAM late on Saturday that the Rafale jets would replace the UAE's French-built Mirage 2000 fleet.
""This deal is not considered as an alternative for the forthcoming F-35 deal, it is rather a complementary deal ... as we develop our air force capabilities,"" Alawi said, adding the UAE had for some time been looking to replace its Mirage fleet.
The sale of 50 F-35 warplanes made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) to the UAE has slowed amid concerns in Washington over Abu Dhabi's relationship with China, including use of Huawei 5G technology in the country.

Last month, a U.S. official said the United States intends to move forward with the sale but that there must be a clear understanding of ""Emirati obligations"".
The United States under then-President Donald Trump agreed to sell the jets after the UAE last year established ties with Israel. President Joe Biden's administration has said this year it would proceed with the sale.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2021 12:01AM ET</span>","Dyson splits with Malaysia supplier, stoking concern over migrant worker treatment","By A. Ananthalakshmi and Liz Lee
JOHOR BAHRU, Malaysia(Reuters) - A short drive across the border from Dyson's new headquarters in Singapore is the boomtown built around its business: a Malaysian industrial area dominated by its biggest supplier, ATA IMS Bhd.
ATA, one of Malaysia's top electronics manufacturing services providers, rode Dyson's success in high-end vacuum cleaners and air purifiers, supplying parts for a company that came to account for 80% of its revenue. 
Ten current and former employees, and a former ATA executive, say the growth came at an unseen cost: its mostly migrant work force worked up to 15 hours a day, were often asked to skip rest days to keep up with demand, and were coached to hide true working and living conditions from labour inspectors and Dyson. 
In interviews over the last two months, the employees also say ATA, which analysts say is Dyson's biggest global contract manufacturer, hired thousands of foreigners without work permits.
After questions from Reuters on Nov. 18, Dyson last month said it would pull its business from ATA in six months, citing a recent independent audit on conditions for workers and allegations by an unidentified whistleblower. 
ATA said in a statement it was audited by the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a body widely engaged by electronics firms to conduct factory audits. RBA hires third-party auditors for the inspections. It declined to comment. 
On Nov. 29, ATA said it had seen the summary of Dyson's audit, which found poor living conditions, concerns of retaliation and unpaid allowances, among other issues. It described the findings as ""non-conclusive"" and said it was reviewing them. Reuters has not seen the audit. 
ATA declined to comment, and referred Reuters to its recent public statements. 
Dyson said on Tuesday it wouldn't comment because the accusations related to ATA.
Malaysia on Wednesday said it would charge ATA over complaints it had received through the labour department. It did not say what the charges or complaints were about or whether they related to the workers' accusations about its Dyson factories.
The country's human resources minister, M. Saravanan, said forced labour allegations at Malaysian companies were hurting foreign investors' confidence in products manufactured there. He had earlier said the government was investigating Dyson's decision to split with ATA.
After Dyson's move, ATA shares dropped 60%. Some analysts have raised doubts about ATA's ability to attract new customers, and on Nov. 29 a statement from the firm forecast revenue declines and cost cuts.
With Dyson's departure, six workers and shopkeepers interviewed in the Johor Bahru industrial area said they feared they might lose their livelihoods.
""There is no guarantee of a job here anymore,"" said one off-duty ATA worker, wearing his royal-blue factory work shirt on a recent Sunday. Like others, he asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal.
ATA officially employs around 8,000 workers, although four ATA workers and the former executive estimated its workforce had been as high as 17,000 until recently, including those without permits. Most of 17,000 were from Bangladesh and Nepal, according to the workers and executive.
RECORD REVENUE
ATA's factories are concentrated in adjacent industrial parks in suburban Johor Bahru, a 30-minute drive to Singapore, where Dyson is headquartered.
ATA posted record revenue of 4.2 billion ringgit ($991.74 million) for the fiscal year that ended in March. Dyson, owned by British billionaire James Dyson, accounted for nearly $800 million of that.
Analysts say the increased scrutiny of Malaysia could increase production costs and deter investors. The United States has banned six Malaysian firms in the last two years over accusations of forced labour. 
""Cost will definitely move up because a lot more care has to be taken into account, not just on recruitment but also worker accommodation. The ramifications are significantly higher costs for labour,"" said Vincent Khoo, head of Malaysia research at brokerage UOB Kay Hian.
Malaysia, which makes everything from iPhone components to semiconductors, is reliant on electrical and electronics manufacturing in particular for exports and economic growth. Between January and October 2021, such products accounted for 36% of total exports.
Foreigners make up about 10% - 1.48 million - of Malaysia's work force, according to government data, though that percentage is higher in the manufacturing sector. The government and labour groups estimate millions more undocumented migrants. 
'WE NEED YOUR COOPERATION'
Until recently, audits of ATA had not revealed any issues, according to ATA and Dyson. A 2020 audit gave ATA a perfect score on working conditions, ATA said in May. Dyson did not confirm that score.
The employees told Reuters that ATA supervisors coached factory staff on what to tell auditors. Two said supervisors told them that if they told the truth about working conditions, Dyson would cut its orders with ATA. 
In July, an ATA supervisor instructed workers in a WhatsApp group to tell auditors they did not work on Sundays and worked no more than three hours of overtime per day. The supervisor has not responded to repeated calls from Reuters. According to workers and payslips seen by Reuters, workers regularly worked Sundays and up to six hours of overtime.
""We need your cooperation… Please brief all the employee… to avoid issue during audit,"" read the message, dated July 2 and seen by Reuters. 
Employees also said the plant had been cleaned and safety equipment distributed ahead of audits, and that workers without permits were asked to stay away. 
When Dyson officials visited, ATA stopped Sunday work and cut back on overtime, the employees said. ATA and Dyson declined to comment.
U.S. PROBE
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) opened an investigation into ATA in April over unethical recruitment practices and poor working and living conditions, according to independent labour rights activist Andy Hall, who sought the inquiry. He showed Reuters a letter dated April 19 from the agency informing him of the investigation. CBP declined to comment.
Nepalese national Dhan Kumar Limbu, 32, said people working with Hall contacted him in April as part of his investigation into ATA, and Limbu said he shared details about working and living conditions with them. Hall confirmed Limbu's account.
Limbu said that in June, ATA officials took him to a police station, where he was questioned about sharing information with activists, then beaten by police. He fled Malaysia and is now back in Nepal. Limbu told Reuters he told Dyson's lawyers about the ATA working conditions in an interview on Oct. 1. 
Dyson did not identify the whistleblower by name but said in a statement to Reuters last month that ""We immediately commissioned an international law firm to undertake a full investigation and provided the whistle-blower with support that enabled them to assist with the investigation."" Dyson did not say which firm it had retained. 
ATA also hired a law firm to review Limbu's claims and said in a statement last week that preliminary findings indicate ""the allegations may be unjustified."" The police have said they are investigating whether officers beat Limbu.
Employees said ATA started to make some changes since the accusations came to light in May, when it first publicly denied the allegations. The company reimbursed some workers 7,000 ringgit in July for what they paid labour brokers in their home countries, according to Limbu, other workers and payslips seen by Reuters. 
ATA also stopped employing foreign workers without permits and closed a crowded dorm that had housed 60 people to a room, workers said. 

Limbu and other employees Reuters interviewed said Dyson should have stayed to ensure working and living conditions improved for migrant workers. 
""My intention to share information was to improve conditions for the workers and get rest days. But now with Dyson's decision, people will lose jobs,"" Limbu said.

436,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2021 04:25PM ET</span>",Trump's social media venture says it has raised $1 billion,"By Krystal Hu and Juby Babu
(Reuters) - Donald Trump's new social media venture said on Saturday it had entered into agreements to raise about $1 billion from a group of unidentified investors as it prepares to float in the U.S. stock market. 
The capital raise, details of which were first reported by Reuters on Wednesday, underscored the former U.S. president's ability to attract strong financial backing thanks to his personal and political brand. He is working to launch a social media app called TRUTH Social that is at least several weeks away.
Digital World Acquisition Corp, the blank-check acquisition firm that will take Trump Media & Technology Group Corp public by listing it in New York, said it will provide up to $293 million to the partnership with Trump's media venture, taking the total proceeds to about $1.25 billion.
The $1 billion will be raised through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction from ""a diverse group of institutional investors,"" Trump Media and Digital World said in a statement. They did not respond to requests to name the investors.
Trump Media inked its deal with Digital World to go public in October at a valuation of $875 million, including debt. The social media venture is now valued at almost $4 billion based on the price of Digital World shares at the end of trading on Friday. Trump supporters and day traders snapped up the stock.
Many Wall Street firms such as mutual funds and private equity firms snubbed the opportunity to invest in the PIPE. Among those investors who participated were hedge funds, family offices and high net-worth individuals, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Family offices manage the wealth of the very rich and their kin.
Some Wall Street investors are reluctant to associate with Trump. He was banned from top social media platforms after the Jan. 6 attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol amid concerns he would inspire further violence. The Capitol attack was based on unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in last year's presidential election. 
""As our balance sheet expands, Trump Media & Technology Group will be in a stronger position to fight back against the tyranny of Big Tech,"" Trump said in a statement on Saturday.
The deal also faces regulatory risk. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren asked Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler last month to investigsate the planned merger for potential violations of securities laws around disclosure. The SEC has declined to comment on whether it plans any action.
Trump Media and Digital World said the per-share conversion price of the convertible preferred stock PIPE transaction represents a 20% discount to Digital World's volume-weighted average closing price for the five trading days to Dec. 1, when Reuters broke news of the capital raise. 
If that price averages below $56 in the 10 days after the merger with Digital World has been completed, the discount will grow to 40% with a floor of $10, the companies added. Digital World shares ended trading on Friday $44.97.
Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), 33 million on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and 24.5 million on Instagram at the time he was blocked, according to a presentation on his company's website.
Investors attending the confidential investor road shows were shown a demo from the planned social media app, which looked like a Twitter feed, Reuters reported.
FIRST-QUARTER ROLLOUT
Since Trump was voted out of office last year, he has repeatedly dropped hints that he might seek the presidency in 2024.
Special purpose acquisition companies such as Digital World had lost much of their luster with retail investors before the Trump media deal came along. Many of these investors were left with big losses after the companies that merged with SPACs failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections.

TRUTH Social is scheduled for a full rollout in the first quarter of 2022. It is the first of three stages in the Trump Media plan, followed by a subscription video-on-demand service called TMTG+ that will feature entertainment, news and podcasts, according to the news release.
In a slide deck on its website, the company envisions eventually competing against Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS cloud service and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud.

KKR's approach was made public on Nov. 21.
""They could come up with three names by Monday but time's tight and it may drag on a bit longer,"" one of the sources said.

The sources also said no decision has yet been taken. TIM, IMI, Bank of America and Barclays declined to comment. Divisions within Italy's biggest phone group are making it difficult for TIM to respond to KKR's offer after a shareholder row a week ago forced Luigi Gubitosi to step down as CEO. TIM's top shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) is pushing for a full board reshuffle after Gubitosi refused to step down from the board, sources said - a move that prevented new general manager Pietro Labriola being named CEO last week.
Labriola could be named as CEO if Gubitosi or another director steps down to make way for him.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), IMI and Bank of America had been lined up for a possible role in advising TIM before Gubitosi stepped aside as CEO, sources previously said.

A preliminary decision could be made at a meeting of the supervisory board on Dec. 15, with Appel potentially proposed for election at the annual meeting on April 7, Handelsblatt reported, citing five people familiar with the matter. 
The newspaper said there were also talks under way about an early contract extension for Telekom CEO Timotheus Hoettges. Both companies declined to comment on the report.
The term of office of Telekom chairman Ulrich Lehner, who has headed the Telekom supervisory body since 2008, ends at next year's shareholder meeting. He had already confirmed that an external search for a successor was under way.
Appel's predecessor at Deutsche Post, Klaus Zumwinkel, also served as supervisory board chairman of Telekom.
The German government holds stakes in both companies.

Appel, a former McKinsey consultant, has been with Deutsche Post since 2000. In 2002, he became a member of the board of management, and in 2008 he moved up to the post of CEO.
His contract runs until 2022 and a decision on his future at the Post had been expected soon. Some industry insiders have speculated that Appel could be ready to move on given that Deutsche Post has posted record results through the pandemic.

The telecommunications firm said it will be participating in the pilot trials in some parts of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and two other urban centres.
It is the first telecom operator to sign up for 5G trials. However, it did not say if it had signed a long term agreement on the usage of the government's 5G network. 
""We will continue to support the government's aspiration to deliver 5G for the nation,"" it said. 
Malaysia's major mobile carriers have raised concerns over transparency and pricing issues, Reuters reported last month.
Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB), the state-owned network wholesaler for 5G, confirmed last month that no agreement had been reached with carriers, and acknowledged its initial timeline for negotiations had been ""too optimistic"".
It also said talks with telecom firms to settle commercial terms were yet to start and long term agreements were expected to be signed in early 2022.

The deadlock followed a government decision in February to set up DNB to build a centralised wholesale 5G network, abandoning earlier plans to apportion spectrum to carriers, in a bid to accelerate infrastructure buildup nationwide.
The government has said 5G pricing would be cheaper for the mobile carriers than the cost the operators have incurred for 4G.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed lower for the second-straight week Friday, as investors weighed up a ""colossal miss"" in job gains for November at a time when the Federal Reserve looks likely to step up the pace of monetary policy tightening.  
The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.17%, or 59 points, the Nasdaq fell 1.9%. The major averages ended off the session lows.  
“It was a colossal miss,” Darren Schuringa, CEO of ASYMmetric ETFs said in an interview with Investing.com on Friday, referring to weaker-than-expected job gains in November. “When I look at these numbers now, it is concerning for me from an economic strength standpoint.”
Nonfarm payrolls increased 210,000 in November, well below economists’ expectations for 550,000 new jobs.
Still, a deeper dive into the monthly jobs report pointed to signs of the strength in the labor market. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.2% as the labor force participation rate rose 0.2% to 61.8% last month.  
While the weakness in hiring “could complicate the discussion at the Federal Reserve … [Fed] officials seem to be leaning toward faster monetary policy normalization in response to high inflation,” Desjardins said in a note.
Technology stocks were among the hardest hit, though pared some intraday losses.
Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell nearly 2%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were down about 1%.
Chip stocks also exacerbated the selling in the broader tech as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) slipped more than 4% after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block its proposed $40 billion takeover of chipmaker ARM Holdings (LON:ARM), citing competition concerns.
“[W]e see the FTC's decision to sue to block the deal as almost certainly ending the chances of any acquisition,” Wedbush said in a note.
DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), meanwhile, plunged 42% after its softer fourth-quarter guidance suggested the e-signature company is unlikely to sustain its pandemic-fueled growth, bringing down the broader software sector with it.
In other news, Peloton Interactive  (NASDAQ:PTON) gave up earlier gains and followed the market lower despite Deustche Bank issuing a buy rating on the stock amid expectations that a hybrid approach to fitness – at home and at the gym – is a possibility.
“[W]e think the hybrid work model extends to fitness, too, and that PTON [Peloton] has plenty of momentum to regain operationally,” Deutsche Bank said in a note.
Financials, meanwhile, were pushed lower by a slump in banks as the Treasury yields fell sharply, with the 10-year yield falling below 1.4%.
SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB), First Republic (NYSE:FRC), Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) were sharply lower as falling yields tend to keep a lid on net interest income generated by banks.
The slump in Treasury yields come as investors flag concerns about the outlook for the economy as the Fed appears ready to step up monetary policy tightening at a time when the new omicron variant could threaten growth.
Yet, if the new variant turns out to be less impactful than feared and supply chain woes continue to ease, the broader market could resume its trend higher. 
""If the borders remain open, and supply chain [problems] continue to unravel, then that would support the markets moving higher from here,"" Schuringa said.
In the short-term, the risk-off trend continued into the crypto markets on Saturday, as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies sold off over 15% in overnight trading.

Just last month, an official said the listing may happen within the next couple of years https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/vietnams-vinfast-plans-us-listing-couple-years-ceo-2021-11-17, as the company joins a growing list of electric vehicle startups taking advantage of investor excitement to raise funds.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 11:26PM ET</span>",Analysis-Didi's New York exit a further blow to Chinese listings in U.S.,"By Scott Murdoch and Sayantani Ghosh
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Ride-hailing giant Didi Global's plan to withdraw from the New York stock exchange may create an even deeper chill after this year's drop-off in Chinese firms' listings in the world's most liquid market, bankers and advisers said.
Chinese listings in the United States have fallen sharply since Didi debuted in New York on June 30 - defying regulators' wishes to pause the listing - due mainly to concerns about an unprecedented regulatory crackdown on technology companies. 
Two days after Didi's $4.4 billion initial public offering, Chinese regulators ordered an investigation into the company which remains underway, ordered app stores to remove 25 of its mobile apps, and blocked the app for new users in mainland China.
The regulatory action, alongside the U.S. government's ongoing threat to delist Chinese companies not compliant with its auditing rules, has already prompted a sharp slowdown in Chinese listings.
The second half of this year has been the quietest six months for U.S. listings by Chinese firms since the first half of 2017, and so far in 2021, listings have totalled nearly $13 billion compared to $13.6 billion last year, Dealogic data showed.
Chinese companies that list on U.S. stock exchanges must disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a government entity, and provide evidence of their auditing inspections, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Thursday.
""We're only going to see limited IPOs out of China into the U.S. now,"" one Hong Kong banker told Reuters, as the city's financial sector digested the impact the Didi decision would have on the listing pipeline.
The banker declined to be named, as the person was not authorised to speak to the media.
Independent research analyst Mitchell Kim, who publishes on the Smartkarma platform, said that already cautious investors would become more nervous about future Chinese IPOs in the world's largest economy.
""U.S. investors may fear investing in Chinese companies, which means Chinese companies may get choked off from accessing U.S. capital,"" Kim said. ""In particular, the Chinese techs could face a greater challenge because so many tech investors are based in the U.S.""
Golden Gate Ventures partner Justin Hall said while Didi's delisting might negatively impact global investor appetite for Chinese technology companies, it's too early to say the same for Chinese retail and institutional investors.
""It's important to note that simply because Chinese technology companies may no longer list as frequently in the United States, that's not to say they can't have wildly successful public offerings on Chinese exchanges,"" he said. 
""By the same vein, founders of Chinese technology companies may opt for safer exchanges in the future, given that all the time and resources required to list on the U.S.-based exchanges would be for naught if they're subsequently required to delist.""
Hong Kong has benefitted from the Sino-U.S. spat with a string of U.S.-listed Chinese firms carrying out secondary listings there in recent years, partly as a back-up in case they are delisted from New York, say market participants.
Another investment banker in Hong Kong was slightly more optimistic that Chinese companies not handling large amount of data could still opt for a New York listing.

Sources told Reuters last month that Chinese regulators had pressed Didi's top executives to devise a plan to delist from the New York Stock Exchange due to concerns about data security.
""Didi's issue is with data. If the data issue is resolved, then it will be ok,"" said the banker, who also declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. airlines will take part in a Senate oversight hearing this month on the industry, an aviation trade group said on Friday, with lawmakers expected to quiz executives about how carriers used pandemic-related federal aid, staffing issues and other matters.
The Senate Commerce Committee has invited the chief executives of seven major U.S. airlines to testify at the planned Dec. 15 hearing.
Airlines for America (A4A), an industry trade group, said in a statement that ""the U.S. airlines look forward to participating"" but did not specify whether the CEOs would testify, as requested by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, the committee's chair.
Cantwell has invited the CEOs of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), United Airlines, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Alaska Airlines and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) to appear, Reuters reported this week.
A4A said the carriers look forward to continuing to work with Cantwell and Senator Roger Wicker, the committee's top Republican, ""on the issues facing the U.S. airline industry.""
""I would encourage them to show up,"" Cantwell told Reuters on Wednesday of the CEOs. ""I think it is bad faith not to show up. ... The public deserves to know some answers.""
Cantwell added that ""we're going to do our oversight role because this was a lot of money."" Many of those CEOs are expected to be in Washington on the day of the hearing to take part in an A4A meeting, officials said.
U.S. airlines and carriers around the world were hard hit by reduced business and tourist travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in March 2020, Congress approved three rounds of taxpayer bailouts totaling $54 billion to cover much of U.S. airline payroll costs through Sept. 30 of this year as a result of the pandemic.
Lawmakers want to know if voluntary employee buyouts offered by airlines, despite receiving payroll assistance, caused operational problems at some carriers that have resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights in recent months.
The leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation Committee separately have asked A4A to answer questions about the government payroll aid that the carriers received.
Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio, the committee's chairman, and the panel's top Republican, Representative Sam Graves, asked A4A to answer questions about staffing reductions despite the taxpayer assistance.
DeFazio and Graves in a letter made public late on Thursday noted that questions have been raised about disruptions at two major U.S. carriers in recent months and asked whether that is the result of ""a shortage of workers in key operational areas"" despite the aid from Congress. 
""We expect airlines to take whatever measures are available to ameliorate any short-staffing issues and begin to address longer-term workforce shortages,"" the two congressmen wrote.
Southwest Airlines and American Airlines in recent months have had high-profile issues resulting in the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
A4A said COVID-19 cut air travel demand by as much as 96% during the early stages of the pandemic last year.
""The industry was in survival mode, and the (assistance program) was critical to ensuring U.S. airline employees remained on the job, ready to go and able to continue providing essential services,"" the group said.

It added that ""the operational disruptions that some carriers have experienced are wholly unrelated to the federal support.""
Airlines that received government assistance were not allowed to issue involuntary layoffs or cut worker pay. They also had to limit executive compensation and halt share buybacks and dividend payments.

446,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 08:31PM ET</span>","Narrowing equity market breadth may signal a ""market top"" -BofA","By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) -Narrowing equity market breadth, rising volatility and the prospects of rate hikes are the classic signs of a market top, BofA said in a weekly report on Thursday.
Just five of the biggest U.S. technology stocks accounted for 71% of the nearly 20% gains in U.S stocks, BoFA analysts noted of the performance of shares in a weekly flows note based on EPFR data.
A situation in which a tiny group of stocks powers gains while others lose ground is often viewed as an indicator that a rally is running out of steam.
The picture was equally worrying for world stocks, with year-to-date returns from a global index excluding the top 300 U.S. growth stocks at a paltry 1.6% despite a record-breaking $1 trillion of equity market inflows so far this year.
Volatility gauges are also signalling caution. While U.S and European stock market volatility gauges have stepped back from 2021 highs hit earlier this week, they remain far above recent averages.
And with major central banks led by the U.S. Federal Reserve expected to start increasing interest rates from next year, traders are getting worried about technology shares. Their stellar performance this year has been partially based on the view that interest rates will remain near record lows.
""Hikes plus volatility plus divergences often a market top make,"" strategists at U.S. investment bank BofA led by Michael Hartnett said in a note.

U.S. Treasuries saw their biggest inflows since October 2020 while investment-grade and high-yield bond funds saw large outflows. Cash funds saw the biggest weekly inflows at $27.1 billion, followed by equities at $9 billion.
Short bonds and long equities trades this year have paid handsome dividends. But in a sign that investors are unwinding some of those trades, BofA said its private clients have trimmed their equity positions for the past three weeks, led by outflows from growth and industrial sectors.

447,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 08:11PM ET</span>","Wall St ends lower on Omicron worries, Fed taper angst","By Devik Jain and Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes closed lower on Friday, with the Nasdaq leading the declines as investors bet that a strong jobs report would not slow the Federal Reserve's withdrawal of support all while they grappled with uncertainty around the Omicron coronavirus variant.
After opening higher, Wall Street spent the rest of the session in the doldrums and an elevated volatility index highlighted investor anxiety. 
The Labor Department's report, ahead of the session's open, showed that while nonfarm job growth rose less than expected in November, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2%, its lowest since February 2020, and wages increased.
Separately, a measure of U.S. services industry activity hit a record high in November. 
Both sets of data appeared to influence investor expectations for the Fed's next move towards tightening its policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week that the central bank will consider a faster wind-down of its bond-buying program, prompting speculation that interest rate hikes would also be brought forward. 
""There's not enough in the jobs report to dissuade the Fed from accelerating the taper and (it) leaves the door open for a quicker rate hike than the market might have been anticipating,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR).
On top of this he pointed to concerns that the Omicron variant appeared to be spreading faster than Delta, the last most prevalent version of COVID-19. 
The number of countries reporting Omicron cases kept rising on Friday but there was still little clarity on the severity of the disease or the level of protection provided by existing COVID-19 vaccines.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.71 points, or 0.17%, to 34,580.08, the S&P 500 lost 38.67 points, or 0.84%, to 4,538.43 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 295.85 points, or 1.92%, to 15,085.47.
The S&P, the Dow and the Nasdaq all registered declines for a week in which they swung wildly from day to day as investors reacted to Omicron news and Powell's comments.
The S&P's decline of 1.2% was its second weekly decline in a row while the Nasdaq fell 2.62%, also its second straight week of losses. The Dow dropped 0.92% in its fourth consecutive weekly decline. 
In a clear indication of investor nerves, Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Market Volatility index, went above 35, in afternoon trading, for the first time since late January. It pared some gains however to close up 9.7 points at 30.67.
Meanwhile the S&P sector outperformers were defensive sectors consumer staples, closing up 1.4% and utilities, adding 1%, followed by healthcare, which climbed 0.25%. 
By the end of the session, consumer discretionary, down 1.8%, was the biggest loser, followed by technology, which fell 1.65%.
Decliners included heavyweights such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), down 6%, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), down 4% and both Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) losing more than 1%.
""It's hard to argue that stocks with such huge valuations are defensive,"" said Interactive Brokers' Sosnick. 
And with large cap technology stocks having avoided a recent deterioration in the broader markets, Sosnick said: ""That's catching up to those stocks.""
The economically sensitive Dow fell less than its peers during the session while other cyclical sectors like industrials, materials also outperformed.
DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) Inc closed down 42% after the electronic signature solutions firm forecast downbeat fourth-quarter revenue.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.39-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 15 new highs and 682 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges 13.8 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.52 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

(Reuters) - Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co said on Thursday it has reached an agreement with the union on a new five-year contract for its employees at a few breakfast-cereal plants in the United States, potentially bringing a near two-month long strike to an end.
The tentative agreement, reached after multiple rounds of talks with the union, includes wage increases and benefits for all employees and better terms for transitional employees.
The latest agreement allows for all transitional employees with four or more years of service to move to legacy positions.
Union members had previously opposed Kellogg's two-tier employment system that did not offer transitional workers a pathway to become legacy staff.
Employees at Kellogg's cereal plants including Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Tennessee went on strike on Oct. 5 after their contracts expired, as negotiations over payment and benefits stalled due to differences between the company and about 1,400 union members. 
The new deal, which will be voted on by Kellogg employees on Dec. 5, will also offer permanent employees with better post-retirement benefits. 
During lengthy negotiations with union members, Kellogg had hired permanent replacements for some of its plant workers on strike, and also warned of a dent to its annual profit due to the disruption. 

Kellogg is one of the several major U.S. companies that has faced worker strikes in the recent past as the labor market tightens and inflation reaches record highs. 
Last month, farm equipment maker Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co reached an agreement with workers after a six week strike.

449,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>","‘Fed Put’ in Doubt as Inflation Runs Hot, But Low Yields Will Keep Stocks in Play","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – Rampant inflation threatens to destroy the ‘Fed put’ as the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten even if the Omicron variant weighs on growth, but the dearth of alternative attractive investments will keep stocks in vogue.    
“By severely limiting the FOMC's ability to respond to downside risks posed by Omicron, inflation has effectively destroyed the Fed put,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said, referring to the belief that when markets decline significantly, the fed will step in with accommodative policies.
But even as inflation will force the Fed’s hand to tighten, and limit the central bank’s ability to respond to market downturns, the hunt for yield will continue to land at the door of stock markets as returns on offer from U.S. government bonds aren't likely to attract investment dollars anytime soon.
""[I]nvestors will have to find ways to get a return and one and a half percent [on the 10-year Treasury yield] on your money is not going to cut it,” Eric Diton, president and managing director of the Wealth Alliance, told Investing.com in an interview earlier this week. 
“That’s really one of the main reasons why we remain bullish on global equities because I don't think that we're going to see the 10-year Treasury yield at three or four percent anytime soon, global rates still going to continue to remain low.”
For months and months, Powell has held onto his view that the factors driving up inflation had been transitory.
But that all changed this week after the Fed chief conceded that the central bank had underestimated how long elevated inflation would persist, and suggested that a faster pace of tapering was on the agenda for the December meeting to help keep price pressure in check.
""The economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are high, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, which we actually announced at the November meeting, perhaps a few months sooner,” Powell said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee this week.
The remarks took some by surprise as they arrived after Powell had flagged downside economic risks posed by the Omicron variant of Covid-19.
Still, the threat of the new variant isn’t likely to derail the economic recovery even as the ‘Fed put’ appears on the brink as the consumer is strong enough to plug the gap somewhat.
“We're still very much in the midst of a global economic recovery, even though this variant may make it uneven, it’s not going to derail this global recovery,” Diton said.
“The consumer accounts for 70% of GDP, and they're in very good financial shape,” Diton added. “There could very well be a decent correction 10% to 20% in stocks,  but that would be a buying opportunity.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global equities and benchmark U.S. bond yields tumbled on Friday in volatile trade after data showed U.S. job growth slowed considerably in November and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus kept investors on edge.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 jobs, the fewest since last December, but the unemployment rate plunged to a 21-month low of 4.2% and 594,000 people entered the labor force, the most in 13 months, indicating a rapidly tightening labor market.
Despite weak jobs growth, solid details in the Labor Department report suggested Federal Reserve plans to accelerate tapering of its bond purchases and expectations for multiple rate hikes next year remained intact.
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 9.8 basis points to 1.351% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite stock index slid almost 3% at one point as investors anticipated slower economic growth next year. 
""The market is saying the Fed is going to make a serious policy error by raising rates too quickly,"" said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. ""Everything is working toward a much weaker growth backdrop; that is what the market senses, and the virus is occurring in the backdrop.""
The Treasury yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, seen as an indicator of economic expectations, narrowed to 77.0 basis points, down from almost 130 points in early October.
Recent global economic growth projections from the International Monetary Fund are likely be downgraded due to the emergence of the Omicron variant, said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
Omicron has gained a foothold in many countries worldwide and many governments have restricted travel rules to curb the variant.
""The top issue is still this whole Omicron variant. There are enormous amounts of uncertainty there,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
Oil prices fell and gold prices rose almost 1% as the plunge in U.S. Treasury yields boosted the safe-haven metal's appeal.
MSCI's all-country world index fell 0.81% and the broad STOXX Europe 600 index closed down 0.6%.
Stocks on Wall Street pared heavy, earlier losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.17%, the S&P 500 fell 0.84% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.92%.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.07% to 96.161.
The euro gained 0.06% to $1.1306, while the yen fell 0.36% to $112.7400. 
Crude prices ended little changed after erasing gains of more than $2 a barrel on growing worries that rising coronavirus cases could reduce global oil demand.
Crude prices edged higher after producer group OPEC+ said it could review its policy to hike output at short notice if a rising number of pandemic lockdowns chokes off demand.

451,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 05:25PM ET</span>",Didi shares plunge more than 20% on plan to delist from NYSE,"By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Just five months after its debut, ride-hailing giant Didi Global said it plans to withdraw from the New York Stock Exchange and pursue a Hong Kong listing, a stunning reversal as it bends to Chinese regulators angered by its U.S. IPO.
Reaction from investors was swift: the company's shares fell 22.17%, losing about $8.4 billion in market value. At their Friday close of $6.07, Didi shares have fallen about 57% since their June 30 IPO price.
""Following careful research, the company will immediately start delisting on the New York stock exchange and start preparations for listing in Hong Kong,"" Didi said on its Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account.
Didi did not elaborate but said in a separate statement it would organize a shareholder vote at an appropriate time and ensure its New York-listed stock would be convertible into ""freely tradable shares"" on another globally recognized exchange.
Market participants said the decision ramps up uncertainty for investors in U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies. U.S.-listed shares of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) , Baidu (O:BIDU) and other Chinese firms fell on Friday.
""If you are a money manager and don’t understand what the rules are, it's easier to just sell and move your money where you better understand the rules of the game,” said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird. 
Sources told Reuters last month that Chinese regulators had pressed Didi's top executives to devise a plan to delist from the New York Stock Exchange due to concerns about data security.
Didi's board convened on Thursday and approved the U.S. delisting and HK listing plans, said two sources with knowledge of the matter.
Didi pushed ahead with a $4.4 billion U.S. initial public offering in June despite being asked to put it on hold while Chinese officials reviewed its data practices.
The powerful Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) then quickly ordered app stores to remove 25 of Didi's mobile apps and told the company to stop registering new users, citing national security and the public interest. 
Didi, whose apps, in addition to ride-hailing, offer products such as delivery and financial services, remains under investigation.
Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry, who publishes on Smartkarma, said Didi may need to buy shares at the $14 IPO price to avoid legal issues and at the very least pay more than the current share price.
However, uncertainty remained over what the delisting means for investors. ""There may also be some hope that by doing this, Didi management will improve its regulatory relations, but I am less confident on that,"" Boodry added.
The upending of Didi's New York listing - likely to be a difficult and messy process - underscores the huge clout Chinese regulators possess and their emboldened approach to wielding it. 
Billionaire Jack Ma ran afoul of Chinese authorities after blasting the country's regulatory system, leading to the dramatic scuppering of a mega-IPO for Ant Group last year.
Didi's move will likely further discourage U.S. listings by Chinese firms and could prompt some to reconsider their status as U.S. publicly traded companies.
""Chinese ADRs face increasing regulatory challenges from both U.S. and Chinese authorities. For most companies, it will be like walking on eggshells trying to please both sides. Delisting will only make things simpler,"" said Wang Qi, chief executive of fund manager MegaTrust Investment (HK).
Didi plans to proceed with a Hong Kong listing soon and is not looking at going private, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
It aims to complete a dual primary listing in Hong Kong in the next three months and delist from New York by June 2022, said one of the sources.
The sources were not authorized to talk to the media and declined to be identified. Didi did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, and the CAC has yet to comment on its announcement.
""Not long after the IPO U.S. investors had been trying to sue DiDi for failing to disclose its ongoing talks with the Chinese authorities. This is unlikely to be taken any better,"" said William Mileham, an equity analyst at Mirabaud.
""It appears that DiDi are not waiting to be dual-listed, but could well be delisted from the U.S. before it starts trading on the HK stock exchange."" 
GRAPHIC-Didi's bumpy ride since listing in New York https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-DIDIGLOBAL/dwvkrzdjxpm/chart.png 
HONG KONG HURDLES
Listing in Hong Kong, however, might prove complicated, particularly in a three-month timeframe, given Didi's history of compliance problems and scrutiny over unlicensed vehicles and part-time drivers.
Only 20%-30% of Didi's core ride-hailing business in China is fully compliant with regulations requiring three permits relating to the provision of ride-hailing services, vehicle licensing and drivers' licences, sources have previously said. 
Didi's IPO prospectus said it had obtained ride-hailing permits for cities that together accounted for the majority of its rides. It has not responded to further queries about permits.
Those problems had been Didi's main obstacle to conducting an IPO in Hong Kong earlier and it is unclear whether the bourse will approve it now, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
""I don't think Didi qualifies to be listed anywhere before it ... sets up effective protocols to manage and ensure the drivers' responsibility and benefits,"" said Nan Li, associate professor for finance at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
The Hong Kong bourse does not comment on individual companies, a spokesperson said.

Didi provided 25 million rides a day in China in the first quarter, its IPO prospectus said. Its main shareholders are SoftBank's Vision Fund, with a 21.5% stake, and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, with 12.8%, according to a filing in June by Didi.
Sources have also told Reuters that Didi is preparing to relaunch its apps in China by the year's end in anticipation that Beijing's cybersecurity investigation of the company would be wrapped up by then.

(Reuters) -U.S.-listed shares of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), JD (NASDAQ:JD).com and other Chinese firms fell on Friday as ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc's decision to delist from the New York Stock Exchange added to worries over stricter regulatory scrutiny at home and tense Sino-U.S. relations.
Shares of Didi, which is now pursing a Hong Kong listing after succumbing to pressure from Chinese regulators concerned about data security, plunged 22.2% to end at $6.07. The company had priced its IPO at $14 apiece in June to raise $4.4 billion.
""It will now set a precedent for other U.S.-listed companies, especially those with data concerns,"" said Justin Tang, head of Asian Research at United First Partners, Singapore.
""The crackdown started with Ant's botched IPO. The Chinese government has already shown that it will go beyond what the market has expected. It will be a while before sentiments thaw in relation to Chinese names."" 
Alibaba fell 8.2%, Baidu dropped 7.8% and JD.com shed 7.7%, with investors on edge as Beijing targets sectors ranging from gaming to education. 
Education companies TAL Education and New Oriental Education & Technology Group fell 8.8% and 9.2%, respectively. 
KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF dropped 7%, while e-commerce platform  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) fell 8.2%, mobile game publisher Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) declined 7.1% and live-streaming gaming platforms operator HUYA plunged 12.9%.

Trium Capital EM portfolio manager Peter Kisler said, ""The concern is all the holders of the ADRs could get stuck with Hong Kong shares, and I'm sure there would be some issues about some people not being allowed to hold those - so there could be some forced selling.""
Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday Chinese companies listing on U.S. stock exchanges must disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a government entity, and provide evidence of their auditing inspections.

454,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 04:47PM ET</span>","U.S. dollar net longs jump to highest since mid-June 2019 - CFTC, Reuters data","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators' net long positioning on the U.S. dollar in the latest week soared to its highest level since mid-June 2019, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position was $23.99 billion for the week ended Nov. 30, up from net longs of $22.11 billion in the previous week. U.S. dollar net long positioning rose for a second straight week.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc, as well as Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a broader measure of dollar positioning, which includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian rouble, the greenback posted a net long position of $24.435 billion this week, from $21.964 billion in the prior week.
U.S. dollar net longs increased after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered hawkish testimonies early this week despite the emergence of the highly-transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant.
""Against all the currencies covered in this report, only the yen saw an improvement in its position against the dollar as investors likely turned to its safety amid heightened risk aversion with the spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant,"" said Scotiabank in its report after the release of the CFTC data. 
Net shorts on the Japanese yen declined to 78,866 contracts this week.
In remarks before Congress, Fed's Powell said the risk of inflation had increased and suggested retiring the term ""transitory"" to describe the surge in prices. He also pushed for accelerating the tapering of Fed asset purchases.
The dollar index hit its highest level since July 2020 last week, before ending broadly unchanged this week.
Jane Foley, head of FX strategy, at Rabobank in London, said it would be difficult for the dollar to post further gains.
""Although Powell's hawkish tone this week brought back the risk that the Fed could hike rates twice next year, the market is already priced for this,"" she added.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin futures' net short positions ballooned to 1,691 contracts, after falling as low as 160 contracts last week, the smallest since mid-January 2019.
As with many risk assets, bitcoin has been affected by worries about the Omicron variant.

Since its all-time high of $69,000 hit on Nov. 10, bitcoin has dropped more than 25%, with some market participants suggesting that the world's largest cryptocurrency has entered a bear market.
On Friday, bitcoin hit its lowest level since Oct. 10 and was last down 4.7% at $53,897.

465,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 03:20PM ET</span>",Trump Justice ally Clark clashed with colleagues long before election drama,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A year before Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Bossert Clark tried to help Donald Trump overturn the presidential election results, he sought to delay one of the biggest water pollution cases in U.S. history.
In 2019, a group of prosecutors under Clark’s supervision at DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) wanted to bring criminal and civil charges against North Dakota pipeline operator Summit Midstream (NYSE:SMLP) Partners in the largest-ever inland spill of waste water from oil drilling.
Clark’s push to delay the case prompted fellow prosecutors to take a rare step: They appealed directly to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, the No. 2 official at the department, saying the case should proceed under the Clean Water Act, according to three sources interviewed by Reuters, documents and calendar entries.
In a memo to Rosen, the prosecutors said Clark’s reasoning for wanting to delay the case flew in the face of “decades of case law.” On November 21, 2019, attorneys from the division and the Environmental Protection Agency, including a Trump political appointee, pressed their case in a conference room with Rosen.
“In my years there running very high profile cases, I have never seen an instance where we had to go above and around the assistant attorney general,” said Tom Lorenzen, a former 16-year department veteran who was not involved in the case.
Clark contended the DOJ should wait for the Supreme Court to rule in a water pollution case his colleagues saw as unrelated to Summit. He also sought other remedies, such as using state laws or a different federal statute that would preclude civil penalties or felony charges. “I may still wish to take the position that I can properly use my prosecutorial discretion to proceed using a different set of tools,” he wrote Rosen.
Outnumbered, Clark acquiesced. The case proceeded, leading to $36.3 million in criminal and civil penalties against Summit https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/summit-midstream-partners-pleads-guilty-largest-us-inland-spill-oil-drilling-2021-09-22, which pleaded guilty in September 2021.
Clark did not reply to multiple interview requests and written questions, and neither he nor his attorney answered questions from Reuters about this incident or his Justice Department tenure.
Before his failed bid https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-give-new-details-trumps-bid-overturn-election-2021-10-07 to oust Rosen as acting attorney general so he could ascend to that role and launch investigations to help bolster Trump’s bogus election fraud claims, Clark had made a name for himself at DOJ for actions that sometimes veered from those of his colleagues.
The Justice Department’s Inspector General is investigating https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-justice/watchdog-to-probe-if-justice-dept-officials-improperly-tried-to-alter-2020-election-idUSKBN29U21E Clark’s election season actions, and the D.C. Office of Disciplinary Counsel is examining his conduct after the 2020 presidential election, said a source familiar with the matter.
On November 5, Clark declined to testify https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ex-us-justice-official-declines-testify-about-his-advice-trump-election-2021-11-05 before the U.S. House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, saying his conversations with Trump are shielded by executive privilege. The committee voted to recommend contempt charges https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-committee-seeks-contempt-charge-trump-era-justice-dept-official-2021-12-02 on Dec 1.
Clark is now tentatively slated to appear before the panel Saturday, where he is expected to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, which could help stave off a contempt finding. A contempt finding by a majority of the U.S. House would leave it to the Justice Department to decide whether to charge a former staffer.
Though Clark’s election plotting with Trump garnered headlines, less attention has been paid to his 2-plus-year tenure, during which he tried to use the environmental office to take actions including a failed bid to punish leftwing protesters in Portland after George Floyd’s murder.
BOOKISH AND CONFIDENT
Clark was no stranger to the Environment and Natural Resources Division when Trump nominated him as assistant attorney general in 2017. During the George W. Bush administration, he was a deputy in the division’s appellate section, developing a reputation as a bookish and self-confident lawyer eager to argue cases in every appellate court in the country.
Before his nomination, Clark worked with Rosen at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. He represented BP (NYSE:BP) after the Deepwater Horizon spill and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in its lawsuit challenging the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon emissions. In private practice, Clark questioned the science behind climate change, a position that led the Senate to delay confirming him as assistant attorney general until October 2018.
At the DOJ, Clark reveled in debating colleagues as if in a courtroom. On his desk, he kept a copy of a book by conservative legal scholar Philip Hamburger arguing that federal agencies are in essence a “deep state.”
Paul Salamanca, one of his former deputies, said Clark was so attentive to detail they once argued over using an Oxford comma. “There were times when Jeff and I really disagreed,” said Salamanca, who described Clark as both a friend and “formidable” attorney. “Once he reaches a conclusion – it's not that he won't ever change his mind – it’s that you have to work hard at it.”
Sam Sankar, a former DOJ trial attorney now with the environmental advocacy group EarthJustice, said the Justice Department should “push back against political expediency.” Clark, he contended, “viewed it in the completely opposite way.”
In late 2018 and early 2019, the department was strategizing over how to defend the government from a Vietnam War veteran who sued over the denial of disability benefits.
The case, Kisor v. Wilkie, turned on a legal doctrine known as “Auer Deference” – a Supreme Court precedent that gives leeway to federal agencies to interpret ambiguities in their regulations. The U.S. often cites Auer Deference as a defense when it gets sued over its rules, but many conservatives believe it grants the government too much power.
Clark jumped into the fray, penning a memo urging the Solicitor General to argue that Auer Deference should be overturned, six sources said. He cited a Biblical reference from Philippians, “fear and trembling,” in one memo, and chided the Civil Division in another for not forcefully fighting to overturn Auer because it likes “winning.”
In the end, then-Solicitor General Noel Francisco sided with the Civil Division. Francisco did not respond to a request for comment.
MONSANTO CASE
A few months after that dust-up, Clark sparred with the U.S. Attorney’s office in Los Angeles, which was investigating  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for its use of a banned pesticide on research crops at its Maui facility, allegedly exposing workers to the toxic chemical.
Prosecutors wanted to charge Monsanto with a felony, said two people familiar with the matter, prompting the company’s defense counsel to file a protest with then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in an effort to prevent charges.
Although ENRD was not involved in the case, Clark began laying the groundwork to kill it, the sources said. During a March 15, 2019 meeting with prosecutors and Rosenstein, Clark described Monsanto as a great company with a great track record, one source said.
Rosenstein sided with Clark, and ordered the prosecutors not to pursue felony charges. Rosenstein declined to comment.
Instead, on November 21, 2019 – the same day Clark's staff went over his head to convince Rosen to pursue the Summit case – Monsanto agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. Through a spokesperson, an attorney for Monsanto declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in California declined to comment.
PORTLAND FOCUS
In the summer of 2020, Portland erupted in 100 days https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-protests-portland-100days/federal-troops-and-street-battles-portland-protests-near-100-days-idUSKBN25V2W3 of protests after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, with agitators throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at the federal courthouse.
The Justice Department sought to quell the protests with extra security and charges against those who assaulted police or damaged federal property.
There was no obvious role for ENRD to play. Clark was determined to find one, according to memos he wrote to colleagues and sources familiar with the matter.
At first he explored bringing civil action against Portland to hold it accountable for damage to federal property, as part of a broader effort under then-Attorney General William Barr to explore ways to compel the city to offer more protection. But he could not find a workable statute, according to a July 14, 2020 memo Clark wrote to Barr. When that legal path failed, Clark set his sights on the protesters, a move that Barr was unaware he was pursuing, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Clark established the “ENRD Trespass Team” and tasked lawyers to find ways to use trespass or nuisance laws to go after the protesters with civil actions, records and interviews show.
The federal courthouse “is under constant nightly threat of vandalism or destruction because of the persistent presence of lawless individuals,” Clark wrote in a July 24 memo to prosecutors assigned to the Trespass Team. Team members “will be expected to work aggressively” to protect the courthouse and “restore order” in Portland.
The prosecutors assigned to the team were flummoxed, say two sources. While ENRD enforces statutes to protect federal land, they said, trying to flex its muscles in Portland seemed far from the division’s mission.
Clark persisted. He demanded the names of those arrested, according to memos and one source familiar with the matter, and called the U.S. Attorney in Portland to pitch his ideas, department records show.
Ultimately, former Oregon U.S. Attorney Billy Williams pushed back. Clark's vision of filing trespass and nuisance claims against protesters never materialized.

“I never wanted to take an action that didn’t make any sense to me,” said Williams, who said he was surprised to hear from the assistant attorney general of ENRD about Portland. “I thought it would only exacerbate the tension going on.”
Six months later, when throngs of Trump supporters desecrated the U.S. Capitol, Clark did not broach the idea of reinstating the Trespass Team.

LIMA (Reuters) -MMG Ltd's Las Bambas copper mine in Peru will shut down copper production by mid-December because of a road blockade, it said on Friday, as executives urged the government to build a freight rail link to avoid future disruption. 
""The freight rail has huge social acceptance,"" Carlos Castro, Las Bambas head of corporate affairs, said in an interview with Reuters. 
Las Bambas is one of Peru's largest copper mines, but its operations have been disrupted by close to 400 days since it began operations in 2016, executives said. 
At issue is a dirt road that Las Bambas uses to transport the copper from its mine to a sea port. Communities along the road have opposed this method of transportation, alleging environmental and social concerns. Las Bambas last faced a production shutdown threat in October https://www.reuters.com/article/peru-mining-idUSL1N2RN2VT. 
Executives said in the interview that the dirt road was not sustainable into the future, that it was the government's responsibility to pave the route in the medium term and that in the long term, a separate freight train link would be the best solution. 
Peru's administration under socialist Pedro Castillo has endorsed the train, but the government's cost-estimate is significant at $9.2 billion, and it would only begin operations in 2028 at the earliest. 
The ministry of energy and mines said in a statement that the government had not been informed about the potential shutdown and that it hoped the company and ""would continue working for the benefit of (surrounding) communities"".
Las Bambas originally intended to transport its copper through an underground mineral pipeline, but that plan was cancelled when the mining project was sold to Chinese miner MMG. 
Executives said a mineral pipeline no longer made sense.
""From the point of view of social profitability, it is unacceptable,"" Castro said. ""What local families tell us is that a mineral pipeline would negatively affect the area, because all the businesses associated with (copper) transport would cease to exist."" 
The road is blocked by residents of the Chumbivilcas province, who are negotiating contracts for locals to be hired as drivers for the mine. 
The Hong Kong-listed company said that no resolution was reached at a meeting on Nov. 30 between the Peruvian government and the community because of what the company views as ""excessive commercial demands"".
In July, Las Bambas flagged that production in 2021 was expected in the low end of its 310,00-330,000 tonnes forecast.

Las Bambas produces 400,000 tonnes of copper a year, or about 2% of the world's copper. 
Stockpiles on the site have increased to around 50,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Omicron-fuelled market swings appear to have made November the worst month for global hedge fund performance since the virus first shut down economies at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hedge funds are down an estimated 1.6% to 2% in November, according to early data from industry research firm PivotalPath, their worst monthly performance since March 2020. 
The potential losses are a setback in what has so far been a steady year for performance. The average hedge fund is up 11.4% in the first 10 months of 2021, data from HedgeFund Research (HFR) showed. That compares to 11.8% last year and 10.5% in 2019.
The losses are “quite widespread"", said Robert Sears, chief investment officer of London-based Capital Generation Partners, which invests in hedge funds. ""A few of our managers got a little bit of positive performance but I think, in aggregate, it's going to be down."" 
The S&P 500 fell 3.9% from its record high in November as Omicron worries hit stocks in the month’s final days, and notched a nearly 1% loss for the month as a whole. Some areas of the market, however, were harder hit, with the S&P’s energy sector losing 6.2% last month and financials losing 5.9%. 
November also saw volatility rise across asset classes, with uncertainty over Federal Reserve monetary policy driving swings in bond and currency markets, as well as stocks.
The market swings wrongfooted some equity-focused funds, which were hit by losses in bearish bets against stocks that unexpectedly rebounded. 
Jean Baptiste Berthon, senior strategist at Paris-based Lyxor Asset Management, which invests in hedge funds, said European and U.S. long-short strategies lost around 1.5% to 2% between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1. 
Shares of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), for example, which Sears said some hedge funds had bet against, jumped 30% between Nov. 18 and Nov. 30. Prior to Nov. 18, short interest in Moderna amounted to 14.4 million shares, or 4.1% of the float, according to data from S3 Partners. 
Computer-driven trend-following hedge funds, meanwhile, suffered a ""significant"" performance drop of 4% to 5% between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, with losses in fixed income, commodities and equities, creating a ""perfect storm"", said Berthon. 
So-called 'macro' hedge funds, which bet on macroeconomic trends, lost closer to 2%, mainly from bond positioning, while merger-arbitrage funds, which make calls on deals, were marginally up, he added. 

Some hedge funds are likely to pull back on risk this month, in an effort to preserve returns in what has for many been a solid year, Berthon said. 
""We're now three weeks before the end of the year, so it's unlikely we'll see funds trying to be heroes and trying to re-instate major play to capture the rebound,"" he said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Friday, after data showed job gains fell well short of estimates in November at time when concerns about the impact of Omicron on economic growth continue to dominate investor sentiment.  
The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.76%, or 261 points, the Nasdaq fell 2.5%.
“It was a colossal miss,” Darren Schuringa, CEO of ASYMmetric ETFs said in an interview with Investing.com on Friday, referring to weaker-than-expected job gains in November. “When I look at these numbers now, it is concerning for me from an economic strength standpoint.”
Nonfarm payrolls increased 210,000 in November, well below economists’ expectations for 550,000 new jobs.
Still, a deeper dive into the monthly jobs report pointed to signs of the strength in the labor market. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.2% as the labor force participation rate rose 0.2% to 61.8% last month.  
While the weakness in hiring “could complicate the discussion at the Federal Reserve … [Fed] officials seem to be leaning toward faster monetary policy normalization in response to high inflation,” Desjardins said in a note.
Technology stocks were among the hardest hit, with Microsoft leading the selloff in big tech.
Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell nearly 3%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were down 2%.
Chip stocks also exacerbated the selling in the broader tech as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) slipped more than 5% after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block its proposed $40 billion takeover of chipmaker ARM Holdings (LON:ARM), citing competition concerns.
“[W]e see the FTC's decision to sue to block the deal as almost certainly ending the chances of any acquisition,” Wedbush said in a note.
DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), meanwhile, plunged 40% after its softer fourth-quarter guidance suggested the e-signature company is unlikely to sustain its pandemic-fueled growth.
In other news, Peloton Interactive  (NASDAQ:PTON) gave up earlier gains and followed the market lower despite Deustche Bank issuing a buy rating on the stock amid expectations that a hybrid approach to fitness – at home and at the gym – is a possibility.
“[W]e think the hybrid work model extends to fitness, too, and that PTON [Peloton] has plenty of momentum to regain operationally,” Deutsche Bank said in a note.
Financials, meanwhile, were pushed lower by a slump in banks as the Treasury yields fell sharply, with the 10-year yield falling below 1.4%.
SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB), First Republic (NYSE:FRC), Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) were among the hardest hit regional banks as falling yields tend to keep a lid on net interest income generated by banks.
The slump in Treasury yields come as investors flag concerns about the outlook for the economy as the Fed appears ready to step up monetary policy tightening at a time when the new omicron variant could threaten growth.
Yet, if the new variant turns out to be less impactful than feared and supply chain woes continue to ease, the broader market could resume its trend higher. 
""If the borders remain open, and supply chain [problems] continue to unravel, then that would support the markets moving higher from here,"" Schuringa said."

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc has asked a U.S. court to affirm its recent victory in an arbitration with a former engineer who claimed the automaker fired and defamed her for raising concerns about defective floormats and contracting practices.
In a petition filed in San Francisco federal court on Thursday, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said an arbitrator in a Nov. 3 decision rejected Cristina Balan's claims that the company falsely accused her of criminal conduct in response to a 2017 Huffington Post article about her firing. 
In March, a California-based appeals court ruled that Balan was required to arbitrate the defamation claims because they were directly related to her employment with Tesla. 
The company on Thursday asked the court to confirm the arbitrator's decision, which opens the door for Balan to challenge it.
Balan said in an email on Friday that she would seek to vacate the arbitration award ""due to fraud, corruption, bias ... and manifest disregard for the law.""
In a 2019 lawsuit, Balan said she was fired shortly after sending an email to Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk claiming contracts were being awarded based on friendships regardless of price or quality.
Balan had also raised concerns about floormats in Tesla's Model S curling up under the pedals.

In a statement provided to the Huffington Post about Balan's case, Tesla claimed she was fired for using company time to work on a personal project and illegally recording conversations with colleagues.
Tesla had lauded Balan's work prior to her firing, including crediting her with perfecting a design for a battery pack, according to court filings.

472,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>",Analysis: UK North Sea's oil and gas future darkens after Shell's Cambo exit,"By Shadia Nasralla and Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Up until a few days ago, the leadership of British North Sea producer Siccar Point was negotiating the sale of a stake in the promising Cambo oil development to another private equity-backed company, NEO, sources told Reuters.
But on Thursday Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Siccar Point's partner in the project, pulled its support for Cambo amid a wider public debate about the future of fossil fuels development in the North Sea. The deal with NEO, as well as the future of the 1.9 billion pound ($2.51 billion) project, were thrown into disarray, according to three industry sources.
Shell's decision sends a negative signal to other companies, investors and bankers who are thinking about putting money into the ageing basin, including by buying assets from majors, industry sources told Reuters.
The withdrawal from Cambo came several weeks after a British regulator rejected Shell's plans to develop another North Sea gasfield, Jackdaw, whose future also remains in doubt unless Shell comes up with a revised plan that passes muster.
In its announcement on Thursday, Shell said Cambo was not economically viable. But company sources said the decision was also influenced by climate protests against developing new oil and gas resources in the North Sea, as well as public opposition to Cambo by Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
""It's an economic decision but that's not to say that the external environment doesn't impact the decision. It's about business risk,"" one Shell source said.
Siccar Point and Shell have delayed the decision on whether to develop Cambo several times in recent years, most recently due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, Siccar Point had been close to a deal with NEO, sources close to the matter said, although it was unclear what size stake was being discussed or what the value of the deal would have been.
NEO declined to comment. Siccar Point declined to comment when asked about talks with NEO.
'TOXIC' CLIMATE
Oil companies including Shell and BP (NYSE:BP) have been major investors in the North Sea for decades. Despite scaling back their presence in the basin in recent years, they still consider it as central to their future in oil and gas as well as offshore wind operations.
While hosting the COP26 climate summit last month, Britain decided not to join an alliance of countries vowing to stop new oil and gas projects on their territory.
Growing pressure from investors, governments and climate activists, however, has led oil majors to scale back spending on oil and gas projects and increase investments in renewable energy in order to slash greenhouse gas emissions.
And if the UK government fails to make clear its support for investment in the sector after Shell's move, output from the mature North Sea oil and gas basin could fall more rapidly than previously expected, industry sources told Reuters.
""At the moment it's toxic,"" said one North Sea oil and gas source, speaking about how Shell's decision has impacted the investment climate in the British North Sea.
Oil and gas fields require regular investment in drilling new wells and fields in order to offset the natural depletion in other fields. The more mature the fields, the more investment is needed.
British oil and gas production at about 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), or about 1% of global oil demand, has fallen from a peak of around 4.4 million boe/d in 1999.
While investments in wells near existing fields are expected to continue, companies will now hesitate before making decisions on big capital projects.
""For the UK North Sea it is a bit depressing,"" said one source.
SHELL'S EXIT WELCOMED
Climate campaigners and some investors welcomed Shell's exit from Cambo, after activists pointed to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) saying that no new oil and gas projects should be developed in order to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
Siccar Point and some politicians have said that halting new oil and gas development in the North Sea could leave Britain more reliant on higher-emissions imported fuel.
A spokesperson for the government said 75% of the UK’s primary energy demand comes from oil and gas at present and the decision on Cambo ""is a commercial decision that has been taken independently by Shell.""
Meanwhile, British courts have increasingly become an arena for climate activists trying to force an end to oil and gas production in Britain.
A Scottish court handed BP a win over Greenpeace in October in relation to a North Sea oilfield.But another case against the government and its Oil and Gas Authority is getting a judicial hearing at a High Court in London starting on Dec. 8 to determine whether tax breaks for oil and gas producers are legal. 
Britain's treasury received around 248 million pounds ($329 million) from oil and gas production in the tax year 2020/21, a drop of 71% on the previous year, according to official data, due to a plunge in oil and gas prices during the pandemic.
This compares with 400 million pounds which the government paid oil and gas producers in 2016/17 due to tax arrangements when the oil price is low.

These stocks are well-positioned to withstand market fluctuations and deliver stable returns. Let’s discuss.Although solid third-quarter earnings, declining jobless claims, and rising consumer spending drove the markets to fresh highs last month, the emergence of a highly infectious new COVID-19 variant, high inflation, geopolitical tensions, supply chain constraints, and the Federal Reserve’s decision to taper its bond purchasing have been fostering worrisome market volatility of late. Because these factors are not likely to dissipate soon, betting on mega-cap stocks with exceptional growth potential and strong fundamentals could be an ideal strategy to hedge one’s investment portfolio against the expected market fluctuations.
Mega-cap stocks, which possess a market capitalization of $200 billion or more, have the potential to dodge short-term fluctuations and deliver stable returns. Also, favorable policies to encourage domestic production and ongoing efforts to address supply chain issues further enhance mega-cap stocks’ growth prospects.
Prominent mega-cap players UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Walmart Inc. (WMT), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), and Broadcom Inc.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Star stock picker Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF tumbled more than 7% and hit its lowest level since November 2020 on Friday as bets on a more aggressive Federal Reserve pushed investors to sell the high-growth, high-valuation stocks that rallied during the early stages of the pandemic.
The declines in ARK's portfolio were widespread, with nine out of its 10 top holdings falling as a selloff in technology stocks pushed the benchmark S&P 500 down 1.3%. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, its largest holding, shed nearly 4%, while Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc, its second-largest holding, dropped 5.2%.
ARK, whose outsized holding of so-called stay at home stocks helped it outperform all other U.S. equity funds last year, is down 25% over the last month. Those declines have come as investors increasingly anticipate that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates in the year ahead, which would weigh on growth stocks by discounting their future cash flows.
Friday’s declines may have been bolstered by a U.S. employment report showing that the U.S. economy added 210,000 jobs last month, pushing the unemployment rate to a 21-month low of 4.2%.
""Ultimately the lower unemployment rate could help build confidence that the economic growth we've been seeing will continue regardless of what happens with Omicron, and that will push investors out into small-caps and cyclicals instead of the stay at home and technology trades,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the central bank is open to accelerating the pace of its tapering program, essentially removing its support of the economy faster than it originally anticipated.
Friday's declines pushed the ARK Innovation fund down 24.5% for the year to date, well behind the roughly 20% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 over the same time. 

 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc, for instance, dropped 4.1% Friday, leaving it down nearly 40% for the year to date, while  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) fell 1.4%, leaving it down 28.3% for the year to date.

They are lesser-known names that have solid growth potential. Read on.The economy has been recovering gradually with increased COVID-19 vaccinations being administered. But investors did not react positively to the news of a new coronavirus variant named omicron, which was found first in South Africa, and the markets have remained volatile throughout the week. Also, record-high inflation data for October, reported last month, did little to improve market sentiment.
However, initial reports suggest that the fears related to the omicron coronavirus variant may have been exaggerated; the variant has so far been found to cause mild illness.

However, not all stocks in the sector are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. So, we think it could be wise to avoid EV stocks QuantumScape (QS), Blink Charging (BLNK), and EVgo (EVGO) because their ratings have been recently downgraded, and they have bleak growth prospects. Let’s discuss.The demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and the infrastructure needed to keep them running has grown significantly over the past few years. This can be attributed primarily to increasing concerns about climate change and supportive government policies. According to a recent survey by KPMG, automotive executives think more than half of their sales will be EVs by 2030, in line with U.S. President Biden’s EV sales goal.
However, according to an evadoption report, the number of internal combustion engine (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) vehicles on the road is expected to increase by 20 million this decade. And even though the EV industry is expected to grow significantly, EVs are still likely to be a small percentage of vehicles in operation. So, as the EV industry grows, all companies in the sector may not benefit equally due to sector overcrowding.
EV-related stocks QuantumScape Corporation (QS), Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ:BLNK), and EVgo, Inc. (EVGO) look overvalued at the current price level, given their companies' bleak growth prospects. Also, analysts have recently downgraded them. So, we think it could be wise to avoid these stocks now.

NEW YORK(Reuters) - While news of the Omicron coronavirus variant threatens to derail U.S. companies' return-to-office-plans, employers trying to get workers back into offices said they are encountering a different, unforeseen challenge: keeping the lights on.
The disruptions to the global supply chain caused by factory shutdowns in Asia, congestion at U.S. ports and a nationwide labor shortage have led to widely publicized microchip and building materials shortages. Now these issues are causing shortages in everyday office supplies, everything from printer ink and toner to paper to lightbulbs. 
When anthropology professor Sara Becker returned to her office at the University of California, Riverside, in early November, she noticed several bulbs had burned out over the eight months she'd worked remotely. An assistant in her department contacted the facilities unit for replacements, and Becker was asked what percentage of lightbulbs in her office were out.
""I'm an anthropologist not a mathematician!"" Becker joked on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Becker said in an email interview that, instead of counting bulbs, she sent photos of her darkened office to the facilities department, which, university spokesman John Warren said, is short on lighting materials and lamps.
For offices and workers, these supply issues - which can trickle down to cause workplace headaches - are only adding to the obstacles companies face in getting people back to the office. 
Variants of the coronavirus, such as Delta, have already forced companies to push back the dates when they hoped most employees would begin to return to offices. It is possible the Omicron variant, first detected in the United States on Wednesday, will delay openings further. 
Now, just securing general lighting supplies is taking eight to 13 weeks longer than normal, said Cheryl Carron, whose duties include heading facilities management for global commercial real estate company Jones Lang LaSalle.
""It's a significant challenge as we look at how we bring people back to work,"" Carron said in an interview. ""It's a real critical need and one we take for granted.""
Companies across the globe have sounded the alarm on supply issues, which have boosted prices on raw materials from chemicals to steel. The concern dominated the last earnings season, with mentions of the issue by chief executives jumping 412%. 
U.S. Customs data showed imports of glass bulbs for use in incandescent lamps fell 25% from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the first quarter this year, a period when the supply-chain issues first hit supplies. Imports have since rebounded but are still below pre-pandemic levels. The United States gets most of its incandescent bulbs from Taiwan.
In addition to lightbulbs, a source at one of the big retail banks, speaking on condition of anonymity, said replacement parts for heating and air-conditioning units across its branch network were in short supply. 
In a recent earnings call, ODP Corp Chief Executive Gerry Smith, whose company owns the  Office Depot  (NASDAQ:ODP) and OfficeMax superstore chains, said the company anticipates a shortage in printer ink and toner until early next year. And one Midwestern law firm asked staff in an email last month to cut back on printing because they are short on paper, according to a copy of the email seen by Reuters. The law firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Peter Lorenz, director of facilities and office operations at law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, said they also experienced paper shortages and delays in obtaining lightbulbs at the firm's New York City office, a 360,000-square-foot (33,445-square-meter) space that used to be occupied by about 500 employees before the pandemic. 
Supplies have been ramping back up since mid-October, Lorenz said, as employees began returning to the office as part of a hybrid work model, in which they split time between that workplace and working remotely.
""I think a lot of the suppliers have sort of bulked up so that they have a pretty good inventory of what we need,"" he said in a phone interview. 

If there is a silver lining to be found in this facilities management headache, Jones Lang LaSalle's Carron said, it is in the lessons that building managers learned from last year's pandemic-triggered shortages.
""They've got toilet paper,"" she joked.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 12:18PM ET</span>","Don't be overly generous with bonuses, EU watchdog tells banks","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks in the European Union have swelled their capital buffers and boosted profitability over the past year, but they must not be ""overly generous"" in paying bonuses and dividends given the risk of abrupt market pullbacks, the bloc's banking watchdog said on Friday.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) said in its annual risk assessment report that it was also monitoring the exposure of banks to clearing houses in London and that lenders should examine if they are allocating enough capital to cover environment, social and governance (ESG) risks.
""Given the COVID-19-related uncertainties, banks should maintain prudent capital distribution policies,"" EBA said in a statement.
EU regulators curbed bank payouts last year as they assessed the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on the economy but lenders are now catching up.
While aggregate capital levels are good, not all banks are well above minimum requirements, with pandemic fallout cushioned by central bank funding, which has increased significantly in importance for lenders, EBA said.
""Even though supervisory recommendations on capital distribution have expired, banks should not pursue overly generous dividend and share buy-back policies,"" EBA said.
Regulators and supervisors should provide clarity on how quickly banks should replenish any buffers that were tapped during the pandemic, EBA said.
The watchdog also published its ""transparency exercise"" for the year, which provides 10,000 data points on 120 banks in the bloc for analysts to number crunch and make comparisons.
EBA said it was also monitoring the concentration risk from significant exposures that EU banks have to clearing houses in London, equivalent to 9.5% of the total amount of over-the-counter derivatives cleared globally in the second half of last year.

The bloc has said it will extend temporary permission for banks to continue clearing derivatives in London beyond next June and set out incentives for shifting clearing to the EU.
Britain's departure from the bloc a year ago has increased legal uncertainty, with EU dependence on UK rules for handling clearers in trouble also rising, EBA said.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co expects to be the world's second largest electric vehicle manufacturer within two years, with annual production capacity of nearly 600,000, a top company executive said Friday.
The automaker's optimism stems from increasing demand for its next new EV, the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup, with retail reservations approaching 200,000, Lisa Drake, chief operating officer of Ford North America, said.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Ford likely would be vying with Stellantis for third place in the EV race by 2025, behind Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group, based on production forecast data provided by AutoForecast Solutions.
Speaking at an investor conference, Drake said Ford is working to vertically integrate more EV components, including power electronics and e-drives, at existing facilities that build parts for combustion vehicles - a modern take on founder Henry Ford's pioneering work in building many of his own components.
""We haven't used 'vertical integration' in this industry in a long time,"" Drake said, but ""you're going to hear it a lot more"" as Ford and other automakers transition from combustion to electric vehicles.
She said Ford working with five global battery suppliers to manufacture and help develop battery cells for its future EVs, aiming to build 240 gigawatt-hours of production capacity globally by 2030. Those suppliers include SK On, LG Energy Solution, CATL, BYD and Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY).
Ford expects to reduce EV battery cell cost to $80 per kilowatt-hour at the pack level ""well before the end of the decade,"" Drake said.

The automaker is looking at different cell chemistries, including cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate, and cell-to-pack structural batteries to help reduce costs.
Ford and BMW are working with Colorado-based startup Solid Power on developing solid state batteries, which Drake said should be commercialized ""well before the end of the decade.""

485,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>","California adopts programs to ensure power supplies in 2022, 2023","By Scott DiSavino
(Reuters) - California utility regulators took several steps to help keep the lights on during summer in 2022 and 2023 after extreme heatwaves this year baked the U.S. West Coast and forced the state's grid operator to impose rotating outages last year.
The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on Thursday approved steps to boost supplies of power generation and encourage consumers to reduce demand, especially when extreme weather stresses the grid.
The actions were part of the CPUC's ongoing efforts to respond to Governor Gavin Newsom’s July 2021 Emergency Proclamation urging all state energy agencies to ensure there is adequate electricity to meet demand.
A CPUC analysis found that a range of 2,000 to 3,000 megawatts (MW) of new supply- and demand-side resources will help address grid reliability in the most extreme circumstances in 2022 and 2023.
One megawatt can power about 200 homes on a hot summer day.
Some of the CPUC's decisions will allow more consumers to sign up for programs that pay them to reduce power use and sell power from electric cars when the grid is stressed.
The CPUC also approved new rate pilot programs to test whether consumers would shift use of agricultural water pumps and car chargers to off-peak evening hours when power demand and prices are lower.
On the supply side, the CPUC ordered utility units of PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Corp, Edison International (NYSE:EIX) and  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE) to acquire a total of 2,000-3,000 MW of additional supply and demand-side resources for the summers of 2022 and 2023.

Some of those supply-side resources could come from natural gas-fired power plants.
After years of restricting the growth of fossil fuel infrastructure, California has increasingly looked to gas for power generation this year after drought and wildfires left it with few other options to keep the lights on.

486,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 11:42AM ET</span>",Juventus say prosecutors looking into terms of Ronaldo sale,"By Elvira Pollina and Emilio Parodi
MILAN (Reuters) -Juventus said Italian prosecutors had ordered a new search of its offices under an investigation into the Serie A club's financial accounting and were also examining the terms of the sale of star player Cristiano Ronaldo to Manchester United.
Publishing a supplement to an investor document for a share issue on Thursday, Juventus reiterated that it had always acted in compliance with existing laws and it was fully collaborating with authorities.
Turin prosecutors said last week they were investigating the club and some of its senior managers, including Chairman Andrea Agnelli and Vice President Pavel Nedved, in a case centred around player transfers.
The prosecutors said they were checking whether Turin-based Juventus provided false communications to investors and issued invoices for transactions that never took place.
Italian financial police searched the club's offices last week to seize documents relating to player transfers between 2019 and 2021. 
The latest search mentioned in the investor document was carried out on Thursday, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Hit hard by the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, Juventus are seeking to raise 400 million euros in cash by selling new shares to cut debt and repair its finances. 
In the supplement to the cash call prospectus, Juventus said prosecutors were also looking at its financial statements for the first half of 2021 in relation to Ronaldo's sale.
In August, Juventus reached an agreement to sell the Portuguese player to Manchester United for 23 million euros ($26 million), including 8 million euros linked to the achievement of specific performance objectives.
Juventus said at the time the deal entailed a 14 million euro hit on its results for the 2020/21 financial year, contributing to a record-high loss of 210 million euros.
A judicial source said prosecutors were checking the accuracy of figures in the club's financial statement relating to the transaction after a wiretapped conversation between club officials mentioned a document that called into question the fairness of the accounting.
Lawyers for Juventus and its managers said the new search did not reflect new charges being investigated, adding the warrant mentioned a document which had yet to be found.
The club said in the supplement to the share issue document that it did not believe the investigation and the searches constituted a ""material adverse change"" under a contractual clause that would allow the banking consortium guaranteeing the cash call to withdraw its commitment.
Juventus, one of 12 leading European clubs that made a failed attempt to set up a breakaway European Super League in April to beef up their finances, is controlled by Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family. 
Exor has committed to subscribing to the cash call to keep its 63.8% stake.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan, Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) e UniCredit CIB are the offer's joint global coordinators. 

Juventus shares were down 0.8% by 1531 GMT on Friday against a flat Italian all-share index.

Investing.com – Ollie's Bargain stock (NASDAQ:OLLI) fell 20% in Friday’s trading as supply chain issues took a toll on the discount retailer’s third-quarter sales and profits, both falling short of expectations.
The discount retailer blamed shipping delays of imported seasonal and other products and subsequent backlogs in its distribution centers for the 7.5% fall in in net sales to around $383.5 million in the quarter ended October 30. Comparable stores sales fell around 15%, the erosion being partially offset by addition of new stores. Gross margins also fell due to increased supply chain costs, the result of higher import and trucking costs and, to a lesser extent, higher wage rates in the distribution centers.
Fatter wages and higher selling expenses associated with 41 net additional stores fueled the rise in selling, general and administrative expenses.
With less than two months to go for the end of the company’s financial year, the company restored giving annual guidance, a practice it had dropped during the pandemic.  
Total net sales for the year are seen between $1.76 billion and $1.77 billion, with comparable store sales likely to rise 3.5% to 4%.
Adjusted profit per share was 34 cents, just over half of 65 cents in the third quarter of last year.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's government - subject to sanctions by the United States and others - is increasingly paying providers in U.S. dollars as it seeks to reduce spending in its bolivar currency to control inflation, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
State oil company PDVSA, government entities and publicly-owned companies this year have started paying a portion of invoices using dollars deposited in foreign currency accounts at some local banks, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information.
Though Venezuela's government has paid some contractors in cash with euros before, it has not previously made dollar transfers on the scale it is now. The payments are an effort to stabilize the exchange rate and prices, the sources said.
Banks are allowed by the government to offer accounts in dollars but Washington's sanctions prevent international transfers into and out of Venezuela. Some local banks have maintained intermediary relationships with global partners.
Venezuela has grappled with hyperinflation for four years as the central bank printed money to finance the budget deficit. 
Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The central bank and PDVSA also did not respond to requests for comment. 
The growing transactions show that, despite the hostility between Washington and President Nicolas Maduro's government, the United States has little recourse to stop Venezuela from using dollars to stabilize its economy.
The U.S. Treasury declined to comment.
The sources said the payments involve four Venezuelan banks, though they declined to name them or the providers receiving payment. 
""Several service-providers receive payments in dollars in their local bank accounts and those funds are then used to pay other providers and even to pay part of their workers' salaries,"" one of the sources said.
The sources could not estimate the total quantity of dollar payments made by the government, but said some payments totaled $5,000 or more.
Economist Tamara Herrera, director of the consultancy Sintesis Financiera, said those receiving the payments, and the local banks, would not be exposed to U.S. legal repercussions because they are generally small local firms.
Some of the dollars used in payments come from foreign sales of crude oil, all three sources said, though none had details of how much income comes into Venezuela from oil sales. 
Venezuela's government has increasing amounts of dollars at its disposal because of rising crude production. Crude exports in November were 572,567 barrels per day, according to documents seen by Reuters.
However, the central bank has not published figures about the trade balance since May 2019.

Evergrande, once China's top-selling developer, is grappling with more than $300 billion in liabilities, fuelling fears of a potential collapse that could send shockwaves through the country's property sector and beyond.
On Friday, the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange it had received a demand from creditors to pay about $260 million. It is already late paying $82.5 million in coupons due on Nov. 6.
""In light of the current liquidity status ... there is no guarantee that the group will have sufficient funds to continue to perform its financial obligations,"" Evergrande said, adding that creditors may demand accelerated repayment if it does not.
That prompted the government of Guangdong, where the company is based, to summon Evergrande Chairman Hui Ka Yan. 
The provincial government said in a statement it would - at Evergrande's request - send a working group to the company to oversee risk management, strengthen internal controls and maintain normal operations.
The Guangdong authorities were not the only government entity to wade into the Evergrande issue on Friday.
In a series of apparently coordinated statements late in the evening, China's central bank, banking and insurance regulator and its securities regulator sought to reassure the market that any risks to the broader property sector could be contained.
""Evergrande's problem was mainly caused by its own mismanagement and break-neck expansion,"" the People's Bank of China said. 
Short-term risks caused by a single real estate firm will not undermine market fundraising in the medium and long term, it said, adding that housing sales, land purchases and financing ""have already returned to normal in China.""
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said the Evergrande issue would not affect the industry's normal operations and it would increase support for guaranteed rental housing.

It added that it believed domestic and overseas regulators would deal with Evergrande-related issues fairly, while the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said any fallout for the capital market was ""controllable"" and it would maintain support for property developers' funding needs. 
In its filing, Evergrande said it intended to actively engage with creditors to come up with a ""viable restructuring plan"" to deal with its offshore debts.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 11:32AM ET</span>","Global tax deal leaves billion-dollar loopholes, Reuters analysis finds","By Tom Bergin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Leaders of the world’s largest economies hailed a recent agreement to overhaul global corporate tax rules as key ensuring multinationals paid their fair share of tax.
The October deal established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% aimed at curtailing profit-shifting to lower-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland, where many large international firms have their European headquarters. “It will eliminate incentives to shift jobs and profits abroad,” U.S. President Joe Biden in early October.
But some companies could still use Ireland to reduce their tax bills even after the agreement takes effect, according to tax specialists and a Reuters review of corporate filings.
That’s because the new agreement won’t stop companies benefiting from a strategy widely implemented in recent years that reduces taxes over a period of up to a decade or more. Ireland’s relatively generous tax allowances permit multinationals with a presence in the country to sell intellectual property, such as patents and brands, from one subsidiary to another to generate deductions that can be used to shield future profits from tax.
Companies that have generated deductions to reduce their taxable income by more than $10 billion each in recent years via this tax-minimizing strategy include U.S. technology companies Adobe Inc and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL), corporate filings show.
Business-software provider Oracle declined to comment and Adobe, creator of software such as Acrobat pdf-maker, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Both companies have said they conform to relevant tax laws.
The agreement, brokered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), is due to take effect in 2023. It was signed by more than 130 jurisdictions, including Ireland. 
The Irish finance ministry said Ireland’s tax treatment of intellectual property transactions is in line with other OECD countries.
In response to Reuters’ questions, the OECD acknowledged that companies could continue to benefit from profit-shifting strategies already in place but that it expects companies to be unable to build up such tax shields in the future. The approach typically relies on a company also having a subsidiary in a country with a corporate income-tax rate of zero, such as Bermuda, that enables the company to conduct the sale tax free. By phasing out zero-tax jurisdictions for multinationals, the OECD expects the global minimum tax of 15% will make the strategy no longer attractive.
“We’re trying to design rules for the future,” said John Peterson, an OECD official. 
Peterson added that the OECD can’t be certain how each country’s rules would interact with the global minimum tax. But he said the OECD is confident that abuses will be limited by a requirement that countries calculate taxable income in accordance with accounting rules.
Tax specialists say the deal’s impact remains unclear because key details are yet to be agreed, including how to calculate the pot of profit that is to be taxed. Countries are currently debating carve-outs for certain tax breaks. In addition, jurisdictions could retain wide latitude in how they allow companies to calculate taxable income, the specialists said.
“Where there isn’t accounting consistency, there is scope for gaming,” said Nicholas Gardner, a tax partner at law firm Ashurst in London.
The new rules are expected to be finalized next year and require lawmaker approval in some jurisdictions. That includes the United States, where several top Republican politicians have voiced opposition to the deal.
Malta is another country that permits multinationals to minimize taxes via intra-company intellectual property sales. Malta’s finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on its intellectual property-related tax allowances.
TAX SHIELD
International pressure forced Ireland in recent years to phase out one of the world’s best-known corporate-tax loopholes, known as the “double Irish.”’ In response, companies have increasingly accumulated tax deductions known as capital allowances via intra-group sales of intellectual property, according to tax advisors, economists and company filings.
Since 2015, multinationals have moved hundreds of billions of euros worth of intellectual property into Ireland, economists say. This has led to vast annual tax deductions for foreign companies related to so-called intangible assets – more than 45 billion euros in 2019 up from under 2.7 billion euros in 2014, according to data from Ireland’s tax authority. The data doesn’t break down what portion of those deductions were related to intellectual-property transactions within a corporation.
“Virtually every multinational has moved intellectual property,” said Christopher Sibley, a senior statistician at Ireland’s Central Statistics Office. 
The profits being shielded from tax by U.S.-based companies typically come from sales to Europe, Asia and Africa, according to tax specialists and corporate filings. The U.S. Treasury loses out because the products and services sold are based on research conducted and investment made in the United States, academics say.
The U.S. Treasury declined to comment on whether U.S. companies will continue to take advantage of pre-existing tax strategies or benefit from future ones.
Adobe books most of its sales to non-U.S. clients through an Irish subsidiary based in a four-storey block in an office park outside Dublin, corporate filings show.
In 2020, Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) Software Ireland Ltd purchased intellectual property from another subsidiary that was both an Irish-registered company and a resident in Bermuda for tax purposes. The set-up meant no tax was due on the $11 billion profit from the sale. Meanwhile, Irish-tax resident Adobe Systems Software Ireland registered an $11 billion expense that could be used to offset taxes on profits over a period of about eight years because it is an asset that depreciates over time, according to the subsidiaries’ accounts. 
Adobe paid $197 million of tax on $3.1 billion of reported profit in Ireland in 2020 and sales of $5.6 billion, according to accounts for its main Irish unit. This equates to an effective tax rate of about half of Ireland’s current statutory 12.5% corporate income tax rate, thanks to the impact of the capital allowances.

Other U.S. companies that have amassed multi-billion-dollar tax deductions from intellectual property sales to affiliates over the last three years include semiconductor maker  Analog Devices  Inc (NASDAQ:ADI), medical devices maker  Stryker  Corp (NYSE:SYK) and software group Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems Inc, publicly available accounts for their Irish subsidiaries show.
Analog Devices and Stryker said they adhere to tax rules and regulations but declined to answer questions on their specific tax arrangements. Cadence declined to comment.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 11:22AM ET</span>","BMO ends Canadian bank results season with earnings beat, dividend boost","TORONTO (Reuters) -Bank of Montreal (BMO) closed out Canadian banks' results season with better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, and announced the industry's biggest dividend increases and share buyback.
Canada's fourth-largest lender said adjusted profit rose 38%from a year earlier, beating estimates on lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions and expenses, with higher income from a year ago in all its major businesses offering a boost. It said it would increase its dividend by 25% to C$1.33 and would buy back up to 22.5 million, or 3.5%, of outstanding shares. 
Canada's Big Six lenders on average this week raised their dividends by 15% and announced plans to repurchase up to 160 million shares, equivalent to 2.7% of outstanding stock after the country's financial regulator lifted a nearly two-year moratorium.
Banks' results have been a mixed bag, with Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and BMO beating expectations, while Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) missed.
All were buffeted by rising expenses, margin pressures and lackluster trading revenues, but some managed to eke out better-than-expected net interest income growth while benefiting from industry-wide increases in fee revenues. 
The industry's costs for performance-based compensation for fiscal 2021, which ended Oct. 31, jumped 18%, a significant increase from previous years, driven by strong growth in capital markets and wealth management businesses.
BMO shares jumped 2.5% in morning trading in Toronto, compared with a 0.8% decline in the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index. The banking subindex is up 0.3% since the earnings season began, beating a 2.65% decline in the broader benchmark.
Many of the Canadian banks' chief executive officers sounded optimistic notes for fiscal 2022 earnings growth, particularly on the boon to struggling margins offered by expected interest rate increases. But they also expressed caution about the uncertainties presented by the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, and supply and labor shortages.
BMO is ""closely monitoring"" inflation and interest rate drivers, including supply and labor shortages and energy prices, BMO CEO Darryl White said on a call with analysts.
For fiscal 2022, BMO expects a mid-single-digit increase in adjusted pre-provision, pre-tax earnings, which rose 12% on a year-on-year basis, executives said. They added that results would benefit from loan growth in the high single digits, excluding the impact of the U.S. Paycheck Protection Program, which was a U.S. government loan program to help businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
BMO expects its net interest margin excluding trading, which fell slightly to 1.66% from the prior quarter, to remain stable in fiscal 2022, and increase if interest rates rise faster than expected. It expects costs to remain flat.

BMO recovered loan-loss provisions of C$126 million ($98.19 million) in the three months ended Oct. 31.

Investing.com –  Zillow  stock (NASDAQ:Z) stock climbed more than 8% Friday as the company secured its board’s approval to buy back $750 million of shares.
The repurchase will include Class A and Class C shares or a combination of both. Since the end of September, the shares have lost a third of their value.
The company’s update on its previously announced plan to wind down its home-flipping business, Zillow Offers, also lent momentum to the stock.
It said Zillow Offers has all the conditions in place to dispose more than 50% of the homes it expected to resell during the entire wind-down process.
With the wind-down progress, the company also updated its current-quarter homes segment revenue outlook to $2.6 billion at the midpoint of the guidance range from $1.9 billion earlier.
The decision to wind down the home-flipping operations came after Zillow Offers left a hole of around $381 million in the company’s third-quarter earnings. At the time of that announcement, the company said it would also lay off a quarter of its workers.
Zillow made a total net loss of $328 million in the September quarter, against a profit of $40 million in the same period last year.
The business suffered as Zillow tweaked its algorithms to grab share in a hot property market, overpaying for houses just when the prices were beginning to cool off. Having overpaid for houses earlier this year, it wrote down $304 million in the third quarter and expects another $265 million in write-downs in the current three-month period.

The case revolved around a Barbados-based bank linked to the company. Loblaw successfully argued the bank was foreign-regulated and largely doing business with other entities, and its income should therefore not be taxed in Canada.
Government lawyers said if they lost the case, it could endanger the collection of more than C$1 billion ($782 million) in taxes a year, given that other companies were eyeing similar arrangements. Ottawa argued the bank was a controlled foreign affiliate of Loblaw which should pay tax on its income.
But Canadian tax law allows an exception for offshore subsidiaries which are foreign banks, are regulated by foreign law, employ more than five people and have an arm's length relationship with the parent company.
Loblaw ""was entitled to rely on the financial institution exception,"" the court ruled.

Loblaw wound down the bank in 2013 and had already recorded a C$367 million charge to cover costs had it lost the ruling.

500,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",Meta Set to Enter Bear Market After $230 Billion Value Wipeout,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms Inc. dropped on Friday, with shares set to a enter bear market after months of volatility triggered by a whistle-blower’s revelations and disappointing quarterly results.
The selloff is now more than 20% since its closing record on Sept. 7, erasing over $230 billion in market value. Meta’s stock has been pressured this week as investors grappled with uncertainty surrounding the omicron variant and the possibility that the Federal Reserve will end its pandemic support program sooner than expected. It fell as much as 2.3% to $303.34 on Friday.
Meta shares have been hurt in recent months by negative comments about Facebook’s business model from whistle-blower Frances Haugen, according to David Trainer, who covers Meta for investment research firm New Constructs. Haugen appeared before the House subcommittee on technology earlier this week, after accusing the social media giant of putting “profit over safety” of its users in October.
Mounting concerns about the impact of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s data collection rules and supply-chain challenges have also contributed to the decline and spurred Meta’s biggest drop in nearly a year in October.
A weaker-than-expected quarterly report released in October also hurt investor sentiment. The company’s third-quarter revenues fell short of consensus estimates, as did its expectations for the fourth quarter. Several analysts trimmed their price targets for the stock in the wake of results, though they remained broadly positive on the firm, citing its long-term growth potential and valuation. 
Prior to the pandemic-driven market rout last year, the company last entered a technical bear market in June 2019, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into potential antitrust violations. 
Still, the stock rallied through the pandemic and had been on a tear this year, rising 42% from Jan. 4 to its Sept. 7 peak, outperforming peers like  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). But its recent plunge has the shares trading around 20.1 times forward earnings, making Meta the cheapest stock among mega-cap U.S. technology companies. 
Newbridge Securities Chief Market Strategist Donald Selkin said Meta appears reasonably valued at current levels, with the decline discounting a lot of the bad news surrounding Facebook. 
“It’s worth sticking your toe in the water,” he said in a phone interview.
The lower valuation doesn’t make the stock more attractive to Trainer of New Constructs, who views Meta as the worst positioned company among its mega-cap peers. He expects the stock to be a “perennial underperformer” for the next several years given the headwinds at the legacy Facebook business. Trainer said he is interested to monitor the company’s shift in focus toward the metaverse, especially the pace of the transition as competition in the field increases.
Yet, Meta has so far held on to its fans on Wall Street, with more than 80% of analysts recommending that investors snap up shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock’s 12-month average analyst price target of $400 implies about 30% return potential from current levels.

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp's dreams of acquiring British chip technology provider Arm for a hefty price of over $80 billion may not materialize, but analysts believe the chipmaker has plenty to focus on as it pushes into the metaverse. 
On Thursday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal, which has been mired in global regulatory scrutiny.
Nvidia's shares fell about 3% on Friday morning.
Analysts have long believed that the chances of the deal getting through are slim to none. 
""Even if Nvidia does not complete its ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) acquisition, demand for NVIDIA AI continues to accelerate,"" Tigress Financial Partners' Ivan Feinseth said, adding that ""Nvidia is all about AI and the Omniverse/metaverse."" 
Nvidia, the world's biggest maker of AI chips and graphics, has been doubling down on its data center business as more internet companies invest in the metaverse -- an online realm that connects people through augmented and virtual reality.
The blockbuster deal would give Nvidia exposure to Arm, which licenses its chips and blueprints to major chipmakers Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, and a chance to dominate the global semiconductor industry.
It would also put Nvidia into intense competition with rivals in the data center chip market such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc.
""What is lost is the ability of Nvidia to invest in the ARM ecosystem at a much more impactful way than SoftBank had or ARM can,"" WestPark Capital analyst Ruben Roy said.

The FTC said the deal would give Nvidia control over computing technology and designs that competitors rely on to develop their chips.
""Owning Arm would be very nice... But if they can't pull it off, they will save the purchase price... We think the company will be fine either way,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -BioNTech should be able to adapt its coronavirus vaccine relatively quickly in response to the Omicron variant, and the next few weeks will show how urgently an upgrade is needed, its CEO Ugur Sahin told the Reuters Next conference on Friday.
Sahin said people should continue to seek the established shot, developed with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), as it very likely continues to protect against severe disease.
""I believe in principle at a certain timepoint we will need a new vaccine against this new variant. The question is how urgent it needs to be available,"" Sahin said.
He reiterated that a product relaunch could be achieved within about 100 days and said a redesign is already under way. But any confirmation of the existing shot's protection against severe disease could buy developers time for a more measured approach.
If third booster shots still prevent disease at an 85-90% rate ""we would have more time to adapt a vaccine"", he said.
Germany's BioNTech and Pfizer together produced one of the first vaccines against COVID-19, with well over 2 billion doses already given to protect people around the world.
There are concerns that the vaccines might not work as well against the Omicron variant which emerged last month.
Sahin reaffirmed his view, stated in a Reuters interview on Tuesday, that the new variant might infect vaccinated people but would likely prevent the need for hospital care.
""We expect that this new variant will evolve as an antibody escape variant. That means this variant might be able to infect vaccinated,"" Sahin said. 
""We anticipate that infected people who have been vaccinated will still be protected against severe disease,"" Sahin added.
The BioNTech CEO, whose work until the emergence of the COVID-19 coronavirus in 2020 was focused on cancer, said the new variant had emerged sooner than he had anticipated.
""This highly mutant virus came earlier than I had expected. I had expected sometime next year and it's already with us.""
Sahin also said that mutations in the virus meant it was more likely that annual vaccinations would be the norm, as is the case with seasonal flu.
Much remains unknown about Omicron, which was first detected in southern Africa last month and has been spotted in at least two dozen countries. It emerged just as parts of Europe were already grappling with a wave of Delta variant infections. 
Asked how infectious the Omicron variant might be, Ozlem Tureci, BioNTech's chief medical officer and its co-founder said the next days or weeks would show.
BioNTech has been criticized for a slow rollout of vaccine deliveries in low-income countries. CEO Sahin said that a planned vaccine production network in Africa would eventually be transferred into local ownership and control.
""Our most important concern is to ensure that the quality is established. How this could be guaranteed when we transfer our technology, and when we transfer also the ownership, is something that we are discussing at the moment,"" he added.
But vaccine patents should not be waived, as U.S. President Joe Biden has suggested, because any knowledge transfer would require BioNTech's hands-on involvement.
Even the most experienced manufacturing contractors needed one-site supervision from BioNTech staff to produce consistent quality, Sahin said. 
""It's not that we want to be involved, we have to be involved. 

""I'm not against patent waivers,"" he added. ""I'm seeking solutions.""

Investing.com – Marvell Technology stock (NASDAQ:MRVL) surged 22% Friday as the company gave a robust forecast for the current quarter, citing strong potential in 5G and data center businesses.
Marvell designs and makes chips that go into data centers and vehicles, a booming market that has been constrained by supplies. It also gives designs to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) for making chips.
""For the fourth quarter, we are expecting sequential revenue growth of 9 percent at the midpoint of guidance, led by 5G, which is projected to increase by 30% sequentially and data center which is forecasted to continue to grow in the double digits on a percentage basis,"" Matt Murphy, Marvell's president and CEO said in a statement.
Marvell expects second-quarter net revenue to be $1.32 billion with a plus-or-minus 3% variation on a year-on-year basis. Gross margin, on an adjusted basis, are expected to stay around 65% levels.
This comes after the company’s third-quarter revenue rose 61% to $1.21 billion, exceeding the top end of its previous estimate as well as analysts’ expectations.
All its business segments, led by data centers, grew. Data centers, Marvell’s largest contributor at 41% of its total revenue, grew 15% from the prior quarter and 109% year-over-year.
Adjusted profit per share rose 72%, to 43 cents, and was ahead of estimates.

507,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 10:02AM ET</span>",Negotiations on future of Volkswagen CEO could drag into next week - sources,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - A decision on the future of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) CEO Herbert Diess, previously expected by the end of the week, could be delayed further, three sources close to negotiations told Reuters on Friday, and discussions may drag into next week.
Whether a decision would be made ahead of an annual supervisory board meeting on Thursday on the carmaker's five-year investment plan, as initially intended, was increasingly unclear, the sources said.
Still, it is unlikely that the meeting would be delayed, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Diess struck an upbeat tone at a manager's meeting last week, stating that negotiations with unions were going well: ""My mood is very good, because we have made a lot of progress,"" he said, according to a copy of his speech seen by Reuters.
Volkswagen, as well as Porsche SE, the regional government of Lower Saxony - which holds 20% of the company - and the works council declined to comment.
Comments by the CEO at a supervisory board meeting in October that 30,000 jobs could be lost if the transition to electric cars was not managed well sparked anger among labour leaders, who criticised what they said was a lack of strategic planning and poor communication.

Head of the supervisory board Hans Dieter Poetsch has convened a mediation committee on several occasions to allay fears over Diess' comments, but no solution has been reached.
Negotiations are expected to result in a package compromise including both a decision on the future of the CEO and details on future investments and job prospects for employees, sources have said.

508,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 09:52AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Mixed on Ambiguous Jobs Report; Dow up 40 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Friday, on course to end the week lower after a hard-to-read employment report that failed to dispel worries about labor shortages and inflationary pressures, despite a sharp slowdown in headline jobs growth.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 41 points, or 0.1%, at 34,681 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.1% but the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4%, amid suspicions that the report will do little to convince the Federal Reserve to change its mind about hurrying up the end of its bond purchases. James Bullard, the hawkish head of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, said that the Fed needs to complete the phase out of its quantitative easing program no later than March next year.
The Labor Department had said earlier that nonfarm payrolls grew by only 210,000 in October, the smallest monthly gain all year and well below the 550,000 consensus forecast. However, other parts of the report painted a brighter picture, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.2% as labor force participation rose to its highest level since the start of the pandemic. Both permanent and temporary layoffs also fell to their lowest level in over a year. 
Reinforcing the impression of an economy that is still running hot in many places, the Institute of Supply Management's non-manufacturing PMI surged to a new record high of 69.1 in November, well above expectations.
The market also remained under pressure from pandemic newsflow. The World Health Organization said it has now detected the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in 38 countries, up from 23 only two days ago. Preliminary findings presented by authorities in South Africa - where the variant was first detected - suggest that Omicron is not only more contagious than the Delta variant that has dominated this year's statistics, but is also more likely to affect younger age groups. 
Among early movers DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) stock stood out, losing nearly 40% after the company warned late on Thursday that its billings growth is slowing, another anecdotal sign that corporate behavioral shifts due to the pandemic are starting to reverse. The company had been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the move to the hybrid work model that needs software to support remote work in an ever broader range of applications.  However, it also boasted one of the most stretched valuations of any established company, with its market value being some 20 times expected sales this year. 
 Smith & Wesson  (NASDAQ:SWBI) stock was another big loser, the gunsmith falling 25% to a seven-month low after reporting a 7% quarterly drop in sales in the last quarter as the hoarding of guns and ammunition in the wake of the pandemic and the hotly-contested U.S. elections last year subsided. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell another 4.1% amid continued selling by CEO Elon Musk.
Elsewhere, Chinese ADRs slumped after Didi Global's (NYSE:DIDI) confirmation of its plans to delist triggered fears of a disorderly exit from U.S. capital markets under regulatory pressure on both sides of the Pacific. Didi ADRs fell 15%, while  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) fell 10.2% and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) ADRs fell 11.2%"

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has sold nearly $11 billion worth of shares since the world's richest person polled Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users about offloading 10% of his stake in the electric-car maker.
He has sold a combined 10.1 million shares, which is over half of the stake that he had pledged to sell, and has acquired 10.7 million shares by exercising options, since Nov. 8.

HOW DID MUSK SELL?
Musk said on Nov. 6 he would sell 10% of his stake if Twitter users agreed. He owned a combination of about 244 million shares through his trust and stock options, bringing his stake in Tesla to about 23% as of June 30. It included 170 million shares held by his trust. 
The tweet was vague. Musk did not outline if he was intending to offload 10% of his shares he indirectly owned through the trust or if his stock options were also part of the deal.

Following a flurry of options exercise, Musk still has an option to buy about 10 million more shares at $6.24 each, which expires in August next year.

510,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 09:46AM ET</span>","PayPal says 'buy now, pay later' volumes surged 400% on Black Friday","By Rachel Armstrong
LONDON (Reuters) - Volumes on PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Inc's 'buy now, pay later' platform were five times higher this Black Friday compared with a year earlier as the payments giant starts to gain traction in the fast-growing credit method, the company's chief executive told the Reuters Next conference. 
PayPal launched its ""Buy in 4"" platform in August last year, making its entry into the increasingly competitive lending niche. 
""We saw a 400% year-on-year rise on our volumes going through 'buy now, pay later' this past Black Friday,"" PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said. ""It’s booming right now."" He added that more than 9 million people have used its service.
Black Friday is the unofficial shopping holiday in late November on the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. 
""We had more than 1 million first-time users for the first time ever in the month of November,"" Schulman said. ""It's not just popular but accelerating in popularity.""
Buy now, pay later (BNPL) services have exploded in popularity in tandem with the acceleration in e-commerce volumes during the pandemic. However, they have drawn scrutiny from regulators over concerns it will lead to higher indebtedness, especially among younger consumers. 
In September, a survey said a third of U.S. consumers who used ""buy now, pay later"" services have fallen behind on one or more payments.
Schulman said the scale of PayPal's customer base meant they could offer the service responsibly. 
""We have 400 million-plus people on our platform. We know consumers and we know merchants and we know when someone can responsibly borrow,"" Schulman said.
""We have one of the highest approval rates and one of the lowest default rates in the industry"".
Schulman declined to comment on PayPal's interest in Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc after reports last month https://www.reuters.com/technology/paypal-says-is-not-pursuing-acquisition-pinterest-2021-10-25 that it had considered buying the social media platform for $45 billion, in what would have been one of the largest tech deals in history. 
However, he said with $20 billion of cash-like equivalents on the company's balance sheet, it was open to big and small deals. 
""When I think about M&A or I think about the strategy of PayPal, I try to think expansively about where is the world going. Not just where the world was but where it is going,"" he said. 
""We have the wherewithal to be acquisitive, no doubt we will be acquisitive and we will look at both small and larger acquisitions but we have very strict capital allocation requirements."" 
He said deals of interest would be in areas that would play in to the interconnection of payments, consumer financial services and shopping tools. 
CRYPTO TO FINANCIAL PLUMBING
Last year, PayPal became one of the first major mainstream financial companies to embrace cryptocurrencies, when it enabled customers to buy, sell and hold certain digital coins in its wallet, triggering a rally in bitcoin.
However, Schulman said enabling people to buy and hold cryptocurrencies is perhaps ""the least interesting"" part of crypto to him, compared with working on the development of other forms of digital money and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). 
""There's a lot of fascination when bitcoin hit $100k or is worth $25k or whatever but it will be what it will be,"" he said.

""But what's really interesting to me is can crypto or digital forms of currency add incremental utility to payments - things like programmable money, things like NFTs (non-fungible tokens), things like some Defi (decentralised finance) applications.""

But some other automotive companies could deliver returns as good as TSLA. We think Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) and Isuzu Motors (ISUZY) are poised for a solid rally in the coming months. So, these stocks could be solid bets now.New car sales fell in November despite robust consumer demand for automobiles due to higher-than-expected private payrolls and technical breakthroughs. Automobile sales in the United States fell 0.7% month-over-month to $12.9 million last month. Automotive companies struggled to meet the rising demand due to shortages of semiconductor chips, tight inventories, and delivery delays.
However, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) was able to slough off the supply chain challenges. The company dominated electric vehicle (EV) sales in November. In addition, TSLA topped the month with 1,013 for Tesla Model Y cars registered and 771 Tesla model 3 cars registered. Its stock has gained more than 90% in price over the past year, and we think looks overvalued at its current price level.
Happily, we think there are a few automotive companies other than Tesla that are worth considering. For example, due to their excellent brand value and financial flexibility, Isuzu Motors Limited (ISUZY) and Mazda Motor Corporation (MZDAY) are expected to deliver returns that match TSLA’s in the near term. Thus, these stocks could be solid bets now.

The deal with Apollo Strategic Growth Capital (ASGC) will deliver gross proceeds of up to $1.2 billion, including a $335 million private investment in public equity, or PIPE. 
Investors in the PIPE included investment manager Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) Corp, travel technology company Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR) Corp and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc. 
The merger comes at a time when business travel is recovering from a pandemic-induced slump, in a boost for companies like AmEx GBT that help corporate employees with their travel arrangements. 
AmEx GBT was a wholly-owned unit of American Express Co (NYSE:AXP) until 2014, when the payments processor sold half its stake to a consortium led by investment firm Certares LP.
Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and the  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) were looking to purchase a 20% stake in the company in late 2019 but pulled out of investment in May last year as the COVID-19 crisis dented AmEx GBT's business.
After the merger, the combined company will be renamed Global Business Travel but it will continue to do business under the AmEx GBT brand name. 
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022, after which Global Business Travel will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""GBTG.""

Special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), or blank-check firms, are publicly listed shell companies that raise funds with the intention of merging with a private entity, allowing firms to go public while sidestepping a traditional initial public offering.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) advised GBT on the deal, while Evercore and Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) advised ASGC.

Investing.com – ADRs of Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) slumped more than 10% in Friday’s premarket, after being up more than 13% earlier as traders come to grips with the delisting being planned by the company.
Coming just after five months of its listing, market players expect the company’s offer to be a sweet one since anything otherwise could create legal obstacles for the ride-hailing firm. The company listed on NYSE on June 30 and the issue price was $14. The stock has mostly traded below that price. It closed at $7.80 Thursday.
While the company told the SEC Thursday that the ADRs will be convertible into freely tradable shares on another internationally recognized stock exchange, Reuters said listing in Hong Kong might prove complicated.
According to the news agency, Didi aims to complete a dual primary listing in Hong Kong in three months, too tight a deadline for a company with a history of compliance problems. Only 20%-30% of Didi's core ride-hailing business in China is fully compliant with regulations, Reuters said.
The company is also under pressure from Beijing to complete delisting by June, Reuters said.
Didi ignored the advice of the authorities in China to delay its public debut, pending scrutiny of its data handling practices. Miffed with the company’s decision, the regulators asked it to stop onboarding new users while also mandating online stores to take its apps off their platforms.

The CVC deal is due to receive final approval on Dec. 10 and was approved by 38 of the 42 clubs comprising LaLiga in a first round.
The alternative proposal from Spain's two largest clubs together with smaller Athletic Bilbao would see JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and HSBC jointly lend 2 billion euros in exchange for an fixed annual payment of 115 million euros for 25 years, a document seen by Reuters showed, confirming a report by the Financial Times.
The CVC deal would see the fund receive 11% of the league's television rights over the next 50 years in exchange for a one-off payment of 2.7 billion euros.
The vast majority of the cash is to be given to clubs to spend on new infrastructure and modernization projects as well as increasing how much they can spend on players.
Real Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao opted out, saying the terms were too generous to CVC. Second-division Real Oviedo also rejected the deal.
In response to their alternative proposal, LaLiga's management said the CVC deal was not just about financing the league but also aimed at making it more competitive and improving its businesses.
""The CVC deal is an operation of investment in a industrial partner, not a bank credit, and (Real Madrid president) Florentino Perez knows that,"" LaLiga president Javier Tebas wrote on social media.
""Now he 'remembers' the clubs from LaLiga (the ones from the less interesting games), the teams he was ignoring when he was building the Super League.

""Turns out that it is Anas Laghrari (CEO of Key Capital and of the Super League disaster) who Florentino Perez sends to make a proposal with such ignorance of the legal and financial situation of LaLiga clubs that it is unfeasible. They seek confusion and continue to manage from the pub's counter.""

SoftBank, either in its own right or through its Vision Fund, has made a string of massive investments around the world, often in large technology companies.
Its shares fell to as low as 5,423 yen ($47.89) on Friday, before settling slightly higher but with losses of 23% over three weeks.
Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global, which is 21.5% owned by the Vision Fund, said earlier Friday it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange and pursue a listing in Hong Kong, after coming under pressure from Chinese regulators over data security. 
A few hours earlier, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block U.S. chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp's more than $80 billion planned acquisition of British chip technology provider Arm, which is owned by SoftBank, adding to already significant global regulatory challenges of the deal. 
A few hours before that, shares of Grab, Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing and delivery firm, slid more than 20% in their Nasdaq debut on Thursday following the company's record $40 billion merger with a blank-check company. 
The Vision Fund is Grab's largest shareholder owning about 18.6% of the company. 
""As long as such news is there, we would have to wait and hold off buying SoftBank Group,"" said Shigetoshi Kamada (NASDAQ:KMDA), general manager at the research department at Tachibana Securities. ""Every time we see negative factors on SoftBank, we have to sell its shares.""
The group reported a second-quarter loss last month as its Vision Fund unit took a $10 billion hit from a decline in the share price of its portfolio companies.

""We don't have a comment,"" a SoftBank Group spokesperson said when asked about the FTC's opposition to Nvidia's purchase of Arm. 
He also declined to comment on Didi's plans to delist from the New York stock exchange and Grab's share debut, saying they were investments made by the Vision Fund and not by SoftBank directly.

Investing.com – Ulta Beauty stock (NASDAQ:ULTA) rose 6% in Friday’s premarket trading as higher demand for its fragrances and haircare products drove its third-quarter sales and earnings to record levels. 
Comfortably beating the estimates for the quarter gave the beauty retailer the confidence to raise its annual outlook one more time.
The company rode the return-to-work to drive, recording more transactions and higher consumption in the quarter ended October 30. Transactions rose around 17% while the average ticket size of each sale was higher by 7.7%.
Comparable sales rose around 26%. The company also opened 6 more stores effectively during the quarter, a contrast to the net closure of two outlets in the same period last year.
Gross profit rose from last year, and its gross margin also expanded. The company attributed this to control of fixed costs including salon expenses as well a better sales mix.
The company now sees its annual net sales at $8.55 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, up from its August forecast of $8.2 billion. Margins are also set to be higher than previously estimated.
Net sales in the third quarter rose 25% to $2 billion. The share of haircare products and styling tools in sales rose to 21% from 20% earlier while that of fragrances and bath products improved by 200 basis points to 12%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
Adjusted profit per share was $3.93, up 61%.  "

The region’s equity funds experienced $2.8 billion outflows in the week through Dec. 1, the most since October 2020, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). strategists said, citing EPFR Global data. By contrast, their U.S. counterparts had the largest inflows in four weeks at $10.2 billion.
The flows are borne out by market movements. The MSCI Europe Index has fallen about 5% since a record high on Nov. 17, double the drop of the S&P 500 over the same period.
U.S. stocks were already the main beneficiaries of inflows that have supported a stellar year for global equities, with the MSCI World Index gaining nearly 16%. A record $900 billion has poured into stocks in 2021, exceeding the combined $785 billion inflows of the past 19 years.
For European stocks, the discount to U.S. equities has only continued to widen, reaching a record 32% based on a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio that has fallen below 15, its lowest level since April 2020.
“We see little justification for a sustained further de-rating in MSCI Europe,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Graham (NYSE:GHM) Secker wrote in a note on Friday. He sees even more discounted valuations beneath the surface, with 28% of European stocks trading at less than 12 times their estimated earnings.
The spread of Covid-19’s omicron variant may threaten Europe’s growth outlook, with some governments already stepping up travel restrictions and partial lockdowns. This week, Germany imposed strict restrictions on unvaccinated people, while several countries including Austria and the Netherlands have imposed broad lockdowns.

The EU sanctioned Belavia on Thursday, accusing it of flying in migrants as a tactic to destabilise European states, punitive measures that were coordinated with Washington.
The sanctions mean EU companies can no longer lease planes to the airline, EU officials have said.
""Due to the imposition of restrictions, the airline has been forced to reduce its fleet,"" Belavia said in a statement, adding it currently had 15 aircraft.
It did not specify which of its previous 14 Boeing (NYSE:BA) and 15 Embraer aircraft were no longer part of the fleet. 
As of the end of last year, the airline owned 15 planes, including 5 Embraer and 8 Boeing aircraft, with the same number on lease. One of Belavia's biggest suppliers of leased planes has been the Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corporation (ALC). 

Belavia, the only airline in the ex-Soviet economy of 9.5 million people, said it planned to rebuild its fleet by purchasing planes and also by leasing them from non-EU based companies.
It has been banned from much of Europe's airspace after an international outcry over the grounding of a Ryanair jet in Belarus and arrest of a dissident.

By Scott Murdoch and Sameer Manekar
(Reuters) - Chinese property developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd has begun talks with some of its offshore bondholders over extending the deadline for a $400 million debt repayment due next week, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
Shares in the group slipped sharply on Friday after it said it had failed to secure the minimum 95% approval needed from offshore bondholders to carry out an exchange offer of its 6.5% offshore bonds due Dec. 7, without which it could risk default.
A group of offshore bondholders who say they own 50% of the debt in question and their financial advisor sent Kaisa a letter earlier this week offering extra time to negotiate the repayment of the bond and avoid a default.
The bondholders also tabled an offer to provide $2 billion worth of fresh funding to Kaisa, but major progress has not been made on that offer, according to the sources, who declined to be named as they were discussing confidential information.
Shares of the embattled property firm closed down 8.82%, far outpacing the 0.09% decline in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, taking the stock's plunge so far this year to around 75%.
The company had hoped to exchange the $400 million 6.5% offshore bonds for new notes due June 6, 2023 at the same interest rate if at least 95% of holders accepted. It did not disclose how many bondholders had consented to the offer.
Kaisa, which became the first Chinese property developer to default on its dollar bonds in 2015, said it had been in talks with representatives of certain bondholders, but that no ""legally binding agreement"" had yet been entered into.
""To ease the current liquidity issue and reach an optimal solution for all stakeholders, the company is assessing and is closely monitoring the financial condition and cash position of the group,"" it said on Friday.
It added that it still exploring selling assets and extending or renewing debt obligations, but cautioned there was no guarantee it would be able to meet the Dec. 7 maturity. 

A failure to repay or reach an agreement with creditors would have ""a material adverse effect"" on Kaisa's financial condition, it said. 
Kaisa is the second-largest dollar bond issuer among China's property developers after China Evergrande Group, which has more than $300 billion in liabilities, and like the others has been scrambling to raise capital to stave off a default.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 07:12AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Toyota turns to Chinese tech to reach its electric holy grail,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp will launch an all-electric small sedan in China late next year, having turned to local partner BYD for key technology to finally make an affordable yet roomy runaround, four sources told Reuters.
Two of the four people with knowledge of the matter described the car as an electric holy grail for Toyota which has struggled for years to come up with a small EV that is both competitive on cost in China and doesn't compromise on comfort.
The sources said the breakthrough was chiefly down to BYD's less bulky lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) Blade batteries and its lower-cost engineering know-how - a turning of the tables for a Chinese company whose popular F3 saloon was inspired by Toyota's Corolla back in 2005.
Little known outside China at the time, BYD, or ""Build Your Dreams"", hit the headlines in 2008 when Warren Buffett bought a 10% stake and it has since become one of the biggest manufacturers of so-called new energy vehicles in the world.
Toyota's new EV will be slightly bigger than its compact Corolla, the world's best-selling car of all time. One source said think of it as ""a Corolla with bigger back-seat section"".
It will be unveiled as a concept car at the Beijing auto show in April and will then most likely be launched as the second model in Toyota's new bZ series of all-electric cars, even though it will only be on sale in China for now.
""The car was enabled by BYD battery technology,"" one of the sources told Reuters. ""It has more or less helped us resolve challenges we had faced in coming up with an affordable small electric sedan with a roomy interior."" 
It will be pitched below premium EVs such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model Y or the Nio (NYSE:NIO) ES6 but above the ultra-cheap Hong Guang Mini EV, which starts at just $4,500 and is now China's best-selling electric vehicle.
Two of the four sources, all of whom declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media, said the new Toyota would be priced competitively. 
One said it would likely sell for under 200,000 yuan ($30,000), aiming for a segment of the Chinese market Tesla is expected to target with a small car within the next two years.
""We don't comment on future products,"" a Toyota spokesperson said. ""Toyota considers battery electric vehicles as one path to help us get to carbon neutrality and is engaged in the development of all types of electrified vehicle solutions.""
A BYD spokesperson declined to comment.
'ALL KINDA FLOORED' 
The fact Toyota has been compelled to turn to BYD to solve its low-cost EV conundrum shows how far the competitive balance of the global auto industry has tipped in the past decade.
When the quality of Chinese vehicles was considered below par, global automakers were not too concerned that they couldn't compete on price and left Chinese companies to control the domestic market for cheap, no-frills cars.
But times have changed.
Toyota executives started to worry back in 2015 when BYD launched its Tang plug-in hybrid, with significant improvements in styling, quality and performance. Most worrying was that fact it was still about 30% cheaper than comparable Toyota models.
There was a critical turn of events in 2017 when Toyota's top engineering leaders, including then-executive vice president Shigeki Terashi, drove several BYD cars such as the Tang at its proving ground in Toyota City near its headquarters in Japan.
Terashi subsequently visited BYD's headquarters in Shenzhen and drove a prototype of its Han electric car. 
""Their long-term quality is still a question mark, but the design and quality of these cars showed levels of maturity, yet they were much cheaper than comparable Toyota models,"" said one of the four sources, who participated in the test drives. 
""We were all kinda floored by that.""
Two of the sources said the BYD evaluations pushed Toyota to create its research and development (R&D) joint venture with BYD last year. Toyota now has two dozen engineers in Shenzhen working side-by-side with about 100 BYD counterparts.
BLADE WINNER
Toyota's new EV comes at a time it is under fire from environmental groups that maintain it is not committed to zero emissions. They say Toyota is more interested in prolonging the commercial usefulness of its successful hybrid technology. 
Toyota executives say they're not against battery electric vehicles (BEVs) but argue that until renewable energy becomes more widely available, they won't be a silver bullet for slashing carbon emissions.
Nevertheless, Toyota has set up division in Japan dedicated to zero-emissions cars called ZEV Factory and it is developing safer and lower-cost battery technologies, including solid-state lithium-ion cells which would significantly boost an EV's range. 
While Toyota has long advocated a runaround that doesn't compromise on comfort as the best way to popularise BEVs, it has struggled to produce such a car.
One problem stems from need to stack bulky, heavy batteries under the floor, as they eat up the interior unless the roof is raised too - which is why many smaller EVs are SUVs.
In 2018, Toyota briefly explored the idea of a battery venture with BYD. That and subsequent interactions led Toyota's engineers to come across BYD's LFP Blade battery. They described it as a game-changer as it was both cheaper and freed up space.
""It's a 'scales fell from my eyes' kind of technology we initially dismissed because its design is so radically simple,"" one of the four sources said.
BYD officially launched its Blade battery in 2020.
LFP batteries have a lower energy density than most other lithium-ion cells but are cheaper, have a longer shelf-life, are less prone to overheating and don't use cobalt or nickel. Tesla already uses LFP batteries in its Model 3 and Model Y in China.
One of the sources said a typical Blade pack is about 10 cm (3.9 inches) thick when the modules are laid flat on the floor, roughly 5 cm to 10 cm thinner than other lithium-ion packs.
A BYD spokesperson said that was possible, depending on how an automaker packages the Blade pack in a car.
CUTTING CORNERS?
While Toyota has not fully solved the puzzle as to how BYD keeps coming in low on costs, two of the sources said one factor may be its abbreviated and flexible design and quality assurance process - which some Toyota engineers see as cutting corners.
Toyota's planning process is much more rigid and thorough, the sources said. Once it has decided on the technologies, components and systems at the outset of a car's three-to-four-year development process, it rarely changes designs. 
During the process, Toyota typically does three design prototypes and three manufacturing prototypes. Some are driven about 150,000 km (93,000 miles) to bullet-proof quality and reliability when testing for emissions or bad-road durability.
At BYD, engineers do far less prototyping - there are typically just two - and designs can be changed as late as two years into the process, which is a definite no-no at Toyota, one source said. A BYD spokesperson declined to comment.
But as a result of those last-minute changes, the technology in a BYD car is much more up to date than in a Toyota when it hits the market, and is often cheaper.
The four sources believe that further advances in simulation and virtual engineering know-how, as well as the fact that BYD produces a wide array of its own components, have helped it close potential gaps in quality and reliability that could stem from such last-minute design changes. 

""Our challenge at Toyota is whether we dismiss BYD's way of engineering as being loosey-goosey and too risky, or whether we can learn from it,"" one of the sources said.

The company sees itself billing clients less in the current quarter than it previously estimated, an indication the pandemic-fueled boom in the company’s business may be peaking.
The company said its annual billings for the year ending January 31 are now seen at $2.34 billion, $78 million less than the midpoint of its previous guidance range.
The revised guidance came after the company’s third-quarter revenue grew 42% to around $546 million, reflecting the tempering in demand for its solutions that enable online onboarding of employees and e-signature of documents. It had grown at over 50% during the height of the pandemic.
CEO Dan Springer said the third quarter saw customers return to more normalized buying patterns, resulting in 28% year-over-year billings growth. On an adjusted basis, net profit per share more than doubled to 58 cents and beat estimates."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening in muted fashion Friday, at the end of a volatile week driven by news surrounding the omicron Covid variant and ahead of the release of the key monthly U.S. employment report.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 20 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 10 points, or 0.1%.
The major indices rebounded Thursday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining over 600 points, or 1.8%, the broad-based S&P 500 rose 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8%.
However, despite these gains, the indices are on course for a losing week, marked by turbulent trading as investors tried to digest the economic repercussions of the new Omicron variant. The Dow and the Nasdaq are each about 0.7% lower on the week, while the S&P 500 is down 0.4%.
The Biden administration announced new rules late Thursday, to take effect on Monday, requiring international air travelers arriving in the United States to obtain a negative Covid-19 test within one day of travel.
Elsewhere, investors will carefully study the official monthly jobs report, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), especially after the hawkish stance Fed chair Jerome Powell took over the potential for the central bank's tightening of monetary policy at his Congressional testimony earlier in the week.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 550,000 in November, an improvement from the 531,000 jobs created in October, while the unemployment rate is expected to drop to 4.5% from 4.6% the previous month. 
That said, both the ADP private payrolls on Wednesday and Thursday’s initial jobless claims were stronger than expected, suggesting a positive surprise is a distinct possibility.
Turning to the corporate sector, Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) will be in the spotlight after the Chinese ride-sharing giant announced it will delist from the New York stock exchange and pursue a listing in Hong Kong, just a few months after its $4.4 billion U.S. IPO in July.
Southeast Asian super-app Grab will also be in focus after it plunged 21% on its debut on Thursday after merging with a special purpose acquisition company.
Crude prices rose Friday after OPEC+ left the possibility open of a quick change in policy if fuel demand is badly hit by the travel restrictions and lockdowns put in place to combat the Omicron Covid variant. 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, stuck to the original plan to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in January, but the top producers also said they could meet again before their next scheduled meeting on Jan. 4, if needed.
The Baker Hughes' rig count and CFTC positioning data round out the week for the crude market.

The deal, sealed on Friday, includes the largest ever overseas sale of the French warplane. It brings the number of new or second-hand Rafales sold for export to 236 and will trigger an increase in production for the warplane, the official told reporters.
The sale deepens existing security ties between France and the UAE at a time when diplomats say U.S. allies in the Middle East are increasingly questioning the commitment of the United States to the region following its exit from Afghanistan.
The French official said the contract demonstrated the appetite of several nations to ""diversify their security"".
The deal is worth 14 billion euros for 80 of Dassault Aviation's Rafale fighters, 2 billion for air-to-air and cruise missiles supplied by European consortium MBDA and 1 billion for 12 Airbus H225M Caracal helicopters, the official said.
The sale involves the latest F-4 standard of Rafale being developed for the French air force, which aims to increase connectivity and shared target identification between the jets, following the example of the U.S.  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-35.
Defence sources have said the Rafale would replace a fleet of Dassault Mirage 2000 jets already deployed in the UAE and is unlikely to displace an order for the F-35 as the UAE continues to hedge its security between two major suppliers.
However, the deal is widely seen as a signal of impatience as the U.S. Congress hesitates on approving an F-35 deal amid concerns about the UAE's relationship with China, including the prevalence of Huawei 5G technology in the country.

The French official said the deal included no provision to buy back Mirage 2000s or carry out industrial offset investments.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore's digital banks will find it hard to carve out space in the city-state's saturated market, said Piyush Gupta, the CEO of DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY), Southeast Asia's biggest lender.
Online-only banks are due to start operations in Singapore next year, marking the financial hub's biggest banking shake-up in two decades.
""In Singapore, it's not that easy for digital banks to carve out space,"" Gupta told the Reuters Next conference on Friday, pointing to Singapore's 98% banking penetration and incumbents' strong digital product suite.
""Even in markets like Brazil and China you can see that the relative market share, size and growth of the incumbent banking system hasn't shifted very much,"" he said.
Singapore-based internet platform company Sea Ltd as well as Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab's venture with Singtel are set to start operations on a restricted basis from 2022 after they won full digital bank licences https://www.reuters.com/article/singapore-banks-idUSL1N2IK0T1 in December.
But Gupta said guidelines by the Singapore regulator that ensure newer entrants have a profitable business over the next few years would prevent them from buying market share by running huge losses over time.
""Without a doubt, you are going to have to compete. People will come in with aggressive pricing products and so on. But on the whole, I think we're relatively well positioned and we should be able to hold our own,"" he said. 
Over the past decade, Gupta has steered DBS into investing billions of dollars to upgrade its technology infrastructure as it embraced cloud computing and digitised its services.
DBS earns most of its profit from Singapore and Hong Kong.
Since Gupta took charge in 2009, DBS has broken into the ranks of the top wealth managers in Asia, acquired a bank in India and one in China over the past year, and has forayed into businesses such as a digital exchange and a global carbon exchange as it seeks new revenue streams.
Gupta said the bank's business momentum was robust despite the Omicron coronavirus variant spreading globally and battering markets as investors worry about the impact on economic growth.
""When I look at our loan book and loan pipeline, those are quite robust, and that's true across the region, including in China where macro numbers are slowing down. But for a player like us, we are seeing reasonably good momentum in our business there,"" he said.
""As we are looking at our pipelines and our business projection for 2022, I think we'll pretty much continue to see fairly similar momentum as we go into the year.""
Last month, DBS beat market estimates with a 31% rise in July-September net profit, aided by growth in fee income and improving asset quality.
TECH DISRUPTION
Referring to last month's technical disruptions at DBS's online banking services, including its payments app, Gupta apologised to customers and said they had the right to expect more from the bank.
DBS had identified a problem with its access control servers.
""But the good news is that everything behind the front door was safe. Nothing got touched, so our data was fine, there was no cyber hack and our payments were going okay,"" Gupta said.
""So we're doing a full review of the end-to-end process. And then we'll come up with some understanding and findings on what we can do better as we go forward.""

Gupta, 61, said he had no plans to retire soon. He had a 27-year-stint at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) before joining DBS.

532,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 06:11AM ET</span>",Macy's reliance on stores for e-commerce weighs on mulled split,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) is grappling with how to make its e-commerce business a standalone company without losing customers who rely on its department stores to pick up or return items they bought online, according to people familiar with the deliberations.
The 163-year-old retailer said last month that it had asked consulting firm AlixPartners to review its business structure after Jana Partners urged it to separate its e-commerce arm. 
The activist hedge fund said in October that the e-commerce business could be worth $14 billion on its own, more than Macy's entire market capitalization of about $8 billion.
AlixPartners also advised HBC, the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, on the separation earlier this year of its e-commerce business from its department stores.
Macy's views a similar separation as more challenging because of its large store footprint and its online customers' reliance on it, the sources said.
Macy's has close to 800 stores. It has said its online sales are two to three times higher per capita in regions where the stores are located, because of the convenience for customers of picking up and returning items at the stores. 
Saks, on the other hand, has only about 40 stores, and the privately held company's e-commerce business generates annual revenue of less than $1 billion. That is a fraction of Macy's e-commerce revenue, which is set to exceed $8 billion this year, according to Morningstar analysts.
A separated Macy's online business will need to have extensive commercial agreements with the company holding the department stores. They would have to govern everything from merchandise distribution and storage to promotions and marketing, in order to provide Macy's customers a seamless experience in-store and online, the sources said. 
Such agreements will need to withstand the test of time as the company holding the department stores downsizes further, shutting down locations on which the e-commerce business relies, the sources added. 
""The introduction of numerous service agreements to compensate stores would likely lower profitability,"" Cowen analysts said in a note last month. 
Macy's did not respond to requests for comment.
The duplication of functions now housed under one roof, such as logistics and administration, would add to the costs, the sources said. 
Macy's has been going in the opposite direction with its ""Polaris (NYSE:PII)"" strategy launched last year, which envisions $1.5 billion in annual cost reductions through the synergies of brick-and-mortar retail with e-commerce by the end of 2022.
In a letter to Macy's in October, Jana suggested that a benefit of separation could be a cash infusion in the online business that would help hire top talent and invest in new technology, the sources said. It pointed to the case of Saks, which attracted a $500 million investment from private equity firm Insight Venture Partners at a $2 billion valuation for its online business. 
The Macy's review is also exploring this possibility, according to the sources.
""Our objective is to light a fire under this company that has an incredible brand,"" said Guy Phillips, managing member at NuOrion Advisors, a Macy's investor that is also pushing the company to make changes. 
Macy's has not provided a timeline for completion of the business review.
While Jana applauded Macy's decision to launch the review, it has not ruled out a challenge to the company's board. It will have the opportunity to nominate directors early next year should it decide the company has not made enough progress.
PASSING ON COSTS TO CUSTOMERS
This is not the first time Macy's faces calls for a breakup. It fended off demands from activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP six years ago to sell its real estate and then lease it back for its stores. It has subsequently trimmed its property portfolio and entered into a partnership with Brookfield Asset Management to cash in on some of it.
Department stores have enjoyed a sales rebound in recent months as Americans splurge on perfumes, dresses and formal wear following COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. But their profitability has suffered amid shipping logjams, labor shortages and inflationary pressure.

Macy's has fared much better than most retailers thanks to its ability to pass on some of the additional costs to customers. Its shares are up 143% year-to-date, compared with an 18% rise in the S&P 500 retailing index. 
Macy's said last month it expects a 1% rise in gross margins from pre-pandemic 2019 levels. It also raised its full-year sales and profit outlook and expects full-year net sales of $24.12 billion to $24.28 billion, compared with $23.55 billion to $23.95 billion previously.

Investing.com – Grab shares were set to rebound in Friday’s premarket trading after they lost more than a fifth of their value on their Nasdaq debut in the previous session.
The Southeast Asian super-app's stock was quoted up 7.4% at $9.40, having fallen from $13.06 to $8.75 on Thursday, its first day of trading.
At Thursday's close, the ride-hailing and delivery giant had a market capitalization of around $35 billion. 
Grab’s early backers include Softbank (T:9984),  Toyota  (NYSE:TM), Hyundai Motor (OTC:HYMLY) and Didi (NYSE:DIDI).
The loss-making firm combined with SPAC Altimeter Growth in a deal that valued it at close to $40 billion, making it the largest ever U.S. listing by a Southeast Asian company. It was also the largest listing through a merger with a blank check company, a process that many startups adopt because of faster listing and cheaper costs associated with a SPAC listing.
SPAC, short for Special Purpose Acquisition Company, is a firm created with the purpose of raising capital from public markets and using that cash to merge it with a private firm to take the latter public. A SPAC is usually backed by industry veterans which is what gets it the premium even as investors are unaware of the identity of the firm that will be pursued for a merger.

Roskomnadzor in October threatened both Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with fines based on a percentage of their annual turnover for a repeated failure to delete content that Moscow deems illegal.
Russian law allows for companies to be fined between 5% and 10% of annual turnover for repeated violations.
Moscow's Tagansky District Court said court dates for both companies - neither of which immediately responded to a request for comment - were set for Dec. 24. 
Russia has increased pressure on foreign tech companies as it seeks to assert greater control over the Internet, slowing down Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) since March and routinely fining others for content violations.

Google has paid more than 32 million roubles in fines this year. Google, Twitter and Meta have significantly reduced the number of posts prohibited by Moscow on their platforms. 
Russia last month demanded that 13 foreign and mostly U.S. technology companies be officially represented on Russian soil by the end of 2021 or face possible restrictions or outright bans.

536,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 05:22AM ET</span>",Indonesia governor says will signal policy rate moves ahead of time,"By Fransiska Nangoy and Bernadette Christina
(Reuters) -Bank Indonesia (BI) Governor Perry Warjiyo said the central bank does not expect inflation to top 3% until 2023, but the central bank would start communicating possible changes to its policy rates ahead of time to avoid any market shocks. 
With the economic outlook brightening, the Indonesian central bank plans to start reducing liquidity in the banking system next year, rolling back loose monetary policy used to weather the pandemic, although it is closely monitoring the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
BI has injected more than 860 trillion rupiah ($59.74 billion) of liquidity into the financial system since last year, including through direct purchases of government bonds, and slashed key rates by 150 basis points to help cushion the economic hit from the health crisis and anti-virus measures.
Unlike the case in many other economies which are recovering from the pandemic slump, price pressures in Indonesia remain mild, but they are creeping up. The consumer inflation rate in November rose to 1.75%, a 17-month high. 
Warjiyo reiterated that BI will keep the main policy rate at a record low 3.50% until inflation shows signs of accelerating.
""Our current projection is inflation starting (to rise) above 3% and moving up towards 4% sometimes in second quarter or early third quarter 2023,"" he said in an interview during a Reuters Next conference.
""But by nature, interest rate decisions need to be forward looking, needs to be preemptive, need to be front loading,"" he added.
Some analysts believe BI will need to start considering rate hikes from mid-2022 as global supply chain disruptions and high commodity prices had already started affecting production costs.
BI's target inflation next year is between 2% and 4%.
Next year BI will mop up liquidity and will start signaling toward the end of the year further policy direction, depending on trends in inflation and growth, Warjiyo said.
Bank Indonesia will communicate with markets the liquidity reduction plan ahead of time, he said, adding that the central bank will make sure the move will not compromise banks' ability lend or purchase government bonds.
Tools which BI could use to absorb liquidity include raising banks' reserve requirements, Warjiyo added.
Meanwhile, he said BI is monitoring how the spread of the new COVID-19 variant will affect the normalisation of fiscal and monetary policy in the developed world.
""This is important because those normalisations will impact our ability to grow as well as ensure our external stability,"" he said.
Indonesia will make sure that yield differential between rupiah assets and U.S. Treasury yields will remain attractive for investors to avoid massive outflows as the Federal Reserve is expected to start raising rates next year.
Warjiyo said on Friday the central bank will not hesitate to ""come to the market"" to stabilise the rupiah if needed.

But he said the country is in much better condition to weather any rupiah volatility than in the past, when Fed policy tightening triggered heavy outflows from emerging markets.

537,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 05:01AM ET</span>",Didi Soars on Speculation of Favorable NYSE Delisting Terms,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – ADRs of ride-hailing giant Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) climbed more than 13% in Friday’s premarket after it revealed its plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange, a move aimed at placating Chinese regulators.
""Following careful research, the company will immediately start delisting on the New York stock exchange and start preparations for listing in Hong Kong,"" Didi said on the Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) micro-blogging site, according to Reuters.
Didi listed on the NYSE on June 30, ignoring the advice of the authorities in China that it delay its public debut, pending scrutiny of its data handling practices. That didn’t go down well with the regulators in China, which then asked it to stop onboarding new users while also mandating online stores to take its apps off their platforms. 
Barring a brief period, Didi stock has traded below its issue price of $14. The stock closed at $7.80 Thursday. 
Didi did not explain its reasons for the plan but said it will hold a shareholder vote at an appropriate time and would ensure its NYSE-listed stock is convertible into tradable shares on another stock exchange.
According to Reuters, Didi is preparing to relaunch its apps in China by the end of the year, when it hopes that the cybersecurity investigation will be wrapped up. Authorities in China have kept a tight watch over their online firms given many of them are listed in the U.S. and have to share vital data on their users with the regulators there, a scenario they are not comfortable with.  Didi's news comes a day after the Securities and Exchanges Commission published new rules for enforcing access to data held by U.S.-listed companies.
Many Chinese ADRs have fallen sharply since the signs of a looming split between the U.S. and Chinese capital markets started to appear. The companies may struggle to sustain their often high valuations without access to the world's largest pool of capital. U.S. investors, meanwhile, stand to be deprived of easy exposure to the world's fastest-growing large economy.

538,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 04:36AM ET</span>",Google delays mandatory return to office beyond Jan. 10,"By Paresh Dave
(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) said on Thursday it is indefinitely pushing back its January return-to-office plan globally amid growing concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and some resistance to company-mandated vaccinations.
Google in August had said it would expect workers to come in about three days a week from Jan. 10 at the earliest, ending its voluntary work-from-home policy.
On Thursday, Google executives told employees that the company would put off the deadline beyond that date. Insider first reported the news.
Google said the update was in line with its earlier guidance that a return to workplaces would begin no earlier than Jan. 10 and depend on local conditions.
Nearly 40% of U.S. employees have come into an office in recent weeks, Google said, with higher percentages in other parts of the world.
But CNBC reported last week that hundreds of employees have protested the company's vaccination mandate for those working on U.S. government contracts.

Google was one of the first companies to ask its employees to work from home during the pandemic. It has about 85 offices across nearly 60 countries.
Europe has so far recorded 79 cases of the Omicron variant, first detected in southern Africa last month, the European Union's public health agency said earlier on Thursday.

539,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 04:35AM ET</span>",China promotes short-selling by letting insurers lend securities,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China on Friday authorised its insurers to take part in securities lending, potentially boosting short-selling activities in the country's stock and bond markets. 
Chinese banks, brokerages and mutual fund houses can already conduct the business, lending securities holdings to other market players, such as short-sellers, for interest income.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) published rules on Friday allowing insurers to participate in securities lending.
The move could help insurers improve returns on their long-term, and sizable stock and bond holdings, CBIRC said in a statement. 
In addition, the measures ""can help improve market liquidity and vibrancy,"" CBIRC added. 
According to official data, Chinese insurers held 11.6 trillion yuan of bonds, stocks and securities funds at the end of October. 
Yuan Yuwei, hedge fund manager at Water Wisdom Asset Management welcomed the move saying: ""improving China's short-selling mechanism can decrease market volatility, and push market prices of securities closer to their intrinsic value.""
It will also reduce the chance of market bubbles, while creating additional income for insurers, he added. 
China cracked down on short-selling activities during the stock market crash in 2015, and blamed foreign short-sellers.
Although China has gradually relaxed short-selling rules over the past years, the size of the securities lending business remains small.
The outstanding value of securities lending stood at 149.8 billion yuan ($23.51 billion) at the end of October, less than 9% of the outstanding value for margin loans, according to official data.
CBIRC said on Friday that global securities lending business totalled 2.3 trillion euros ($2.60 trillion) at the end of 2020, and the business is a normal practice to improve secondary market liquidity. 
In the rules published on Friday, CBIRC set the eligibility threshold for the business, and urged insurers to strengthen risk controls when participating in securities lending.

540,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 04:09AM ET</span>",Everything We Know About Didi’s Plan to Delist From the NYSE,"(Bloomberg) -- Didi Global Inc (NYSE:DIDI) said on Thursday it plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange, barely five months after its ill-fated initial public offering drew the wrath of regulators in Beijing. The Chinese ride-hailing giant will pursue a Hong Kong listing instead, allowing existing shareholders to convert their holdings in the company. But Didi’s announcement was scarce on details, leaving investors -- already nursing roughly $40 billion of losses -- with several unanswered questions. 
1. Why is Didi going to delist?
Didi’s delisting comes at the behest of Chinese regulators, who had long expressed concern that going public in the U.S. could risk exposing its vast troves of data to foreign powers. Despite regulatory unease, the firm pushed ahead with its IPO in June, a move that Beijing regarded as a challenge to its authority, Bloomberg News has reported. The government reacted swiftly, announcing a cybersecurity probe into the firm days after its debut and taking its services off domestic app stores. Since then, authorities have weighed unprecedented penalties for the company, including a forced delisting. People with knowledge of the matter said last week that Beijing has directed management to come up with a plan to withdraw from the NYSE.     
Didi’s move could mark the first in a wave of Chinese delistings from the U.S. Beijing is said to be drafting regulations to effectively ban companies from going public on foreign stock markets through variable interest entities, according to people familiar with the matter, closing a loophole long used by the country’s technology industry to raise capital from overseas investors. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday announced its final plan for putting in place a new law that mandates foreign companies open their books to U.S. scrutiny or risk being kicked off the NYSE and Nasdaq within three years. 
2. How will it work?
Instead of a simple privatization from New York, Didi is opting to seek a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange first. The move will ensure that its American depositary shares will be “convertible into freely tradable shares of the Company on another internationally recognized stock exchange,” according to its statement. The firm is planning to file for the Hong Kong listing around March, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News on Friday, asking not to be identified as the plans haven’t been made public. The entire process could take three to six months to complete, First Shanghai Securities analyst Linus Yip said. 
It’s unclear whether Didi can pull off the maneuver. Prior to its U.S. IPO, the company had weighed a potential Hong Kong listing but eventually abandoned that effort after the city’s exchange, which makes far more stringent demands on companies seeking a listing than its New York peers, questioned Didi’s compliance with Chinese regulations. It didn’t have licenses to operate in certain cities and many of its drivers lacked a household registration, or hukou, for the cities where they lived, part of municipal requirements for providing on-demand ride-hailing services there, people with knowledge of the matter said in July.
3. Will U.S. investors swap their stock for shares in Hong Kong?
It depends. Didi has dropped 52% from post-IPO peak, wiping out about $42 billion of market value. SoftBank Group Corp., the largest minority shareholder in Didi, last month reported a record loss at its Vision Fund unit, in part because of the stock’s plunge. Some shareholders may use the delisting as an excuse to exit, while certain retail investors may not be equipped to hold Hong Kong shares.
But for the vast majority of institutional money managers that want to stick with Didi, swapping into a new Hong Kong listing should be relatively straightforward. One question is whether the new shares would trade with a valuation discount: Hong Kong has long been home to some of the world’s lowest price-to-earnings ratios. A gauge of tech shares in the city was on track for a record low on Friday.
4. Does the announcement mark the end of Didi’s troubles? 
Unlikely. The cybersecurity probe into Didi is still ongoing, and regulators may still impose an array of punishments ranging from a fine to a suspension of certain operations or the introduction of a state-owned investor, Bloomberg News has reported. The municipal government of Beijing, where the ride-hailing giant is based, had previously proposed that Shouqi Group -- part of the influential Beijing Tourism Group -- and others based in the capital would acquire a stake in Didi, giving state-run firms control of the company. 
Didi also needs to appease regulatory concerns over its data security. The company had previously put forth a number of a number of proposals to appease the powerful Cybersecurity Administration of China, including ceding management of its data to a private third party, Bloomberg reported in August. It’s uncertain how such an arrangement, if pursued, would impact Didi’s access to the data, which is crucial to helping the firm orchestrate 25 million rides a day between some 400 million riders and drivers.
Even if those issues are addressed, the months-long probe into Didi has likely already taken a toll. With Didi’s platforms having been barred from Chinese apps stores since July, customers and drivers alike who have upgraded their mobile phones no longer have access to its services, leaving room for smaller competitors to wrest a share of China’s ride-hailing market. President Xi Jinping’s campaign to achieve “common prosperity” has also heaped pressure on platform companies like Didi to offer better wages and benefits to its army of drivers. Agencies including the antitrust watchdog and transport ministry on Tuesday published a set of wide-ranging guidelines for the ride-hailing industry that will require firms to strengthen social insurance while adopting “reasonable” commissions.  
It’s also unclear whether top executives will emerge unscathed from the debacle. Regulators could require Didi to reshuffle its top management as punishment for defying Beijing, media including the South China Morning Post have reported. Co-founders Cheng Wei and Jean Liu, together with Senior Vice President Stephen Zhu, control about 50% of the company’s voting rights.

541,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 03:59AM ET</span>","European Stocks Higher; Payrolls, Omicron News in Focus","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Friday, seeking to end a volatile week on a positive note as investors wait for more news about the omicron Covid variant ahead of the release of important U.S. employment data.
At 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.2%. 
Equity markets around the world have suffered wild swings for much of this week amid uncertainty over the economic impact of the recently discovered omicron Covid variant. 
The European Union's public health agency said on Thursday that omicron could account for more than half of all infections in Europe within months, while Germany, Europe's biggest economy, said it would only allow those with proof of vaccination or naturally-acquired immunity into shops and restaurants. It will also make vaccination mandatory for those in the health and care systems from March.
In South Africa, where the variant first emerged, latest data show that rates for new infections and hospitalizations are rising faster than in previous waves of the pandemic.
There has been some good news, as GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) announced on Thursday that analysis indicated that its antibody-based therapeutic drug will be effective against omicron, while Roche (SIX:RO) said Friday it has developed new test kits to help researchers detect mutations in the new variant. 
Still, most investors will be focused on the release of the official U.S. monthly jobs report later Friday, looking for clues as to whether the Federal Reserve will increase the pace of its tapering in December.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 560,000 in November, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with the unemployment rate expected to drop to 4.4%.  
French industrial production climbed 0.9% on the month in October, and improvement from the 1.5% drop the previous month, while German and French services PMIs remained in expansion territory.
In corporate news, most of the news came from Asia after Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) announced it will delist from the New York stock exchange and pursue a listing in Hong Kong, just a few months after its $4.4 billion U.S. IPO, while Southeast Asian super-app Grab fell 21% on its debut after merging with a special purpose acquisition company.
Crude prices rose Friday after OPEC+ left the possibility open of a quick change in policy if fuel demand is badly hit by the travel restrictions and lockdowns put in place to combat the omicron Covid variant. 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, surprised the market by sticking with the plans to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in January, but the top producers also said they could meet again before their next scheduled meeting on Jan. 4, if needed.
By 4 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.8% higher at $68.33 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2.7% to $71.47. Both contracts are on course for a losing week, for the sixth straight week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,769.00/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1292.

542,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 03:21AM ET</span>",Drugmakers cut prices by 62% on average to get China state insurance listing,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Pharmaceutical firms have agreed to cut prices by 61.7% on average for 67 medicines to be included in China's national medical insurance coverage in a new round of negotiations, Chinese authorities said on Friday.
Inclusion on the National Reimbursement Drugs List has helped many global drugmakers such as Merck & Co Inc and Novartis AG book strong product sales growth in China in recent years, as their products have become more widely available.
The newly added 67 medicines are branded drugs with no generic versions available in China and include blockbusters such as Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY)'s psoriasis treatment Taltz and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s multiple myeloma drug Darzalex, according to the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA).
Products from domestic companies such as InnoCare Pharma Ltd and  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE) Ltd were also included. 
Last year, drugmakers agreed to an average price cut of around 50% for more than 100 medicines, underscoring China's strong bargaining power, as it seeks to make more drugs affordable for its 1.4 billion people.
The deepest price cut among the 67 medicines was 94%, NHSA official Huang Huabo told a news conference without naming the product.
In negotiations with Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) for its rare neuromuscular disease drug Nusinersen, the government negotiator told a company official that the firm should ""work harder"" in giving price cuts, stressing that the government's price cap was non-negotiable, before the sides reached an agreement, video clips from state broadcaster CCTV showed.
Biogen did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
In another example showing the state's heavy influence, Danish diabetes drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) A/S last month said its sales growth would slow by 3% in 2022 because of lower prices and reduced sales volume in China.
Insulin makers agreed last month to cut prices by 48% on average to be qualified to bulk supply public hospitals.

For certain medicines already included in the reimbursement list such as PD-1 inhibitors from Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co Ltd and BeiGene, the government widened their coverage by adding more disease types. 
Apart from the 67 brand-name drugs, seven medicines with generic versions were also added to the list, while 11 medicines of low clinical value were removed, NHSA said.

(Reuters) - Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) will reach its target of 50% sales from smoke-free products by 2025 through organic revenue growth rather than mergers and acquisitions, its CEO told Reuters.
The maker of Marlboro cigarettes has spent more than $8 billion on reduced risk products since it began developing them a decade ago, Chief Executive Jacek Olczak said in an interview during the Reuters Next conference.
About 30% of revenue at Philip Morris now comes from ""smoke-free"" products such as iQOS tobacco heating devices, Olczak added on Thursday. 
Philip Morris has also set a target of generating $1 billion in sales from non-nicotine products by 2025 as part of its evolution into a broader ""healthcare and wellness"" company.
""The way we look at these targets, we achieved the current 30% organically and I believe we can get to 50% by continuing this organic growth,"" Olczak said, adding: ""Our $1 billion target of achieving sales from non-nicotine products we can also to a very large extent achieve organically.""
Olczak's comments come nearly two months after Philip Morris bought British inhaler-maker Vectura, a deal which faced opposition from public health experts who questioned whether a tobacco group should own a company that cures the respiratory illnesses which cigarettes cause.
Asked if he was surprised by the backlash, Olczak said there were ""a few voices of criticism"" and that he expected ""negative emotions"" to fade as Vectura launches products over the next few years that will address unmet patient and consumer needs.
Since it was announced in July, critics have put concerted pressure on shareholders and the government to block the deal. 
In August, a group of more than 35 health charities, experts and doctors across the world wrote to shareholders over the damaging effect tobacco has on United Nations sustainable development goals, following up with a letter to the British government to look at conflict of interest issues in September. 
""Nothing we are doing should come as a surprise, we are putting in action the visions that we shared openly seven or so years ago about leaving cigarettes behind,"" Olczak said.

""This is completely moving the company in another direction.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Didi Global said on Friday it will delist from the New York stock exchange and pursue a listing in Hong Kong, the latest development after it ran afoul of Chinese regulators by pushing ahead with its $4.4 billion U.S. IPO in July. 
Didi's decision to delist in the U.S. comes as a deepening regulatory crackdown wiped billions of dollars off the ride-hailing giant's valuation. [
Following are key events since Didi publicly announced its intention to list in the United States:
June 11 - Beijing-based Didi makes public the filing for its U.S. listing, setting the stage for what is expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering of 2021.
June 17 - Reuters reports that China's market regulator has begun an antitrust probe into Didi, citing three people with knowledge of the matter.
The probe, the latest in a sweeping crackdown on China's so-called ""platform"" companies, is investigating whether Didi used any competitive practices that squeezed out smaller rivals unfairly, and whether the pricing mechanism used by Didi's core ride-hailing business is transparent enough, sources said.
June 30 - Didi raises $4.4 billion in its IPO, pricing it at the top of its indicated range and increasing the number of shares sold, giving it a valuation of $73 billion on a fully diluted basis and $67.5 billion on a non-diluted basis. 
The shares end their first day of trading slightly above the IPO price.
July 2 - The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) says it has launched an investigation into Didi to protect national security and the public interest, and that Didi was not allowed to register new users during the probe, sending Didi shares lower.
Didi says it plans a comprehensive examination of cybersecurity risks and would cooperate fully with the relevant government authority. 
July 4 - The CAC orders Chinese app stores to stop offering Didi's app after finding that the firm had illegally collected users' personal data.
Didi says it had stopped registering new users and would remove its app from app stores, as well as making changes to comply with rules and protect users' rights. It says the move may hurt its revenue.
July 5-6 - Didi says it was unaware before its IPO that the CAC would launch a cybersecurity investigation or order a halt in China to new user registrations and a suspension of app downloads.
Didi shares fall as much as 25% in the first U.S. trading session since Chinese regulators ordered its app off mobile app stores in China.
July 8 - Medical data group LinkDoc Technology becomes the first Chinese company to pull back from plans to list in the United States after regulators started an investigation into Didi.
July 30 - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says it will not allow Chinese companies to raise money in the United States unless they fully explain their legal structures and disclose the risk of Beijing interfering in their businesses.
Aug 10 - SoftBank says it will pause its investing in China as it waits for regulatory action against the country's tech firms to play out.
Aug 11 - Autonomous driving startup Pony.ai suspends its plan to go public in New York through a merger with a blank-check firm at a $12 billion valuation, after it failed to gain assurances from Beijing that it would not become a target of a crackdown against Chinese technology companies, people familiar with the matter say.
Aug 27 - China is framing rules to ban internet companies whose data poses potential security risks from listing outside the country, including in the United States, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Sept 2 - Chinese regulators summon 11 ride-hailing firms including Didi, Geely's Caocao and Meituan's ride-hailing unit to discuss points of concern.
Sept 3 - The city of Beijing is considering taking Didi under state control, Bloomberg News reports.
Sept 4 - Didi denied reports that the Beijing city government is coordinating companies to invest in it.
Sept 7 - Beijing city government told Reuters in a faxed statement it was not advising companies to invest in Didi.
Sept 8 - China's Ministry of Transport said it would crack down on illegal behaviour in the country's ride-hailing industry.
Sept 10 - Chinese government officials told leading delivery and ride-hailing companies including Didi, Meituan,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group's Ele.me and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), to improve how they distributed incomes and ensure rest periods for workers.
Sept 20 - Didi co-founder and President Jean Liu has told some close associates that she intends to step down, Reuters reported.
Sept 30 - China published new draft measures aimed at bolstering its new data security law, including definitions of what it considered ""core"" and ""important"" data.
Oct 21 - China's cybersecurity watchdog suggested Didi and two other U.S.-listed tech companies explore listings in Hong Kong, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Oct 29 - CAC published draft guidelines that will subject companies with more than 1 million users in the country to a security review before they can send user-related data abroad.
Nov 8 - SoftBank Group Corp valued its Didi stake at $7.5 billion, 40% below acquisition cost.
Nov 11 - Didi was preparing to relaunch its ride-hailing and other apps in China by the end of the year in anticipation that Beijing's investigation into the company will be wrapped up by then, Reuters reported.
Nov 14 - CAC published draft rules that would require companies pursuing share listings in Hong Kong to apply for cybersecurity inspections if they handle data that concerns national security. Large internet platforms planning to set up headquarters, operating or research centres abroad should also submit a report to regulators, CAC said.

Nov 26 - Chinese regulators have pressed top executives of Didi to devise a plan to delist from the New York Stock Exchange due to concerns about data security, sources said.
Dec 3 - Didi announced plan to delist from New York and seek a Hong Kong listing.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 02:21AM ET</span>",Reaction to Didi Global's plans to delist from New York,"(Reuters) -Following are reactions to ride-hailing giant Didi Global's decision to delist from the New York stock exchange and pursue a listing in Hong Kong, succumbing to pressure from Chinese regulators concerned about data security.
Didi ran afoul of Chinese authorities by pushing ahead with its $4.4 billion U.S. IPO in July despite being asked to put it on hold while a review of its data practices was conducted.
SHIFARA SAMSUDEEN, LIGHTSTREAM RESEARCH ANALYST, WHO PUBLISHES ON RESEARCH PLATFORM SMARTKARMA:
""As we expected, Didi will first delist its shares from the NYSE and start filing for listing on HKEX. The company is already facing class action lawsuit in the US, and we think Didi will buy back its shares at the same IPO price of US$14 per share. However, it may not be able to relist its shares in HK at the same price (rather at a lower price) given there will be stringent control by the state over its use of user's personal data (which will place it at a disadvantage) and location related issues such as liquidity, etc.
""Beijing is also sending a warning to the entire internet sector in China to be ready to face more regulations and is likely to keep foreign investors away from Chinese tech stocks for some time."" 
ZHAN KAI, LAWYER AT EAST & CONCORD PARTNERS, SHANGHAI:
""Technically speaking, Didi's U.S listing was not compliant with Chinese data security regulations.
""From a political perspective, China and the U.S. have so far failed to reach an agreement on supervising U.S.-listed firms. Apparently, the Chinese government hopes companies can choose Hong Kong as listing venue.""
WANG QI, CEO AT FUND MANAGER MEGATRUST INVESTMENT (HK), HONG KONG:
""Chinese ADRs face increasing regulatory challenges from both U.S. and Chinese authorities. For most companies it will be like walking on eggshells trying to please both sides. Delisting will only make things simpler.""
NAN LI, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, FINANCE AT SHANGHAI JIAOTONG UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI:
""Well, again no surprise to me. This is the only way that Didi can survive, and this is maybe a good thing for the investors in the U.S. market. There are other issues related to Didi in addition to the data security. Didi also embedded financial services on their platform, they withheld the payment to the drivers, charge high fees for drivers, make loans with high interest rates etc. And the inherent problems of the share-riding due to the fact there is no appropriate regulation of the bad behavior of the drivers.
""I don't think Didi qualifies to be listed anywhere before it separates the data platform services with financial services, and sets up an effective protocols to manage and ensure the drives' responsibility and benefits.""
JUSTIN TANG, HEAD OF ASIAN RESEARCH AT UNITED FIRST PARTNERS, SINGAPORE:
""The listing of Didi was largely expected given the crackdown post its IPO. It will now set a precedent for other U.S. listed companies, especially those with data concerns.
""The crackdown started with Ant's botched IPO. The Chinese government has already shown that it will go beyond what the market has expected. It will be a while before sentiments thaw in relation to Chinese names.""
KENNY NG, SECURITIES STRATEGIST, EVERBRIGHT SUN HUNG KAI, HONG KONG:
""Didi's plan to delist in the United States and the listing of Hong Kong stocks I believe will have an obvious impact on location decisions for large technology stocks' future listings.  At the same time, this event makes the market believe that the current industry supervision of technology stocks in the mainland will continue, and the decline in the stock prices of technology stocks listed in Hong Kong today also reflects this factor.
""On the other hand, Didi, the company itself, also has its own unique factors. Because Didi's business has more data related to customer information, which is leading the regulatory authorities to pay it special attention.""
MING LU, AEQUITAS RESEARCH ANALYST, SHANGHAI:
""I think this change does not bring anything positive for Didi's investors. The authorities have not announced a final punishment on Didi and the investigation is still going on after more than 100 days. So far, the risk for Didi and its shareholders is still unlimited.""
KYLE RODDA, IG ANALYST, MELBOURNE: 
""In the short- to medium-term, this means volatility for pockets of the market that are really exposed to global trade and U.S.-China geopolitics specifically, and you might start to see some pressure on Hong Kong stocks, which have tended to look to raise capital in the United States but base themselves in China and draw most of their profits from the Chinese economy.
""Longer term this is more significant, because this is going to be one of those frogs in a beaker scenarios where very, very slowly there's going to be a decoupling between the U.S. and China in terms of their economic relationship, as well as their enmeshment with one another in the global financial system.""
TOM NUNLIST, SENIOR ANALYST AT CONSULTANCY TRIVIUM CHINA, BEIJING:

""My two main thoughts at this point are: If confirmed that CAC really is the main actor behind the push, then big flex for the regulator. Would be a further indication of it's rising power and influence.
""The apparent issue is data security, but we still don't have great insight into what the specific concern is. This is the outstanding question.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche's newly acquired subsidiary TIB Molbiol has developed three new test kits to help researchers detect mutations in the new Omicron variant of coronavirus, Roche said on Friday.
Governments around the world are urgently scouring databases for recent cases of COVID-19 infections, screening travellers and decoding the viral genomes of the new variant as they try to measure how far it has spread.
Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified Omicron as a SARS-CoV-2 ""variant of concern"", saying it might spread more quickly than other forms.
""We are able to offer a test that can specifically identify the novel B.1.1.529 Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant to help better understand its spread and behaviour,"" Thomas Schinecker, head of Roche Diagnostics, said in a statement.
While the WHO has said widely available tests can detect individuals infected with any variant, most PCR tests cannot distinguish between Omicron and Delta, the dominant and most infectious version of the virus.
Until now, the world body has recommended only the TaqPath test produced by U.S. firm Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) as a proxy.
The new Roche and TIB Molbiol testing kits, made only for research use, can differentiate between unique mutations in Omicron compared to other SARS-CoV-2 variants, Roche said.

They can thus help researchers detect Omicron and study its spread versus other variants. Roche said they could also be used to monitor the potential impact of therapeutics, vaccines, and public health interventions on the spread of variants.
Roche acquired Berlin-based TIB Molbiol on Dec. 1 to expand its PCR-test portfolio to combat new infectious diseases.

549,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 01:59AM ET</span>","European Stock Futures Higher; Caution Ahead of Payrolls, Omicron News","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to edge higher at the open Friday, helped by the sharp rebound on Wall Street as investors wait for more news about the omicron Covid variant ahead of the release of important U.S. employment data.
At 2:20 AM ET (0720 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
Equity markets around the world have seen volatile trading for much of this week amid uncertainty over the economic impact of the recently discovered omicron Covid variant. 
Helping the tone in Europe Friday was the significant bounce on Wall Street overnight, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average surging over 600 points, or 1.8%.
However, any gains are likely to be tempered with caution after Australia became the the latest country on Friday to report an omicron case, suggesting the travel restrictions put in place to combat its spread are having little impact.
The European Union's public health agency said on Thursday that omicron could account for more than half of all infections in Europe within months, while Germany, Europe's biggest economy, said it would only allow those with proof of vaccination or naturally-acquired immunity into shops and restaurants. It will also make vaccination mandatory for those in the health and care systems from March.
The scheduled release of the official U.S. monthly jobs report later Friday is also likely to prompt vigilance, with markets looking for clues as to whether the Federal Reserve will increase the pace of its tapering in December.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 560,000 in November, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with the unemployment rate expected to drop to 4.4%.  
In corporate news, the tech sector is likely to be in focus after the news that Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) will delist from the New York stock exchange and pursue a listing in Hong Kong, just a few months after its $4.4 billion U.S. IPO, while Southeast Asian super-app Grab fell 21% on its debut after merging with a special purpose acquisition company.
Crude prices rose Friday after OPEC+ left the possibility open of a quick change in policy if fuel demand is badly hit by the travel restrictions and lockdowns put in place to combat the omicron Covid variant. 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, surprised the market by sticking with the plans to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in January, but the top producers also said they could meet again before their next scheduled meeting on Jan. 4, if needed.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $67.62 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.6% to $70.81. Both contracts are on course for a losing week, for the sixth straight week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,772.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1284.

551,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 01:56AM ET</span>","As global costs soar, Japan's 'shrinkflation' gets harder to swallow","By Kantaro Komiya and Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - It was a chocolate biscuit that turned Masayuki Iwasa, a self-professed penny-pincher with a sweet tooth, into one of Japan's most scrupulous chroniclers of ""shrinkflation"".
Having sworn off his favourite Chocoliere tartlets for a decade after Bourbon Corp reduced the package size, the newspaper delivery man and part-time stock trader was spurred to action around two years ago after he noticed the biscuits had also gotten smaller.
""I was annoyed they were shrinking and shrinking,"" said the 45-year-old Iwasa, whose website, http://www.neage.jp (price increases), documents surreptitious price hikes.
Today he tracks prices of some 400 goods and services - everything from washing powder to day passes at Tokyo Disneyland. The bulk of his website is devoted to so-called shrinkflation, when a product gets smaller but the price stays the same.
""In Japan, the impact of deflation means it is difficult to raise prices directly, so shrinkflation is a kind of a measure of last resort,"" Iwasa said. ""But basically it's sneaky and it bothers me.""
While the practice is hardly unique to Japan -  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) sparked a global outcry when it reduced the size of the Toblerone chocolate bar in 2016 - its prevalence in the world's No.3 economy is a notable legacy of years of deflation.
Because consumer prices and wages barely budged for the last two decades, companies have become reluctant to increase prices for fear of losing customers. 
That's a headache for policymakers, who ultimately want to see higher prices that are an essential component to a virtuous spending cycle that drives economic growth, especially as the population ages and declines.
There are now signs that even Japan Inc may be nearing a tipping point, as soaring raw material costs and a weak yen drive up what companies pay for fuel, coffee beans and beef.
While only 14% of Japanese firms have so far passed on higher costs to customers, another 40% say they plan to, a recent Reuters poll showed.
Yet food companies are among the least willing to pass on costs, the survey showed, reflecting their fear of alienating shoppers.
""As the price of raw materials increases, food manufacturers would like to raise prices but it is difficult for them to do that,"" said Tsutomu Watanabe, an economics professor at the University of Tokyo.
Watanabe said many companies will balk at outright price increases, just as they did in 2008 during another commodities surge and in 2013-2014 when the yen weakened sharply, leaving shrinkflation as one of the few ways to protect margins.
CONSUMER BACKLASH
In 2008, Bourbon cut the number of Chocoliere biscuits in a 150 yen ($1.30) packet to 14 from 16, citing higher costs, according to Iwasa's website, which uses company announcements, internet archives and other public information to track prices.
Bourbon later shaved just under a gram off each of the confections, reducing the packet size to 110.6 grams from 122.5 grams.
The company did not respond to requests for comment.
Kameda Seika Co was hit with criticism this year after it reduced the contents of packages of its ""kaki pi"" rice cracker and peanut mix by 5% to 190 grams.
The size was cut because Kameda could no longer offset rising commodity and transport costs with belt-tightening elsewhere, a spokesperson told Reuters. 
Calbee Inc said it will reduce the contents of some of its potato chips and Jagarico potato sticks by about 5% from next month. Separately, it will raise prices of more than a dozen potato chip products by up to 10%.
The snack maker received more negative feedback from customers over the shrinkage than the price hikes, said spokesperson Satoshi Yoshida.
""There may be customers who have had such a negative experience in which they felt deceived and have a bad memory of it,"" he said.
Lotte Co was criticised when it announced a renewal of its Bacchus chocolates in Japan last year, without mentioning it had cut the package to 10 pieces from 12, according to posts online.
Spokesperson Yuichi Nitanai confirmed the reduction but declined to comment further.
The government's official consumer price index takes into account reduced package sizes, said an official at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which compiles the index.
But the impact of shrinkflation may still not be fully reflected in that data because the government index tends to use leading brands, whereas shrinkflation is more prevalent at lesser known companies, said University of Tokyo's Watanabe.

""Top firms have a certain amount of pride and don't want to be seen doing something that looks unattractive such as shrinkflation,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Two Georgia election workers targeted by former U.S. President Donald Trump in a vote-rigging conspiracy theory have sued a far-right website that trumpeted the false story, alleging it incited months of death threats and harassment against them.
The defamation suit against The Gateway Pundit was filed Thursday by Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, a voter registration officer in the Fulton County elections office, and her mother, Ruby Freeman, who was a temp worker for the 2020 election. The women were featured in a Reuters report published Wednesday on their ordeal.
The lawsuit names the Pundit, its founder and editor Jim Hoft, and his brother, writer Joe Hoft. It alleges they repeatedly published demonstrably false claims that portrayed the women as “traitors” who conspired to “steal the presidential election in Georgia.”
A lawyer for Jim Hoft and The Gateway Pundit did not immediately respond to a comment request Thursday morning. Joe Hoft did not respond to a comment request. 
The lawsuit, filed in St. Louis Circuit Court, alleges that the Pundit’s “lies” about Freeman and Moss “devastated” their reputations and “instigated a deluge of intimidation, harassment, and threats that has forced them to change their phone numbers, delete their online accounts, and fear for their physical safety.” the suit says. Freeman went into hiding.
The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, revolves around false allegations first raised by a volunteer Trump campaign attorney at a Dec. 3 hearing of Georgia state legislators. Freeman and Moss worked in heavily Democratic Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, where a strong showing by Democrat Joe Biden helped give him a narrow Georgia victory. 
Trump, a Republican, and his surrogates falsely alleged that Freeman and Moss pulled “suitcases” full of fake ballots for Biden and processed them late at night on Election Day, Nov. 3, after most poll workers and election observers left. 
State officials including Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger quickly and forcefully debunked the allegations, explaining that the “suitcases” were standard ballot containers and the votes were properly counted under the watch of an independent monitor and a state investigator.
The Gateway Pundit covered the false allegations in multiple stories, including one that identified Freeman by name with the headline: “What’s Up, Ruby? Crooked Operative Filmed Pulling Out Suitcases of Ballots in Georgia IS IDENTIFIED.” The Pundit identified Moss in another story.

The Pundit stories continued through the summer, even as multiple audits and reviews confirmed the accuracy of Fulton County’s vote results. 
“I couldn't have imagined the lies that The Gateway Pundit would tell about me, pushing people to harass me and my family and to threaten us with violence,” Freeman said in a statement issued by her lawyers.

(Reuters) - Company executives are beginning to consider different permanent work models for their employees as the coronavirus pandemic, and the spread of the Omicron variant, destabilize their latest return-to-office plans. 
With Omicron so new, companies are struggling to understand how the variant might affect their operations and profits. Most have taken a wait-and-see stance as they weigh how fast the variant may spread and its potential harmfulness, although Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google was indefinitely delaying its return-to-office plan around the world. 
Luxury toilet maker Lixil Corp's chief people officer, Jin Montesano, told the Reuters Next conference this week that the company has deviated from Japan's rigid work structure by dumping core working hours and morning meetings, and rethinking what the office should be. 
""It's no longer the place to work ... wherever you get work done is where you work,"" said Montesano during a panel discussion on the Future of Work. ""What we want to do is reimagine the office.""
Countries moved swiftly this week to impose bans or tougher testing rules on travel after the Omicron variant was first uncovered in southern Africa.
""We almost could compare it to a war situation,"" Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) CEO Jacek Olczak said to Reuters at the conference. ""Everyone pretends that things are getting normal, but it is not normal. We have all changed.""
Dr. Neal Mills, chief medical officer for benefits consulting firm Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc, said his team has been meeting with clients all week about possible new options.
""They are recognizing that they are going to need to revisit many of the decisions they've made. If this changes how effective treatments are, what is the level of risk the organization is willing to tolerate in bringing employees back in January?"" he told Reuters.
The World Health Organization said as more countries report cases, the new COVID-19 variant carries a ""very high"" global risk of surges. Scientists have said it could take weeks to understand its severity, although early indications were that most cases were mild.
The prospect of a fast-spreading variant has raised fears of a return of the sort of restrictions that shut down a swath of industries in 2020. 
""Companies at this point have created time lines for people to come back to the office and then delayed them so many times that what I'm hearing is they are looking to not commit until there's certainty,"" said Jeff Levin-Scherz, a managing director with benefits consulting firm Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) Plc. 
More than half of U.S. employers (57%) surveyed by Willis Towers Watson either require or plan to require vaccinations, in a poll released on Tuesday but which was conducted before Omicron was discovered.
Additionally, the survey found slightly more than a third of employees were working remotely - and that was expected to drop to 27% in the first quarter of 2022.
Wall Street banks, for instance, are not immediately changing their return-to-work plans, but like many industries are closely monitoring the situation. Global airlines are bracing for the possibility they could be forced to juggle schedules. 
""We are in what I would call the uptick mode, but ... there could be various concerns coming up at any time, and we need to adjust our schedules accordingly,"" Emirates Airline President Tim Clark said at the Reuters conference.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co's CEO, James Quincey, said his company has learned throughout the pandemic.
""Each successive wave of lockdown had less of an impact on our business,"" he said this week at the Redburn CEO conference. ""That adaptability and flexibility ... makes us feel better.""
COMPANIES IN LIMBO 
Meanwhile, companies that operate in the United States are being squeezed between President Joe Biden's administration, which has pushed for companies to mandate vaccinations, and the courts.
On Tuesday, two courts blocked the administration from enforcing mandates requiring millions of American workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Biden unveiled regulations in September to increase the U.S. adult vaccination rate as a way of fighting the pandemic, which has killed more than 750,000 Americans and weighed on the economy. 
The most sweeping regulation, a workplace vaccine-or-testing mandate for businesses with at least 100 employees, was temporarily blocked by a federal appeals court in early November.
The orders had been seen as providing cover for companies to require workers to get vaccinated, and the court rulings leave them in limbo as they push to get workers back into workplaces. 
Of course, for some companies, the ""office"" is still preferred.

""Nearly two-thirds of my customers are men buying jewelry for their girlfriends, wives, grandmothers or children. And we know that men buying jewelry need help,"" Alexander Lacik, CEO of jewelry maker Pandora (OTC:PANDY), said at the Reuters conference.

SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Thursday sued to block U.S. chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp's more than $80 billion planned acquisition of British chip technology provider Arm, adding to already significant global regulatory challenges of the deal.
The FTC said the proposed deal would give one of the largest chip companies control over computing technology and designs that competitors rely on to develop their own competing chips.
The deal has been widely expected to fall apart after facing opposition in the chip industry. British regulators said last month they would launch an in-depth probe of the deal, and it is also under scrutiny in the European Union. 
Arm licenses its chip architecture and blueprints to major chipmakers Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, underpinning the global smartphone ecosystem. Arm was sold to Japan's SoftBank in 2016.
Nvidia said it would ""work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition.""
Arm declined to comment.
The stock-heavy deal has more than doubled in value since it was announced in September 2020 as Nvidia shares have risen on the performance of its data center business. Nvidia will owe only a $1.25 billion breakup fee if the deal does not close, and its shares closed up 2.2% at $321.26 on Thursday.
""Nobody thinks the deal is going to close,"" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein. ""The data center story has been really playing out. The software narrative has become a bigger piece of the story. I would love to see this deal, but I don't think they need it.""
Before Nvidia's offer, Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) had planned to file for an initial public offering for Arm. While Arm's revenue is growing briskly, rising 56.3% to $1.46 billion in the six months ended Sept. 30, it is unclear whether Arm, in an IPO, would fetch anything close to the $80 billion in value offered by Nvidia.
That would be a new blow for the Japanese conglomerate whose Vision Fund assets sank by $10 billion last month, driven by plummeting valuations for investments in Chinese e-commerce firm  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and ride-hailing service Didi Global Inc. 
The FTC, which is made up of two Republicans and two Democrats, voted 4-0 to approve the challenge to the planned merger.
'HIGHER PRICES AND LESS CHOICE'
The FTC alleged ""the proposed merger would give Nvidia the ability and incentive to use its control of this technology to undermine its competitors, reducing competition and ultimately resulting in reduced product quality, reduced innovation, higher prices, and less choice, harming the millions of Americans who benefit from Arm-based products.""
The FTC added the combined firm ""would have the means and incentive to stifle innovative next-generation technologies, including those used to run datacenters and driver-assistance systems in cars.""
Some semiconductor firms such as MediaTek Inc and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc have voiced support for the deal. But other firms such as Qualcomm have opposed it over concerns that Nvidia would have a first look at key technologies that they depend on and could then have better insights into their future products.
Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang, made a biting comment at an industry dinner last month, saying that Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon, who recently took the helm of an industry trade group, had proven to be a master advocate in the battle over Arm. Qualcomm had its own extensive battles with global regulators, including the FTC, which Qualcomm prevailed over after the regulator brought an antitrust lawsuit against it.

""He's the perfect person to advocate for our industry,"" Huang said from a stage as Amon sat in the audience. ""I was trying to figure out, how is it possible that Cristiano knew every single regulator on the planet, and by the time I got there to tell them about my story on Arm, he was already there advocating against it?"" Huang said, to stunned laughter from the crowd. 
The FTC said it has cooperated closely with staff of the competition agencies in the European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China will cut to no more than 10 days the time required for approval of travel by U.S. business executives, its ambassador to the United States said on Thursday, promising to turn ""an attentive ear"" to concerns raised by businesses.
Qin Gang, who arrived in the United States in July, told a dinner hosted by the US-China Business Council that Beijing would also work to make COVID-19 testing more convenient and allow executives to work during quarantine.
Qin said Beijing was adopting President Xi Jinping's direction on upgrading ""fast track"" travel arrangements, a response to U.S. concerns about resumption of business travel announced after Xi met U.S. President Joe Biden last month. 
""With the upgraded arrangement, the time needed for travel approval will be shorter, no more than 10 working days,"" he said.
Qin said Beijing would share its specific workplan ""very soon"" with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
He said Beijing was committed to implementing the spirit of the recent virtual summit of Xi and Biden, and injecting ""more positive energy into our relations.""
Qin called for strengthened co-operation in manufacturing, financial services and the energy sector.
He also repeated Beijing's call for Washington to abolish additional tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the administration of former President Donald Trump.
Marc Allen, chief strategy officer for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, welcomed the announcement of fast track travel, and a separate decision by China's aviation authority to issue an airworthiness directive on the Boeing 737 MAX, which will pave the way for the model's return to service in China after more than 2-1/2 years.
At the same gathering, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment Jose Fernandez repeated a litany of U.S. complaints about China’s business practices and stressed the need for a level playing field for U.S. companies.
He reiterated U.S. concerns about human rights, including alleged forced labor, in China's Xinjiang region and highlighted U.S. government warnings to business about the risks of operating in Hong Kong.

He told the business leaders operating in China they should keep in mind that they are ""not bystanders in the broader economic and strategic relationship.""
""Above all, please be mindful how your activities can affect U.S. national security and the fundamental values that we all hold dear,"" he said.

556,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 11:26PM ET</span>","To fight Omicron, Biden sets new travel rules and adds free COVID tests","By Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Thursday laid out his strategy to fight the Omicron and Delta coronavirus variants over the winter, including free and insurer-funded at-home COVID-19 testing and new requirements for international travelers.
The U.S. government will require private health insurers to reimburse their 150 million customers for the cost of over-the-counter, at-home COVID-19 tests, administration officials said, and make 50 million tests available free through rural clinics and health centers for the uninsured.
Reimbursement for tests will not kick in, however, until January, missing the crucial holiday period when many families and groups gather indoors.
""We're going to fight this variant with science and speed, not chaos and confusion,"" Biden said at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, while warning that infections will rise this winter. 
""The actions I'm announcing are ones that all Americans can rally behind and should unite us in the fight against COVID-19,"" he said. 
The administration is urging all eligible Americans to get vaccinated or obtain booster shots to fight the virus and protect against Omicron, which is spreading quickly around the world. It plans to increase family vaccination sites and expand availability at pharmacies. 
Less than 60% of the U.S. population, or 196 million people, have been fully vaccinated, one of the lowest rates among wealthy nations. The administration says an additional 100 million are eligible for boosters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all vaccinated adults should get a booster in light of waning protection over time and the emergence of Omicron.
The United States also plans to require inbound international passengers to be tested for COVID-19 within one day of departure, regardless of vaccination status. Mask requirements on airplanes, trains and public transportation vehicles will be extended to March 18.
The new plan will also improve care for those who get COVID-19, tripling the number of “surge response teams” that provide extra staff at hospitals that are overrun with patients to 60 from its current level, Biden said. 
It will speed more medications ""recommended by real doctors not conspiracy theorists,"" he added. 
The efforts to expand testing and shots come as the world faces new threats from the Omicron variant, and the United States confronts a heavily entrenched, politically fueled anti-vaccination culture.
Fears about the variant have pounded financial markets and created doubts about the speed of the global economic recovery as the pandemic rages on.
The White House is considering further restrictions and ways to boost testing and vaccinations that will depend on the severity of the variant, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. 
INSURERS SEEK CLARITY
Psaki told reporters earlier on Thursday that the Biden administration would clarify whether private health insurance companies would get government money to reimburse customers for over-the-counter tests when it releases guidance on the issue by mid January.
A White House official said later on Thursday, however, that the government will not reimburse private health insurers for the cost of at-home tests. Insurers were required to cover diagnostic testing for COVID-19 ""without any cost-sharing requirements during the public health emergency,"" the official said.
Additional free tests at healthcare clinics should be available as soon as this month, Psaki said. 
Biden said free tests would be available for pickup at thousands of convenient locations for those without private insurance.
""The bottom line: This winter, you'll be able to test for free in the comfort of your home and have some peace of mind,"" he said.
The largest U.S. employer-based health insurers include  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS). Currently, insurers are reimbursed a set amount by the government for most medically necessary COVID-19 tests performed in labs and medical offices. 
Kristine Grow, spokesperson for insurance industry lobby AHIP, said the industry is working with the administration to make sure the impact of any testing plan is fully understood. Areas of concern include price gouging on these tests, higher premiums and clear rules and guidance for implementation, she said. 
Morningstar analyst Julie Utterback said she views the government’s plan as a shift in the potential site of testing, rather than a significant increase in costs for health insurers, assuming at-home tests can be accepted as valid.
""To control the spread of the virus from a policy perspective, I see the logic in trying to keep infected people at home instead of forcing them to interact with people outside their household when they are experiencing symptoms,"" Utterback said.

Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said the strategy could come at a notable cost for health insurers, with the coverage requirement possibly lasting through the first half of the year.
More than 786,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States, including 37,000 in November alone.

So far, the C919, China's attempt to rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, has completed only 34 certification tests out of 276 planned, Yang Zhenmei, a Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) official, told reporters. 
Reuters in September reported COMAC has found it harder to meet certification and production targets for the C919 amid tough U.S. export rules, according to three people with knowledge of the programme.
China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp Ltd said in August it expected to receive its first C919 by the end of the year, but that would require the model to be certified.

COMAC is years behind its initial certification schedule and it did not take the C919 to China's biggest air show in Zhuhai in September.
C919 Chief Designer Wu Guanghui last month recommended CAAC continue to focus on certification as a priority for next year and asked it to step up resources to help with the delivery and commercial operations of the plane.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, with investors continuing to evaluate the risks from the new omicron COVID-19 variant. U.S. Treasury yields pared a climb over U.S. Federal Reserve comments suggesting it could quicken the pace of its asset tapering.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.11% by 9:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.18%. The Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was 52.1 in November.
Hong Kong-listed developer  Kaisa Group  Holdings Ltd. (HK:1638) also failed to win approval for its proposed debt swap.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.27%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.21% and South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.10%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched down 0.10%.
The Fed laid out the case for faster asset tapering via officials including Fed Governor Randal Quarles, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell holds a similar stance, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying she understands the “reasoning” behind the Fed’s plans.
Some investors remain cautious, even as some worries about omicron have receded over hopes that current vaccines will remain effective or be adjusted.
“The environment in markets is changing,"" Citigroup Private Bank chief investment strategist Steven Wieting told Bloomberg.
“Monetary policy, fiscal policy are all losing steam. It doesn’t mean a down market. But it’s not going to be like the rebound, the sharp recovery that we had for almost every asset in the past year.”

Meanwhile, Chinese shares listed in the U.S. recorded losses on Thursday, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced final plans to implement a new law. The law mandates foreign companies to open their books or risk being kicked off the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq within three years.

The firm had sought to exchange the dollar notes maturing Dec. 7 for new ones due 18 months later. The offer to exchange the notes failed to meet the required 95% approval rate. Kaisa became the first Chinese developer to default on such bonds in 2015.

Tightened lending curbs in the real estate industry early this year has exacerbated financial troubles at some property developers, triggering sector-wide liquidity stress.
China Evergrande, one of the country's biggest developers, has struggled to make payments on billions of dollars worth of bonds, while smaller peers have likewise missed payments or had their credit ratings downgraded.
On Thursday, liquor and meat producer Beijing Shunxin Agriculture Co Ltd said it planned to sell its entire stake in a money-losing property unit.
The announcement came two weeks after liquor product maker Hainan Yedao Group Co Ltd said it would sell its 40% stake in a property company to focus on core businesses and improve liquidity.
Dozens of China-listed companies, including Xiamen ITG Group Corp Ltd, Aoyuan Beauty Valley Technology Co and Zhangtian Financial Group Co Ltd have announced plans to dispose of property businesses so far this year, the state-run Securities Times reported.

Reflecting the real estate sector's liquidity crunch, data from the China Trust Association showed outstanding investment from trust firms fell below 2 trillion yuan ($313.66 billion) at the end of the third quarter, down 26% from a year earlier.

Fertitta Entertainment had moved to terminate the deal, first agreed in February, on Wednesday.
FAST said on Thursday Fertitta's delay in delivering its financial statements is why the deal has not been closed by the termination date, and so it has no right to unilaterally end the merger agreement. 
Fertitta had in June expanded its agreement to go public with blank-check company FAST Acquisition Corp to include a few hospitality and restaurant entities.

(Reuters) - Sustainability-focused investors believe a little effort can go a long way toward finding profitable opportunities buried in incomplete corporate environmental or social impact filings.
That is according to several speakers on a panel at  the  Reuters Next conference, who described how they choose sustainable investments and work with executives at a time when there are few standard requirements for how major U.S. and European companies should detail carbon emissions disclosures or workforce demographics.
Eoin Murray, head of investment at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), said the disparate reports from many companies give portfolio managers the chance to dig deeper. 
""As an active manager, there's a part of me which doesn't mind that some of the data doesn't entirely line up, because it means the rewards go to those that do their homework properly and unearth the real gems,"" Murray said.
Mary Jane McQuillen, a managing director for ClearBridge Investments, said while some companies are eager to become more sustainable, others are defensive and don't want to be burdened by yet another topic of investor interest.
A third group, McQuillen said, admits there is much about sustainable reporting they don't know, and is seeking input from their shareholders.
""They say, 'we really don't know what the issues are. If you can help us as an owner, and with your years of experience as an investor in understanding how these issues may apply to my industry, as well as to my particular company, that would be super helpful,"" she said.
U.S. regulators are in the process of developing guidance for how companies should spell out things like emissions, and rules in Europe are just coming into place.
At the U.N. climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, global leaders agreed to do more to curb carbon emissions and took other steps toward setting up global carbon markets and an international body to set sustainability reporting standards.
Julie Gorte, senior vice president at Impax Asset Management, said absent complete corporate reporting, investors can still learn a great deal about companies' environmental, social or governance impact through government filings.

""For companies the watchword is, look, people are going to find out stuff about you, whether you tell them or not. If you want them to know what the truth is, tell them,"" Gorte said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Shares in Grab, Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing and delivery firm, slid more than 20% in their Nasdaq debut on Thursday following the company's record $40 billion merger with a blank-check company.
Grab's shares rose as much as 21% minutes after the listing before retreating to trade 23% lower at $8.51 by 1834 GMT.
""The price makes no difference to me. I'm going to celebrate tonight and get back to work tomorrow,"" Chief Executive Anthony Tan told Reuters just after the shares started trading.
The backdoor listing on Nasdaq marks the high point for the nine-year-old Singapore company that began as a ride-hailing app and now operates across 465 cities in eight countries, offering food deliveries, payments, insurance and investment products.
Grab kicked off the biggest U.S. listing by a Southeast Asian company with a bell-ringing event in Singapore, hosted by Nasdaq and Grab's executives.
The event was attended by about 250 people including its investors, drivers, merchants and employees, with many dressed in the company's signature green.
Thunderous handclaps reverberated in the hotel ballroom as an emotional Tan thanked them for putting Grab and Southeast Asia's tech economy on the global map.
CEO Tan and Tan Hooi Ling developed the company from an idea for a Harvard Business School venture competition in 2011. The two Tans are not related.
The listing comes after Grab's April agreement to merge with U.S. tech investor Altimeter Capital Management's SPAC, Altimeter Growth Corp and raise $4.5 billion, including $750 million from Altimeter.
Grab's flotation ""will provide a bigger cash buffer"" to its ""cash burn"", S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said in a note. But it said the company's ""credit quality continues to be constrained by its loss-making operations, and free operating cash flows could be negative over the next 12 months.""
Southeast Asia's internet economy is forecast to double to $360 billion in gross merchandise value by 2025, prompting Grab's rivals, including regional internet firm Sea Ltd and Indonesia's GoTo Group, to bulk up. 
GoTo plans a local IPO in 2022 after completing an expected $2 billion private fundraising, sources have told Reuters. A U.S. listing will follow the Jakarta offering.
""Longer term, we're really excited about Grab Financial Group,"" said Chris Conforti, partner at Altimeter Capital, referring to Grab's financial services unit. ""I think the bell curve on that is much wider in terms of what the outcome could be, but it could be extremely large.""
BONANZA FOR BACKERS
CEO Tan, 39, expanded Grab into a regional operation with a range of services, after launching it as a taxi app in Malaysia in 2012. It later moved its headquarters to Singapore.
""What we have shown to the world is that home grown tech companies can develop great technology that can compete globally, even when international players are in town,"" Tan told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. ""We can compete and win.""
He will control 60.4% of voting rights along with Grab's co-founder, and president Ming Maa, but hold only a 3.3% stake with them.
Grab's listing brings a payday bonanza to early backers such as Japan's SoftBank and Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing, which invested as early as 2014.
They were later joined by the likes of  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Japanese megabank MUFG. Uber (NYSE:UBER) became a Grab shareholder in 2018 after selling its Southeast Asian business to Grab following a five-year battle. 
In September, Grab cut its full-year adjusted net sales forecasts, citing renewed uncertainty over pandemic curbs on movement. 
Third-quarter revenue fell 9% from a year earlier and its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) widened 66% to $212 million. GMV in the quarter rose to a record $4 billion.

It aims to turn profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2023.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were the lead placement agents on the fundraising, while Evercore and UBS were the co-placement agents.

After discussing a potential deal since March, the companies were now in advanced talks and CSL, the world's largest maker of blood plasma treatments, was carrying out due diligence on the Swiss firm, according to reports in The Australian Financial Review and The Australian. 
The reports said the deal valued the Swiss company, which makes prescription medications and is focused on treatment of kidney disease, at about A$10 billion without giving further details about the potential deal.
Both Vifor Pharma and CSL said in separate statements that they will not comment on the speculation.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a research note that CSL may be seeking diversification because blood plasma collections - where it pays people to give blood, which it then converts to treatments - remained depressed due to COVID-19 restrictions.
""Diversification could be wise, although it could lead to near-term de-rating until any potential synergies are evident to the market,"" the Morgan Stanley note said.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said in a note that the potential buyout would be ""a departure in terms of therapeutic area for CSL but does tie into their nascent kidney transplant franchise"".

Vifor's shares closed 21% higher at the top of Swiss mid-cap index on Thursday. CSL shares were down 1% in early trading on Friday, against a slightly higher overall market.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A broad rally sent Wall Street to a sharply higher close on Thursday, recovering ground lost over recent sessions as market participants snapped up bargains while digesting the implications of a shifting pandemic.
All three U.S. indexes advanced, with investors favoring value over growth, and economically sensitive smallcaps and transports outperforming the broader market.
Of the three, the Dow gained the most, notching its highest one-day percentage gain since March 5, with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co providing the biggest lift to the blue-chip industrial average. 
""We went 29 days in a row in the S&P 500 without a 1% change, up or down, but boom - Omicron hits and five days we’ve had this blast of volatility,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""After the worst two-day drop in more than a year, we’re finally seeing a bit of a bounce,"" Detrick added. ""Buyers are starting to nibble after the recent weakness and pushed stocks higher, but the uncertainty of Omicron is still out there.""
As world governments scramble to determine how to respond to the emergent COVID-19 Omicron variant, the United States is set to require private health insurance companies to provide at-home tests, a policy expected to go into effect on Jan. 15.
The Omicron variant has spooked markets for about a week, hitting travel-related stocks particularly hard as a patchwork of new restrictions were enacted around the globe, but those companies were bouncing back in Thursday's session.
The S&P 1500 Airlines and Hotel and Restaurants indexes jumped 7.5% and 3.8%, respectively.

Jobless claims and planned layoffs data provided further evidence that employers are increasingly disinclined to hand out pink slips amid a tight labor market, the result of booming demand colliding with worker scarcity and low labor market participation.
Labor scarcity, combined with stubbornly persistent supply chain constraints, has helped erase the word ""transitory"" from the Federal Reserve's inflation vocabulary as wages and prices continue to rise, and could very well translate into rate hikes coming sooner and faster than many had hoped.
Market participants now train their gaze on the Labor Department's hotly anticipated November employment report, expected on Friday.

Inter, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, was expecting shareholders to demand to cash out less than 2 billion reais, while its vast majority would swap its shares in Brazil for shares listed in the U.S. or Brazilian Depositary Receipts. But the bank said requests to cash out exceeded 2 billion reais.
Banco Inter had offered shareholders 45.84 reais per unit for investors not interested in migrating to the United States, but units were trading below it, making the cash deal more attractive. Units in Inter closed at 32.99 reais on Thursday.
In a recent interview with Reuters, Chief Financial Officer Helena Caldeira said the bank has the right to review the transaction and potentially lower the cash-out price, without providing a time frame for that.
The bank said earlier it was planning to list in the United States to have ""more access to global capital markets and potentially a larger and more diverse investor base.""

BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - China's aviation authority on Thursday issued an airworthiness directive on the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX that will help pave the way for the model's return to service in China after more than 2-1/2 years, leading to a surge in the planemaker's shares.
The directive instructs airline operators on the revisions required before the MAX returns to service, although it does not specify when China will lift a ban on the MAX in its airspace.
 Boeing Co  described the directive as an ""important milestone"" toward the return of service in China and its shares closed 7.5% higher, pushing the Dow Jones index up 1.73% in its biggest one-day percentage gain since March.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), which was the first regulator globally to ground the MAX in March 2019 after two deadly crashes, said it had completed a review of the design changes proposed by Boeing.
""After conducting sufficient assessment, CAAC considers the corrective actions are adequate to address this unsafe condition,"" the regulator said in a statement on its website. 
""The CAAC's decision is an important milestone toward safely returning the 737 MAX to service in China,"" Boeing said on Thursday. ""Boeing continues to work with regulators and our customers to return the airplane to service worldwide.""
Before the 737 MAX was grounded, Boeing was selling one-quarter of the planes it built annually to Chinese buyers, its largest customers.
The CAAC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the next steps required before the MAX returned to service. The regulator had sought industry feedback last month before issuing the airworthiness directive.
It previously outlined three principles for the jet to return to service in China, involving certified design changes, proper training for pilots and specific and definitive findings into the two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said in October the company was working toward gaining Chinese approvals by the end of the year for the 737 MAX to fly, with deliveries expected to resume in the first quarter of 2022.
Around a third of about 370 undelivered 737 MAX airplanes in storage are for Chinese customers, Boeing said at the time.
China's authorisation of the 737 MAX is very good news, which will support the drawdown of undelivered MAX inventory,  Safran  (PA:SAF) CEO Olivier Andries told reporters on Thursday.
Safran makes MAX engines as part of the CFM International joint venture with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co .

Beyond safety concerns, Boeing's sales in China have been hobbled by U.S.-China trade tensions, with Washington accusing Beijing of blocking purchases of Boeing planes by its domestic airlines.
Other Asia-Pacific countries - including Singapore, Malaysia, India, Japan, Australia and Fiji - have already approved the return of the 737 MAX.

579,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 05:22PM ET</span>",Special Report-U.S. rushed contracts to COVID-19 suppliers with troubled plants,"By Marisa Taylor
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -As the Trump administration debated whether to declare COVID-19 a national emergency early last year, a little-known U.S. health office issued a public plea to Big Pharma.
On March 6, 2020, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority called on pharmaceutical and medical device companies to develop a vast array of essential COVID supplies.
Known as BARDA, a program within the Department of Health and Human Services, the authority sought vaccines, testing devices, treatments and other products. BARDA, created in 2006 to help companies develop medical supplies to address public health threats, made clear in its call for proposals it was seeking products to be made at U.S. facilities with a track record of meeting Food and Drug Administration manufacturing standards.
Yet a majority of more than 50 companies so far selected to develop and manufacture supplies in the United States did not meet those standards, according to a Reuters examination of FDA records and dozens of federal contracts issued by HHS under the $60 billion COVID program.
In all, less than 20% of the companies awarded fast-track contracts examined by Reuters were experienced manufacturers with a clean FDA record for their U.S. plants in the two years prior. Four of every five either had no U.S. manufacturing experience, poor domestic inspection results or serious recalls before their COVID contract awards, Reuters found.
“These are red flags,” said Peter Lurie, a former FDA associate commissioner who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “The government ought to be able to find companies in this country that aren’t tainted by previous poor performance.”
HHS, which oversees both the FDA and BARDA, said it takes “our responsibility as stewards of tax dollars very seriously,” and that it has an “outstanding” record of conducting contract due diligence.
Texas-based Luminex (NASDAQ:LMNX), a unit of Italy’s DiaSorin SpA, is one example of a company recruited to the COVID fight while under FDA scrutiny. In February 2020, the FDA found serious manufacturing problems at its plants in Austin, Texas, and Northbrook, Illinois, FDA records show.
A month later, the company was awarded the first of five COVID-19 contracts worth a total of nearly $19 million for new tests that would be manufactured at the Austin facility, BARDA records show. Luminex said the government contracts helped it address a vital pandemic need and that the problems didn’t impact its COVID tests.
Other companies recently had product recalls that were designated as “Class 1” by the FDA, signaling a serious risk to health or even death.
One was Smiths Medical, a unit of Britain’s Smiths Group (OTC:SMGZY) Plc, awarded a $20 million contract from BARDA in July 2020 to expand its U.S. plant in New Hampshire to produce syringes. In the years before, Smiths Medical had issued serious recalls involving 20 different devices, including two devices that received Class 1 recalls.
Smiths Medical said it takes immediate action when an issue is identified. “While accelerating our operations to produce this critical equipment, safety and quality have remained our top priority,” the company said.
The FDA found “objectionable conditions” at three U.S. plants operated by contract drugmaker Catalent (NYSE:CTLT) Inc in 2018 and 2019 but allowed the company to address them without the agency taking action. They included an Indiana vaccine facility that was cited both years. The same plant was later contracted to produce COVID-19 shots for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.
Catalent said it “takes these observations very seriously and all observations are addressed.” The company said it is on track to deliver over one billion COVID vaccine doses globally by year’s end.
The manufacturing problems have persisted since the COVID contract awards. At least 21 of the companies reviewed by Reuters have initiated serious product recalls of their COVID supplies or received poor inspection results from the FDA at the plants where they were expected to expand manufacturing to fulfill the government contract. While there have not been reports of patient injury or death, the manufacturing issues have delayed vaccines and treatments and affected the accuracy of diagnostic tests.
As Reuters reported in May, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co delayed manufacturing of its COVID antibody treatment amid problems at the plant producing it, after HHS agreed to pay it up to $1.2 billion. Separately, Emergent BioSolutions Inc’s $628 million government contract was canceled in November after the company struggled to manufacture COVID vaccines.
The FDA said in a statement to Reuters that it relies on a ""variety of robust oversight tools"" to ensure product safety and quality.
""Protecting patients is the highest priority of the FDA and the agency is confident in the safety and quality of the medical products we regulate, including the authorized and approved COVID-19-related products,"" the agency said. 
STEEP DROP IN INSPECTIONS
The COVID contracting spree, which began under former President Donald Trump and has continued under the Biden White House, came as FDA domestic inspections fell precipitously. The Biden administration has outlined its ambitions for investing billions more dollars into expanding the U.S. manufacturing base for COVID vaccine production.
What has not been spelled out is how pandemic-era manufacturing quality is being evaluated. Leading into the pandemic, FDA inspections of U.S. plants producing prescription medicines and medical devices had dropped almost 25% between 2011 and 2019, FDA inspection data show; the numbers don’t include pending inspection reports or inspections prior to a product approval. Domestic inspections were further curtailed by COVID restrictions during the pandemic, dropping almost 64% in 2020 and almost 80% in 2021 from the previous peak in 2011, records show.
“As a country we need people to trust the quality of our vaccines, medical devices and medicines,” said Madris Kinard, a former FDA public health analyst. “But the state of affairs when it comes to oversight of any of these companies right now is really worrisome.”
HHS declined to answer questions about specific COVID suppliers’ compliance or performance. The department wouldn’t make its experts available for interviews. BARDA, an office of HHS, said it couldn’t comment without agency approval.
The FDA said it “cannot comment” on contract decisions made by BARDA, as the agency said it generally did not participate in discussions about such contracts in order “to avoid any appearance that procurement or investment considerations may influence the FDA’s regulatory decision-making.”
The FDA said the drop in domestic inspections can be explained in part by a 2012 statute change that allowed it to prioritize facilities based on risk. As a result, the agency was no longer required to inspect U.S. facilities on a specific timetable and could focus on those with more regulatory problems, including plants abroad. The FDA said the numbers don’t reflect other ways it monitors companies for manufacturing problems and that it has begun to increase domestic inspections.
“We try to prioritize surveillance inspections by risk,” FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock told Reuters. “We don’t inspect a plant every time a new product is added. We may have recent inspection data that showed everything was ok, we may have data from another regulatory authority, we may have done a remote assessment.”
But the federal agencies sometimes operate in a vacuum. In response to Reuters’ questions, HHS said BARDA considers publicly available information about a manufacturer’s track record under federal procurement regulations, but that nonpublic interactions between a company and the FDA are considered trade secrets.
“Companies’ historic interactions with the FDA are considered commercial confidential and since these activities were conducted prior to U.S. government funding, we can encourage but cannot require the companies to provide those previous interactions,” HHS said. The agency said it requires companies to share such information after a contract award as it relates to the actual product.
Using the Freedom of Information Act, Reuters asked HHS for any records related to BARDA’s interactions with the FDA or performance assessments before or after contract awards. HHS said no records were found.
“If they don’t have records,” said former FDA official Kinard, “then how can they claim they did any performance assessments? Did they even talk to the FDA?”
TINY OFFICE, TALL TASK
At its inception, BARDA was set up not as an official agency, but as a program overseen by HHS’s Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR).
The ASPR office, which wields a nearly $3 billion budget, and BARDA work together to promote the research and development of medical supplies. They aim to “reduce the time and cost,” in ASPR’s words, of developing products by funding and helping U.S. biomedical companies navigate what the office called the Valley of Death, or the late stage of development where products have “languished or failed” before regulatory approval.
When the pandemic hit, BARDA’s plea for assistance from manufacturers was met with applications by hundreds of companies, many of which had little experience interacting with the FDA, said two government officials involved in the process who spoke on condition of anonymity.
HHS experts rushed to familiarize themselves with the newer firms, and cold-called companies they had already worked with during previous outbreaks to supplement the applicant pool, the two officials said. BARDA was tasked with choosing manufacturers who could produce COVID supplies inside the United States, whenever possible. HHS was so swamped with proposals it also asked the Pentagon to help.
Very quickly, the contracting process became controversial.
BARDA experts were reviewing company proposals for COVID products submitted through its own website. A second channel, set up by Trump’s ASPR appointee Robert Kadlec and run by his office, was also researching potential suppliers.
In April 2020, Kadlec moved to reassign BARDA’s director, Rick Bright, a veteran government health official. Bright fought back with a whistleblower complaint that accused Kadlec of ignoring FDA safety concerns and ousting him to cover up the steering of contracts to political allies. Bright, who has since settled with the government, declined to comment.
Kadlec denied targeting Bright. But he said the United States was overwhelmed by the need for supplies during an emergency and that HHS agencies should have better prepared the companies well before the pandemic.
“What was intended was that the government would help create these manufacturing capabilities that would be robust and regularly tested,” Kadlec told Reuters. “They were not robust. They were not invested in and they were not regularly tested. It was a shit show.”
Kadlec acknowledged the Trump White House meddled in some COVID-19 contract negotiations. “I would suggest to you that any president facing re-election in his last year of his first term who also has a major public health crisis would politicize the process,” he said. “Obviously the Trump persona was a hell of a lot different than other presidents, and that magnified the problem.”
For instance, he said White House officials directly negotiated a $647 million ventilator contract with Dutch firm Philips NV that a House subcommittee concluded overcharged the federal government by hundreds of millions of dollars. The negotiations for this new COVID-related contract included White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, the inquiry found.
The House report also concluded that HHS contract officers were excluded from the talks until the last moment. “By then, the generous terms of the contract had already been agreed to by the White House,” the report said.
In an interview, Navarro confirmed he had a role in the ventilator discussions. He said he regularly involved himself in COVID supply discussions after meeting resistance from the FDA when he insisted all the supplies should be manufactured in the United States. But he disavowed responsibility for the cost. Instead, he blamed Philips, which denied overcharging the government.
A Kushner representative declined to comment and a Trump spokesperson did not respond to questions. In November, Trump told Navarro to defy a subpoena issued by a separate House committee investigating the COVID-19 response.
Lost in the public scandal were the manufacturing problems the FDA said it found at a Philips ventilator plant in California. Three months before the Trump administration embarked on negotiations, the FDA designated the violations as serious enough to order the company to take action. The agency also cited Philips for failing to give notice that another ventilator model manufactured at the plant could “cause or contribute to a death or serious injury,” according to the FDA’s database.
HHS announced it accepted delivery of more than 12,000 of the Philips ventilators before canceling the remainder of the contract in September 2020, shortly after the House findings.
This past summer, Philips issued a Class 1 recall of 15 million sleep devices and ventilators amid concern a polyester-based polyurethane foam could degrade “and be ingested or inhaled by the user.” The company also recalled 22,300 ventilators in the U.S. government’s stockpile due to problems with pressure levels when the devices were used on infants and children; Philips said the recalled products, which included all 12,000 ventilators sold to the government for COVID, are being corrected with a software update.
“When issues arise, we work quickly to take action and focus on the needs of our patients and the clinicians that serve them,” said Philips spokesman Steve Klink.
INSPECTIONS AND CONTRACTS
Several companies were wrangling with the FDA over manufacturing problems at the very time they were negotiating contracts with BARDA.
The FDA, for instance, finished inspecting Luminex’s Austin and Northbrook plants on Valentine’s Day 2020 and found serious manufacturing problems, according to a warning letter the agency issued to the company four months later. The FDA designated the problems as “Official Action Indicated,” a recommendation for regulatory action.
The FDA also said in its warning letter that a Luminex testing device, known as Verigene, failed to detect a patient’s superbug infection. The patient did not receive appropriate treatment and died two days later – possibly because of the test failure – the warning letter states. The FDA said Luminex did not properly inform the agency that it had removed the device from the market after the incident, and that such violations could impact a company’s ability to receive federal dollars.
Luminex told Reuters it had properly notified the FDA about what happened to the patient and complied with additional FDA directives over the matter.
The onset of the pandemic brought new opportunities for Luminex. In March 2020, Luminex received FDA emergency authorization for use of its new COVID-19 test kits. It vowed as a result to dramatically expand manufacturing.
In 2020 and 2021, Luminex issued Class 2 recalls for its Verigene diagnostics system over problems including possible inaccurate results. This February, Luminex secured an $11.3 million contract from the Biden administration, its largest to date.
In a statement, Luminex said BARDA’s support helped it boost manufacturing capacity by 300% during the pandemic and quickly produce “high-quality tests to meet the expanding need.”
Other test makers who received contracts had not operated a U.S. plant previously.
Diagnostics company Ellume secured a $30 million contract in October 2020 under the Trump administration to develop at-home COVID tests that were made in Australia. The Biden administration in February awarded Ellume an additional $232 million, which the company said will be used to build its first U.S. plant for future COVID manufacturing.
In October 2021, the FDA issued a safety warning on certain lots of Ellume’s COVID-19 home test because of the risk of false positive results. The problems involved a “manufacturing issue,” the FDA said. In November, the agency designated the company’s voluntary recall as a Class 1, with 2 million affected tests.
“The FDA is not aware of any confirmed serious injuries or deaths related to the false positive results with the affected Ellume COVID-19 Home Tests at this time,” the FDA said in its safety warning. The company said none of its tests now on store shelves are affected by the recall. Its U.S. plant is expected to eventually produce 15 million COVID tests per month.
Ellume told Reuters it “remains steadfast in its commitment to deliver home tests to communities across the United States.”
Other companies also experienced problems after winning their contracts.
Smiths Medical issued two separate major recalls for products, both posing a risk of death, after being awarded its COVID-19 contract to manufacture syringes. One involved syringes that could malfunction and deliver too little or too much insulin to diabetes patients. The other involved a device that could leach aluminum into the blood of patients being treated for hypothermia.
Smiths said the recalled syringes used for insulin were manufactured in the company’s New Hampshire plant but not associated with COVID-19 vaccines. “The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented staffing and supply chain constraints,” the company said. “The incentive that BARDA provided allowed for expansion of our domestic production.”
One company decided to cut its losses early when it became clear it couldn’t deliver. John L. Warden Jr., CEO of the start-up Hememics Biotechnologies, said his company could not develop its novel COVID diagnostic device in time to meet the deadline set by Trump officials.
“BARDA was doing its best but it was getting daily calls from the White House. They were under enormous pressure,” Warden said. “We were all told that our deadline was November 2020, and the fact that it was around the election was not a coincidence.”

Hememics had been offered $600,000 by BARDA. In the end, it took $25,000 of funding for development and turned down the rest so it could have more time before it applies for FDA emergency authorization.
“We were frankly too inexperienced at that point,” Warden said. “We just needed more time.”

By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Dating app Tinder is exploring how to blur the boundaries between offline and online worlds, CEO Renate Nyborg said in an interview at the Reuters Next conference. 
The chief executive of the Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) Inc-owned dating app cited the company's newly launched Explore feature. Interactive events like ""Swipe Nights"" allow users to choose their own adventures and match with others based on their choices.
The company is testing in-app currency that daters will use to pay for premium services and receive it as rewards for good behavior on the app, she said. 
Asked about the company's plans around dating in the metaverse, Nyborg said: ""From a Tinder perspective, we've been talking about a Tinderverse internally, which is more about blurring the boundaries between offline and online.""
The metaverse broadly refers to the idea of shared virtual spaces that people can access through different devices and where they can move through digital environments. These spaces may use virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR).
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which recently changed its name to Meta Platforms Inc, is one of the many tech companies making bets on metaverse technologies.
Dating app Bumble said during its November earnings call that it wants to prepare for ""whatever emerges in the metaverse."" 
Nyborg said Tinder was still focused on helping people meet in real life.
She said that while the COVID-19 pandemic had shown it was possible to feel connected only using the internet, it also demonstrated the importance of real-life connections.

581,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 04:36PM ET</span>",TD CEO sees 'bumpy' road ahead after earnings top estimates; CIBC hit by higher costs,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) -Toronto-Dominion Bank sounded a cautious note about next year's outlook due to inflation and the end of stimulus measures after better-than-expected earnings, while Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce missed estimates due to higher expenses and loan-loss provisions.
Both banks also joined rivals in announcing share buybacks and raising dividends, after the financial regulator lifted restrictions on capital distributions last month.
TD, Canada's second-biggest bank, surprised with a 5-basis-point margin expansion in its U.S. retail business in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with the prior quarter. It also released C$123 million ($96 million) of reserves previously set aside to cover loan losses.
But its chief executive warned that meeting the bank's medium-term target of 7%-to-10% adjusted earnings-per-share growth would be challenging in 2022. 
""While we have good momentum entering the year, the road ahead is likely to be bumpy,"" CEO Bharat Masrani said on an analyst call. 
Executives pointed to a ""complex"" macroeconomic environment, characterized by high inflation as well as uncertainties over the economic trajectory and consumers' financial health as pandemic-related stimulus payments are withdrawn.
Loan-loss provision releases and trading activity, which helped earnings this year and are set to return to more normal levels, and revenue pressure from the U.S. Paycheck Protection Program's loan forgiveness will also be challenges, Masrani said.
While TD is keeping loan-loss allowances high to reflect those, it will look ""very seriously"" at any acquisition opportunities in Canadian financial services to use its excess capital, as ""there are not many opportunities that present themselves,"" Masrani said. 
CIBC, the country's fifth-largest bank, reported 10% revenue growth, but that was clouded by a 13% increase in expenses. It also took C$78 million of provisions, higher than expected, as a 36% jump in money set aside in its Canadian banking unit offset releases in other divisions. 
The bank said it expects expense growth in fiscal 2022 to rise to the mid-single digits, but aims to deliver positive medium-term operating leverage, with revenue growth outpacing expense expansion.
""While we may have periods of negative operating leverage earlier in the year, we will target positive operating leverage across our business through the course of next year,"" Chief Financial Officer Hratch Panossian said on an analyst call. 
DIVIDEND HIKES
TD shares closed up almost 5% at a record high of C$96.50 in Toronto, while CIBC fell 2.8% to C$137.28, a six-month low. The broader stock benchmark rose 1.45%.
TD said it would increase its dividend by 12.7%, and buy back up to 2.7% of outstanding shares. 
CIBC will raise its dividend by 10.2% to C$1.61 per share and buy back up to 2.2% of stock, it said. 
Canadian banks have faced pressures from low margins and higher variable compensation costs this quarter, as some of the earlier boost from their capital markets businesses and reserve releases receded. 
But the hoped-for recovery in Canadian non-mortgage lending appears to be materializing, albeit at different rates. 
Canadian credit card lending at both banks rose 3.1% from the prior quarter. TD's business lending grew 2.6% from the previous quarter, the same pace as mortgage growth. CIBC's corporate lending increased 0.85%, compared with a 3.4% increase in home loans.
TD reported that adjusted fourth-quarter net income rose to C$2.09 a share, beating the average analyst estimate of C$1.96.

CIBC's adjusted earnings for the quarter were C$3.37 per share, versus the expected C$3.53.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Members of the United Auto Workers union have voted to change the union's election method from the current delegate system to a direct election model, a court-appointed monitor said.
The referendum showed 63.7%, or 89,615 votes, in favor of the direct voting system, with 50,971, or 36.3%, for keeping the status quo, monitor Neil Barofsky said. 
The referendum at the 400,000-member union was required as part of a U.S. Justice Department settlement announced in December 2020 of corruption allegations that resulted in the convictions of two former UAW presidents, among others.
Barofsky will confer with the UAW and then draft amendments to the union's constitution to incorporate the direct voting system. The next election of the UAW’s president, secretary-treasurer, vice presidents and regional directors will be the first under the new rules and likely take place in 2022.
In total, 16 people have been convicted in the wide-ranging investigation of corruption within the UAW or relating to illegal payoffs to UAW officials by Fiat Chrysler executives. Two former Fiat Chrysler executives have been convicted.
Several UAW officers, including the union's two former presidents, have pleaded guilty to embezzling millions of dollars for their personal benefit, using the funds for liquor, cigars, golf outings, related equipment and expensive hotel stays.

Barofsky said in a report last month the UAW has not done ""enough to respond to repeated warnings about the pressing need to transform its culture.""
The UAW represents about 150,000 workers at Detroit’s Big Three automakers. It also represents thousands of workers in other fields. At its peak in 1979, the union had a membership of about 1.5 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Goldman Sachs Group Inc plans to issue new profitability targets for the next three years, consistent with longer-term goals it set in 2020, thanks in part to the investment banking and trading boom during the pandemic, three sources at the bank told Reuters.
At its last investor day in January 2020, Goldman set three- and five-year targets for return-on-equity (RoE) and return-on-tangible-equity (RoTE), two measures of profitability, that analysts at the time said were ambitious. 
Goldman has since benefited from the U.S. Federal Reserve's stimulus measures pumping liquidity into capital markets, while the subsequent boom in the Wall Street firm's main businesses has meant progress has been faster than anticipated, the three sources said.Still, the sources said executives understand that the favorable environment is likely to recede as the central bank tightens monetary policy. The bank is considering issuing a new set of profitability targets for the period through 2025 that would be in line with longer-term targets it set in 2020.
Specifically, the sources said the bank is planning to set new medium term return-on-equity (RoE) and return-on-tangible-equity (RoTE) targets of at least 15%. They cautioned that decisions relating to targets could still change between now and next year. 
Asked for comment on the expected target, a spokesman for Goldman said: ""At our Investor Day in January 2020, we disclosed a medium-term ROE target of 13 percent and longer-term ROE target of mid-teens."" The spokesman declined further comment.
The 2020 targets formed an important part of Chief Executive David Solomon's plan to rejuvenate the bank, which had struggled to adapt to tougher regulations introduced after the 2007-09 financial crisis, which crimped profit margins at its core trading businesses. Since then, progress has been faster than anticipated across most of Goldman's businesses, sources said.
Growing Goldman's fledgling consumer business, Marcus, has proved more challenging. Earlier this year, management backed away from an earlier goal to turn Marcus profitable in 2021, saying it would take at least another year to turn a profit.
Goldman had only achieved an RoE of 10% and RoTE of 10.6% in 2019. Despite that, the bank is tracking well ahead of the mid-term goals so far this year. In the first nine months of 2021, it achieved an annualized RoE of 25.7% and an annualized RoTE of 27.2%. In 2020, the bank achieved a return on equity of 11.1% and return on tangible equity of 11.8%.
Return on equity is a key metric used globally to assess banks' profitability. It tells investors how much profit banks generate from each dollar invested by shareholders. Return on tangible equity excludes intangible assets such as goodwill.
FASTER GROWTH 
Goldman will update on the key targets early next year but is not planning on hosting a formal investor day where executives give extended briefings on different parts of the business, as it did in January 2020, one of the sources said.
Goldman last updated on progress against its targets in January this year when it maintained goals for efficiency and return-on-equity. In October it reported a surge in profits boosted by a wave of M&A activity and initial public offerings.
Goldman has benefited from a massive injection of liquidity into financial markets by the Fed since last March, because it makes a higher proportion of its revenues from investment banking and trading. 
Its trading businesses have enjoyed their most successful period since the 2007-2009 financial crisis while its investment banking division has reaped rewards from record global deal making.
COST SAVINGS
Executives are also discussing whether to increase a target to achieve $1.3 billion in cost savings over the three years to end 2022, the three sources said. Chief Operating Officer John Waldron said at a conference in June that the bank had identified a further $400 million of potential savings. 
The savings are an important factor behind improving the bank's RoE and remain a top priority, one of the sources said. However, executives have yet to decide whether they want to set a new headline cost savings target, the three sources said.
Cost cutting measures have also helped the bank's performance, along with Solomon's client services initiative, One Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which formed a key part of his vision after he became CEO in late 2018, the sources said. 
By improving collaboration, Goldman hoped to gain more business from existing clients and improve its market share in a number of areas, those sources said. The strategy has enabled it to do more business with its biggest corporate clients and to serve more clients overall, the sources said.
The bank's shares have risen by 47% in the year to date, outperforming the sector, reflecting increased confidence among analysts and investors in Solomon's ability to deliver on his transformation plan.
Executives acknowledge current rates of return are unsustainable longer-term because they are driven largely by the unusually strong operating environment, the three sources said. However, they are confident the bank will continue to outperform the existing mid-term targets even when conditions normalize. Executives expect the bank will continue to benefit from cost savings and market share gains, the three sources said.

""They've delivered a tremendous performance throughout 2021,"" said Devin Ryan, analyst at JMP Securities, part of Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) Group. ""They're gaining market share in sales & trading and investment banking, and they're executing well on these new initiatives."" 
Goldman shares, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, were up 3.2% at $388.59 in late trading.

Laboratory (NYSE:LH) data expected in the coming weeks will show whether antibodies from individuals who have previously received Novavax's COVID-19 shot can neutralize the variant, according to the company.
Novavax also said it has started developing an Omicron-specific spike protein antigen and will begin laboratory tests of a new vaccine to target the variant in a few weeks.
The Omicron coronavirus variant has shaken up markets and caused global alarm over concerns about whether it could evade protection provided by widely used vaccines and prolong the public health crisis.

Other vaccine makers including  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) have also begun working on Omicron-tailored COVID-19 shots.
Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine received its first emergency use approval in Indonesia in early November followed by the Philippines.

Investing.com — Shares of special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) firm CF Acquisition Corp VI (NASDAQ:CFVI) have rallied Thursday, up over 9% to $10.64 in the last hour of the session.
The shares initially hit a high of $14.38 in response to news that it will take video platform Rumble public in a deal valuing the company at approximately $2.1 billion.
The deal is expected to contribute approximately $400 million in proceeds to Rumble, including a fully committed PIPE of $100 million at $10 per share and $300 million of cash held in the trust account of CFVI.
Rumble, described as a neutral video platform and an alternative to YouTube, said it had 44 million monthly active users in August 2021 and grew from 1.6 million average monthly active users in Q3 2020 to 36 million average monthly active users in the third quarter this year.

597,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 03:35PM ET</span>","Apple Sales, Oil Prices, Jobs Report: 3 Things to Watch","By Sam Boughedda
Investing.com -- Stocks roared back Thursday after a plunge on Wednesday over the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid, which has officially arrived on U.S. shores.
A second case was identified Thursday, after the first official case was revealed on Wednesday. Still, the Biden administration has a new push to get people vaccinated and boosted, and new testing rules for travelers.
It’s still not clear how dangerous the Omicron variant is or whether it will respond to current vaccines and treatments.
Lawmakers in D.C. managed to hammer out an agreement to keep the federal government funded until about February, and they were working to vote on that agreement as early as Thursday evening.
Meanwhile, the cartel of major oil producing countries decided to keep their planned production thresholds in place for next month, choosing not to retaliate against a number of nations, including the U.S., that released oil from their national reserves to help damp energy prices.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. Apple in spotlight 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was under scrutiny after Bloomberg reported that the company is facing slowing demand for its iPhone 13 lineup. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report said that Apple is telling vendors that a pick-up in orders in 2022 may not materialize. 
The company has already felt the effects of the global supply chain issues and had to slash its iPhone 13 production target by around 10 million units for this year, while in the fourth quarter of the 2021 fiscal year it posted a rare revenue miss, due to supply chain challenges. 
2. Oil prices in view
Investors will be watching oil price after the producer alliance OPEC+ stuck to the number of barrels it planned to roll out in January. For days on end, there had been speculation that the 23-nation OPEC+ — comprising the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 other oil producers steered by Russia — would cancel the additional 400,000 daily barrels it had targeted each month since July.
3. Jobs, jobs, jobs
On the economic front, better-than-expected weekly jobless claims data stoked optimism on the labor market recovery ahead of Friday’s monthly jobs report. The Labor Department reported that 222,000 people filed for unemployment insurance, confounding economists’ expectations for an 18,000 rise.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 560,000 in November, with unemployment rate expected to drop to 4.4%. The data are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).

(Reuters) - A former chief financial officer of  Immunomedics  (NASDAQ:IMMU) Inc has been charged with insider trading for tipping his girlfriend ahead of positive clinical trial results for a new breast cancer drug, federal authorities said on Thursday.
The U.S. Department of Justice said Usama Malik likely gave nonpublic information to former Immunomedics communications chief Lauren Wood within 20 minutes of learning on April 2, 2020 that the Food and Drug Administration would let the company halt its trial for Trodelvy because of evidence the drug worked.
Wood, who had left the company four months earlier but lived with Malik, allegedly bought about 7,000 Immunomedics shares that night for $64,400, and sold them three months later for a $213,618 profit after the stock price more than quadrupled.
Authorities said Wood also doubled her money from exercising Immunomedics stock options, and returned $65,000 to Malik that he had given her for the exercise, while Malik tipped three family members who made $21,400 of illegal profit.
Malik, 47, and Wood, 33, both from Washington, D.C., were each charged with securities fraud, carrying a maximum 20-year prison term.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against both defendants, describing Wood as Malik's now-former girlfriend.
Lawyers for Malik and Wood did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
 Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) bought Immunomedics for $20.6 billion in October 2020. Four months later, Malik became chief executive of privately-held Fore Biotherapeutics.

“Effective immediately, Usama Malik is no longer a director or chief executive officer of Fore Biotherapeutics,"" the Philadelphia-based company said in a statement on Thursday.
Fore said it learned on Wednesday about the charges, and that they ""in no way"" relate to the company.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 03:32PM ET</span>","Investors track COVID case counts, watch key market levels as Omicron fears grow","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The emergence of Omicron is fueling uncertainty in markets, as investors await information about the heavily mutated coronavirus variant and gauge how badly it could damage the global recovery. 
Early indications suggest Omicron may be markedly more contagious than previous variants, though researchers are still seeking to understand its impact. 
In the meantime, volatility across asset markets has soared, with a recent hawkish turn from the Federal Reserve contributing to the gyrations.
Here are some factors investors are watching to discern Omicron’s impact on the economy and asset prices.
VIEW OF THE VARIANT
Among the key factors that could sway market reaction to Omicron are whether it causes more severe disease than previous variants, if it becomes the dominant strain across the world and how responsive it is to existing vaccines and therapies. 
Many are closely watching South Africa, where officials said Omicron is quickly becoming the dominant variant, accounting for 74% of the 249 virus genomes sequenced in November.
Government response is also key. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that his administration's plan to fight COVID-19 does not include shutdowns. 
Graphic: Omicron variant map - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-VARIANT/zdvxonlxxpx/Omicron.jpg 
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
While the impact of Omicron may take time to show up in traditional economic indicators, some investors are counting on less-conventional measures for a view of activity.
One indicator of mobility watched by TD Securities are requests for driving directions using Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Maps, which have recently ticked lower. 
Other data include checkpoints tracked by the Transportation Security Administration, restaurant reservations and hotel occupancies. 
Graphic: Apple Maps driving directions requests - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/MOBILITY/gkplglglavb/chart.png 
Many on Wall Street have also tried to map various courses the pandemic might take and their possible impact on growth. 
A ""downside"" scenario outlined by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in which a large wave of infections leads to lockdowns, could slow global growth to 2% in the first quarter of 2022, 2.5 percentage points below the bank's current forecast. 
Others said Omicron could hasten the end of the pandemic. 
""If a less severe and more transmissible virus quickly crowds out more severe variants, could the Omicron variant be a catalyst to transform a deadly pandemic into something more similar to seasonal flu?"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategists wrote.
SENTIMENT 
Omicron, as well as the possibility of a more aggressive Fed, is weighing on sentiment among retail investors.
The percentage of retail investors with a bullish view has tumbled to 27%, compared with 48% three weeks earlier, according to the latest survey from the American Association of Individual Investors.
Bearish sentiment stood at 42.4%, its highest level in more than a year.
Uncertainty about Omicron ""leads to many investors fearing the worst-case outcome,"" wrote Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.
Some retail investors, however, have capitalized on recent stock weakness.
Retail net purchases of U.S. equities hit a record high on Tuesday at $2.2 billion after reaching $2.1 billion in Friday's sell-off, data from Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research showed. 
Graphic: Bearish investor sentiment rising - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/INDICATORS/gdpzymqrbvw/chart.png 
VOLATILITY 
Concerns over Omicron and the Fed are stirring volatility across asset markets. 
The Cboe Market Volatility index, known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" topped 30 on Wednesday for the first time since March amid several days of swings in stock prices. 
Moves in the bond market have also picked up in recent weeks, fueled in part by uncertainty over Fed policy. The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE Index, which measures expectations of volatility in the bond market, is near its highest levels since March 2020. 
Currency market volatility, as measured by the  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Currency Volatility Index, is near its highest level since March 2021. 
Graphic: Volatility view - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/VOLATILITY/mopanqnjbva/chart.png 
SAFE HAVENS
Market fluctuations have sent investors into so-called haven assets such as the Japanese yen, Swiss franc and U.S. government bonds. Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, have fallen in recent days despite hawkish signals from the Fed that would normally cause them to rally. 
More strength in these assets could indicate that uncertainty continues to plague markets.

LOOKING AT LEVELS
Investors are also watching important technical levels to assess the extent of damage in the market. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since July 2020, a potentially bearish sign. 

The benchmark S&P 500 remains above its 200-day level, but closed below its 50-day moving average on Wednesday for the first time since mid-October.

Both companies have a history of strong earnings growth and just came off solid quarters, with QCOM growing its quarterly EPS by 76% year-over-year and PAYC reporting 31% quarterly EPS growth. Meanwhile, both names have held up much better than their tech peers, with PAYC and QCOM both above rising 200-day moving averages. Let’s take a closer look at each company below:.We’ve seen a violent correction in many tech names over the past couple of weeks, and the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) is now down more than 5% from its highs. However, the size of the correction doesn’t properly highlight the damage underneath the hood of the market. This is evidenced by more than 70% of stocks being below their 50-day moving averages, and nearly 75% of sectors are below their 200-day moving averages. Despite the brief bout of significant selling pressure we’ve seen, there’s still minimal fear out there, with no significant increase in put-buying just yet.
This suggests that the market could certainly head lower before we see a durable bottom. The good news is that the best time to build a shopping list is when the market is in a correction, given that high-quality names can be bought at very reasonable prices. In this update, we’ll look at two names that look set for a strong year ahead and assess their ideal buy-points if this correction continues.

So, it could be wise to avoid fundamentally weak EV stocks like Arrival (ARVL) and Faraday Future (FFIE).The electric vehicle (EV) industry is expected to grow manifold in the long run, thanks to the growing climate change concerns, favorable government policies, and technological advancements in batteries. However, the recently-identified omicron coronavirus variant could aggravate the semiconductor chip shortage, hampering the EV industry’s progress.
According to Makoto Uchida, the CEO of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.

(Reuters) -Pratt & Whitney's improved version of the geared turbofan engine used by Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY)'s strong-selling A320neo jet family will help build backlog, the engine maker said on Thursday.
Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX)' Pratt said it will also meet the demands of its largest commercial customer, Airbus, which has asked suppliers to explore rates as high as 75 a month by 2025. 
The GTF Advantage update comes with 4% higher thrust, 1% improved fuel burn, and can last longer between scheduled maintenance appointments. Pratt says the updated GTF will be the most powerful engine for the A320neo family when it enters service in January 2024. 
“This is not a paper engine,"" Tom Pelland, Pratt senior vice president of GTF engines, told reporters at the company's media day in Connecticut. ""This is an engine we’re testing today.”
The development, reported by Reuters on Wednesday, comes as airlines are under pressure to slash emissions with engine makers eying longer-term advances like hybrid-electric propulsion to improve fuel efficiency.
Pelland said the GTF could deliver future double-digit improvements in efficiency, using new technologies, compared with the original engine launched in 2016 that improved fuel burn by 16%.
Pratt could not specify a timeframe for such an update.
Pratt faces rival CFM International, co-owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA, and U.S.-based  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), which leads in market share on the A320 program.
“We expect to continue to grow our backlog and keep our delivery share in about the same or better place,“ said Rick Deurloo, Pratt's chief customer officer.
Deurloo said the engine maker is not trying to grow its A320 market share of around 40% but wants to be more selective about finding airlines that are more likely to fly the planes.
Engine makers make most of their money over the life of an aircraft in the aftermarket. 
The update could help win orders in China which has airports at high altitude, he said. 
“There’s a lot of activity we suspect will happen in China next year,” he told Reuters.
Earlier in the day, French jet engine maker Safran said the worst of the coronavirus crisis was over but took a cautious view on long-term airline traffic in a continuing stand-off with Airbus over proposed increases in jetliner production. 
Asked about Airbus' plans for 2023, Pratt & Whitney President Christopher Calio told reporters, “We’re going to meet the demands of our customer.”

Deurloo said Pratt hasn't yet set plans for the following two years.
“We have a general question around what that demand may actually be which is why we haven’t locked in for 2024 and 2025,"" Deurloo said.

ROME (Reuters) -KMW+Nexter Defence Systems (KNDS) is close to making a 650 million euro ($736 million) binding bid for Leonardo's OTO Melara and Wass units, three sources said on Thursday, in a move that could strengthen its position in the land defence sector.
The Franco-German consortium is conducting due diligence on the two units that Italian defence group Leonardo has put on the block and could submit its offer by the end of the year or early 2022, the sources familiar with the matter said.
KNDS is pitted against Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri, which expressed an interest in the units but has not started formal due diligence and has put forward a less generous proposal so far, the sources said.
The Italian government, which controls both Leonardo and Fincantieri, is determined to have the final say on the deal.
As Europe pushes for closer cooperation on defence, Rome wants to keep open the door for cooperation between domestic and foreign groups, political sources have said, but also wants to protect jobs and growth at home.
As part of its proposal, KNDS has offered to include Italy in the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) tank project, an option that would give Leonardo the possibility of offering its sensors and electronics for the new tank. 
OTO Melara, which makes naval and terrestrial cannons, would also fit into KNDS's portfolio and strengthen its hand in a 2.2 billion euro contract that the Italian army is due to launch in the near future.
ELIMINATING A COMPETITOR
Italian metalworker unions FIOM and UILM said they had called a one-day strike at some Leonardo plants on Dec. 6 and will organise a rally in Rome on the same day against the sale of the two units to foreign groups.
""Foreign buyers, who specialise exclusively in the terrestrial field, have an interest in acquiring OTO Melara and Wass with the aim of eliminating a competitor ahead of the launch of a new contract for the Italian army,"" the unions said in a flyer distributed to workers at an OTO Melara plant in the Italian city of La Spezia.
The sale could result in the splitting up of the two divisions' land, naval, underwater and munitions' businesses, in a move that could put at risk some of the 1,500 jobs at the units, FIOM and UILM said.
OTO Melara is currently a tank supplier to the Italian army together with Iveco Defence Vehicles, while Wass produces torpedoes.

Fincantieri, which started informal talks with Leonardo over OTO Melara and Wass before KNDS' approach, could decide to join forces with other groups, the sources said.

609,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 02:45PM ET</span>","U.S. Omicron plan: boosters, free at-home tests, tighter travel rules","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration on Thursday sought to ramp up its pandemic response following U.S. detection of the Omicron coronavirus variant this week, making at-home COVID-19 tests available free of charge, accelerating its push for booster shots and tightening rules for travelers.
Below are some of the key measures in the plan, released by the White House and unveiled by President Joe Biden at the National Institutes of Health:
FREE AT-HOME, OVER-THE-COUNTER TESTS
Private health insurance companies will be required to reimburse customers for the cost of over-the-counter at-home COVID-19 tests, the White House said, with the administration issuing federal guidance by Jan. 15.
For the uninsured, at-home tests will be made available at no charge at community testing sites. 
At least eight over-the-counter rapid antigen tests have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT)' BinaxNOW, OraSure Technologies Inc's InteliSwab, ACON Laboratories' FlowFlex and Ellume's home test. Other manufacturers include Quidel (NASDAQ:QDEL) Corp, Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) and Co, Celltrion Inc, iHealth Labs Inc and InBios International Inc. 
Health insurers already cover the more accurate PCR tests done through laboratories that are not FDA-approved for at-home use.
WIDER PUSH FOR BOOSTER SHOTS
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services along with pharmacy companies will launch a public information campaign to encourage booster shots, following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) revised guidance this week recommending all adults get a booster.
Pharmacies will reach out to customers by text and e-mail and take steps to increase vaccine availability, including weekend and evening hours, according to the White House. 
The government's Medicare insurance program for those over 65 and the disabled and the Medicaid program for low-income people will also make outreach efforts to encourage shots among the millions who rely on them.
Federal government employees will receive paid leave to get their booster shots, Biden said, urging private employers to do the same for their workers.
TIGHTER TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS
The U.S. CDC will require inbound international passengers be tested for COVID-19 within one day of departure, regardless of their vaccination status, sources separately told Reuters. Mask requirements on airplanes, trains and public transportation vehicles will be extended through March 18.
The new one-day testing requirement would apply to U.S. citizens as well as foreign nationals and could take effect as early as next week. 
CDC officials also have ordered airlines to disclose passenger names and other information for those who have recently been in eight southern African countries that identified early Omicron cases and will provide it to local and state public health agencies. 
MORE FAMILY VACCINATION CLINICS
The administration will launch hundreds of family vaccination clinics nationwide that will allow eligible parents, grandparents and children to get initial vaccines and booster shots with a ""one-stop-shop,"" the White House said. 
Community health centers will host the clinics throughout December. Mobile health clinics will also be deployed across the country, starting in Washington and New Mexico, according to the plan. 
Retail pharmacies, including CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp will start allowing family-based appointment scheduling, the White House said. 
INCREASING TREATMENT SUPPLIES 

The White House said any new COVID-19 treatment pills approved by U.S. regulators would be ""equitably accessible to all Americans, regardless of their income or their zip code,"" adding that it was working to secure 13 million doses of antiviral courses. 
Biden, speaking at NIH, said some doses already have been secured.

(Reuters) - The European Union's drug regulator said on Thursday it had started a rolling review of the inactivated-virus COVID-19 vaccine from French biotech firm Valneva, weeks after the EU signed a deal with the company for supplies of the shot.
The decision to start the real-time review - which could speed up approval of the shot - was based on preliminary studies that suggest the vaccine, VLA2001, triggers an antibody response against the coronavirus, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in a statement. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-valnevas-covid-19-vaccine-vla2001
Valneva said it was hopeful its vaccine candidate would cross protect people against variants of the virus, adding it would test it specifically against Omicron.
""Valneva believes that VLA2001 can make an important contribution to the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially play a role in protecting against the new Omicron variant,"" the company said. 
COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac, Sanofi-GSK and Russia's Gamaleya Institute are also under the EMA's rolling review, which aims to speed up possible approvals by studying data as it becomes available.
Unlike vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and vaccine candidate  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), the Valneva shot exposes the immune system to the entire coronavirus, not just the spike protein. 
Experts hope that could potentially make the immune response to that shot less sensitive to large mutations on the spike protein. 
The European Commission last month signed its eighth deal for a COVID-19 vaccine with Valneva, under which the company would supply up to 60 million doses of the shot over two years.

Valneva said in October its vaccine demonstrated efficacy ""at least as good, if not better"" than AstraZeneca's shot in a late-stage trial comparing the two, with significantly fewer adverse side effects. 
AstraZeneca's vaccine is already approved in the EU, as are shots from Pfizer-BioNTech,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson. (This story corrects description to inactivated virus, in paragraph 1)

However, the stock is currently trading significantly below its 52-week high of $29.44, closing yesterday’s trading session at $7.97. So, let’s evaluate if it is wise to buy the dip in the stock now. Read on.
Integrated fuel cell company FuelCell Energy, Inc. (FCEL), in Danbury, Conn., on November 2 signed a six-month extension with Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) to continue collaborating on carbonate fuel cell technology. Over the past three months, the stock soared 25.1% in price to close yesterday’s trading session at $7.97. This is partly due to investors’ optimism surrounding the passage of the bi-partisan infrastructure bill, which includes $9.50 billion to accelerate the development of clean hydrogen technology. In addition, the stock soared in price in October on retail investor interest.
However, it is uncertain if the infrastructure bill-related funding will directly benefit FCEL. The stock has lost 16.4% in price over the past month and 28.7% year-to-date.
Also, the company had entered an open market sale agreement in June 2021, pursuant to which it may, from time to time, offer and sell shares. This could lead to share dilution. In addition, FCEL reported losses in the last reported quarter. So, the stock’s near-term prospects look bleak.

However, because domestic travel remains off the government's radar regarding the imposition of travel restrictions, is now the right time to scoop up the shares of DAL? Let's find out.Incorporated in 1924, Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE:DAL) operates scheduled passenger and freight flights across the United States and internationally. In addition, the Atlanta, Ga.-based company offers third-party customer vacation packages, aircraft charters, aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul services.
Closing yesterday's trading session at $33.53, the stock has declined 17.1% in price over the past month, due mainly to concerns over the airline industry’s recovery with the emergence of the omicron variant, which could spell fresh travel restrictions.
As governments worldwide tighten international travel restrictions, investors fear a slowdown in future bookings and delays in the industry’s already sluggish recovery. This, along with DAL's already poor profitability, might cause the stock to remain under pressure in the near term.

614,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 02:21PM ET</span>","U.S. SEC mandates Chinese companies detail ownership structure, audits","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Chinese companies that list on U.S. stock exchanges must disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a government entity, and provide evidence of their auditing inspections, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Thursday.
The rule advances a process that could lead to more than 200 companies being kicked off U.S. exchanges and could make some Chinese companies less attractive to investors.
The new rules implement a law passed by Congress in December 2020 that aims to ensure foreign companies listed in the United States, in particular Chinese companies, comply with U.S. rules.
Unlike many countries, China has not allowed the SEC's accounting body, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, to inspect its auditors, which in turn certify the accounts of Chinese companies listed in the United States.
Chinese authorities are reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms due to national security concerns.
U.S. regulators worry the lack of U.S. oversight is putting investors at risk.
At its core, ""the finalized rule will allow investors to easily identify registrants whose auditing firms are located in a foreign jurisdiction that the PCAOB cannot completely inspect. Moreover, foreign issuers will be required to disclose the level of foreign government ownership in those entities,"" said an SEC official.
The rule will also require enhanced disclosures from Chinese entities listing in the United States via a vehicle known as a variable interest entity (VIE).
While that structure allows Chinese companies in some sectors to circumvent domestic rules on listing overseas, U.S. regulators worry the structure creates risks for investors and may obscure information on their ultimate ownership.

Companies will have 15 days to dispute an SEC designation that they require enhanced disclosure .
The SEC has up to three years to order delisting of companies that do not comply with the rules.

(Reuters) -Laboratory analysis of the antibody-based COVID-19 therapy GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) is developing with U.S. partner Vir has indicated the drug is effective against the new Omicron variant, the British drugmaker said on Thursday.
A GSK statement said that lab tests and a study on hamsters have demonstrated the sotrovimab antibody cocktail works against viruses that were bio-engineered to carry a number of hallmark mutations of the Omicron variant.
The two companies have been engineering so-called pseudoviruses that feature major coronavirus mutations across all suspicious variants that have emerged so far, and have run lab tests on their vulnerability to sotrovimab treatment.
An analysis of past tests has now yielded the preliminary clearance for the drug, because Omicron' main mutations have been found across a variety of previous variants. 
""We've been carefully following every mutation that might be important,"" said Herbert Virgin, Vir's Chief Scientific Officer.
""With this new variant, the mutations that we have tested so far have no significant effect on sotrovimab,"" he added. 
Importantly, the mutations within the area on the spike protein that the sotrovimab antibodies bind to did not make a difference.
For confirmation, a pseudovirus with all of the Omicron mutations is now being tested, with an update expected by the end of the year, GSK added in its statement. 
The antibody is designed to latch on to the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus, but Omicron has been found to have an unusually high number of mutations on that protein. 
“Sotrovimab was deliberately designed with a mutating virus in mind,"" said Vir Chief Executive George Scangos, adding that the drug was targeting a region of the spike protein that was highly unlikely to mutate. 
Separately, Britain's drug regulator on Thursday approved sotrovimab, also known under the brand name Xevudy, for people with mild to moderate COVID-19 and who are at high risk of developing severe disease.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommended use of Xevudy as soon as possible and within five days of the onset of symptoms. 

Sotrovimab is based on monoclonal antibodies, which are lab-made versions of natural antibodies the body generates to fight off infection. Similar products are offered or being developed by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).
Regeneron on Tuesday said that lab tests and computer modelling suggest that COVID-19 antibody drugs including Regeneron's would have reduced efficacy against the Omicron variant.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The growth of online virtual worlds will help advance the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies for payment transactions but it won't be a game-changer, according to Frédéric Chesnais, chief executive of French fintech company Crypto Blockchain Industries. 
In blockchain-based 3D virtual worlds, often referred to as metaverses, users can purchase and trade virtual assets and services using cryptocurrencies. Some analysts have argued the growing popularity of metaverses will drive an explosion in digital tokens.
""I think it will be important but I don't think this is the key turning point,"" Chesnais, who was until earlier this year the CEO of videogame company Atari told a Reuters NEXT panel on Thursday.
Interest in the metaverse exploded after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said in October it was changing its name to Meta and would be focusing on building its own virtual world. Other big companies and smaller fintechs are also rushing to develop digital worlds. 
Crypto Blockchain Industries invests in blockchain projects and is developing AlphaVerse, a blockchain-based metaverse.
Chesnais said that the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies will be driven by the more than one billion people globally who do not have access to a bank account because they may not have an address or an official identity.
""The only way for these people to have access to a better way of life and be part of the economic system is to have a wallet and to be paid in cryptocurrency,"" he said.

“This is the most important moment for crypto.""
On Wednesday, Yat Siu, the chairman and co-founder Animoca Brands -- which invests in and builds various virtual worlds -- cautioned that while digital assets are set to grow as virtual worlds become more popular, investors in these technologies will face ""bumps in the road"" as the technologies mature.

Belarus Potash Company (BPC) is the exporting arm of Belarusian state potash producer Belaruskali and is Minsk's main foreign currency earner. BPC ships potash mainly to China, India and Brazil. 
The U.S. Treasury said on Thursday that it issued a general license authorising wind down of transactions involving BPC until April 1. [nL1N2SN1N7]
""While there is a high chance that the licence will be prolonged... some customers will still try to avoid new business,"" VTB Capital said. ""It is crucially important to see how willing China and India are to sign new contracts (with BPC).""
BPC, whose supplies are currently handled by the Klaipeda port in Lithuania, did not immediately reply to a Reuters' request for comment. Belaruskali was sanctioned in August, the deadline for wind-down of operations with it expires on Dec. 8.
The general license allows wind-down activities, avoiding disruptions to shipments in transit, while not allowing new business, said Brian O'Toole, a former Treasury Department official now with the Atlantic Council.
Because no new business is authorised, ""there's going to be an immediate impact, presumably, to price, especially in the U.S.,"" he added.
With 12.5 million tonnes potash to be produced in 2021, Belaruskali is the world's second largest producer of the crop nutrient after  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) Ltd, VTB Capital said.
""This news will further support the already elevated potash price, which is currently at 13-year high,"" it added.

The expanded U.S. sanctions do not change global supply and demand, but North American potash producers Nutrien and Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS) stand to benefit, Scotiabank analyst Ben Isaacson said in a note.
Nutrien shares rose as much as 3.4% in Toronto, while Mosaic stock gained as much as 3.9% in New York.

Furthermore, some stocks showed early signs of recovery this week after vaccine manufacturers announced that they were on their way to producing vaccines to immunize against the omicron variant.
Although the economy is under inflationary pressure, a recent decline in weekly jobless claims, better-than-expected private payrolls in November, and President Biden's strategic initiatives to contain the spread of the omicron variant should keep the market’s momentum going.

(Reuters) -Newmont Corp projected a jump in gold production for 2022 on Thursday as its operations recover from a pandemic-driven hit and investments to boost output at its Boddington mine in Australia and Ahafo in Ghana pay-off.
The world's top gold producer forecast output of 6.2 million ounces for next year, up from the 6 million ounces it expects to produce in 2021. Total gold output combined with other metals is estimated to be 7.5 million gold equivalent ounces in 2022.
While gold prices have declined this year due to the economic recovery and winding down of pandemic-era stimulus, the detection of the new Omicron coronavirus variant has recently boosted appeal of safer assets.
Denver, Colorado-based Newmont said it expected full-year gold production to rise to between 6.2 million and 6.8 million ounces over the next five years.
It forecast 2022 attributable capital expenditure of about $2.13 billion.
""The next two years, two and a half years are the most significant reinvestment period that Newmont has had in at least a generation,"" Chief Executive Thomas Palmer said on a conference call.
""And it's a bit of a combination of the pandemic having those projects stack up on each other a bit more than would have been our intent.""
The miner expects all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of $1,050 per ounce in 2022, with the figure set to reduce to between $920 and $1,020 per ounce by 2024. AISC is a key metric used by miners to measure overall cost of producing gold.
The pandemic's impact on its operations had forced Newmont to cut its 2021 production outlook and hike its AISC forecast in October.

The miner said on Thursday it was on track to return more than $2 billion to shareholders in 2021.
Its shares were down 1.7%, tracking weaker gold prices.

623,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 01:18PM ET</span>",SEC Moves a Step Closer to Delisting Chinese Companies in the U.S.,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government is inching further on efforts to boot Chinese companies off American stock exchanges for not complying with Washington’s disclosure requirements. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday announced its final plan for putting in place a new law that mandates foreign companies open their books to U.S. scrutiny or risk being kicked off the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq within three years. China and Hong Kong are the only two jurisdictions that refuse to allow the inspections despite Washington requiring them since 2002.  
The SEC’s new rule, which lays out how the regulator will identify companies subject to delisting and the procedure for kicking non-compliant firms off exchanges, is the latest development in a tussle between financial officials in the world’s two biggest economies. While much of the recent tension has been around the shell companies that Chinese firms use to list in the U.S., Thursday’s regulation dates back decades.  
“If you want to issue public securities in the U.S., the firms that audit your books have to be subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. “While more than 50 jurisdictions have worked with the PCAOB to allow the required inspections, two historically have not: China and Hong Kong”
The rule gets the ball rolling on a process that could lead to more than 200 companies being kicked off U.S. exchanges. At issue is a problem that has vexed U.S. regulators for more than a decade: China’s refusal to let inspectors from the PCAOB review audits of firms such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). that trade on American exchanges. It has gained urgency due to rising tensions between the two countries and following the high-profile accounting scandal at  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) Inc.
In a rare bipartisan move during the Trump administration, Congress in December 2020 mandated that Chinese companies finally open their books -- and required the SEC to write rules for the ones that don’t comply. Thursday’s final plan satisfies that requirement.
The new rules comes after SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in July that the regulator would halt new Chinese initial public offerings, in part over a lack of disclosure around those so-called variable interest entities. Separately, Bloomberg News reported earlier this week that China was planning to ban companies from going public on foreign stock markets through VIEs.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Thursday said it will launch an optional audio recording pilot program in three U.S. cities to enhance safety, allowing drivers and riders to send trip recordings to Uber in case of a safety incident.
Uber at the end of 2019 disclosed it had received 6,000 reports of sexual assault and 107 road fatalities related to 2.3 billion U.S. trips in 2017 and 2018. The recording feature is intended to provide drivers and riders with added security if they feel uncomfortable and allow users to submit proof of how a situation unfolded, Uber said.
The audio recording feature was launched in Latin America two years ago and is available in 14 countries in the region, but will roll out in the United States for the first time.
Launching in Kansas City, Missouri, Louisville, Kentucky and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina later this month, drivers and riders will be able to opt into audio recording for individual trips through the Uber app. 
Riders are alerted to drivers potentially recording a trip via an in-app banner and can cancel if they are uncomfortable, Uber said.
Uber Vice President of Product Management Sachin Kansal said the company has applied lessons learned in Latin America to ensure privacy, transparency and convenience.
Encrypted recordings are stored in the Uber app and users are not able to play them, Kansal said. If a safety incident occurs, users filing a safety report can send the recording to qualified Uber staff who are able to decrypt it, Kansal said.
""We expect that people will be very accepting of this feature,"" Kansal said. ""As we learn from those cities and get feedback, we can expand it further.""

Uttara Sivaram, Uber's senior manager of public policy, said the company would initially focus the recording feature on U.S. jurisdictions with one party consent laws. 
A spokeswoman on Wednesday said the company was awaiting full-year traffic fatality data from U.S. regulators to finalize its safety report for the years 2019 and 2020.

In September, the EV maker announced a deal to go public through a reverse merger with special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Gores Guggenheim at a valuation of $20 billion. That deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022.
Polestar, based in Gothenburg, Sweden, expects global sales to hit 29,000 this year, and with plans to launch a new vehicle annually for the next three years, it expects to sell 290,000 units by 2025, Ingenlath said.
The Polestar 4 SUV coupe is scheduled to follow in 2023 and the Polestar 5 four-door GT in 2024. The company expects 40% of sales in the medium term to come from Europe and 30% each from North America and Asia.

Polestar expects revenue of $1.6 billion this year, double that amount next year, and is targeting $17 billion in 2025, according to Ingenlath.
Part of that push will be the addition of over-the-air updates for its vehicles, starting with a performance upgrade for the Polestar 2 that sells for about 1,000 euros and gives a 68-horsepower boost in performance. The company also expects to add self-driving capability on the highway for the Polestar 3 around mid-decade.

Investing.com — Biofrontera AG ADR (NASDAQ:BFRA) shares rose 37% Thursday after the company said the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued a notice of allowance for its pain-reducing illumination therapy.
The notice is for the U.S. patent application titled ""Illumination for Photodynamic Therapy,"" that Biofrontera says covers an "" innovative, pain-reducing illumination protocol for photodynamic therapy (PDT).""
Photodynamic therapy is a treatment process that combines a drug and light to kill abnormal cells.
Biofrontera CEO Erica Monaco said the patent ""strengthens Biofrontera's competitiveness"" for an FDA-approved combination product and provides ""an opportunity to pursue label expansion to include more patient-friendly protocols."" 
The company's shares hit a high of $6.58 earlier in the session but now trade around $5.96."
627,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 12:37PM ET</span>",Saving the dinosaurs: Startups drive to electrify fossil-fuel cars,"By Nick Carey
SILVERSTONE, England (Reuters) - You can save your prized Aston Martin DB6, Porsche 911 or Mustang from the museum of combustion engine history. Or your Fiat 500 and  Renault  (PA:RENA) Clio, for that matter.
That's the message from a growing cohort of European and American startups seeking to carve out roles in the auto transition by converting the roaring dinosaurs of the fossil-fuel age into clean electric vehicles (EVs).
At the high end, companies like Britain's Lunaz sell a ""remanufactured"" Aston Martin DB6 for 1 million pounds ($1.3 million), or Dutch firm Voitures Extravert, which sells a reengineered 1960s Porsche 911 for 300,000 euros ($337,000).
At the lower end, startups like France's Transition-One have developed no-frills kits designed to electrify mass-market models like the Fiat 500 and Renault Clio in a few hours for about 8,000 euros. They are betting they can provide drivers with a cheaper and greener road to zero emissions than scrapping their car and buying a new one. 
EV conversion is a cottage industry that's emerged over the past five years, and been turbo-charged by advances in battery technology and electric motors in the past two. The market is largely untested, and several industry players interviewed by Reuters described an exciting, if precarious, scene. 
""It's pretty revolutionary at the moment,"" said Mark Roberts, a 30-year McLaren veteran who is now chief creative officer at British startup Charge Cars. ""Almost every month there are new companies popping up and you don't know who'll fade away after a year or so or who'll be there for the duration.""
Next year Charge Cars will launch production of 499 electric versions of 1960s Mustangs, built from the ground up using car bodies produced under license from Ford and starting at 300,000 pounds apiece. The company, which initially set out to convert classic cars, has spent five years developing an electric replica model instead. 
""Traditional manufacturers like Porsche can afford to screw up,"" says CEO Vadim Shageleev. ""We're a startup, so we can't."" 
Established startups like his have attracted attention from traditional auto suppliers and manufacturers seeking technical input as they transition to electric -  Michelin  (PA:MICP), for instance, has partnered with Charge Cars to test new technologies.
But there may be little room for error as a host of new EV conversion startups strive for scale to help them weather the increasing regulatory standards and costs that have begun to be introduced in countries like France. 
""New regulations will wipe out a lot of smaller players because they won't be in position to meet the standards,"" said Chris Hazell, founder of Britain's Zero EV, another startup working on mass-producing conversion kits for Porsche 964s and other classic models. His company will expand to the United States next year.
CLASSIC TO GARBAGE
There are various proposed routes to scale.
Lunaz, for example, sees classic cars like the Aston Martin DB6 as a good start.
The three-year-old company and its competitors at this end of the EV conversion industry aim to capitalise on the world's large population of classic vehicles, with an estimated 5 million in the United States alone.
Lunaz typically buys a classic car on the open market or takes a customer's existing vehicle, strips it down to the bare metal, rebuilds it, gives it a fresh paint job, new interior and an electric drive system and software with a range of about 250 miles. 
But Lunaz sees its future in commercial vehicles, and is building a new factory at Silverstone in central England, home to the British Grand Prix, to convert more than 1,000 diesel garbage trucks a year into upgraded electric models. 
""Classic cars were the lightning rod to get us to market,"" founder David Lorenz said. ""But if you want to have a real impact, you've got to have scale.""
Lorenz told Reuters the company was scoping out sites for a U.S. plant and one in continental Europe, and was considering going public within a few years.
'THROW THESE CARS AWAY?'
In France, by comparison, the race is heating up among mass-market converters who spy an opportunity in the country's anti-road pollution plans, which outpace much of Europe. 
All diesels older than 2011 will be banned in large cities from the start of 2025, affecting millions of car owners. Paris wants to go faster and implement the ban from 2024.
New vehicle retrofitting laws introduced in the country last year, which startups say require government testing of about 100,000 euros per generic model to be converted, have intensified the need for scale. 
Orleans-based converter Transition-One plans to start selling conversion kits for six models including the popular Fiat 500 and Renault Clio for those diesel owners who cannot afford a new EV. The kits consist of battery, electric motor, power electronics, and new instrument cluster, and typically have a range of about 140 km.
The cost to customers could be close to 5,000 euros including government subsidies, said CEO Aymeric Libeau, who said he aimed to produce kits ""at scale"" next year, having waited for the retrofitting laws to materialise, with the gear to be installed by independent mechanics certified by Transition-One. 
Arnaud Pigounides, CEO of Paris-based REV Mobilities, estimates converting a car to electric cuts emissions 60% versus scrapping an old vehicle and producing a new one, in a country home to around 40 million passenger cars.
Pigounides said his company, which offers to convert a range of cars and commercial vans for around half the price of a new vehicle, has orders to convert 370 cars and 1,500 vans. 
""The big question is: do we throw all those cars away or do we convert them?"" he added.
'HOW DO WE DO 10,000?'
Chris Pateman-Jones, CEO of British vehicle charging company Connected Kerb, said only ""mass market"" options in the EV conversion industry could make a real difference to the environment, rather than classic cars.
""The cost of producing a new car is huge, so if you can reuse what's there it's a fantastic idea,"" he said. ""But the challenge is doing it at sufficient scale to actually have a meaningful impact.""
For four-year-old startup Electrogenic, based down the road from Lunaz, the plan to reach significant size is to tap into rural Britain's four-wheel drive market, specifically the Land Rover Defenders popular among farmers.
Co-founder Steve Drummond said the company was developing a kit for old Land Rover Defenders for 20,000 pounds that local mechanics can install. He added that Britain's 36,000 farms need four-wheel drive EVs but there are no equivalent new models on the market.
Across the world in California, meanwhile, Zero Labs is aware of the limits of its current business performing electric ""restomods"" to rebuild classic Ford Broncos and Land Rovers.

The company's vehicles start at $350,000, but it can only convert around 50 a year - so it is developing electric platforms that licensed auto shops can use to convert classic cars.
""We asked ourselves how do we do 10,000 a year?"" CEO Adam Roe said. ""Our platforms are going to be our scale product.""

(Reuters) -Kroger Co raised full-year sales and profit forecasts after its results topped estimates on Thursday, as a sustained boom in at-home cooking lifts demand for the retailer's groceries, sending its shares up 12%. A rise in U.S. COVID-19 cases during the third quarter also boosted sales at grocers, with some such as Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) forced to reinstate limits on purchases of items including tissues, roll towels and bottled water, as consumers resumed hoarding some goods. 
""We believe the food at home change is structural and not temporary, with most people consuming meals at home and grocery stores continuing to capture the majority share of stomach,"" Kroger (NYSE:KR) Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen said in an analyst call. 
Concerns over the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus could also potentially boost sales at Kroger in the coming weeks if consumers return to pantry stocking, CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram said. 
""If there are more restrictions at restaurants or service outlets, it would result in more consumers eating at home, and Kroger, being the largest conventional food retailer in the U.S., is well positioned to benefit from that."" 
A Kroger spokesperson told Reuters the company was closely monitoring the situation around the Omicron variant and was encouraging shoppers ""to only buy what they need.""
Kroger said it expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of $3.40 to $3.50, compared with its prior forecast of $3.25 to $3.35. 
The higher forecast comes against the backdrop of a 41-basis-point decline in the company's third-quarter adjusted gross margin rate as Kroger spent heavily on increasing shipping capacity to mitigate supply-chain disruptions and also due to cost inflation.

The company expects annual same-store sales to dip 0.2% to 0.4%, compared to a fall of 1% to 1.5% it forecast previously. 
Kroger's sales rose 7.2% to $31.86 billion in the third quarter.

The tentative agreement, reached after multiple rounds of talks with the union, includes wage increases and benefits for all employees and better terms for temporary employees.
The latest agreement allows for all temporary employees with four or more years of service to move to permanent positions with better pay and benefits.
Union members had previously opposed Kellogg (NYSE:K)'s two-tier employment system that did not offer temporary workers, who make up 30% of its workforce, a pathway to become permanent staff.
Employees at Kellogg's cereal plants including Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Tennessee went on strike on Oct. 5 after their contracts expired, as negotiations over payment and benefits stalled due to differences between the company and about 1,400 union members. 
The new deal, which will be voted on by Kellogg employees on Dec. 5, will also offer permanent employees with better post-retirement benefits. 
During lengthy negotiations with union members, Kellogg had hired permanent replacements for some of its plant workers on strike, and also warned of a dent to its annual profit due to the disruption. 

Kellogg is one of the several major U.S. companies that has faced worker strikes in the recent past as the labor market tightens and inflation reaches record highs. 
Last month, farm equipment maker Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co reached an agreement with workers after a six week strike.

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on Thursday raised the number of diverse directors it wants on portfolio company boards, citing rising shareholder expectations and more demographic data showing who is who.
Starting in March, Goldman Sachs Asset Management will expect companies whose shares it owns to have at least 10% of their directors be women, unless there is a higher local minimum requirement, said Catherine Winner, head of stewardship for the division managing about $2 trillion, in an interview.
At a board with between 11 to 20 directors, for instance, that would mean at least two women, an increase from Goldman's Goldman's prior requirement that boards have at least one woman. 
In addition, Goldman will require companies in the S&P 500 and FTSE 100 to have at least one director from an under-represented ethnic minority group. In last year's guidelines, Goldman had stopped short of such an explicit requirement because of challenges around obtaining details about directors' race or ethnicity.
But since then, many more companies have begun to share such details, Winner said, making the requirement more practical. ""The data is better and we're messaging the importance of diversity to these companies. We need action from them,"" she said.
The lack of female and minority representation at the highest levels of corporate leadership has come under growing scrutiny from investors and employees.
As of June for instance just 2.5% of board seats at California companies were held by Hispanic or Latino directors, even though they account for 39.4% of the state's population.

When companies do not meet expectations Goldman Sachs said it will cast proxy votes against boards' nominating committee members, and will continue to vote against all members of U.S. boards that do no include any women.
Globally about 2,500 companies would not meet the new requirements, Winner said.

As such, we think Mid-cap names AerCap (AER), Jabil (JBL), Olin (NYSE:OLN), AutoNation (NYSE:AN), and Penske Automotive (PAG), which each possesses solid fundamentals, could be ideal bets now. Read on.Factors such as the emergence of another infectious coronavirus variant, rising inflation, geopolitical tensions, supply chain constraints, and the Federal Reserve’s decision to taper its bond-buying soon are driving market volatility. The major benchmark indexes witnessed a sell-off last Friday, raising concerns about a potential market correction in the near term.
Against this backdrop, fundamentally sound mid-cap stocks could be ideal bets. Historically, mid-cap stocks have delivered better returns than large-cap stocks and remained more stable than small-cap stocks. With favorable policies encouraging domestic production, and with ongoing efforts to address supply chain issues acting as a support, mid-cap stocks should benefit this month and beyond.
Therefore, we think investors could consider betting on mid-cap stocks AerCap Holdings N.V. (AER), Jabil Inc. (JBL), Olin Corporation (OLN), AutoNation, Inc. (AN), and Penske Automotive Group, Inc.

(Reuters) -European shares fell more than 1% on Thursday, as countries ramped up restrictions to curb the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, raising worries about hits to a nascent economic recovery.
The continent-wide STOXX 600 closed down 1.2%, giving back more than half of the previous day's gains when a recovery in the pandemic-exposed sectors triggered the STOXX 600's best session in almost six months.
Germany agreed on new COVID-19 restrictions on Thursday that focussed on the unvaccinated, and the United States tightened travel restrictions, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the Omicron variant showed the pandemic could be around for ""some time.""
Travel and leisure shares, which suffer the most from movement curbs, fell 2.6%, bringing losses this year to 7%, significantly underperforming other major sectors which are on course to gain in double digits.
Europe's equity benchmark has seen sharp fluctuations in recent days on uncertainties about how contagious and severe the new variant is, and the effectiveness of current vaccines in tackling it.
""We're going to stay in this pattern of up one day and down the next as long as the Omicron story remains an unknown,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital.

638,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 12:03PM ET</span>",Management turmoil complicates Telecom Italia bid response,"By Elvira Pollina, Stephen Jewkes and Pamela Barbaglia
MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) is looking to draw up a list of candidates on Friday to advise it on a takeover approach from U.S. group KKR as banks jockey for position in Europe's biggest ever private equity deal.
But divisions within Italy's biggest phone group are making it difficult for the company to respond to KKR's non-binding bid approach valued at 33 billion euros ($37.40 billion) when debt is factored in.
Tensions are still running high after a shareholder row a week ago forced Luigi Gubitosi to step down as CEO following a clash with the group's top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) and independent board members.
In last week's drama, TIM placed oversight of the group's strategic assets in the hands of Chairman Salvatore Rossi, setting up a special committee to study the KKR approach that was made public on Nov. 21. 
But top management remains in limbo and the board split on key issues.
Two people close to the matter said the Vivendi representatives and other board members are pushing for a full board reshuffle after Gubitosi refused to formally step down from the board - a move that prevented new general manager Pietro Labriola being named CEO last week.
""The committee is meeting on Friday to discuss advisers but it's not clear if they'll succeed given all the upheaval,"" one of the sources said.
Vivendi declined to comment.
KKR - which industry sources said was working with Citi,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JP Morgan - has said any deal is conditional on support from the Italian government as well as the TIM board.
""But right now there is no management team at TIM and there is no more strategic plan ... how can you evaluate a bid if you have no standalone strategy plan?"" another source familiar with the matter said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Intesa division IMI (LON:IMI) CIB and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) had been lined up for a possible role in advising TIM before Gubitosi stepped aside, two other sources said, but they added that the situation was uncertain.
Rothschild and Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) are now also squaring off for a role with TIM, the sources said.
KKR's non-binding offer is also dependent on a four-week due diligence which will need a green light from TIM. No special board meeting has been called to date ahead of a scheduled regular meeting on Dec.17.
The Italian government, which is TIM's second-largest investor with a 10% stake, has special anti-takeover powers to shield companies deemed of strategic importance from foreign bids.

Furthermore, shipping delays, delivery charges, and the capacity for in-person product evaluation have shifted consumer preference back toward physical stores. Therefore, we think investors are better off avoiding e-commerce stocks Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Wayfair (NYSE:W), which possess bleak financials. Read on.The e-commerce industry benefited enormously from the pandemic-led lockdowns last year, with a dramatic shift in consumer preference toward online shopping. Many conventional brick-and-mortar stores transformed their business strategies to boost their online presence in response to shifting customer behavior.
However, with significant progress in vaccinations and the easing of social distancing rules, brick-and-mortar stores have witnessed a substantial increase in foot traffic over the past few months. In addition, researchers found that approximately 40% of consumers prefer in-store shopping over online due to high delivery charges, shipping delays, and the opportunity to examine products in person before buying.
The increasing popularity of physical stores may make it difficult for e-commerce companies with bleak fundamentals to stay afloat. Therefore, we believe fundamentally weak e-commerce stocks Etsy, Inc. (ETSY) and  Wayfair Inc . (W) are best avoided now.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Siemens Chief Executive Roland Busch picked up 6.94 million euros ($7.86 million) in compensation for the 2021 business year, his first year leading the engineering and technology company, the group's annual report, published on Thursday, showed.
The 57-year-old, who took over from long-serving CEO Joe Kaeser in February, saw his compensation, including pension contributions, increase from the 5.05 million euros he received a year earlier as deputy CEO, the annual report said.
Kaeser, who led Siemens from 2013, picked up 4.6 million euros for the year to end of Sept. 2021, the report said, down from 9.27 million euros he received a year earlier.
During the business year, Siemens increased its revenue by 11% and net income by 59% as the trains and industrial software maker bounced back from the pandemic hit 2021.
Busch will pick up a maximum of 15.3 million euros for 2022 if he exceeds all his goals for next year, the annual report said. The targets include comparable revenue growth, and basic earnings per share, as well as increasing sustainability and diversity.
For 2022, Siemens is targeting revenue growth in the mid-single digit percentage range, and basic earnings per share of 8.70 to 9.10 euros, up from 8.32 euros in the 2021 fiscal year.
Busch's fellow board members also got bigger compensation packages for 2021. Cedrik Neike, who leads the Digital Industries unit, saw his compensation increase to 4.12 million euros, while Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas's package rose to 4.82 million euros. 
Matthias Rebellius, a new board member and the head of Smart Infrastructure division, received 3.44 million euros, while fellow newcomer Judith Wiese, who is chief people and sustainability officer, got 4.19 million euros.

Chairman Jim Hagemann-Snabe's compensation package fell to 608,000 euros from 632,000 euros, as the supervisory board held fewer meetings due to pandemic restrictions.

The company had cut production of iPhone 13 by as many as 10 million units, down from a target of 90 million, due to a global chip shortage, but now it has informed vendors even those numbers look unlikely, the report said.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares fell over 3%, dragging down those of iPhone component and semiconductor suppliers Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS), Europe's ASML and Infineon (OTC:IFNNY). 
Apple and its suppliers did not respond to Reuters requests for comments.
The holiday season is Apple's biggest quarter and typically so, for its most important product, the iPhones, which start at $699 and go as high as $1,600.
Analysts had expected demand to remain steady for new products, but lowered shipping estimates as supply-chain issues burdened the company as well as many retailers who faced inventory shortages.
Consumers, who splurged on new phones and laptops during the peak of the pandemic as they stayed indoors, are now spending more on vacations and outdoor activities.
""As lockdowns eased, spending returned on these experiential activities, so may be less for the new iPhone. We believe that (iPhone) demand is likely to be pushed out in 2022,"" Counterpoint Research analyst Tarun Pathak said. 

IDC analyst Ryan Reith believed it is not so much as demand for smartphones was drying up, but U.S. consumer spending was slowing due to the pandemic.
Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook warned in October that the impact of supply constraints, which cost the company $6 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, will be worse during the holiday quarter even as demand for the new lineup was robust.

And because the demand for lithium is projected to remain robust in the coming months, we think lithium stocks  Albemarle  Corporation (NYSE:ALB) and Sociedad Quimica y Minera De Chile (SQM) could be ideal bets now. Let’s discuss.Lithium is a critical component in manufacturing a wide range of products—from pesticides to cell batteries and industrial agents. Lithium-ion batteries are an integral part of electric cars (EVs), which are gaining popularity daily. So, the demand for lithium is projected to remain robust for the foreseeable future as nations worldwide invest heavily to replace fossil-fuel-powered cars with EVs.
According to reports, the global lithium market is expected to reach $8.2 million by 2028, registering a 14.8% CAGR. In addition, the price of lithium carbonate, a vital element in rechargeable batteries, has risen 276% in China since the beginning of the year to 197,500 yuan ($30,940) per ton, thanks to rising demand.
Albemarle Corporation (ALB) and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) use lithium as a raw component in their production processes. So, we think these fundamentally sound stocks could be solid picks to cash in on soaring lithium prices.

LONDON (Reuters) - Air France-KLM is considering delaying its planned capital increase because of tough travel restrictions imposed by governments to mitigate the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, two sources familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. 
The French-Dutch carrier was hoping to raise at least 1 billion euros ($1.13 billion) by the end of the year to shore up its heavily-indebted, pandemic-hit balance sheet and repay government aid, but this is now likely to be delayed, the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
""The mathematics of it doesn't work. They need to sell a recovery story and that doesn't work with Omicron hovering,"" said one of the sources. Air France-KLM declined to comment. 
The United States, Japan, Hong Kong and a number of European countries are among those to have tightened borders and imposed new restrictions amid uncertainty around the virulence of the new variant and its ability to evade vaccine protection. 
Shares in travel companies around the globe have plummeted since news of the variant emerged, with British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) down almost 15% since Friday and Lufthansa and Air France-KLM down around 9%. 
The airline already completed a 4 billion euro recapitalisation package in April which included state support and a 1.036 billion euros rights issue that doubled the French government's stake to 30%. 
It had more than 10 billion euros of cash at hand at the end of September and can afford to delay the plan. Yet, it needs to reimburse state aid to lift a EU ban on merger and acquisition (M&A) deals, a source at the French government said. 
SOARING DEBT 
Air France-KLM's chief executive Ben Smith said at the end of September the company was aiming to raise new funds ""as soon as possible"", without providing an exact date. Government bailouts via perpetual instruments have pushed Air France's total debt to 10.2 billion euros, according to Refinitiv Eikon records, and the company has seen its borrowing costs spike over the past week. 
""I would not be advising them to come to market anytime soon - market conditions are not ideal for any company at the moment, let alone an unrated travel firm,"" said a third source, from the banking sector. 

Air France-KLM does not have a rating from any of the main credit ratings agencies and is therefore not eligible for European Central Bank corporate debt purchases.

The European Union executive had four years ago launched legal action against Italy for failing to police allegations of emissions-test cheating by Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis.
Stellantis and Italy's Transport ministry were not immediately available for comment.
The Commission said it had asked Italy to explain its failure to comply with its obligation to enforce emission rules based on European regulation.
According to the regulation, member states are required to set and implement rules on penalties for the use of banned so-called defeat devices that hamper the efficiency of emission control systems, resulting in higher emissions for vehicles.

The Commission said that Italy had ordered a mandatory recall of the affected vehicles, but had failed to apply penalties.
Italy now has two months to reply and take the necessary measures, otherwise the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

The company has already felt the effects of the global supply chain issues and had to slash its iPhone 13 production target by around 10 million units for this year, while in the fourth quarter of the 2021 fiscal year it posted a rare revenue miss, due to supply chain challenges. 
While demand for the iPhone 13 is reported to have weakened, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has taken the opposite opinion, increasing the price target on Apple shares to $200 from $185 and telling investors that he has increased confidence in the model. 
“Our iPhone 13 checks continue to be much stronger than expected with our belief that Apple is now on pace to sell north of 40 million iPhones during the holiday season despite the chip shortage headwinds,"" Ives told investors in a research note.
""The focus of the Street has been on the lingering chip shortage for Apple (and every other tech and automotive player), however the underlying iPhone 13 demand story for Cupertino both domestically and in China is trending well ahead of Street expectations in our opinion,” he added."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co said Thursday it would extend a production halt at its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, which makes the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle, through Jan 28.
The largest U.S. automaker in August widened its recall of the Bolt to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules and to address fire risks after a series of fires.
The suburban Detroit plant halted production in August but conducted two weeks of limited production at Orion starting Nov. 1 to help provide courtesy transportation vehicles for customers during recall repairs.
GM President Mark Reuss said in October the company was addressing the recall before resuming production of new vehicles. GM said Thursday it continued ""to focus on battery module replacements.""
GM disclosed in October that its battery partner, South Korea's LG Electronics, had agreed to reimburse it for the $2 billion in estimated costs and expenses associated with the Bolt recall.

GM and LG Energy Solution are building two joint-venture U.S. battery plants.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has an ongoing investigation into the battery fires. The agency noted in August that all Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles had been recalled due to the risk of the high-voltage battery pack catching fire.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday, as investors tempered their concerns about the new Omicron strain of Covid-19 against the backdrop of another set of healthy labor market data.
A senior  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) executive said earlier that his company doesn't foresee a big drop in the effectiveness of its current vaccine against the new variant, while GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) said early trial data said its experimental antiviral treatment Sotrovimab appeared effective against all known variants of the disease, including Omicron. GSK ADRs rose 1.0% while shares in its research partner Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) consolidated, having risen 50% in the last week. 
By 9:50 AM ET (1450 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 393 points, or 1.2% at 34,415 points its cyclical-heavy composition helping it to outperform the other major indices after a couple of days of underperformance. The S&P 500 was up 1.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%.
Despite the broadly positive tone, the standout mover was falling. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell as much as 4% before paring losses to be down only 2.1%, after a newswire report that said demand for its new generation of iPhones is weakening due to limited availability and high prices. Despite partial success in diversifying its business into services in recent years, the iPhone remains central to Apple's business outlook.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said that the number of initial jobless claims last week had risen to 222,000, still the second-lowest number since the pandemic began in earnest and below analysts' forecasts for 240,000. The previous week's initial claims were also revised down by another 5,000. There was more supportive news at the margins from the political sphere, where Republican and Democratic lawmakers reached a tentative deal to fund the U.S. government through mid-February, averting the (largely phantom) threat of a government shutdown this weekend.
Consumer-focused stocks in particular were helped by news out of the monthly meeting of OPEC and partners led by Russia, which defied many expectations by sticking to their plan of raising oil output by another 400,000 barrels a day in January. The actual increase is likely to be less, given that OPEC has missed its target for raising output for the last few months due to various above-ground problems, many of them related to past under-investment. 
In a departure from recent practice, however, OPEC said that its meeting would remain in session, giving it the freedom to revise its decision at any time over the next month. The decisions represent a balancing act between those who are concerned about the risk of new Omicron-driven mobility restrictions to global oil demand and those more concerned by prices overheating as the world emerges - however irregularly - from the pandemic.
Elsewhere, business software providers had another solid start, with Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock rising 11.4% after an earnings report bolstered by an international expansion drive. Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock rose 2.3% after the cybersecurity company attracted more customers than expected in the last three months, while Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) stock, which had cratered by more than one-third in the last three weeks, steadied after its quarterly update, rising 3.4%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock rose 3.6% after national aviation regulators cleared its 737 MAX aircraft to fly in China after a hiatus of over two years."

(Reuters) -Dollar General Corp on Thursday forecast annual sales and profit largely below expectations as the discount retailer battles higher costs triggered by the pandemic.
Spiraling freight costs, shipping delays and other supply-chain snarls at a time when labor and raw materials are getting costlier have pinched profit outlooks at dollar stores that already operate on razor-thin margins.
Rival  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) also forecast holiday-quarter profit below expectations last week and raised its pricing point to $1.25 for most items at its namesake stores to boost margins.
Dollar General (NYSE:DG), which typically sells products for $10 or less, announced a target of about 1,000 new pOpshelf stores, aimed at wealthier customers who enjoy a treasure-hunting experience, by the end of fiscal 2025.
The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based company also announced plans for an international expansion for the first time, saying it expects to open up to 10 stores in Mexico by the end of fiscal 2022.
Dollar General narrowed its fiscal 2021 sales growth forecast to between 1% and 1.5%, the midpoint of which was below expectations.
Its full-year earnings forecast of $9.90 to $10.20 per share was also largely below analysts' average estimate of $10.20, according to Refintiv IBES data.
Evercore ISI analyst Micheal Montani said while Dollar General was doing what is right for its lower income consumer by investing in wages and maintaining pricing, the higher costs would squeeze already low margins and these costs would be ""tangible"" for investors in the near term.

Shares of Dollar General were down about 1.3% in morning trading.
Net sales rose to $8.52 billion in the third quarter ended Oct. 29, marginally above analysts' expectations, from $8.20 billion a year earlier.

""If you're a small and unknown brand, marketplaces offer a great opportunity, because they provide you with an audience. I already have an audience,"" CEO Alexander Lacik said during an interview at the Reuters Next conference on Wednesday.
Pandora, the world's largest jewellery maker by production capacity, has found a niche between cheaper accessories sold by the likes of H&M and more expensive jewellery like that of  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF).
""Eight out of ten women globally are aware of our brand, so I don't need to make you aware of me. What I need to do is to show you what I've got, and I can to this much better if I have a direct relationship with my customer,"" he said.
The $12.3 billion company, headquartered in Copenhagen, has increased investment in e-commerce during the pandemic. It is present on China's T-mall platform but not on large global platforms like Amazon or Farfetch. 
""Marketplaces always have to make a compromise for all the clients they are serving. I don't have to compromise,"" he said.
Pandora's more than 2,600 physical stores remain the core of its business and accounted for 62% of global sales between July and September. 
""Nearly two-thirds of my customers are men buying jewellery for their girlfriends, wifes, grandmothers or children. And we know that men buying jewellery need help,"" he said.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the industry is now rebounding from pandemic lows driven by solid demand for substances like plastics and methanol.
The United States chemical industry is expected to experience a comeback in 2022, driven by the strong economic recovery and the easing of the pandemic restrictions.

Read on.One of the world’s premier entertainment companies, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), in Burbank, Calif., has completed several developments over the past few months, especially with the help of its streaming service Disney +.

Also, on November 16, Louis Alfieri, the chief creative officer of Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) Sun Creative, said that he’s seeking unspecified damages from Walt Disney Parks and Resorts for allegedly infringing on his patent for a “tower ride.” DIS stock has lost 16.5% in price over the past month to close the last trading session at $142.15.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU antitrust regulators on Thursday fined  Barclays  (LON:BARC) ,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), HSBC and NatWest 344 million euros ($390 million) for foreign exchange market rigging, closing a key chapter in a high-profile investigation.
UBS avoided a 94 million euro fine by alerting the European Commission to the cartel, which was set up via a chatroom known as ""Sterling Lads"". 
HSBC received the largest fine at 174.3 million euros, followed by Credit Suisse at 83.3 million euros, Barclays at 54.3 million and RBS (LON:NWG) at 32.5 million. 
Barclays, HSBC and RBS - known as NatWest since a rebranding - admitted wrongdoing in return for a reduced penalty. 
NatWest said the misconduct took place about a decade ago in a single chatroom, involved a former employee and that its culture and controls had since fundamentally changed.
UBS said it had been the first bank to disclose potential misconduct and was pleased the matter was resolved.
Barclays, Credit Suisse and HSBC declined to comment.
Some of the world's biggest banks have been fined more than $11 billion collectively by U.S. and European regulators since allegations first surfaced around 2013 that dealers were rigging the world's largest financial market. Dozens of traders were suspended or fired.
The latest investigation focused on foreign exchange (forex) spot trading of G10 currencies, the most liquid and traded currencies in the world, which include the U.S. dollar, pound and euro. 
Traders exchanged sensitive information and trading plans and sometimes coordinated strategies through the online chatroom, the Commission said. 
The EU has already sanctioned some of the same banks over similar conduct in 2019 in a settlement featuring chatrooms called ""Three Way Banana Split"", ""Only Marge"",""Essex Express"" and ""Semi Grumpy Old Men"".
""Today we complete our sixth cartel investigation in the financial sector since 2013 and conclude the third leg of our investigation into the foreign exchange spot trading market,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
She said the collusive behaviour of the five banks undermined the integrity of the financial sector at the expense of the European economy and consumers.

Barclays,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JP Morgan, MUFG and RBS were fined a combined 1.07 billion euros in May 2019 by the EU antitrust authorities for manipulating the foreign exchange market via two cartels, between 2007 to 2013 for one group and between 2009 to 2012 for the other.

(Reuters) - Factories in Vietnam are struggling for staff after many migrant workers returned home when a coronavirus lockdown that had kept them in Ho Chi Minh City for months last year was eased, a partner at venture capital firm Cento Ventures told Reuters.
A mass exodus from the city and its nearby industrial provinces has raised fears labour shortages will hamper the recovery from a record GDP slump in the third quarter. 
""When the heavy hand of the government ... causes hundreds of thousands of workers to stay in factories to keep the exports churning, eventually when this heavy hand is withdrawn, workers go back to the villages and they do not return,"" Cento's Dmitry Levit said at the Reuters Next conference on Thursday. 
Vietnam is one of the world's largest garment manufacturers, with more than 6,000 clothing and textile factories employing about three million people. They supply brands like Zara, Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), North Face, Lacoste and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).
Tens of thousands of people left Ho Chi Minh City after restrictions were eased in early October, ignoring requests from authorities that they stay to work. 
Vietnam said last month that it was aiming to fix the labour problem by end of this year or early in 2022. 
Tough and prolonged lockdowns in Asian countries after the Delta variant swept through gutted economies and consumption and have made life especially difficult for companies whose businesses depend on putting feet on the ground.
""The pandemic has hit a hard reset on supply chains. Any businesses that were not viable have ... been destroyed,"" said Nipun Mehra, co-founder and CEO of Ula, an Indonesian startup that provides inventory and delivery services to the country's mom-and-pop kiosks.
Ula, valued at some $500 million, recently attracted funding from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Jeff Bezos.
Southeast Asian countries are the lifeblood of supply chains feeding large companies in the West, and lockdowns and port jams have snarled supplies in the weeks leading up to Christmas.
Malaysian chip suppliers, important players in the global semiconductor production line, have predicted it will take two or three years for the market to normalise, although the crisis is easing.
""Malaysia seems to be recalibrating itself quite nicely,"" Levit said.

Justin Hall, a partner at Golden Gate Ventures, said governments in the region were not stepping up as they should to ease the supply crunch, and that the private sector was not capable of sorting out such problems by itself.
There may be some improvements over the next 12-18 months, he said, but added: ""It is an unhappy status quo for the time being.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG)'s radical restructuring involving a string of disposals and cost cuts is about halfway complete, with the group on track for higher sales and margins in coming years, its leadership team said on Thursday on its Capital Markets Day.
The sprawling conglomerate began stripping off division after division in 2020, including a sale of its profitable elevator business for 17.2 billion euros ($19.50 billion), in an attempt to bring down roughly the same sum's worth of debt and crippling pension liabilities.
The German steel-to-submarines conglomerate expects mid-term adjusted margins of 4-6% and aims to restore its ability to consistently pay a dividend, it said in a statement ahead of presentations. The group had reported an adjusted margin of 2.3% in the full year 2020/21.
""We are relentlessly pushing forward the full transformation to the group,"" CEO Martina Merz said on Thursday, adding the sale of the elevator division was a difficult but necessary step. ""The focus now is preparing the next package of divestments.""
Thyssenkrupp's two-year overhaul has so far included the sale of its mining technology business to Denmark's FLSmidth in July and the disposal of its infrastructure and carbon components operation. 
These transactions should bring in a high-triple-digit-million euro figure to bolster the company's net financial position and pension liabilities, Thyssenkrupp said.
Next in line are the marine systems division, which could see partnerships, consolidation or a standalone scenario, and the cement plant construction and chemicals divisions, whose future the company will be deciding on soon.
More details about the initial public offering of its hydrogen division Uhde Chlorine Engineers planned early next year will be announced at a capital markets day on Jan. 13.
Higher material prices and expanding margins in both materials and steel should fuel higher sales and earnings in the first quarter of next year, Chief Financial Officer Klaus Keysberg said. 
The group reported sales of 7.3 billion euros and EBIT of 78 million euros in the first quarter of 2020/21.

Adjusted medium-term EBIT margin targets by division included at least 10% for industrial components and 7-8% for automotive, where 80% of sales were being generated from components not used in combustion engines.

(Reuters) -Indian ride-hailing company Ola plans to go public in the first half of 2022, Chief Executive Officer Bhavish Aggarwal said on Thursday, undeterred by the recent volatility and lackluster listing of some start-ups in the country. 
Ola, backed by Japan's SoftBank Group, is also gearing up to create something of a ""super app"" with plans to broaden its services beyond mobility to include personal finance and micro insurance, Aggarwal told the Reuters Next conference.
""We are not a company that takes a short-term view on anything. Short-term, there might be volatilities in the market but that has never informed our decisions,"" said Aggarwal, who founded the company in 2010.
Indian companies have raised a staggering $9.7 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs) in the first nine months of 2021, according to accountants EY, but the dismal stock market debut of Indian digital payments firm Paytm last month has caused worries among some bankers. 
Ola, which has a majority share of India's ride-hailing market, where it competes with Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), has plans to raise up to $1 billion through an IPO.
While Ola's finances have bounced back in recent months, Aggarwal said the company was working to improve them further after they were hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""Our vision for the Ola business is to be a large, broad-based mobility platform,"" Aggarwal said, adding that the Ola app already allows its 150 million customers to buy and sell new and used cars, and avail vehicle finance and insurance.
He said he wanted to expand the offering and plans to leverage the customer base to offer personal finance services and micro insurance, moving towards a super app. 
EV AMBITIONS
Aggarwal also plans to list Ola's separate electric vehicle business in the future, and is currently building it out starting with its electric scooters, for which it has received 1 million reservations, he said. 
It plans to launch an electric car in 2023 and is looking at setting up local battery cell manufacturing.
The company has come under criticism for delays in its scooter deliveries, but Aggarwal said those were caused by the global semiconductor shortage and first deliveries were on track for Dec. 15.
""Our ambitions in electrification are to make India the global electric vehicle hub,"" he said. 

Aggarwal said that while companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are leading the way in building vehicles more suited for Western markets, India can lead in the area of small cars, scooters and motorbikes for which global demand is higher.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, rebounding after the previous session’s selloff in the wake of the confirmation of the country’s first case of the omicron variant. 
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 262 points, or 0.8%, S&P 500 Futures traded 17 points, or 0.4%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures were flat.
The major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first case of the Covid-19 Omicron variant. The individual, from California but who had recently been in South Africa, is fully vaccinated and said to be isolating and improving. 
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 460 points, or 1.3%, the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.2% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.8%. After Tuesday’s slump, this represented the worst two-day loss in 14 months.
Wednesday’s selloff, and the expected bounce later Thursday, continue a highly volatile streak for the Wall Street indices as the market tries to digest the potential repercussions from the new variant.
Earlier Thursday, the Biden administration announced the tightening of  travel rules, requiring all in-bound international passengers to test for Covid within 24 hours of departure and extending its mask requirement on all domestic flights and public transportation through March 18.
The other focus of investors’ attention is the speed at which the Federal Reserve seeks to normalise monetary policy. In his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Chairman Jerome Powell repeated that speeding up the taper of bond purchases would be on the central bank’s agenda at the December meeting.
This means Friday’s official jobs report will be carefully studied, and ahead of that the weekly initial jobless claims are due at 8:30 AM ET.
Turning to the corporate sector, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be in focus following a Bloomberg report indicating that demand for its latest batch of iPhones is weakening due to price and availability issues.
Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) all impressed with their earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, while the likes of Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) report earnings before the bell.
Crude prices traded higher Thursday, recovering from the three-months lows hit during the previous session, as traders adjusted their positions ahead of the OPEC+ meeting to decide future output levels. 
Expectations are growing that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, will pause plans later Thursday to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in January.
Capping the gains was news from the Energy Information Administration of a smaller than expected draw from U.S. crude inventories of 910,000 barrels last week.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% higher at $66.39 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $69.63.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,778.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1342.

675,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 06:37AM ET</span>","Global stocks rally set to moderate next year, correction likely - Reuters poll","By Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global stocks will shake off recent weakness and rise over the next 12 months but at a more tempered pace than this year's rally, found a Reuters poll of equity analysts who also said a correction was likely in the next six months.
Uncertainty around the virulence of the Omicron coronavirus variant and its ability to evade vaccine protection led to a rare sell-off in financial markets last Friday.
But some analysts reckon that flight to safe assets and heightened volatility suggests markets may be in for a bumpier ride in the short run.
Indeed, when asked if a correction in their local equity market was likely, about three-quarters of respondents - 79 of 106 - in a global poll covering major indexes from over a dozen countries said Yes.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank would discuss whether to accelerate the unwinding of its asset purchases programme didn't help risk assets.
""Looking ahead, we continue to see market upside, though more moderate, on better-than-expected earnings growth with supply shocks easing,"" said Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief U.S. equity strategist and global head of quantitative research at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities.
""The key risk to our outlook is a hawkish shift in central bank policy, especially if post-pandemic dislocations persist.""
The broader poll of over 150 equity analysts around the world taken Nov. 15 to Dec. 1 showed most indexes bouncing back from the current downtrend and touching new highs by end-2022.
Of the 17 major indexes polled on, 10 were expected to surpass their lifetime highs over the next 12 months, with five reaching that milestone as early as mid-2022.
Driven by earnings and economic growth, the benchmark S&P 500 index will extend this year's rally and gain 7.5% between now and end-2022 to finish at 4,910.
The pan-European STOXX 600 is forecast to rise 7% and reach 500 points by July, 10 points above its lifetime peak hit on Nov. 17.
India's BSE Sensex was expected to falter in the near-term but recoup its current loses and hit a high of 63,000 by the end of next year.
Despite scaling new peaks, the majority of the 17 global indices polled on were forecast to neither repeat nor surpass this year's strong performance next year.
Underpinned by a solid corporate outlook, Japan's Nikkei share average index was expected to reach 31,000 by June 2022, around an 11% gain from Tuesday's close.
When asked to give their outlook on corporate earnings in their local markets over the coming six months, over 85% of strategists polled, 79 of 91, said they expected earnings to improve.
""We expect earnings to be the key driver of global equity returns in 2022. In line with our earnings expectations, we expect high single-​digit equity returns in 2022 compared to double-​digit returns in 2021,"" said Philipp Lisibach, chief global strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).

""Other tailwinds for this asset class going forward include the ongoing economic recovery, and the 'there is no alternative' (TINA) argument for equities.""

676,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>","Safran stands firm on jet output, reviews part of Zodiac","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -Jet engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) said the worst of the coronavirus crisis was over but took a cautious view on long-term airline traffic in a continuing stand-off with Airbus over proposed increases in jetliner production.
The French aeronautics supplier also placed almost a third of its recently acquired Zodiac Aerospace business under review, while targeting higher revenues and margins over five years.
CEO Olivier Andries said Safran remained committed to building enough engines to allow Airbus to meet a firm output target of 65 A320s a month in 2023, up some 50% from crisis-hit levels, but that it was too early to commit to more.
Airbus has asked suppliers to explore rates as high as 75 a month by 2025 based on its forecasts of strong demand for the sought-after medium-haul category as the pandemic eases.
A decision on this would need to be made by mid-2022.
Engine makers are cautious about joining planemakers, notably the current volume leader Airbus, in raising new output because they fear it will accelerate aircraft retirements and dampen lucrative repairs demand demand, or else be short-lived.
Safran co-produces engines for the single-aisle category with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) through their joint venture CFM, which according to Safran has 72% of the market against rival Pratt & Whitney, owned by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX).
Andries said Safran sees air traffic demand growth in the medium-haul sector for A320s and Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737s rebounding to 4.9% a year on average between 2023 and 2025.
But 20-year annual growth for all traffic combined, of which medium-haul has the biggest chunk, would average 2.9% compared with forecasts from Airbus and Boeing at or close to 4%.
""We have a (demand) vision which is more prudent than the planemakers,"" Andries said, adding ""3% is not nothing, it is very significant and will stay above world GDP.""
Safran did not rule out targeted acquisitions where they make sense while considering shedding some ex-Zodiac activities.
Safran agreed to buy Zodiac in 2017 to create the world's third largest aerospace supplier after cutting its offer following a string of profit warnings from the aircraft seat maker, and completed the deal the following year.
Safran said ahead of an investor presentation on Thursday that a re-assessment of the legacy Zodiac business had led to 70% of the business ""confirmed as core and 30% under review.""
Safran declined to identify the activities under review, but recently-appointed CFO Pascal Bantegnie said weakly defended or least profitable activities might be sold.
The renamed Safran Seats and Safran Cabin businesses, part of the company's Aircraft Interiors division, are both set to reach breakeven in 2022 and double-digit profitability by 2025 and ""take advantage of the recovery of a severely hit market"". 

Safran also outlined group targets for 2021-2025 including compound average growth of 10% or more in revenues and around 15% in the widely watched aftermarket for civil jet engines.
It forecast an operating margin of 16-18% by 2025 and said it would return to a 40% dividend payout for its 2022 finances.

679,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",Analysis-White House delay on Fed regulation chief bodes badly for bank M&A,"By David French
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The White House's delay in nominating the Federal Reserve's new regulatory chief is likely to compound a logjam in approving bank tie-ups that have been on ice since September due to uncertainty over personnel changes at the U.S. central bank. 
While Democratic President Joe Biden said https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/biden-renominates-powell-fed-chairman-brainard-vice-chair-2021-11-22 last week he would re-nominate Jerome Powell as Fed chair, he left the industry guessing as to who would take on the powerful vice chair for supervision role overseeing Wall Street's biggest lenders.
Randal Quarles stepped https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fed-announces-quarles-step-away-internal-regulatory-lead-role-vice-chair-term-2021-10-12 down from that role in October. The White House has said it would announce his replacement this month. With vetting, followed by a lengthy nomination process, it could be ""some time"" before that person takes up the role, said Keith Noreika, a partner at law firm Simpson Thacher. 
As the head of supervision typically oversees big bank deals, a lag is likely to lengthen approval times for announced tie-ups and is making bank boards nervous about exploring new ones, said regulatory lawyers and deal advisers. 
""No one has line-of-sight on deal approvals, so it is hard to get a board to sign off on a deal when there is no clue on the time frame for it to happen,"" said a senior investment banker who works on mergers of financial institutions.
A spokesperson for the Fed declined to comment.
The Fed rules on transactions involving bank holding companies, a structure which most of America's biggest banks use because they have services beyond traditional deposit-taking and lending, such as wealth management and insurance broking.
While the Fed has not adopted a formal policy change, its approval process ground to a halt in early September, said the sources, who declined to be named discussing client matters. 
Currently, seven big deals have been awaiting assent for longer than the median close time of 142 days from Jan. 1 to Nov. 15 this year, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence. 
Among them are First Citizen Bancshares's purchase of CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) and  New York Community Bancorp  (NYSE:NYCB)'s acquisition of Flagstar Bancorp (NYSE:FBC). Both said in October that their expected completion dates had moved into 2022 due to delays in regulatory approvals. 
""Effectively, they are on hold,"" one lawyer said of reviews. 
The sources attributed the freeze to impending personnel changes that could affect Fed policy, including the chair role. 
Powell's re-nomination eliminated some of that concern, but the supervision head is seen as the gatekeeper. That person leads the committee that scrutinizes potential tie-ups before kicking them to the central bank's board of governors for a formal vote. 
Progressives say Powell is too industry friendly. They are pushing https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/progressives-frustrated-white-house-punts-regulation-chief-2021-11-22 for the White House to appoint a supervision chief who will be tough on the industry and curb tie-ups, which they say harm consumers by creating bank deserts and pushing up fees. 
""They have been too lenient with mergers,"" said Todd Phillips, a director at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. ""We...really want small banks, small banks are more likely to lend in the communities in which they're situated.""
Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, who has a big say over the pick, told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that he was discussing a number of candidates with the White House. 
""Whoever is nominated...will be more aggressive on banking regulation,"" Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at investment bank Stifel, wrote last week. ""How much more aggressive and how much higher the hurdle will be for banks to have merger applications approved is unknown."" 
The White House's decision to elevate Fed Governor Lael Brainard to vice chair may also bode badly for multi-billion-dollar deals given that she voted against https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardvotes2020.htm  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s purchase of E*Trade and TD Ameritrade's acquisition by  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. 
COMPETITION SCRUTINY
Mergers allow banks to build scale and reduce costs as they contend with historically low interest rates, which have dented net interest income, and increasing competition from fintechs.
Mergers across the board, however, are confronting heightened skepticism from the Biden administration. 
In July, the president issued an executive order to study potential competition law reforms, citing concerns that unchecked mergers had contributed to a lack of vigor in key economic sectors and hurt consumer choice. 
The Federal Trade Commission has also been placing heavier scrutiny on deals across the economy.

Biden's executive order directed https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy the Justice Department, along with the bank regulators, to review bank merger policies, with the results due next year.
""The issues are how do we balance size, like is a bank too big to fail, versus how do we value competition, (and) how do we balance financial stability,"" said Phillips of the Center for American Progress.

682,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 05:28AM ET</span>",China's Kaisa struggles for relief from bondholders as default risk looms,"By Scott Murdoch and Samuel Shen
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd is unlikely to win bondholders' approval to extend the maturity of a $400 million bond due next week, analysts say, heaping more pressure on other indebted peers.
Kaisa's proposal to delay the maturity of the bond by 18 months comes against the backdrop of growing creditor concerns about Chinese property developers' ability to meet their near-term offshore repayment obligations.
Some developers in late October called on regulators to extend their offshore bond maturities https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-china-developers-propose-offshore-debt-maturity-extension-2021-10-27 or undertake a debt restructuring, as a growing number of defaults hit the sector in a fallout from embattled China Evergrande Group.
Kaisa needs at least 95% of its bondholders to approve a proposal to exchange $400 million, 6.5% offshore bonds due Dec. 7 for new notes due June 6, 2023 at the same interest rate.
At least one group of Kaisa bondholders had rejected the offer, according to a letter sent this week by their financial advisor to the Kaisa board and a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
""The group believes that the terms of the exchange offer are unacceptable and illustrate an unwillingness on the part of the company to consider more appropriate and holistic ways to address Kaisa's current short term liquidity challenges,"" the letter said.
Kaisa, which has been trying to accelerate the disposal of real estate projects and other assets including its Hong Kong-listed property management unit to improve liquidity, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The group of bondholders mentioned in the letter sent to Kaisa offered a 'forbearance period' to the company to delay the repayment to continue negotiations.
The bondholders, who say they own 50% of the debt Kaisa is trying to exchange, have offered $2 billion in fresh debt funding to the Chinese company to help it avert a default, two sources with knowledge of the offer told Reuters.
The exact details of the funding size or terms for the offer were not disclosed. The sources could not be named due to confidentiality constraints.
There had been little interaction between Kaisa and the group since the offer was presented to the Chinese developer, said the sources.
Hong Kong-listed shares of Kaisa ended nearly 1% higher on Thursday, while Evergrande rose more than 3%.
REFINANCING RISKS 
Kaisa's struggle in getting a much-needed lifeline from its creditors will also weigh on other smaller developers that are looking to avoid long and messy litigation and restructuring processes, analysts said. 
Developers' refinancing risks will increase if bond markets stay weak, although financially robust companies will have stronger buffers than their weaker peers, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service said in a report on Thursday. 
James Wong, portfolio manager of GaoTeng Global Asset Management Ltd, said that for Kaisa, a debt restructuring is ""quite certain"", as the threshold of securing approval for the bond maturity extension proposal was too high.
""Investors are waiting for that day (of restructuring) to come"" he said, adding smaller Chinese developers will continue to struggle. 
Kaisa, which became the first Chinese property developer to default on its dollar bonds in 2015, has said its notes exchange offer will expire at 1600 GMT on Thursday unless it extends or terminates the proposal.
Kaisa is the second largest U.S.-dollar bond issuer among China's property developers after China Evergrande Group, once China's top-selling developer and now at the centre of the country's property sector liquidity crisis.
A string of other Chinese developers are also staring at a wall of offshore debt maturing over the next few months, and some of them are scrambling to sell part of their assets to raise cash to avoid defaults.
Evergrande, which has more than $300 billion in liabilities, failed to pay coupons totalling $82.5 million due on Nov. 6 and investors are on tenterhooks to see if the developer can meet its obligations before a 30-day grace period ends on Dec 6.

Despite the unprecedented funding squeeze caused by the regulatory crackdown on debt accumulation in the sector, some developers are now able to raise fresh credit in the home market.
Three developers plan to sell bonds in China to raise a combined $2.8 billion, signalling Beijing is marginally easing liquidity strains for the sector.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could be sued by consumer groups for privacy violations, an adviser to Europe's top court said on Thursday, in a German online gaming case that could pave the way for similar action across the EU.
The case started in 2012 and is one of several privacy and antitrust headaches facing Facebook in Europe, where regulators have introduced legislation to curb the power of so-called tech giants and ensure more transparency.
""Member states may allow consumer protection associations to bring representative actions against infringements of the protection of personal data,"" Richard de la Tour, advocate general at the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), said in an opinion.
Such actions must be based on infringements of rights derived directly from GDPR, he added, referring to the landmark EU privacy rules adopted three years ago. 
""We'll analyse the Advocate General's opinion. Legal clarity on scope and process of GDPR is important and we’re glad the Court of Justice of the European Union is considering the questions raised in this case.” said a spokesperson Meta Platforms Inc.
GDPR stipulates that any requests to collect personal data should be subject to clear and informed consent.
De la Tour said consumer bodies that defend the collective interests of consumers are particularly suited to GDPR's objective of establishing a high level of personal data protection.
Facebook found itself in the dock after the Federation of German Consumer Organisations filed a lawsuit alleging that the social network had allowed operators of online games to improperly collect the personal data of gamers.
The games were offered on Facebook's App Center in 2012. By playing the games, users automatically agreed to share personal data including email addresses. At the end of the game, they would receive a message saying that the app could post their status, photos and other information.

A German lower court had ruled in favour of the German federation, leading Facebook to appeal to a higher court, which subsequently sought advice from the CJEU. 
Facebook has since revamped its privacy settings.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Thursday as investors fretted about the spread of the omicron Covid variant and the associated economic damage.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.9% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.7%. 
European indices followed their U.S. counterparts lower following the news that the United States became on Wednesday the latest country to identify a case of the omicron Covid-19 variant within its borders. 
The World Health Organisation stated that at least 23 countries from five of six regions have reported cases of omicron, “and we expect that number to grow.” 
The UN agency expects to have more information on the transmissibility of the new variant of the coronavirus within days, but noted that hospitalizations were rising across South Africa, where the new variant was first discovered, and omicron is rapidly becoming the dominant variant there.
“Frankly, omicron will dominate and overwhelm the whole world in three to six months,” said Singapore doctor Leong Hoe Nam on CNBC.
There was some good news from GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Thursday, with the drugmaker’s antiviral Covid treatment approved for use by the U.K. regulatory agency while analysis showed it was effective against omicron. Its stock rose 0.2%, outperforming the negative overall market.
 Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) stock also climbed 0.2% after the Swiss drugmaker expressed confidence in its ability to grow sales by 4% each year until 2026, while Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) stock rose 0.3% after the German conglomerate said it was on track with its restructuring plans and it expects its margins to increase.
Elsewhere,  Daily Mail  and General Trust (LON:DMGOa) stock rose 1.9% after the controlling shareholders of the Daily Mail publisher, the Rothermere family, increased the cash component of its offer to buy out other shareholders.
Economic data releases later Thursday include the Eurozone unemployment rate and producer prices for October.
Crude prices traded higher Thursday, recovering from the three-months lows hit during the previous session, as traders adjusted their positions ahead of the OPEC+ meeting to decide future output levels. 
Expectations are growing that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, will pause plans to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in January.
Capping the gains was news from the Energy Information Administration of a smaller than expected draw from U.S. crude inventories of 910,000 barrels last week.

COVID fears, the approach of year-end and the Fed signalling policy tightening -- it's a recipe for turbulence and that's what we are seeing. The VIX, an equity volatility index dubbed Wall Street's fear gauge, has soared above 30%, double the placid levels of mid-November. 
The discovery of a single U.S. Omicron case turned Wall Street traders' screens red, quickly reversing what had been a buoyant session following a record stock market close in Europe.
Sentiment in the investor community, keen protect any year-to-date portfolio gains, is clearly turning on a dime. 
Bond and currency volatility too have spiralled to the highest since last March and December respectively,.
On Thursday, Asia picked up the selloff baton from New York and the downtrend continues into Europe. U.S. futures though signal a higher open, at least for now. 
Listen out for a raft of Fed speakers -- their last airing before the pre-meeting quiet period. The hawkish messages are loud and clear; Cleveland Fed boss Loretta Mester -- a voting Fed member next year -- reckons the bank should be able to squeeze in a couple of rate hikes next year.
More money poured into Treasuries, with 10-year yields now down more than 20 basis points from a week ago.
Over in Europe, German 10-year yields are close to 2-1/2 month lows touched recently. For signs of stress, also watch Italy, whose bond yield premium over Germany this week has gaped wider and is at the highest since last October. 
Finally, oil remains on shaky ground amid the Omicron worries and travel curbs. An OPEC+ meeting later in the day will decide whether to proceed with the monthly output increase or to curb supply.
Vol hasn't bypassed oil markets either -- Brent futures jumped $20 from August though October, fell almost $10 by mid-November and are down a further $10 since then

The airline's new owners, UAE-based businessman Murari Lal Jalan and UK investment firm Kalrock Capital, told Bloomberg News that Jet could buy at least 100 narrowbody aircraft, BloombergQuint said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The group is set to invest about $200 million through equity and debt in Jet over the next six months, BloombergQuint said.
Jet, Boeing and Airbus did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. 
The Jalan-Kalrock consortium's resolution plan for Jet was approved by India's bankruptcy court in June, with the airline poised for takeoff by the first quarter of 2022 as it gears up to resume domestic operations.
The debt-laden airline, once India's biggest private carrier, stopped flying in April 2019 after running out of cash, leaving thousands without jobs. 

Shares of the airline jumped as much as 3.7% to 85 rupees on Thursday and were trading 2.4% higher at 0740 GMT.
The news on Jet comes a month after billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala-backed low cost Indian carrier Akasa Air placed a $9 billion order for 72 Boeing 737 MAX jets.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Canadian winterwear producer Canada Goose Holdings (NYSE:GOOS) Inc has run into controversy in China due to a dispute over its return policies, with a city consumer watchdog calling it into meetings and other groups accusing it of ""bullying"" customers.
The latest furore against the premium down jacket maker comes just three months after the winterwear brand was fined for false advertising and as Chinese regulators have become more active protecting consumer rights.
Canada Goose became a hot topic on Chinese social media in recent days over its handling of a case involving a customer who wanted a refund of her purchases amounting to 11,400 yuan ($1,790.17) after finding quality issues. 
She said she was told by Canada Goose that all products sold at its retail stores in mainland China were strictly non-refundable, according to her account which went viral online. 
Canada Goose declined to comment on the specific case to Reuters but said that customers were eligible to receive a refund within 14 days, based on Chinese law, if their purchase had issues with materials or craftsmanship，a stance that was also reported by Chinese media. 
That, however, has failed to quell criticism of the brand.
""No brand has any privileges in front of consumers,"" the government-backed China Consumer Association (CCA) said in an opinion piece posted on its website on Thursday morning. 
""If you don't do what you say, regard yourself as a big brand, behave arrogantly and in a superior way, adopt discriminatory policies, be condescending and bully customers, you will for sure lose the trust of consumers and be abandoned by the market,"" the CCA said.
The Shanghai Consumer Council said it had summoned brand representatives on Wednesday for talks to explain its refund policy in China. However it said it was not satisfied by Canada Goose's response and would meet firm officials again next week. 

Chinese state-owned broadcaster CCTV called Canada Goose ""arrogant"" on its WeChat account on Wednesday.

Gregor will depart as finance chief and executive director no later than June 30, 2022, and the board has initiated a process to appoint a replacement, the British company said.
After a more than two-decade stint at Jaguar Land Rover, Gregor was recruited in mid-2020 soon after Mercedes' Tobias Moers was appointed as chief executive to help the more than century-old Aston Martin navigate a slump in sales due the coronavirus outbreak.
""Over the last 18 months, Ken has played a significant role in rebuilding Aston Martin Lagonda's financial position and setting the business on a strong pathway for the future,"" Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll said.

In November, Aston Martin, whose shares have tumbled since its 2018 market debut, posted a third-quarter pre-tax loss of 97.9 million pounds ($130.01 million), even as sales doubled to 1,349 cars — driven by demand for its first sport utility vehicle, the DBX.

Dolat Capital Market Pvt, the third brokerage to initiate coverage on the digital payments giant after Macquarie Capital Securities and JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd., said its transition to a “manufacturer” of financial services from an agent, cross-selling of services, and strong growth in the number of users will help the company.
Paytm’s “super app” has emerged from a pure “want” category to reach to the “need” status, Dolat analysts, led by Rahul Jain, said. It positions the company as “one of the strongest digital brands to garner significant share of opportunities that will evolve in the Indian internet ecosystem,” they said.
The brokerage has set a target price of 2,500 rupees ($33.4), which is 16% higher than the company’s issue price. Paytm (BO:PAYT) dropped as much as 2.7% to 1,592 rupees on Thursday, a fifth day of declines, after plummeting 37% in the first two sessions of trading. JM Financial has a sell rating on the stock, while Macquarie has rated it as underperform. 
 One 97 Communications Ltd ., Paytm’s parent company, raised $2.5 billion in its IPO but its debacle of a debut made it one of the worst initial showings by a major technology firm since the dot-com bubble era of the late 1990s. Paytm has the backing of top global investors, including Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group Corp., Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. 
Paytm reported its first financial results as a public company over the weekend, with losses widening to 4.74 billion rupees in the July-September quarter from a year earlier amid rising expenses. Its revenue rose more than 60%, boosted by strong growth in its financial, commerce and cloud services. 
The entry multiple for Paytm might appear steep, “however we see it as sustainable since it is the most impactful and real-economy internet business,” the note said.

692,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 02:06AM ET</span>",A trillion-dollar wager that interest rates won't rise far,"By Yoruk Bahceli
(Reuters) -A build up of bets on rising interest rates has done nothing to derail a stock market rally based on conviction that policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks will go nowhere near as far as it did in the past.
A fresh bout of COVID-linked uncertainty has seen markets backtrack slightly on the hefty rate hikes priced in next year from the Fed, Bank of England and others. But Fed boss Jerome Powell's most recent comments indicate he is on track to raise rates several times in the next two years. 
Stock markets have been mostly unfazed by rate rise talk - equity funds have seen inflows every week this year, save two. In a world where bonds, on an inflation-adjusted basis, yield far below 0%, there is simply no alternative, investors say.
And those negative ""real"" yields, alongside stubbornly low longer-dated government borrowing costs, flattening yield curves and soaring equities, all rely on the view that terminal rates - or where central bank policy rates will peak - will be lower than in previous cycles.
The previous Fed rate hike cycle peaked at 2.25%-2.5% in 2018. But the upcoming cycle will end below 2%, according to euro-dollar futures' view of U.S. rates in five years, a proxy for the terminal rate. 
That bet, which is lower than the 2.5% the Fed itself projects, reflects the belief that policy tightening may end before interest rates hit the Fed's 2% inflation target. It implies ""real"" U.S. interest rates will remain negative.
It's a similar picture in the euro zone and Britain, where terminal rates are seen just above 0% and just below 1% respectively.
""What equity markets are saying (is) ... interest rates won't get very high and real yields will stay low,"" said Craig Inches, head of rates and cash at Royal London Asset Management. 
""Bond markets are saying ... we will hold long-end yields low because we think (rates) will rise, then come straight back down again.""
But there is no margin for error. 
A trillion dollars have poured into global stocks this year - more than the prior 19 years combined - taking share price valuations to ever new highs. Corporate bond risk premia are historically low, while cumulative household, corporate and sovereign debt rocketed $36 trillion during the pandemic.
For this reason, many reckon real U.S. yields - currently at minus 1% on the 10-year benchmark - will need to stay sub-zero for years, if not decades. And yields remain stubbornly low on long-dated bonds - 10-year Treasuries peaked just below 1.8% this year.
""What's been driving the longer part of the curve is an expectation that once central banks start raising rates they won't be able to get anywhere near levels they got to in prior hiking cycles,"" said Barnaby Martin, head of credit strategy at BofA.
TIGHTROPE
Crucial to estimating the terminal rate is the natural or neutral rate, sometimes called r-star - the equilibrium level of rates where full employment co-exists with stable inflation. 
This rate has been in steady decline across the developed world. Reasons range from ageing populations to high savings rates and the United States is no exception, with the inflation-adjusted r* falling to around 0.4% last year, from 2.5% in 2007. 
The risk is neutral rates turn out higher than markets project.
Long bond yields, suppressed by huge demand for safe securities, are a misleading indicator, some argue. 
Second, early and aggressive rate hikes priced in relative to the Fed's own projections suggest investors are not buying the Fed's shift to flexible average inflation targeting (FAIT). With FAIT, the Fed aims for inflation to average 2% over time and will tolerate temporary overshoots. 
Guneet Dhingra,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s head of U.S. rates strategy, noted the Fed aimed to raise the neutral rate when it launched its new inflation strategy. 
""To the extent you can call the FAIT framework successful, you can also say the Fed has been successful in lifting the neutral rate higher than the last cycle,"" Dhingra said, predicting the terminal rate may end up above 2.5%.
Rates could be lifted too by greater corporate spending, better productivity and above all, labour market changes. Here, economists will watch the NAIRU rate - the lowest unemployment can go without boosting inflation. 
The question is whether the pandemic will reverse a years-long NAIRU slide, if for instance workers gain more wage bargaining power.
There is no sign yet of a wage spiral, although current labour shortages mean the market's terminal rate bets may face challenges. 
And if shortages ease, that may increase the likelihood that the Fed sticks to the rate hike cycle it currently projects. 

A ""violent"" repricing of long bonds is a risk, says Ludovic Colin, portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management.
""For equities to sustain the current valuation they have, it's going to be a very tight rope they are walking.""

Sales from these new products is expected to exceed and make up for a $9 billion hit from launches of copycat versions of its products in this period, the Swiss drugmaker on Thursday said in a presentation https://www.novartis.com/sites/novartis_com/files/novartis-r-d-day-2021.pdf ahead of an investor briefing. 
The update comes weeks after Novartis said it would sell its stake in Roche to simplify its structure and focus on key offerings against diseases such as arthritis and cancer, following the launch of a review of its generic-drug unit Sandoz.

Novartis also expects core margins in innovative medicines to reach the high 30s by 2026, adding it had up to 20 assets in its pipeline that had blockbuster potential - meaning they could eventually yield annual sales of at least $1 billion.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Thursday as investors fret about the spread of the omicron Covid variant and the associated economic damage.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.7% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.9% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.7%.
The major European indices rebounded Wednesday despite concerns about the Covid variant as well as the Federal Reserve hinting at an early departure of its accommodative monetary policy.
However, the tone has quickly turned negative with the news that the United States became on Wednesday the latest country to identify a case within its borders. 
The World Health Organisation stated that at least 23 countries from five of six regions have reported cases of omicron, “and we expect that number to grow.” 
The UN agency expects to have more information on the transmissibility of the new variant of the coronavirus within days, but noted that hospitalizations were rising across South Africa, where the new variant was first discovered, and omicron is rapidly becoming the dominant variant there.
In corporate news, Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) said earlier Thursday that it’s confident of growing sales by 4% each year until 2026, as it had up to 20 products in its approval pipeline that had the potential to generate at least $1 billion in sales.
Economic data releases later Thursday include the Eurozone unemployment rate and producer prices for October.
Crude prices traded higher Thursday, recovering from the three-months lows hit during the previous session, as traders adjusted their positions ahead of the OPEC+ meeting to decide future output levels. 
Expectations are growing that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, will pause plans to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in January.
This follows the announcement of the first case of the omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus in the United States, while U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk said the U.S. could adjust the timing of its planned release of strategic crude oil stockpiles if global energy prices dropped substantially.
Capping the gains was news from the Energy Information Administration of a smaller than expected draw from U.S. crude inventories of 910,000 barrels last week.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% higher at $66.45 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.3% to $69.78.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,778.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1322.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Macau's Suncity Group Holdings Ltd said gaming rooms operated by a company owned by its former CEO and chairman, Alvin Chau, have been closed.
Chau, who was arrested with 10 others on Sunday over alleged links to cross-border gambling and money laundering, is also the founder of Macau's biggest junket operator which brings in high rollers to play at casinos.
Suncity Group also confirmed in its statement issued late on Wednesday that Chau had resigned from all positions at the listed company, but did not announce a new CEO or chairman.
In a watershed development for the sector, Macau and mainland Chinese authorities are adopting a zero-tolerance approach to the promotion of gambling in mainland China where it is illegal. In tandem, they are seeking to rein in the flow of Chinese gambling-related funds into Macau and other gaming hubs - outflows that China last year deemed a national security risk.
Chau's junket operations are estimated to have accounted for a quarter of Macau's gambling revenues, and the closure of his gaming rooms is expected to exacerbate pain for casino operators in the world's largest gambling hub that has already been hit hard by the pandemic.
Shares in  Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF) have plunged 20% since Chau's arrest while Sands China (OTC:SCHYY) and MGM China (OTC:MCHVY) have both slid 15%, though declines logged on Thursday were much milder than earlier in the week.
Suncity Group, which describes itself as a gambling sector investment company with hotel and other retail assets, has sought to draw a distinction between its businesses and Chau's junket operations, but analysts see them as inextricably linked.
""Suncity junket was the cash cow, the money-making entity, that supported financially the rest of the group,"" said Carlos Lobo, a Macau-based gaming consultant.
He added that the certain demise of Chau's junket operations following his arrest would lead to closures in other areas of the group such as restaurants, bars and hotels.
Suncity Group said in the statement that its travel-related businesses would be ""adversely affected"" by the crackdown on Chau's junket operations.
Its stock was down 5% in Thursday afternoon trade, off a record low marked earlier in the day, after being suspended on Wednesday. The shares have halved in value this week and are now worth HK$847 million ($110 million).
Macau authorities have accused Chau and 10 others of using the former Portuguese colony as a base for an illegal ""live web betting platform"" in the Philippines that attracted mainland Chinese gamblers.

A warrant for Chau's arrest has also been issued by the mainland Chinese city of Wenzhou, accusing him of forming an extensive junket agent network that helps citizens engage in gambling activities and of setting up a company that helps gamblers make cross-border fund transfers.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 01:07AM ET</span>","Investors flee U.S. corporate junk debt on inflation, Omicron concerns","By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Worries over surging inflation and a new variant of the coronavirus are roiling the U.S. corporate junk bond market, though some believe the tumble could draw investors seeking higher yields.
November marked the worst month since the start of the pandemic for the bonds of low-rated companies, with high-yield bonds notching an average return of minus 1.03%, the lowest since March 2020, according to Morningstar Direct data.
Spreads, which indicate the yield premium investors demand to hold junk-rated debt over safer U.S. Treasuries, also widened the most since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Among the factors driving the moves were fears that higher inflation will force the Federal Reserve to normalize monetary policy faster than expected, as well as a rush away from comparatively risky assets on worries over the Omicron variant, analysts said.
""With most managers sitting on healthy returns for the year, there's a bit of de-risking as well,"" said John McClain, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management.
But McClain said November's poor showing could aid the market in the coming year, with the higher yields that have resulted from falling prices potentially drawing investors.
""We're back to yields that look like the beginning of 2021 and spreads that are reasonably attractive here,"" he said. ""It sets the asset class up well for investor demand going into 2022.""
The option-adjusted yield spread of the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA U.S. High Yield Index, a commonly used benchmark for the junk bond market, increased by 51 basis points in November, the biggest monthly jump since March 2020.
Graphic: Junk Bond Spreads Widen, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/zjpqkykeypx/Pasted%20image%201638376953981.png On Tuesday, the spread was at its widest since February at 367 basis points. 
The funds also saw their biggest weekly net outflow since March in the week ending Nov. 24, with investors pulling a net $3.3 billion from the category, Refinitiv Lipper data showed. 
Among the victims of last week’s Omicron-triggered rout was the iShares iBoxx High-Yield Corporate Bond exchange-traded fund, which sank to its lowest level since November 2020 in frenzied risk-off trading. 
Inflation, which erodes bonds' interest payments over time, was a key worry: BofA's November survey of U.S. credit investors found 73% citing inflation as their biggest concern, up from 66% in September and the highest share since 2012.
U.S. consumer prices accelerated in October as Americans paid more for gasoline and food, leading to the biggest annual gain in 31 years. 
Worries over supply chain bottlenecks were another factor that may have weighed on junk-rated companies, according to Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. 
“Anything that can negatively impact your cash flows poses a risk,"" he said. 
Martin added that with three straight months of losses in high-yield bonds, some investors may have decided to lock in profits after a good year. 

Year-to-date total returns on the ICE BofA High-Yield Index, at 3.4%, were higher than those for other ICE indices tracking investment-grade corporate, as well as municipal bonds, according to ICE Data Services.

699,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 12:11AM ET</span>","Factbox-Grab debuts on Nasdaq, marking biggest Southeast Asia listing","(Reuters) - Grab, Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing and food delivery firm, lists on Nasdaq on Thursday following its $40 billion merger with special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Altimeter Growth Corp.
The deal is the world's biggest ever by a blank-check company and the biggest U.S. listing by a Southeast Asian firm.
WHAT IS GRAB?
Founded in 2012, Grab is Southeast Asia's largest startup, valued at just over $16 billion last year. It launched as a Malaysian taxi-hailing service and now calls itself a ""superapp"" after expanding into food, grocery and parcel delivery and to digital payments, lending and other financial services.
Singapore-headquartered Grab operates across 465 cities in eight countries in the region, counting Indonesia as its biggest. Its venture with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd was awarded a digital bank license in Singapore last year.
Grab gained the global spotlight in 2018 when it bought the Southeast Asian business of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc in return for the U.S. ride-hailing company taking a stake in Grab.
With some 8,000 employees, Grab has tech centres in Singapore, Beijing, Seattle, Bengaluru and other places.
WHO'S BACKING GRAB?Early investors include Japan's SoftBank, China's Didi Chuxing and venture capital firms Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX) Ventures Holdings and GGV Capital.
Grab raised about $12 billion ahead of the listing. Investors range from venture and hedge funds to automobile companies and other ride-hailing firms, and include:
Uber, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) Inc, China Investment Corp, Coatue Management, Hillhouse Capital, Hyundai Motor Co, Invesco Ltd,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Ping An Capital Co,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, and Yamaha Motor Co..
In the SPAC deal, about three dozen investors came on board including Temasek Holdings, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity International, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala and Malaysia's Permodalan Nasional Bhd and Altimeter Capital.
WHO'S THE COMPETITION?GoTo Group, formed by the merger of Indonesian ride-hailing and deliveries firm Gojek and local e-commerce leader Tokopedia is Grab's biggest competitor.
Singapore-based Sea Ltd, which has e-commerce, gaming and a digital payments business, and is also muscling into food delivery and financial services in Indonesia. Sea has also won a digital bank license in Singapore.
Grab is likely to increasingly start competing with banks as it expands its financial services.
It also competes with such delivery companies as Foodpanda and Deliveroo PLC.
WHAT ARE GRAB'S FINANCIALS?
Grab's third-quarter revenue fell 9% from a year earlier to $157 million. Its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) widened 66% to $212 million. Gross merchandise value hit a quarterly record of $4 billion.
The delivery business has emerged as the biggest segment as more consumers shifted to online food delivery during the pandemic.
Grab forecasts it will turn profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2023.
WHO ARE ITS KEY EXECUTIVES?
Anthony Tan, 39, is the company's CEO and co-founder.
Fellow co-founder Tan Hooi Ling, 38, runs Grab's operations, including corporate strategy and technology.

Both Tans, unrelated, met at Harvard Business School, where they conceived the idea of the ride-hailing company.
Grab's president, Ming Maa, is a prominent dealmaker from SoftBank, who joined the company in 2016.

The San Francisco-based company said the name ""Square"" had become synonymous with it's seller business. The new name would distinguish the corporate entity from its businesses, Square added, a strategy similar to Meta Platforms Inc's rebrand last month.
The company said there would be no organizational changes and its different business units - Square, peer-to-peer payment service Cash App, music streaming service Tidal and its bitcoin-focused financial services segment TBD54566975 - will continue to maintain their respective brands. Shares were up nearly 1% in extended trading.
""The name has many associated meanings for the company — building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music, a blockchain, a section of code, and obstacles to overcome,"" Square said in a statement.
The move comes days after Dorsey stepped down from his role as chief executive officer at Twitter. The digital payments giant's Square Crypto, a team ""dedicated to advancing Bitcoin"", will also change its name to Spiral.
Under Dorsey, who has frequently expressed his interest in the cryptocurrency, Square bought $50 million worth of bitcoin even before the wave of institutional interest that propelled the digital currency's price to record highs this year. In February, it further raised its wager and invested another $170 million in it.

Square has also been weighing the creation of a hardware wallet for bitcoin to make its custody more mainstream.
The new name would become effective on or about Dec. 10, Square said, but the ""SQ"" ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange would not change at this time.

In a raft of allegations against one of the country's biggest employers, the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) said https:// Coles underpaid 7,812 employees by A$115.2 million ($81.99 million) between January 2017 and March 2020.
Underpayments ranged from insufficient annual salaries to cover for the overtime work done by its workers and also ""significantly underestimated"" amounts under the company's remediation programme, among others. 
More than A$108 million was the outstanding amount under the remediation programme, the FWO said, adding that the company also failed to keep proper records of employees' overtime hours. 
The FWO was seeking penalties against Coles in the Federal Court for multiple alleged breach of workplace laws, with penalties of up to A$63,000 per breach.
""Businesses paying annual salaries cannot take a 'set-and-forget' approach to paying their workers,"" Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker said on Thursday. 
Coles, which has been under the watchdog radar since February 2020 when investigations on the company's pay arrangements for its salaried employees had started, said it was reviewing the proceedings.

The FWO had also sued the country's biggest grocer Woolworths Group https://reut.rs/3IcqLLZ and the largest lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) https://reut.rs/3xMUmql (CBA.AX) for staff underpayments, underlining it as a persistent issue among businesses of all sizes, across different industries.

Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd., which became the first Chinese developer to default on such bonds in 2015, is trying to stave off another collapse that could come as soon as next week. The company’s offer to exchange some of its $400 million of dollar notes maturing Dec. 7 for new ones due 18 months later expires at 4 p.m. London time.
If the offer -- which requires a 95% approval rate -- fails to win support, the firm has said it may not be able to repay bonds and could consider a debt restructuring. Kaisa has some $11.6 billion in dollar debt outstanding. That means a potential default risks spurring selling in the broader high yield market.

(NYSE:JPM)
While it is likely that omicron is more transmissible, early reports suggest it may also be less deadly, which would fit into the pattern of virus evolution observed historically, strategists Marko Kolanovic and Bram Kaplan wrote in a note Wednesday. This might ultimately be a positive for risk markets because it could signal that the end of the pandemic is in sight, they said. 
“Omicron could be a catalyst for steepening (not flattening) the yield curve, rotation from growth to value, selloff in Covid and lockdown beneficiaries and rally in reopening themes,” the strategists said. “We view the recent selloff in these segments as an opportunity to buy the dip in cyclicals, commodities and reopening themes, and to position for higher bond yields and steepening.”
The emergence of the new virus strain has roiled markets in recent days, with countries around the world stepping up travel restrictions. While some health officials said it could take weeks to reach a verdict, Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said there is no indication that it is more deadly than other strains. 
It would fit with historical patterns for a less severe and more transmissible virus to quickly crowd out more severe variants, which could turn omicron into a catalyst to transform a deadly pandemic into something more akin to seasonal flu, the JPMorgan strategists wrote. 
“If that scenario were to happen, instead of skipping two letters and naming it omicron, the WHO could have skipped all the way to omega,” -- the last letter of the Greek alphabet -- the strategists said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Thursday morning, with U.S. equivalents reversing a recent rally. Concerns about the risks posed by the new omicron COVID-19 variant continue to mount, and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his stance of wrapping up asset tapering earlier than planned.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 225 was down 0.44% by 9:01 PM ET (2:01 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.81%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.34%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.35%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.23% while the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.20%. The country is reportedly planning to ban companies from going public on foreign stock markets through variable interest entities, with the China Securities Regulatory Commission denying the report.
U.S. shares were also on a downward trend, with the S&P 500 recording its worst two-day selloff since October 2020 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 also underperforming. U.S. Treasuries also retreated from an earlier rally that took the 30-year yield to its lowest level since January 2021.
The U.S. also confirmed its first case of the omicron COVID-19 variant, which will pose a fresh challenge to the economic recovery. However, Powell reiterated that the Fed should consider quickening the pace of asset tapering as inflation remains high.
The prospect of tighter monetary policy from central banks, alongside the risk posed by omicron to the global economic recovery, increased expectations for volatility in financial markets to continue through the month.
“The omicron variant is the number one uncertainty facing the U.S. economic outlook,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Kim Mundy said in a note.
The number of COVID-19 cases in South Africa almost doubled, while the U.K., Switzerland, and Brazil reported cases of the omicron variant. Although World Health Organization chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said vaccines will likely protect against severe cases of the variant, questions remain.
On the data front, the U.S. economy grew at a modest to moderate pace through mid-November 2021, while price hikes were widespread amid supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages, the Fed said in its Beige Book survey released on Wednesday.
The U.S. initial jobless claims figure will be released later today, with the job report, including non-farm payrolls, following a day later."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol Myers Squibb Co was sued on Wednesday by four employees who said the drugmaker refused to grant them religious exemptions from its COVID-19 vaccination requirement, and threatened to fire them on Dec. 6 for remaining unvaccinated. 
The plaintiffs in the proposed class action filed in Manhattan federal court accused Bristol Myers of violating a federal civil rights law known as Title VII by ""systematically manufacturing"" reasons to refuse religious accommodations.
The plaintiffs allege that Bristol Myers is concluding their politics is the real reason they won't be vaccinated, regardless of whether they have sincere religious beliefs that independently would justify exemptions. 
They also said the company is ignoring sincere religious beliefs that are ""inconvenient"" to denial decisions, even as it accommodates employees with medical reasons not to be vaccinated.
Bristol Myers said its priority during the pandemic has been the health and safety of communities, employees and patients.
""Our policy that all eligible employees in (the) U.S. and Puerto Rico be vaccinated against COVID-19 is consistent with this safety priority,"" the New York-based company said in a statement.
Wednesday's lawsuit came as the Biden administration seeks to require vaccinations for millions of workers at large private U.S. employers, a mandate is also being challenged in court.
Many health officials consider widespread vaccinations the best way to help control the pandemic.
The Bristol Myers plaintiffs, all with six-figure salaries, are Carrie Kefalas, a physician overseeing clinical trial risk management for drug development; biotechnologist John Lott; data integrity manager Jeremy Beer, and biologist Kamila Dubisz.
They objected to the company requiring they fill out ""inquisitorial"" questionnaires about their reasons for religious exemptions.
The complaint said Bristol Myers rejected Kefalas' request because it thought her beliefs were insincere and she might not accept mask-wearing or regular COVID-19 testing. The company offered no reasons for the other rejections, the complaint said.
Bristol Myers referred in Kefalas' rejection letter to several statements it said she made publicly, including that its vaccine requirement was a ""communist, unamerican practice (sic).""
The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction against Bristol Myers' firing the plaintiffs or similarly situated employees.

Bristol Myers ended 2020 with about 17,000 U.S. employees.
The case is Kefalas et al v Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-10204.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 08:15PM ET</span>","EV industry must work closer with lithium suppliers, executives say","By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - Automakers must work closer with lithium producers to guarantee supply of specialized types of the white metal that boost an electric vehicle's range and performance,  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp and Livent (NYSE:LTHM) Corp executives told the Reuters Next conference on Wednesday. 
As EVs go mainstream, automakers are planning models that can run longer before recharging and handle different weather conditions. Batteries for such EVs typically are made with a type of lithium known as hydroxide that cannot be stored for long periods of time and thus must be made in custom batches.
As such, producing it requires extensive investment and planning, which lithium producers are hesitant to do even as prices rise unless automakers sign long-term contracts and share development plans, Albemarle lithium division head Eric Norris and Livent Chief Executive Paul Graves said on a Reuters Next panel. 
""It's very important that we have the kind of relationship and transparency with (automakers) in order to not put them in a situation where they don't have the product available that they need,"" said Norris, who joined Albemarle in 2018. 
""We need certain economics to be able to continue to grow.""
Without such coordination, the auto industry may not have enough of the type of lithium needed to make EVs run longer, thus making them less appealing to consumers. 
Global demand for lithium last year was about 320,000 tonnes. Most industry consultants expect that to hit 1 million tonnes by 2025 and 3 million tonnes by the end of the decade.
""There may be periods where there is just insufficient lithium available to meet exactly what every (automaker) is trying to do,"" said Graves, who has run Livent since it was spun off from  FMC Corp  (NYSE:FMC) in 2018. 
""The demand side of the equation has to be very thoughtful about what its business plans are over the next three or four years.""
NEW TECHNOLOGY
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) , Stellantis NV and others signed supply agreements this year with so-called direct lithium extraction (DLE) start-ups promising to sustainably produce lithium from geothermal brines in California and Germany. Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures has also invested in a DLE company.
DLE technologies differ, but they each promise a one-size-fits-all approach to extract the metal from any geological deposit across the globe, a tantalizing prospect for an automotive industry hungry for more supply.
But DLE technologies also typically cost more and use more energy than evaporation ponds, which use solar power to produce lithium. Both executives said DLE works best when engineered for a specific lithium deposit, a factor that likely will curb enthusiasm for it.
""You need to look at the facts when you look at what's being promoted as being more sustainable,"" Norris said of DLE. ""It's usually focusing on one element of that sustainability and not on the whole picture.""

Livent itself uses a type of DLE technology in Argentina alongside evaporation ponds, a tailor-made approach that works at that operation but might not work elsewhere, Graves said.
""There's a hope that there's been a technological breakthrough that is going to suddenly release all of this abundant lithium at incredibly low cost into the world,"" he said. ""But the rules of chemistry and physics don't bend very easily.""

Mergers and acquisitions have been happening at record pace this year, as companies seek to reshape themselves as they emerge from the pandemic by using cheap debt and bumper stock prices to pursue transformative combinations.
However, panelists addressing ""The Great M&A Game"" warned the ferocious appetite was being stymied by a concerted push by U.S. regulatory agencies, who were using any means necessary to slow down and kill transactions.
""There just aren't going to be any big deals in the foreseeable future,"" said Robert Kindler, vice chairman and global head of M&A at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), noting every deal ""is getting very close scrutiny, and people are not going to do deals when there is any issue on the regulatory side.""
Among the tactics being deployed by regulators are extensive requests for information and other administrative road blocks, said Scott Barshay, corporate department chair at law firm Paul Weiss.
He also noted the October announcement by the Federal Trade Commission, which said it was reapplying the practice of making companies seek the agency's approval for all deals for the next decade, in exchange for waving through an existing transaction.
The Biden administration has expressed concern that unchecked dealmaking has contributed to a lack of vigor in key economic sectors and hurt consumer choice. A study into possible reforms of competition law is currently under way.

There has been a chilling effect, said Kindler, who predicted fewer than ten deals worth more than $10 billion in 2022 between publicly listed companies.
Barshay noted that private equity firms would likely escape the same scrutiny given to a deal involving two listed entities, allowing buyout firms to continue making big acquisitions.

(Reuters) - Mitsubishi Corp is looking to sell a fuel terminal that provides transportation fuels which meet California's stringent emissions requirements, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
The company is working with Ernst and Young's energy advisory group to market its 600,000-barrel Petro-Diamond terminal in Long Beach, California, and its corresponding fuel trading division, the sources said.
Mitsubishi is seeking either a joint venture partner for Petro-Diamond or an outright sale, the sources added.
The terminal is the only U.S. refined products asset owned by Mitsubishi, Japan's biggest trading house by sales.
Mitsubishi previously had a sizable trading operation in Singapore, also named Petro-Diamond (PDS). The company began winding down in 2020 after it said a PDS trader had lost $320 million in unauthorized transactions in crude oil derivatives.
Mitsubishi could still scrap the sale of the U.S. terminal if it fails to find a suitable buyer, they said. A target valuation for Petro-Diamond could not be determined.
EY and Mitsubishi did not return requests for comment.
PetroDiamond was formed in 1983 and markets and distributes on-spec transportation fuels in Southern California including CARB gasoline, low sulfur diesel, ethanol and marine fuels. 

Last year, an executive order required that by 2035 all new cars and passenger trucks sold in California be zero-emission vehicles, and that the state reduce the dirtiest forms of oil extraction.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's major averages fell more than 1% on Wednesday after a morning rally faded as investor angst about the latest coronavirus variant soared with the first U.S. case confirmation while the market also digested Fed comments on inflation.
After having advanced as much as 1.9% by late morning, the S&P 500 gave up all its gains in the afternoon along with the Dow and Nasdaq, which fell the most on the day. All three indexes breached key technical levels during the session. 
Late in the day, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said the country had detected its first case of the Omicron variant, which had infected a person who came from South Africa, where the variant was initially discovered.
Earlier on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said policymakers needed to be ready to respond to the possibility inflation may not recede in the second half of next year as expected.
Wall Street had already tumbled on Tuesday after Powell had surprised the market by signaling that the central bank would consider accelerating the withdrawal of its bond buying program at its December meeting amid a surge in inflation. 
""The market's grappling with the twin concerns of the Omicron variant, which may or may not be able to evade the vaccine, and a more hawkish Powell than expected,"" said Chris Zaccarelli the chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Wall Street had tumbled sharply on Friday when investors first heard of the Omicron variant with health officials saying they were unsure how transmissible or dangerous the variant is and how much protection existing vaccines provide.
On Monday, the market rebounded sharply as investors looked for bargains after the sell-off, only to fall again on Tuesday following the Powell comments. [.N/C]
""We tried to buy the dip again (on Wednesday) but news that Omicron is here already has taken some of the wind out of the sails of the bulls,"" said Zaccarelli.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 461.68 points, or 1.34%, to 34,022.04, the S&P 500 lost 53.96 points, or 1.18%, to 4,513.04 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 283.64 points, or 1.83%, to 15,254.05. 
The Dow closed below its 200-day moving average for first time since July 13, 2020, while the S&P finished below its 50-day moving average for first time since Oct. 13 and Nasdaq ended a session under its 50-day moving average for first time since Oct. 14.
While all of the 11 major S&P sectors were gaining into the early afternoon, all but one sector ended the day in the red. The communications services sector was the biggest loser with a 1.99% drop and consumer discretionary was not far behind with a 1.86% dip.
The sole advancing sector was utilities, a more defensive sector which tends to draw interest when investors are fleeing from riskier bets. The next best performers on the day were also defensive sectors with the healthcare ending down 0.2% and consumer staples falling 0.4%.
The CBOE market volatility index, often referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge, closed up 14.5 points at 31.12 after earlier rising to 32.61, its highest level since February. 
The economically sensitive Russell 2000 index of small cap companies did an almost complete about-face, closing down 2.3% after rising as much as 2.5% at its late morning peak.
The World Health Organization said it expected to have more information on the transmissibility of the Omicron variant within days, and that the agency believes the existing COVID-19 vaccines will work against the variant. 
Lauren Goodwin, economist and portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments, said it was not surprising to see volatility as investors digest uncertainties including the lack of information on Omicron and the latest signals from the Fed.
However Goodwin also pointed at Wednesday's positive economic data, which was ""reminding investors that the economic and corporate backdrop for this market is really strong.""

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.96-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 42 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 37 new highs and 541 new lows.

China tightened financing curbs on the real estate industry early this year, exacerbating financial problems at indebted developer China Evergrande Group and triggering sector-wide liquidity stress that some feared could destabilise China's economy.
In recent weeks there have been signs that some financing channels are being marginally relaxed for developers.
According to the filing system of China's interbank debt market, Country Garden Real Estate Group, controlled by Country Garden Holdings, plans to issue medium-term notes worth 5 billion yuan.
Chongqing Longhu Enterprise Development Co, the main platform of Longfor Group, plans to issue 3 billion yuan of debt.
Separately, the state-owned developer China Overseas Enterprise Development Group Co aims to issue three tranches of debts totalling 10 billion yuan, according to the registration filing.
There have been other signs of life in the domestic bond market for developers. Corporate bonds issued by real estate companies nearly tripled in November from the previous month, to 37.1 billion yuan, official China Securities Journal reported on Wednesday.
There are also signs of marginal lending relaxation. Last month, sources told Reuters financial regulators had told some Chinese banks to issue more loans to property firms for project development.

But Chinese authorities have given no signal that they will relax the ""three red lines"" - financial requirements the central bank introduced last year that developers must meet to get new bank loans. Analysts have said Beijing will continue its deleveraging campaign against developers despite the recent policy tweaks.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) on Wednesday said it plans to boost spending on new oil and gas projects in 2022 by 20% to $15 billion, while also raising shareholder returns.
Major oil companies are responding to a jump in profits this year from higher oil and gas prices, and have signaled they plan to revive outlays for drilling and carbon-reduction measures. 
Chevron increased its share buyback guidance range to $3 billion-$5 billion per year, up from a $2-$3 billion range set in July. 
The new level brings its investor-friendly buyback program back to pre-pandemic levels. It was distributing $5 billion per year before the pandemic forced a suspension.
However, it keeps spending on projects below the $20 billion initially planned for 2020, months before the effects of the coronavirus hit its operations. 
The spending plan ""reflects Chevron's enduring commitment to capital discipline,"" Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth said. 
While the 2022 spending budget is higher than this year's forecast spend, it is at the low end of Chevron's previous $15 billion to $17 billion per year guidance range. 

The company has been cutting debt and freeing cash flow for shareholder distributions after this year's rebound in crude oil prices, which reached a 7-year high in October. 
Chevron will spend $3 billion next year at its U.S. Permian Basin operations out of the approximately $8 billion allocated to oil and gas producing assets. Another $2 billion will be deployed in its Tengiz field in Kazakhstan.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 06:46PM ET</span>","Ford, GM race to brag 'We're Number 3!' in electric vehicle market","By Paul Lienert and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co are revving up their century old rivalry, this time over which will sell more electric vehicles by 2025.
But with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ensconced as the global EV leader and the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group mounting a $100 billion-plus challenge, GM and Ford are racing for third place, at best.
As the biggest Detroit carmakers struggle to escape from Tesla's shadow, the Motown matchup is like two football teams slugging it out using very different playbooks. 
GM on Wednesday announced plans to form a joint venture with South Korea's  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) to build a battery cathode materials plant in North America by 2024. The deal is part of the automaker's long-range plan to carefully construct a proprietary, vertically integrated EV machine that it will fully turn on only when costs fall and demand grows in the second half of the 2020s. 
""Our goal is EV market leadership,"" said GM Executive Vice President Doug Parks.
On Friday, Ford will elaborate on its markedly different EV strategy. It plans to quickly launch several higher-volume models such as the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lightning, using modified combustion vehicles. Ford will follow up in the middle of the decade with a broader portfolio of electric SUVs and trucks, designed from the ground up to run on batteries.
Ford CEO Jim Farley is pressing subordinates to add more EV production capacity, on top of announced plans, including expansion of electric F-150 capacity in Dearborn, Michigan.
Despite their activity, both Detroit automakers are expected to lag well behind EV market leaders Tesla and VW through 2028, according to data provided by AutoForecast Solutions, whose production estimates are widely used across the industry.
The data also shows the Detroit giants must deal with a surprise contender for third place in the global EV race: Stellantis, the European company formed last year by the merger of French automaker PSA and Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler. 
Graphic: The global EV leader board through 2028: https://graphics.reuters.com/GM-POSCO/PLANT/jnvweaexdvw/chart_eikon.jpg 
AFS expects that Tesla's global output will reach nearly 1.5 million by 2025, with further growth depending on where and how the company expands its production footprint.
Forecasts call for the VW Group to reach 1.45 million EVs in 2025 and climb to 1.9 million in 2028, according to AFS data.
Ford's global EV production is expected to hit 695,000 in 2025 and 1.14 million in 2028.
GM's EV numbers look much thinner: 494,000 in 2025 and 624,000 in 2028. Those figures do not include production from the SAIC-GM-Wuling joint venture in China, which produces EVs under the Baojun and Wuling brands and in which GM is a minority shareholder.
According to AFS, Stellantis aims to build 948,000 EVs in 2025 and 1.2 million in 2028, which would put the company in third place, ahead of Ford.
Ford's strategy differs from GM's in other respects. While both companies plan to build EVs in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China, Ford also will source production in Germany, Turkey and Spain. GM will get electric vehicles from nine plants in 2028, Ford from 12, according to AFS data.
One common element: Both companies will heavily electrify their premium U.S. brands. GM's Cadillac will offer the Lyriq, Symboliq, Celestiq and Escalade EV, as well as a compact SUV, by 2025. Ford's Lincoln will counter with electric versions of the Corsair, Aviator and Navigator, along with an electric pickup.

A Lincoln electric pickup?
Ted Cannis, head of the Ford Pro business unit, said the company has seen so much early demand for the new F-150 Lightning from fleet and retail customers, ""I'm not sure how we can supply"" enough vehicles.

(Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump's new social media venture is seeking to raise up to $1 billion by selling shares to hedge funds and family offices at several times the valuation it commanded in a deal with a blank-check acquisition firm in October, two people familiar with the matter said.
Trump Media & Technology Group, which has yet to roll out the social media app it says it is developing, already stands to receive $293 million if its deal to list in New York through a merger with blank-check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp is completed.
The deal valued Trump Media at $875 million, including debt. Trump Media is now seeking to raise up to an additional $1 billion at a valuation of close to $3 billion, to reflect Digital World's share rally after Trump supporters and day traders snapped up the stock, the sources said.
It is the clearest indication yet that Trump and the Digital World dealmakers are seeking to capitalize on the market euphoria around their venture, which has so far been fueled by its ambitious goals rather than a business that is up and running.
Digital World shares were valued at $10 each in the deal with Trump Media. Trump Media is now looking to secure a so-called private investment in public equity (PIPE) that would value Digital World shares closer to their recent price, the sources said. 
The sources added that Digital World shares may be valued based on a 20% discount of their 10-day, volume-weighted average price. 
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Trump Media and Digital World did not respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg News reported last month that the companies were seeking to raise a PIPE without any details on its terms.
Digital World shares soared on Wednesday, as investors welcomed the news that the PIPE could dilute existing Digital World shareholders less than they expected by pricing at a level much higher than the customary $10 per share seen in most mergers with blank-check firms.
The shares, which had been trading down 6% before news of the $1 billion raise, rallied to close up 7% at $44.35 on Nasdaq, then extended gains in after-hours trade, rocketing up 31%, to $58.01.
Most PIPE transactions are inked before a deal to take a company public is rolled out, and it is far from certain that the companies will raise the entire $1 billion they are seeking following their deal announcement. Many Wall Street firms have snubbed the opportunity to invest, and many of the investors participating in the confidential road shows for the PIPE are hedge funds, family offices and high net-worth individuals, the sources said. Family offices manage the wealth of the very rich and their kin.
Weighing on the deal's appeal is the reluctance of many investors to associate with Trump after he was banned from top social media platforms for encouraging his supporters to participate in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, which was based on unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in last year's presidential election. 
Some hedge funds that backed the launch of Digital World, including Saba Capital Management and Lighthouse Investment Partners, have said they sold their shares to distance themselves from the Trump deal. 
The deal also faces regulatory risk. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren asked Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler last month to investigate the planned merger for potential violations of securities laws around disclosure. The SEC has declined to comment on whether it plans any action.
Trump Media and Digital World have asked investors to finalize commitments to the PIPE by the middle of December, the sources said.
In a PIPE road show attended by one of the sources, investors were asked to commit between $10 million and $20 million. Neither Trump nor Digital World executives made an appearance, and the investor presentation was led by David Boral (OTC:BOALY), the president of EF Hutton, an investment bank that advised Digital World on the deal, the source said. A Trump Media representative was also in attendance, the source added.
But Trump has been personally involved. He has been calling some investors to ask them to make a commitment to the PIPE of more than $100 million, the second of the sources said.
Investors attending the road show were shown a demo from the planned social media app, called TRUTH Social, which looked like a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) feed, the sources said.
BIG PLANS
Trump has said he is launching his own social media app to stand up against the companies that have barred him from their platforms. He had 89 million followers on Twitter, 33 million on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and 24.5 million on Instagram at the time he was blocked, according to a presentation on his company's website.
Since Trump was voted out of office last year, he has repeatedly dropped hints that he might seek the presidency for a third time in 2024.
Special purpose acquisition companies such as Digital World had lost much of their luster with retail investors before the Trump media deal came along. Many of these investors were left with big losses after the companies that merged with SPACs failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections.

TRUTH Social is scheduled for a full rollout in the first quarter of 2022, and is the first of three stages in the Trump Media plan, followed by a subscription video-on-demand service called TMTG+ that will feature entertainment, news and podcasts, according to the news release.
In a slide deck on its website, the company envisions eventually competing against Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS cloud service and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud.

Blackstone did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc on Wednesday released a new chip designed for gaming-specific handheld devices offering 5G connectivity, a potential new mobile platform for video gamers offering more flexibility to play streaming games on the go.
The San Diego-based firm said it has partnered with gaming hardware company Razer Inc to create an initial test device for game makers.
Qualcomm is the world's biggest supplier of chips for smartphones, which have become a key platform for video games, which in turn are one of the biggest revenue generators in mobile app stores.
With its ""G3x Gen 1"" chip announced on Wednesday, Qualcomm envisions handheld devices that have a touch screen similar to a smartphone, but also physical controls like a gaming console controller and much longer battery life while playing graphics-intensive games.
The most popular similar device on today's market is the Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974)  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH), but that device does not feature cellular data connectivity, instead relying on a WiFi connection.
Qualcomm powered devices would have 5G connectivity to stream games directly from cloud gaming providers like  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) when WiFi isn't available. The devices would also have bigger batteries to take advantage of Qualcomm's graphics processing capabilities, which often aren't fully exploited on phones because it would hurt battery life.

""The big thing about the phone is it's always going to fit in your pocket. There are a lot of compromises that go into a phone for the use cases that are not gaming,"" Micah Knapp, senior director of product management at Qualcomm, told Reuters in an interview. ""So what happens if you build a device that's just for gaming?""
Qualcomm said it has partnered with Razer, a maker of gaming PCs and laptops, to create an initial ""developer kit"" that game makers can use to start writing software. Qualcomm did not give a time frame for when commercial devices for consumers might appear.

719,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 06:10PM ET</span>","Analysis-History says expect strong December for U.S. stocks, despite Omicron and Fed worries","By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - A pileup of risks into year-end has some investors gauging whether December will continue its historical trend of a strong stock performance, even as markets face of worries over the Omicron coronavirus variant and a more hawkish Federal Reserve. 
November and December have been the S&P 500's second- and third-best months of the year since 1950, with the index rising an average of 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. 
This year, November's gains were derailed in its final days, as concerns over how the new COVID-19 variant may impact global growth and Tuesday’s hawkish shift by the Fed in the face of surging inflation left the index with a 0.8% loss for the month. The S&P 500 is up 21.6% so far this year and remains near record highs.
While those risks are unlikely to dissipate anytime soon, stocks may still finish the year on a strong note, if historical performance is any guide.
The S&P has notched a positive return in December 74% of the time since 1928, more than in any other month, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. 
A weaker November has only bolstered that trend, if performance over the rest of the year has been robust: This year marks the 10th time the S&P 500 was down in November but up more than 10% for the year, the firm's data showed. In the nine prior years when this occurred, stocks finished December with a gain, according to Bespoke.
“Momentum is definitely a factor,” George Pearkes, macro strategist at Bespoke, told Reuters. “If stocks are going up all year and people are underweight and chasing they may want to add to their positions before year-end.” 
December's gains tend to be even more positive when the S&P 500 has a strong first 11 months of the year, according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). 
Since 1950, the index has gained an average of 1.7% in December when the S&P 500 has climbed at least 20% in the rest of the year, compared with an average of 1.5% for December overall, according to Detrick.
Markets may have their work cut out for them this time around. 
The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, on Tuesday rose to levels seen during last week’s Omicron-fueled selloff after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress the central bank will likely discuss speeding up its taper of monthly bond purchases at its upcoming policy meeting in the face of surging inflation. Stocks tumbled on the news, while yields on Treasury bonds rose.
“With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management, in a recent note.
Expectations of a more hawkish Fed are likely to be an unwelcome development for the technology stocks whose outsize weighting in the S&P 500 helped send the index to record highs this year. 
Rising yields on Treasury bonds--which often follow expectations of more aggressive Fed policy -- dull the allure of equities for some investors and can weigh even more on stocks with lofty valuations, as they threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows. 
The S&P 500 information technology sector is trading at 27.5 times forward 12-month earnings estimates compared with its historic average of 20.8 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
Investors are also attempting to gauge the potential seriousness and severity of the Omicron variant, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) mapping out four scenarios of how the strain may spread and its potential impact on global growth. 
A ”downside” scenario, in which a large wave of infections leads to lockdowns, could slow global growth to 2% in the first quarter of 2022, the bank said, 2.5 percentage points below its current forecast. 

Many investors, however, believe stocks will remain buoyant.
“The market has been looking for an excuse to sell off for quite some time,” said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. ”Yet strong corporate earnings and the likelihood of an expanding economy should keep the stock market from falling significantly from here.”

""Today the prior conditions have been completed,"" the airline said in a statement from Bogota. Avianca ""has emerged successfully from said process.""
Avianca, along with rival Chile's LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ), were the two largest carriers in the region before the coronavirus pandemic, but both were sent into bankruptcy restructuring when the virus upended air travel, amid especially strict restrictions in Latin America.
Avianca had already posted several years of losses before the pandemic began, and went through a boardroom coup in 2019 led by United Airlines.
The Southern District of New York approved the company's reorganization plan in early November, a day before Avianca announced it will move its domicile to Britain and its stock will no longer be traded on the Colombian stock exchange.

Once its principle domicile is established in Britain, the company will be known as Avianca Group International Ltd. Its current shareholders will not receive any payout or be included as shareholders in Avianca Group, the airline has said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada on Wednesday excluded Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co from a multi-billion-dollar race to supply 88 new fighter jets and indicated a previous clash between the U.S. company and a Canadian aircraft maker influenced the decision.
The move means only  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Sweden's Saab AB can compete. Ottawa says it intends to make a decision next year on a contract that could be worth up to C$19 billion ($14.8 billion).
Reuters reported the decision to bar Boeing's F-18 Super Hornet on Nov. 25, citing a defense source. The formal announcement came from the federal procurement ministry and did not mention Boeing.
Boeing said it was ""disappointed and deeply concerned"" by the announcement. ""We are working with the U.S. and Canadian governments to better understand the decision and looking for the earliest date to request a debrief to then determine our path forward,"" it said in a statement without giving more details.
Defense analysts had expected Ottawa would exclude Saab's Gripen plane, given Canada and the United States only fly U.S. military jets. Unlike Canada, Sweden is not a member of NATO or NORAD, the North American defense organization.
Saab said in a statement that the Gripen had passed all aspects of the evaluation, including security and interoperability requirements.
Canada belongs to the consortium that developed Lockheed Martin's F-35 jet, which defense sources say is the preferred choice of the air force.
The procurement ministry made clear one reason for the decision was Boeing's formal complaint in 2017 to the U.S. Commerce Department that Ottawa was unfairly subsidizing a passenger jet made by Montreal-based rival Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF).
Canada responded by saying it would look less favorably on a bid from a company that had had a negative economic impact on Canada's interests.
The procurement ministry on Wednesday said proposals had been assessed on elements of capability, cost and economic benefits.
""The evaluation also included an assessment of economic impact,"" it added. A spokesman for Procurement Minister Filomena Tassi declined to comment.
The procurement ministry said it could now either decide which bidder offered the best plane or offer Lockheed Martin and Saab a chance to improve their proposals. 

Lockheed Martin said: ""As a cornerstone for interoperability with NORAD and NATO, the F-35 will strengthen Canada’s operational capability with our allies.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global equity markets retreated from early gains on Wednesday as concerns about the first U.S. case of the Omicron variant and sooner-than-expected interest rate hikes next year by the Federal Reserve turned investor sentiment bearish.
The major economic sectors on Wall Street earlier were a sea of green while European stocks posted their best session in almost six months after Tuesday's sharp sell-off triggered by unease over rising inflation and questions regarding the new variant of the coronavirus.
The safe-haven yen and Swiss franc earlier rose even as the more risk-adverse British and Australian currencies rebounded. Similar investor sentiment could be seen in U.S. stocks when earlier gains of more than 1.5% were wiped out.
The United States on Wednesday identified its first known COVID case caused by the Omicron variant, discovered in a fully vaccinated patient who traveled to South Africa, as scientists continue to study the risks the new version could pose.
""We don't have all the facts. There isn't clarity of how easily it spreads, whether the vaccines are effective,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""That's causing a lot of swings in the market."" 
MSCI's all-country world index closed down 0.26% after earlier trading 1.8% higher. The broad STOXX Europe 600 index closed up 1.7%, with Germany's DAX index gaining 2.5% and France's CAC40 adding 2.4.% 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.34%, the S&P 500 fell 1.18% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.83%. Only the S&P's utilities sector <.SPLRCU) closed higher.
Investors also remain skittish about the outlook for rising inflation and a quicker pace of Fed plans to taper its massive bond purchasing program.
With a robust U.S. economy and supply-demand imbalances poised to persist near-term, policymakers need to be ready to respond to the possibility that inflation may not recede next year as expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives.
The market perceives Powell as more hawkish than in the past and expects three rate hikes in 2022 with another three the following year, said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions in Boston.
""This concept of inflation running way to the upside and the Fed's behind the curve and they're going to have to massively tighten, we don't subscribe to that,"" Janasiewicz said. ""The market's a little ahead of itself in terms of that.""
U.S. Treasury yields pared gains on a safety bid after the discovery of the U.S. case of Omicron, but remained higher on the day as investors priced in the likelihood the Fed will speed up the pace of its bond purchase taper.
A closely watched part of the yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, which is seen as an indicator of economic expectations, was at 85.5 basis points, or the flattest this year by some accounts.
Market expectations of future consumer prices slid, as the 10-year TIPS breakeven rate was at 2.428%, indicating inflation will average about 2.43% a year for the next decade.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 1.7 basis points to yield 1.424%.
A survey showed manufacturing growth in the euro zone accelerated and supply chain bottlenecks worsened, driving the cost of raw materials up at the fastest rate in over two decades to add to global inflation concerns.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.093% to 96.064.
The euro was down 0.19% at $1.1314, while the yen traded down 0.31% at $112.7800.
U.S. crude oil futures retreated after an American official said the country was continuing to consider tools to lower energy prices, and as government data pointed to weaker gasoline demand.
Crude prices also fell as the Omicron variant triggered fresh travel restrictions that could dampen oil demand and after an OPEC+ document showed the group forecasting a bigger oil surplus in the new year than previously thought.

U.S. crude futures fell 61 cents to settle at $65.57 a barrel after earlier trading as much as 4% higher, while global benchmark Brent crude slid 36 cents to settle at $68.87 a barrel. 
U.S. gold futures settled up 0.4% at $1,784.30 an ounce.

Given the historically high inflation, supply chain constraints, and ongoing volatility in the broader market, investors and analysts are anticipating a market correction in the near term. However, the inelastic demand for healthcare products should help the industry participants to deliver substantial returns and hedge the current market risks. Global healthcare spending is expected to reach $10.06 trillion by 2022.
Given this backdrop, we believe it is wise to bet on quality healthcare stocks Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK), Novartis AG (NVS),  Zoetis Inc . (NYSE:ZTS), and Cerner Corporation (NASDAQ:CERN) that have the potential to deliver solid returns and dodging the market fluctuations.

728,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 05:09PM ET</span>",Pratt to announce update of A320neo engine with more thrust,"By Allison Lampert
Hartford, Conn. (Reuters) - Engine maker Pratt & Whitney is set to announce an improved version of its geared turbofan engine used by Airbus' strong-selling A320neo jet family, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The update of Pratt's GTF engine will boost fuel efficiency by 1% and deliver 4% higher thrust when it starts to roll out in 2024. 
Pratt, owned by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp, is banking on the combination of improvements to help win orders, with the higher thrust an advantage for Airbus' long-range narrow-body jet, the A321XLR. The XLR is expected to enter service in 2023. 
The 1% improvement is a slender increase, but airlines are eager for any savings at a time of stressed balance sheets and oil prices, which had been creeping up until the recent spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
The first update of the GTF engine since its introduction in 2016 is expected to be announced by Pratt on Thursday at a media event. 
Pratt declined comment on the update, which already has been quietly marketed to certain airlines, said the sources, who spoke anonymously to discuss the matter ahead of the event. 
Pratt faces rival CFM International, co-owned by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA, and U.S.-based  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), whose engines power almost 60% of the A320 program's ordered jets.
The upgrade comes as airlines are under pressure to slash emissions with engine makers eying longer-term advances like hybrid-electric propulsion to improve fuel efficiency.
CFM has unveiled plans to test-build an open-bladed jet engine able to reduce fuel use and emissions by 20%. The ""RISE"" engine, could enter service by the mid-2030s.
Single-aisle jets like the A320 and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX had been benefiting from a rebound in domestic traffic, which plunged in 2020 due to the pandemic. But new travel curbs introduced due to Omicron are raising questions over the sector's recovery.
It is not yet clear how effective the update will be in winning customers.

One of the sources said the improvements could help Pratt attract airlines during sales campaigns in regions that are hot or at altitude, where engines need more thrust, such as the Middle East. 
In November, low-cost carrier Air Arabia said it was in talks with Pratt and its current supplier CFM for 240-250 engines for 120 Airbus A320neo jets.

729,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 05:08PM ET</span>","San Francisco agency opposes Cruise robotaxi application, citing safety","By Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - San Francisco's public transit operator has challenged an application by Cruise to charge for robotaxi rides, saying on Wednesday promotional videos from the General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) unit show Cruise passengers illegally hopping in and out of vehicles in the middle of the street instead of at the curb.
The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) said in a 24-page letter that the recent videos from Cruise show the self-driving technology company is allowing unlawful behavior that also endangers people nearby and slows down buses, agency director Jeff Tumlin said. The agency also blasted Cruise's application for failing to plan service in low-income and minority neighborhoods or to accommodate wheelchairs. 
""Together, the Cruise Videos document 14 total stops for pick up or drop off of passengers; they provide evidence that not a single one of these stops complied with the requirements of the Vehicle Code and Transportation Code,"" the agency wrote. 
Cruise said it would respond to the concerns in a letter to the CPUC next Monday.
GM's Cruise, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo and other companies view San Francisco as a good testing ground for robotaxi services. With the federal government slow to produce rules on autonomous vehicles, states have stepped in to regulate. But local authorities in San Francisco and elsewhere have sought greater say over the new technologies, which include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Autopilot.
The SFMTA letter responds to a Cruise application last month to the California Public Utilities Commission, which has final say over whether companies can charge for rides. 
SFMTA's letter calls for denying Cruise's application unless it can prove its automated systems can recognize lawful on-street parking, parallel park and pull into parking lots.

The agency also criticized Cruise's initial deployment plan because it would ignore nearly all of the city's low income and disadvantaged communities and serve just 19% of San Francisco's Hispanic population and 24% of its Black population. The company also has yet to test wheelchair accessible trips, the agency wrote.
In addition, Cruise said it would avoid streets with light rail lines, yet it failed to acknowledge a long train route in its planned service area, SFMTA wrote.

730,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 05:06PM ET</span>","Facebook removes curbs on praise, searches for Kyle Rittenhouse","By Kanishka Singh
(Reuters) - Social media platform Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has removed restrictions on users praising or searching for the name of Kyle Rittenhouse after a jury acquitted the teenager of murder in the fatal shooting of two men during racial justice protests last year.
""After the verdict in Kenosha we rolled back the restrictions we had in place that limited search results from returning content related to key terms including Kyle Rittenhouse,"" a spokesperson for Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
""While we will still remove content that celebrates the death of the individuals killed in Kenosha, we will no longer remove content containing praise or support of Rittenhouse,"" the spokesperson said.
Last month, a jury acquitted Rittenhouse of murder in the fatal shooting of the two men in a decision that reignited fierce debate about gun rights and the boundaries of self defense in the United States.
Jurors found Rittenhouse, 18, not guilty on all charges: two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety in protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on Aug. 25, 2020 in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Rittenhouse shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and fired a bullet that tore a chunk off the arm of Gaige Grosskreutz, 28. Rittenhouse claimed self defense.

Last year, Facebook designated the killings a mass shooting and pledged to remove content praising Rittenhouse, saying such content violated their policies and would be taken off their platform.
The prosecution had portrayed Rittenhouse as a reckless vigilante who provoked the violent encounters and showed no remorse for the men he shot with his AR-15-style rifle. The defense argued that Rittenhouse had been repeatedly attacked and had shot the men in fear for his life.

731,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 05:02PM ET</span>",ViacomCBS's Shari Redstone says media company will focus on organic growth,"By Dawn Chmielewski
(Reuters) - ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc Chair Shari Redstone, who in the past has hinted at more deals to bulk up the media empire, said on Wednesday the company will focus on organic growth and seek global expansion opportunities.
In an interview during the Reuters Next conference, she said the company remained open to “always look at opportunities out there,” but had no immediate urge to merge.
ViacomCBS, with its $20.1 billion market valuation, is one-tenth the size of the Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. As media conglomerates have raced to bulk up to amass content for subscriptions and advertising-supported streaming video services, the company’s relatively smaller scale has spurred speculation that Redstone would seek another deal.
“I think our growth trajectory is actually pretty high at this point in time,” Redstone said. “Our ability to grow both domestically and internationally is well on its way.”
Redstone said ViacomCBS’s collection of traditional media assets -- its CBS broadcast network, its cable networks, including Comedy Central and MTV -- provides an opportunity for the company to retain its core audience even as it reaches younger cord-cutters via its streaming service, Paramount+. The company’s strength, she said, lies in its content, evoking her late father Sumner Redstone’s famous line about content as “king.”
As Paramount+ emerges as a central focus for the company, Redstone said ViacomCBS no longer views itself as an “arms dealer,” selling movies and television shows to other streaming services. Instead, it is focusing its resources in-house. So while its hit Paramount Network TV show ""Yellowstone"" might be streaming on NBCUniversal's Peacock, its spinoff, ""1883,"" will play on Paramount+.
“There’s a definite shift in the company now that we are creating content for our platform,” Redstone said.

Redstone, who through National Amusements operates movie theaters, defended ViacomCBS’s strategy of releasing films simultaneously in theaters and at home. She called it a “false narrative” that such a day-and-date release strategy is harmful to box office, citing the success of “Paw Patrol: The Movie.”
“We were able to do a marketing campaign greater than any campaign we ever could have done had it been a single release in theaters,” Redstone said. “As a result of that, we actually tripled, from a Paramount standpoint, the box office that we expected to do and, at the same time, brought on hundreds of thousands of subscribers to … Paramount+.”

733,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 04:59PM ET</span>","As Freeport converts mining trucks to green power, costs unclear","By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - Copper mining giant Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc is converting its fleet of diesel trucks and other machinery to electric or hydrogen power, a transition required to fight climate change even though the costs are not yet known, Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said in an interview at the Reuters Next conference. 
The mining industry is grappling with its paradoxical role as supplier of copper, lithium and other building blocks for renewable technologies even as operations contribute to global warming. 
Freeport, which operates mines in the Americas and Indonesia, has roughly 600 haul trucks - some of which move more than 400 tonnes (881,850 pounds) of dirt per load - and numerous other pieces of equipment. 
To power those machines, Freeport bought 180 million gallons of diesel last year, according to regulatory filings, contributing to its so-called scope one (direct) emissions.
""We have to make investments to reduce carbon emissions,"" Adkerson said in the interview released Wednesday. ""We're going to do that. It's going to cost some money.""
The Phoenix, Arizona-based company is testing electric- and hydrogen-powered trucks and is studying other fuel sources for its coal-fired powered power plant in Indonesia, where it runs the world's second-largest copper mine. 
Freeport is also participating in the Charge on Innovation Challenge with Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Ltd, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) Ltd and others to help better electrify mine sites.
It joined hydrogen fuel consortiums in South America and next year plans trial runs of diesel-electric trucks from Komatsu (OTC:KMTUY) Ltd and  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). 
Energy accounts for roughly 20% of Freeport's annual operational costs, though it is not clear yet how that could change once the entire fleet is converted, the company said.
""There will be an impact on supply as a result of converting all of this,"" said Adkerson. ""There are more questions than answers right now.""
But Adkerson, who has been CEO since 2003, said it was ""absolutely necessary"" for Freeport to curtail emissions. He cited extreme weather caused by global warming and the incongruity of copper mining creating emissions while the metal is needed for green energy solutions
""The world is going to need copper, and yet copper mining has emissions,"" he said. 
The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), an industry trade group chaired by Adkerson, set a goal https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/worlds-largest-miners-pledge-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050-2021-10-05 in October for all members - including Freeport - of net zero direct and indirect carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner, in part by retiring diesel-powered equipment.
Freeport is also studying ways to re-process waste rock at its mine sites to extract an estimated 10 billion pounds or more of copper. Adkerson said it is too soon to say how much copper could eventually be produced using this method, but added: ""Our technical team is really excited about it."" 
In Spain, Freeport is recycling electronic scrap waste at one of its smelters. The operation is not expected to become a major focus for the company, which prefers to focus on operating large mines, Adkerson said.

""That (copper) scrap will be needed because of what I believe is the coming real scarcity of copper,"" he said. ""We just don't see (recycling) as a business opportunity for Freeport.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) asked a U.S. court on Wednesday to dismiss and not allow the refiling of an antitrust lawsuit by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which urges a court to demand that the company sell two big subsidiaries.
In its court filing, Facebook argued that the FTC had ""no plausible factual support"" for its claim that the company has the market clout to push up prices in the social network market. The social media giant also said the FTC failed to ""plausibly establish"" that Facebook acted illegally to protect a monopoly.
Facebook also pressed again for FTC Chair Lina Khan to be recused from the matter, arguing that her participation in a vote to approve the lawsuit was improper because of her criticism of the company before she joined the agency.
The FTC's high-profile case against Facebook represents one of the biggest challenges the government has brought against a tech company in decades, and is being closely watched as Washington aims to tackle Big Tech's extensive market power.
The FTC had originally sued Facebook during the Trump administration, and its complaint was rejected by the court. It filed an amended complaint in August, adding more detail on the accusation the social media company crushed or bought rivals and once again asking a judge to force the company to sell photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp.

The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the 26-page filing.
The case is being tried by Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Given positive seasonality and strong earnings growth, this dip should be bought. Investors should consider buying the following 3 tech stocks: Paycom (NYSE:PAYC), Diodes (NASDAQ:DIOD), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Overall, 2021 has been a very strong year for the stock market with the S&P 500 up 22% entering the last month of the year. Recently, the index has encountered a heavy bout of selling and is down nearly 3% from last Monday’s all-time high of 4,743.8.
A major reason for this dip is the omicron-variant of the coronavirus which has been identified in many countries. This variant is especially concerning as it seems to be more contagious than previous variants, and there are some reports that it may evade antibodies from existing vaccines. It’s also coming amid a backdrop of rising coronavirus cases which isn’t too surprising given its tendency to spread more in winter months and that travel volumes are currently running at 90% of 2019 levels.
Another catalyst was Fed Chair Powell’s remarks at Tuesday’s Congressional testimony in which he said that he would no longer describe the rise in inflation as being “transitory”. This caused a sharp selloff in the stock market and caused major averages to close below Friday’s lows.

And, e-commerce stocks may struggle next year as analysts are more pessimistic about the consumer spending outlook. Therefore, we think investors are better off avoiding e-commerce stocks Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY).According to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics' Digital Economy Index, Black Friday online sales dipped to $8.9 billion for the first time ever. The reason is that the retailers had started offering deals earlier in October, and strategic shoppers grabbed those opportunities for the best deals. Furthermore, the threat of supply chain disruptions and delivery delays made shopaholics take advantage of the early discounts.
Although retailers had a rough phase last year due to the pandemic, decrease in consumer spending, and supply chain bottlenecks, they rebuilt themselves and generated better revenues this year due to increased in-store traffic and online sales. However, since the early attractive deals offered by retailers changed the shopping patterns and led to a decline in Black Friday's online sales, it would be wise to avoid fundamentally weak retail stocks.

Read on.HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) in Palo Alto, Calif., provides personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions, and services worldwide. HPQ shares have gained 60.9% in price over the past year and 43.5% year-to-date to close yesterday’s trading session at $35.28. The stock is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
The computer hardware giant posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and a robust outlook for the year, and its stock rose in price on Nov. 24 on the news the company’s net revenue increased 9.3% year-over-year to $16.68 billion, which was $1.25 billion more than the consensus expectation. The revenue increase can be attributed mainly to the company’s growth in the PC business and higher average selling prices. According to UBS analyst David Vogt, average selling prices were up more than 6% sequentially for HPQ in the quarter. Its non-GAAP net earnings came in at $1.08 billion, indicating an increase of 28.9% year-over-year, while its EPS was $0.94, beating the Street estimate by 6.8%.
The demand for HPQ’s PC is growing rapidly and is outpacing supply. HP CEO Enrique Lores expects robust demand ahead for both PCs and printers as offices reopen. Moreover, the company ended the quarter with a higher-than-normal order backlog, particularly in PCs. As more workers return to office and enterprise technology spending gears up, demand should increase, eventually generating revenues. “We believe the handoff to enterprise strength as workers return to the office in a hybrid manner will boost commercial PC demands for multiple quarters,” said Citi analyst Jim Suva. For its fiscal year 2022, HPQ expects its non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.07 - $4.27 and to generate free cash flow of at least $4.50 billion.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Embattled gambling group Suncity Group Holdings has closed all of its VIP gaming rooms in Macau, the world's largest gambling hub, after the company's CEO was arrested, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.
The shutting of the company's VIP rooms will result in a cut of around a third of its Macau headcount, said one of the sources, a senior casino executive who declined to be identified as the closure has not been publicly announced. 
Suncity Group did not respond to a request for comment. Its shares were suspended from trade on Wednesday, the second time in three days, pending what it said was the release of an announcement related to its VIP business.
Late on Wednesday, Suncity Group announced in a statement that CEO Alvin Chau had resigned from all his positions in the company. The statement also said the company had applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to resume trading on Thursday. 
The news comes amid a broad investigation into Chau, who was arrested on Sunday over alleged links to cross-border gambling and money laundering. Chau is also the founder of Macau's biggest junket operator which brings in high rollers to play at casinos.
Reuters efforts to contact Chau or his lawyer have been unsuccessful. Suncity Group's stock plunged 48% on Tuesday to a record low, valuing it at HK$880 million ($113 million).
Marking a watershed development for the sector, authorities are adopting a zero-tolerance approach to the promotion of gambling in mainland China where it is illegal and are seeking to rein in the flow of Chinese gambling-related funds into Macau and other gaming hubs - outflows that China last year deemed a national security risk.
The closure of Suncity's gaming rooms has only exacerbated pain for Macau-listed casino stocks which have tumbled this week on the expected loss of business from Chau's junket business which is estimated to account for around a quarter of Macau's gaming revenues.
Shares in  Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF) Ltd, which analysts say is the casino operator most reliant on Suncity's gaming rooms, have been particularly hard hit, sliding 8% on Wednesday to bring this week's losses to 18%. 
Declines for U.S. parent Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) Ltd have been milder with its shares having declined 5% over Monday and Tuesday.
Outside Macau, Bloomberry Resorts Corp, a popular casino destination for Chinese gamblers in the Philippines, tumbled 10% on Wednesday.
Macau authorities have accused Chau and 10 others of using the former Portuguese colony as a base for an illegal ""live web betting platform"" in the Philippines that attracted mainland Chinese gamblers.
A warrant for Chau's arrest was also issued on Friday by the mainland Chinese city of Wenzhou, accusing him of forming a junket agent network that helps citizens engage in gambling activities and setting up a company that helps gamblers make cross-border fund transfers.
""The writing was on the wall already. But nothing was done in Macau until the Wenzhou police talked about it,"" the executive said.
While Chau's junket operations, also called Suncity, are not part of the listed Suncity Group, they have previously been singled out by mainland China's state-run media, which said they harmed China's social order.
A 2019 article by the Economic Information Daily, a unit of China's state news agency Xinhua, alleged that the annual amount of online betting on websites run by Suncity was more than 1 trillion yuan ($155 billion). Suncity has also not responded to a request for comment on that estimate.
One of the sources told Reuters that Suncity operated VIP rooms in properties owned by all six of Macau's licensed casino operators - Wynn Macau, Sands China (OTC:SCHYY), MGM China (OTC:MCHVY), SJM Holdings (OTC:SJMHF), Melco Resorts and Galaxy Entertainment. 
In 2019, Suncity operated up to 17 VIP gaming rooms in Macau and accounted for nearly half of the gambling hub's VIP market, the executive added. 
MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International said Suncity's operations were suspended at the casino company's properties and that it was seeing no dramatic impact from the action. Shares of MGM were down 2.5% in afternoon trade.
Melco Resorts said in an email to Reuters that Suncity had ceased operations at its City of Dreams and Studio City resorts. 

Wynn said in a statement the Suncity junket rooms at Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace suspended operations at midnight on Dec. 1.
The other casino operators have not responded to requests for comment.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed lower Wednesday, after cutting its intraday gains as the U.S. confirmed its first case of the new Omicron Covid-19 strain, triggering a fresh wave of uncertainty across on Wall Street.  
The S&P 500 fell 1.2%, and had been more than 1% higher intraday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, or 462 points, and the Nasdaq slipped 1.8%.
U.S. health officials confirmed Wednesday that the first case of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was identified in California. 
The individual – who returned from South Africa on Nov. 22 and tested positive on Nov. 29 – was “fully vaccinated and experienced mild symptoms, which are improving at this point,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser.
The news triggered a bout of uncertainty, with the CBOE Volatility Index, or so-called fear index, surging 16%, triggering a wave of selling in the broader market and overshadowed better-than-expected labor market data.      
Private payrolls grew by 534,000 in November, less than the 570,000 in October, but ahead of expectations for 525,000.
The better-than-expected jobs data comes just days ahead of the monthly nonfarm payrolls due Friday, and strengthened expectations for the Federal Reserve to step up the pace of bond tapering.
In his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill, Fed Chair Jerome Powell continued to reiterate that speeding up the taper of bond purchases would be on the agenda at the December meeting, but added that there was no reason for faster taper to be disruptive to markets.
In sign of skittish investor sentiment, utilities, a typically defensive corner of the market, was the only sector to close in the green.
AES Corporation (NYSE:AES),  Alliant Energy  (NASDAQ:LNT), WEC Energy (NYSE:WEC) were among the biggest gainers.
Health care stocks were pushed higher by a more than 9% surge in Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) after the pharmaceutical company reported a positive update from its mid-stage focal glomerular sclerosis study.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), meanwhile, slumped more than 11% after losing an appeal against a court ruling on patents – used in the making of its Covid-19 vaccine – held by Arbutus Biopharma (NASDAQ:ABUS). Arbutus surged 44%, but was well off its session highs. 
In energy,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) was in focus after the oil major forecast a doubling of earnings and cash flow by 2027 amid plans to lower capital expenditure.
In tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) erased its intraday gains as the broader market reversed. The tech giant was up more than 1% intraday as some on Wall Street highlighted improving signs of improving supply chain pressures that could help the tech maker roll out its latest line of iPhones.
Citing signs of improved wait times for iPhones, UBS forecasts Apple to sell 80 million iPhones in the December quarter, compared with 82 million last year.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), meanwhile, fell more than 2% even as Cathie Wood revealed that ARK purchased 1.1 million shares of the social media company on Tuesday, amid optimism about the future of the company under the leadership of new Chief Executive Parag Agrawal."
746,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 03:57PM ET</span>",GM boosts profit outlook as supply chain troubles ease,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) expects full year adjusted pre-tax profits will reach about $14 billion, higher than the previous forecast, the automaker's Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said during a presentation.
GM had previously forecast full-year adjusted pre-tax profits at $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion. GM shares were up more than 2.5% in mid-afternoon trading following Jacobson's statement.
GM's financial performance is benefiting from strong consumer demand, high prices for new vehicles and more stability in supplies of semiconductors, Jacobson said.
However, GM's vehicle production and inventories won't get back to normal until late 2022, Jacobson cautioned.
Tight inventories support higher prices, but GM and its rivals are still working to find a balance between stocking too many vehicles, as in the past, and too few for a U.S. market where many consumers still buy what is on a dealer lot.
GM is also wrestling with rising costs for commodities used in its vehicles. 
""We see inflation everywhere,"" Jacobson said.
So far, Jacobson said the company is not seeing much impact from the new Omicron coronavirus variant.
""We are continuing with the protocols that we have put in place, that have worked,"" Jacobson said.
During an online talk with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) auto industry analyst Dan Levy, Jacobson said GM will be aggressive in investing in electric vehicles and other technology as it tries to catch up with electric vehicle market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and compete with rivals such as Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co .
""We have pulled forward about 12 EVs from the original plans a year and a half ago,"" he said.
Jacobson said he would rather have GM build a battery plant that sits idle for two or three years than have the company be caught short without enough battery capacity. Jacobson said he has told other GM executives he will support spending to accelerate EV programs or invest in promising technology.
""There’s money in the account and the checkbook is open,"" Jacobson said. ""You have to put on the memo line what you are going to use it for.""
That is a sharp contrast with the austerity GM imposed in early 2020 when the pandemic forced an almost total halt to North American production.

Despite a strong recovery from the pandemic shock, and aggressive plans to double revenue by 2030, GM's $84 billion market value remains a fraction of Tesla's $1 trillion value and also trails newly-public, and much smaller, electric truck and van maker Rivian.
""We have some clear advantages over startups,"" Jacobson said. ""Not every startup is Tesla.""

Investing.com -- Stocks got off to a flying start on Wednesday but turned sharply negative late in the session after U.S. public health officials announced they had found the first confirmed case of the Covid-19 Omicron variant.
The case, found in California, was described as mild but symptomatic. The person is fully vaccinated and said to be isolating and improving. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the person had recently returned to the U.S. from South Africa.
U.S. health officials stressed that there was still a need to wait for further data to determine how transmissible and how effective the new strain is at evading current vaccines.     
On the jobs front, private payrolls rose 534,000 in November, according to ADP. That was less than October but more than expected. The report comes just a couple of days before the much anticipated government jobs report on Friday. 
In his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill, Fed Chair Jerome Powell repeated what he said Tuesday: Speeding up the taper of bond purchases would be on the central bank’s agenda at the December meeting, but he added that there was no reason for faster taper to be disruptive to markets.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. General Motors
General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) now expects full year adjusted pre-tax profits will reach about $14 billion, higher than the $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion previously forecast. The automaker, which is making a pivot to electric vehicles, announced a joint venture on Wednesday with South Korea’s  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) Chemical to build a factory in North America to process critical battery materials for GM's Ultium electric vehicle platform. 
The factory will process Cathode Active Material (CAM), a key battery material that represents about 40% of the cost of a battery cell — a move from GM to take control of its supply chain and minimize disruptions after recent issues that saw a shortage of semiconductor chips.
2. OPEC meeting
Crude oil futures pared gains on Wednesday, held down by growing concerns about travel amid a new variant of Covid-19 that is spreading around the globe. On Thursday the cartel of major oil producing nations will meet to decide on production for January, after agreeing they would only gradually add supply to the market. The Biden administration could adjust the timing of its planned release of strategic reserves of oil if global energy prices drop substantially, U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk told Reuters on Wednesday.
3. Beige book
The U.S. economy continued to come under pressure from supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and inflation but businesses were able to hike prices to offset price pressures amid strong consumer demand, according to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book released Wednesday.
""Economic activity grew at a modest to moderate pace in most Federal Reserve Districts during October and early November, ""the Fed said in its Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through Nov. 23.  ""[G]rowth was constrained by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.""

(Reuters) - Workers at Cargill Inc's beef-processing plant in High River, Alberta, one of Canada's largest, will vote on a new company offer backed by union negotiators, just days before a potential strike, the company said on Wednesday.
The plant processes up to 4,500 head of cattle per day, or 35% of Canada's beef-processing capacity. United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Union Local 401 has said the plant's roughly 2,000 workers will strike on Monday unless a deal is in place.
After the two sides held talks on Tuesday, UFCW's bargaining committee agreed to recommend the new offer to its members, Cargill spokesman Daniel Sullivan said. The vote will take place Thursday through Saturday.
A spokesman for UFCW said he would comment later in the day.
Workers have raised safety concerns. COVID-19 hit the High River plant hard in 2020, sickening more than 900 workers. The outbreak, which forced Cargill to temporarily close the plant, is linked to three deaths. 
Outbreaks have hit other North American meat plants, where employees often work in close quarters. 
Cargill's offer includes a wage increase, improved health benefits and retroactive pay, Sullivan said, without providing details.
""We remain optimistic we can reach a deal before the strike deadline,"" Sullivan said in an email.
Workers voted 98% last week against Cargill's previous offer. UFCW had recommended rejection.
A plant shutdown would quickly ripple through North America's beef and cattle supply chain.

More slaughter-ready cattle would have to stay longer at feedlots, incurring extra expense for those farmers, said Brian Perillat, senior analyst at CanFax. 
U.S. retail ground beef prices in October were up 16% from a year earlier at an average of about $4.87 a pound, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chair Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, said on Wednesday he will not seek re-election in 2022.
DeFazio, who has served in the House of Representatives since 1986, is the latest senior Democrat in Congress to announce a decision to not seek re-election, coming at a time when many expect Republicans may retake control of the House in the November 2022 midterm elections.
""For 36 years I have fought corporate greed and special interests,"" the 74-year-old DeFazio, who is from Oregon, said in a statement. ""It’s time for me to pass the baton to the next generation so I can focus on my health and well-being."" 
DeFazio helped lead the effort to dramatically boost infrastructure spending and a comprehensive investigation into the safety of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX.
DeFazio has been involved in key infrastructure issues. He also helped lead the effort to provide U.S. airlines with emergency government assistance after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and pressed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to get tough on passenger misbehavior.
The president of the Association of Flight Attendants, Sara Nelson, said DeFazio had been a champion for airline workers on issues ""from fines and penalties for disruptive passengers and sexual assault, to evacuation standards and staffing requirements to stopping the spraying of poisonous pesticides in the cabin to fighting for child restraint seats for our youngest passengers.""
She noted DeFazio's key role in the airline industry winning $54 billion in COVID-19 payroll assistance. ""We owe our jobs and a functioning airline industry to Peter DeFazio,"" Nelson said.

DeFazio helped win reforms of the FAA's certification of new airplanes and the delegation of some responsibilities to manufacturers after two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes in five months killed 346 people. He's continued to press the FAA on its oversight of Boeing.
He has also focused on efforts to combat climate change, especially through cutting emissions from the transportation sector and been a advocate for transit and rail.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will issue new guidance aimed at curbing banks' reliance on fees from overdraft and non-sufficient funds (NSF) facilities that lenders impose on consumers, its top official said on Wednesday.
Rohit Chopra added that he has also tasked the regulator's bank examiners with prioritizing lenders that over-rely on such fees, of which banks netted $69 billion in the third quarter.
The agency also hopes that impending data-sharing rule changes aimed at boosting competition among lenders will make it easier for consumers to dump banks that overcharge them. 
""The (consumer watchdog) is considering a range of regulatory interventions to help restore meaningful competition in this part of the checking market, rather than allowing large institutions to rely on overdraft and non-sufficient revenue fees forever,"" Chopra said.
Chopra pointed out that a ""blockbuster"" third quarter far outstripped the $15 billion netted in 2019.
Also on Wednesday,  Capital One  Financial (NYSE:COF) said it would eliminate all overdraft and NSF fees for consumers, ending a practice that drew the ire of U.S. lawmakers at a Senate hearing earlier this year.
Customers will have to choose if they want to opt for the free overdraft protection service, Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank said in a memo, and have to show a pattern of steady deposits to be eligible for it.
""Many in the market are anticipating that other large banks will also call it quits (on overdraft fees). The CFPB is not holding out hope that this will happen quickly,"" Chopra added. 

Industry groups criticized any potential move by the CFPB to introduce ""stifling"" rules that may hinder competition and innovation that benefit American consumers.
""Outside of overdraft, few options remain for consumers to meet their short-term liquidity needs within the well-regulated, well-supervised banking system,"" said Richard Hunt, who leads the Washington-based Consumer Bankers Association.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 02:31PM ET</span>","Global airlines prepare for Omicron volatility, agility will be key","By Jamie Freed and Rajesh Kumar Singh
SYDNEY/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Global airlines are bracing for more volatility due to the Omicron coronavirus variant that could force them to juggle schedules and destinations at short notice and rely more on domestic markets where possible, analysts say.
Many travellers have already booked trips for the Christmas period, a peak season for airlines, but since news of the variant last week, there are growing industry concerns over a pause in future bookings and further delays to the already slow recovery in business travel.
On Wednesday, United Airlines Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said the new variant will have a near-term impact on bookings. 
Fitch Ratings has lowered its global passenger traffic forecasts for 2021 and 2022, saying the emergence of new variants like Omicron highlight the likelihood that conditions would remain volatile for airlines.
""It feels a little bit like we are back to where we were a year ago and that's not a great prospect for the industry and beyond,"" Deirdre Fulton, a partner at consultancy MIDAS Aviation, said at an industry webinar.
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) called for a ""more measured and evidence-based"" response, saying ""the costs of significantly restricted global air mobility affect all countries"".
Airlines have been blaming a lack of consistent and stable health protocols as well as border restrictions for depressed international travel demand.
New protocols in the wake of the Omicron variant are expected to add to their headache. 
The United States https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-urges-americans-avoid-travel-niger-poland-over-covid-19-2021-11-30, for example, is moving to require that all air travellers entering the country show a negative COVID-19 test performed within one day of departure.
All non-EU travellers to mainland France, where the Omicron variant has not been detected yet, will have to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test, regardless of their vaccination status, a government spokesman said. Ireland and Portugal are also demanding that travellers produce a negative test.
Airlines are currently using a range of apps to verify test results. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said it would comply with Washington's directives, but did not say if the new testing requirement would need the carrier to make any changes to its verification app.
IMPACT TO VARY BY REGION
Omicron's impact will vary by country and region due to each government's response and the diverse nature of global airlines, as well as their business models. 
Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings on Wednesday suspended new reservations for international flights arriving into Japan until the end of December as the country tightens border controls.
Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY), which lacks a domestic market and is operating at only 10% of pre-pandemic capacity, said it was too early to assess Omicron's impact on demand.
Airlines in countries with large, strong domestic markets like the United States, China and Russia are better shielded from the greater uncertainties of international travel.
An analysis by UBS shows U.S. carriers have not yet changed their scheduled capacity, which is running at 87% of 2019 levels in December and is expected to reach 92% of pre-COVID capacity in January.
United Airlines is launching its Newark-Cape Town route on Wednesday and Delta Air is expecting strong bookings over the Christmas period.
""In the past year, each new variant has brought a decline in bookings, but then an increase once the surge dissipates. We expect the same pattern to emerge,"" said Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen and Co.
Travel booking website Kayak said international travel searches from the United States were down only 5% on Sunday - a stark contrast to a 26% fall in searches from Britain, which had tightened testing requirements for arrivals.
Major European airlines are far more dependent on international travel than their U.S. counterparts, placing them more at risk of fallout from the Omicron variant.
In Asia, countries like Australia, Japan, Singapore and Thailand had only begun to cautiously lift border restrictions in recent weeks and passenger numbers remained at fractions of pre-pandemic levels before the Omicron variant was discovered.

John Grant, chief analyst at travel data firm OAG, said moves by Japan and Australia to delay entry to some foreigners due to Omicron were ""sad and frustrating"" but the proportionate impact on travel was ""relatively insignificant.""
Airlines globally have been more agile about quickly adjusting their schedules and destinations during the pandemic and that is expected to continue, he said.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Treasury is discussing with European Union authorities the possibility of extending by more than two years a 2021 deadline to cut Rome's 64% stake in ailing bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), two sources told Reuters.
Under the terms of a 5.4 billion euro ($6.12 billion) state bailout agreed with Brussels in 2017, Italy was supposed to have a deal in place by the end of this year to re-privatise MPS, but this has not proved possible.
Talks to sell the Tuscan lender to the country's No.2 bank UniCredit collapsed in October, leaving the Treasury chasing alternative options.
Rome expects to win Brussels' approval for a lengthy extension of the deadline to return MPS to private hands. This will give the government time to boost the bank's profitability and attract new investors, the sources said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The extension being sought will be ""more than two years,"" one of the sources said. This was confirmed by a second source familiar with the matter.
Shares in MPS jumped almost 17% on Wednesday, with traders saying the Treasury-led restructuring could make the lender more appealing for a potential partner.
In a further boost on Wednesday, ratings agency Fitch removed a negative rating watch on the bank.
Both sources said the Treasury would make every effort to keep the new deadline confidential, in order to avoid the risk that potential buyers wait until it is looming to table an offer when the government is under pressure.
However, the extension will largely cover the timeline of MPS' new industrial plan ending in 2025, provided the EU competition authorities authorise it.
The Treasury firstly needs to address the bank's capital requirements, which MPS has put at 2.5 billion euros. 
Reuters reported in October that the cash call could total 3.5 billion - to cover layoff costs and other expenses - or more than 3.5 times the bank's current market value.
Rome will also implement some of the measures that were offered to UniCredit as part of a stand-alone solution for MPS, the sources said.

The plan will clear the bank of its residual problem debts, which will go to state-owned bad loan manager AMCO, while state agency Fintecna will take on risks from MPS' pending lawsuits.

The lawsuit filed in 2018 had stated that IAC/InterActiveCorp (NASDAQ:IAC) and subsidiary Match deliberately prevented Tinder founders Sean Rad, Justin Mateen and Jonathan Badeen from cashing in stock options they could exercise and sell to IAC.
The plaintiffs were given stock options in Tinder as part of their compensation in 2014, but because Tinder is a private company they were not able to exercise their options and then sell stock on the open market.
Instead, they were allowed to exercise their options and sell only to IAC and Match on specific dates, on which the stock options would be independently valued.
However, IAC and Match then merged Tinder into Match, which Tinder's board of directors was not aware of and did not consent, while canceling the future dates for exercising options, according to the lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs in 2018.

MILAN (Reuters) -UniCredit is considering cutting around 3,000 jobs through voluntary departures under a new strategic plan the Italian lender is due to present on Dec. 9, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 
The majority of the job cuts will affect corporate centres, the sources said, adding the figure was still tentative because the bank would start negotiations with unions only after unveiling the plan.
UniCredit's new Italy head Niccolo Ubertalli told unions at a recent meeting the bank would redeploy staff towards branches after the domestic network was badly hit by cuts in the past few years, a third source separately said.
UniCredit, which in 2020 lost the title of Italy's No.1 bank to Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) when the rival took over mid-tier player UBI, hired in April investment banker Andrea Orcel as its new CEO to replace Jean Pierre Mustier.
Intesa this month agreed with unions 2,000 early departures and 1,100 new hires https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/intesa-signs-accord-with-unions-2000-early-staff-exits-1100-new-hires-2021-11-16 ahead of a new business plan due in February.
UniCredit, which operates in 13 markets including Germany, Austria and eastern Europe, employs 87,102 staff globally, of which around 36,000 are in Italy. The cuts would amount to 3.4% of UniCredit's overall workforce. 
In Italy, where a significant portion of the reductions would be concentrated given its relative weight for UniCredit, banks only lay off people on a voluntary basis and usually through costly early retirement schemes.
Italian banking unions aim to replace half of the people leaving with young hires in accords over job redundancies. 
UniCredit's previous plan, unveiled in December 2019 and due to run through 2023, had envisaged 8,000 job cuts, leading to 1.6 billion euros in restructuring charges.
Following negotiations with unions after the plan, UniCredit in April 2020 agreed with Italian unions https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-banks-unicredit-idUKKBN21K2WP 5,200 voluntary departures in the country, partly offset by 2,600 new hires.

When he was hired in 2016 to bring UniCredit back from the brink, Mustier slashed 14,000 jobs under his first four-year plan.
Separately on Tuesday, sources said UniCredit was discussing an extension over the medium term of an option to take full control of a joint venture with France's CNP Assurances.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Stellantis NV Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said external pressure on automakers to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles potentially threatens jobs and vehicle quality as producers struggle to manage the higher costs of building EVs. 
Governments and investors want car manufacturers to speed up the transition to electric vehicles, but the costs are ""beyond the limits"" of what the auto industry can sustain, Tavares said in an interview at the Reuters Next conference released Wednesday. 
""What has been decided is to impose on the automotive industry electrification that brings 50% additional costs against a conventional vehicle,"" he said.
""There is no way we can transfer 50% of additional costs to the final consumer because most parts of the middle class will not be able to pay.""
Automakers could charge higher prices and sell fewer cars, or accept lower profit margins, Tavares said. Those paths both lead to cutbacks. Union leaders in Europe https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/transition-electric-cars-threatens-60000-jobs-italy-fim-cisl-union-2021-11-19 and North America https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/united-auto-workers-presses-gm-ford-unionizing-battery-plants-2021-04-28 have warned tens of thousands of jobs could be lost.
Automakers need time for testing and ensuring that new technology will work, Tavares said. Pushing to speed that process up ""is just going to be counter productive. It will lead to quality problems. It will lead to all sorts of problems,"" he said.
Tavares said Stellantis is aiming to avoid cuts by boosting productivity at a pace far faster than industry norm.
""Over the next five years we have to digest 10% productivity a year ... in an industry which is used to delivering 2 to 3% productivity"" improvement, he said.
""The future will tell us who is going to be able to digest this, and who will fail,"" Tavares said. ""We are putting the industry on the limits.""
Electric vehicle costs are expected to fall, and analysts project that battery electric vehicles and combustion vehicles could reach cost parity during the second half of this decade.
Like other automakers that earn profits from combustion vehicles, Stellantis is under pressure from electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and other pure electric vehicle startups such as Rivian. 
The electric vehicle companies are far smaller in terms of vehicle sales and employment. But investors have given Tesla and Rivian higher market valuations than the owner of the Jeep SUV brand or the highly profitable Ram pickup truck franchise.
That investor pressure is compounded by government policies aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union, California and other jurisdictions have set goals to end sales of combustion vehicles by 2035. The United Kingdom has set 2030 as the deadline for going all-electric.
Tavares said governments should shift the focus of climate policy toward cleaning up the energy sector and developing electric-vehicle charging infrastructure.
Stellantis, created in 2021 with the merger of French automaker  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) and Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler NV, is on track to deliver 5 billion euros in cost reduction through streamlining its operations, Tavares said.
Tavares has accelerated Stellantis' electric vehicle development, committing 30 billion euros through 2025 to developing new electric vehicle architectures, building battery plants and investing in raw materials and new technology.
On Tuesday, Stellantis said it had invested in solid-state battery startup Factorial alongside German automaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn).

""We can invest more and go deeper in the value chain,"" Tavares said. ""There may be other (investments) in the near future.""

Investing.com —  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares fell Wednesday after the company lost an appeal on a patent ruling involving Arbutus Biopharma Corp (NASDAQ:ABUS). 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Appeals Board and Patent Trial decisions regarding two Arbutus patents concerning drug-delivery technology. Accordingly, the court dismissed Moderna's appeal for ""lack of standing."" The decision, which upholds last year's ruling, means Moderna could now face a patent infringement lawsuit.
Moderna shares are down over 8.6%, while Arbutus shares have almost doubled, currently up 90%.
One of the two patents involved is the 435 patent, which is shown to ""stable nucleic acid-lipid particles comprising a nucleic acid, methods of making SNALP, and methods of delivering and/or administering the SNALP.""
Moderna has previously said that if the claims were upheld, Arbutus could use a lawsuit to demand royalties for the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine."

(Reuters) -Moderna Inc could face a patent infringement lawsuit over its COVID-19 vaccine after a federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected its challenge to patents belonging to Arbutus Biopharma (NASDAQ:ABUS) Corp.
The Federal Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals let stand an administrative panel's findings that Arbutus' patents, which may cover technology used in the vaccines, are not obvious in light of previously known science and so are valid.
Arbutus shares were up $1.63, or 51% higher, at $4.83.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares fell almost 9% to $321.15.
Moderna and Arbutus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Moderna previously said in court filings that it believes Arbutus could bring a lawsuit demanding royalties from its COVID-19 vaccine if the patents are upheld.
The company last month forecast 2021 sales of between $15 billion and $18 billion, and 2022 sales of between $17 billion and $22 billion, for its COVID-19 vaccine.

Both patents in question involve the so-called lipid nanoparticles that enclose the genetic material, known as messenger RNA (mRNA), in the vaccine. The technology could prove useful in developing future mRNA-based vaccines against other illnesses as well.
Moderna initially challenged the patents before the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, part of the federal patent office. The board agreed with Moderna that some portions of one of the patents were invalid but otherwise sided with Arbutus, and the Federal Circuit upheld its findings.

KKR made a 10.8 billion euro ($12.2 billion) offer for TIM last month, just before a boardroom row forced group CEO Luigi Gubitosi to step down following a clash with top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) after two profit warnings since July. 
Last week, TIM placed oversight of the group's strategic assets in the hands of Chairman Salvatore Rossi, setting up a special committee to study the KKR bid. 
Unions have expressed concerns over the future of TIM's 42,500 workers across Italy and have told the company they will not accept any reorganisation that puts jobs at risk, a document seen by Reuters shows.
""We want to be involved in any decision concerning an overhaul of the group,"" Riccardo Saccone of the SLC-Cgil union said, adding a strike at TIM could be called within 10 days.
TIM was not immediately available for comment.
Any takeover deal is conditional on support from TIM's board and the Italian government, as well as due diligence expected to last four weeks. 

TIM's fixed network is Italy's main telecoms infrastructure and Rome has said its response to KKR will hinge on plans for the network which it sees as strategic. State lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti is TIM's second-biggest shareholder.

Therefore, we think these stocks could be ideal picks to cash in on the industry's growth prospects. Read on.A persistent semiconductor chip supply shortage has hampered output in various industries—from automobiles to electronics. However, massive investments by governments and businesses to scale up production should help the semiconductor industry meet the growing demand. According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), global semiconductor sales for September 2021 were $48.3 billion, up 27.6% from September 2020 and 2.2% from August 2021.
In addition, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has urged the House of Representatives to adopt legislation supporting U.S. semiconductor chip manufacturing as soon as possible to avoid future supply disruptions and to catch up with the growing demands.
Keeping this backdrop and the long-term trends in mind, we believe fundamentally sound semiconductor stocks Amkor Technology Inc. (AMKR) and Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO) could be solid picks now. Though these stocks have witnessed significant price declines recently, we think they are well-positioned to gain substantially in the coming months.

However, not all stocks are well-positioned to grow in the crowded industry. So, we think popular SaaS stocks Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), and Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) are best avoided now, given their bleak growth prospects. Let’s discuss.The demand for cloud-based applications, which facilitate remote working, has grown significantly, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. And amid the rapid, ongoing, global digitization, the need for software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions is expected to be accelerated further. According to a Research and Market report, the global software-as-a-service (SaaS) market is expected to reach $436.90 billion in 2025, growing at a 12.5% CAGR.
However, as the SaaS industry grows, the risk of being exposed to cyber threats is a growing concern. Organizations are often subject to cyberattacks because they have crucial data on the cloud, which is under threat from malware and ransomware. Furthermore, the SaaS space also seems crowded, with several companies vying for a market share in the growing industry.
Against this backdrop, we think it could be wise to avoid fundamentally weak popular SaaS stocks Twilio Inc. (TWLO), Okta, Inc. (OKTA), and Fastly, Inc. (FSLY). Their prices appear to have gotten ahead of their intrinsic values and we think the companies have bleak growth prospects.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee voted on Wednesday to advance law professor and privacy advocate Alvaro Bedoya's nomination to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
The committee deadlocked 14-14 on the nomination but under rules it can proceed to the full Senate for a vote.
The committee separately voted to approve a new term for Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Jessica Rosenworcel.
On Wednesday, the committee also will consider the nomination of Gigi Sohn, a former senior aide to then FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, to an open seat on the FCC, which is currently divided 2-2 between Republicans and Democrats.
Bedoya, founding director of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy & Technology, is also a former chief counsel of the U.S. Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law. His nomination now goes to the full Senate.
Bedoya, who has called privacy ""a civil right,"" has been skeptical of widespread, untargeted use of facial recognition technology and has argued that the software often makes mistakes, particularly when searching for the faces of African Americans, women and young people.
The agency enforces antitrust law and pursues allegations of deceptive advertising, including scams. It reviews deals having to do with pharmaceuticals, a key issue at a time when drug prices have been a political concern.
The FTC is currently made up of Chairwoman Lina Khan, a progressive Democrat, a second Democrat and two Republicans. The FTC cannot take any actions on a tie vote.

Bedoya was born in Peru but is a naturalized U.S. citizen.
The FTC under Trump sued Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), alleging it broke antitrust law, and under Biden the agency has pursued that lawsuit against the unit of Meta, as the company now calls itself. It is also investigating Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as assessing Amazon's $8.5 billion deal for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios to determine if it is legal under antitrust law.

South African telecoms group MTN opened its offer for sale to retail investors on Wednesday at 169 naira per share to sell up to 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria.
The public offer, which closes on Dec. 14, marks the first phase of a share sale to retail investors where the South African company will seek to sell down its holding in MTN Nigeria to 65% from 78% over time, MTN Group Chief Executive Ralph Mupita said at a roadshow in Abuja.
MTN Group Chairman Mcebisi Jonas attended the roadshow, which was held on the sidelines of a state visit by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.
The drop in MTN Nigeria shares pushed the main share index down 1.8% to a three-week low.
MTN listed its Nigerian business in Lagos two years ago at 90 naira each, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation.
In March 2020, MTN Nigeria shares fell back to the listing price due to lockdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

There have been few initial public offerings in Nigeria since the 2008 global financial crisis, which wiped out more than 60% of the stock market's capitalisation.

Investing.com - Zscaler’s stock (NASDAQ:ZS) is trading flat after the cyber-security software provider posted an earnings beat.
Zscaler reported $230.5M in revenue for their quarter ended October 31, 62% above last year’s numbers, their strongest year-over-year growth quarter since coming public in 2019. Non-GAAP income came in at $.14/share. Both were ahead of analyst estimates.
CEO and Chairman Jay Chaudhry said, “CISOs and CIOs are looking to phase out legacy network security in favor of zero trust architecture, due to increasing cyber and ransomware risks and accelerating digital transformation. This architecture shift continues to drive strong demand for our Zero Trust Exchange platform.” He also reported the company crossed the $1B annual recurring revenue (ARR) mark, with a focus on reaching $5B over time.
Zscaler shares opened up 7% pre-market at $371/share, though they may have dropped as part of the 'reopening trade' momentum today. Investors appeared to be initially impressed guidance and the billings numbers as promising signs for the security provider. Billings were up 71% year over year, ahead of revenue. Zscaler’s guidance for Q2 2022 (their fiscal year runs August-July) is for $240-242M revenue and $.11/share non-GAAP net income. They raised full-year guidance to $1B in revenue and $1.3B in billings, from $930-950M and $1.23-1.25B previously. Current analyst expectations for Q2 are for revenue of $225M.
Morgan Stanley and JMP Securities are among the sell-side firms who raised their price targets on Zscaler in response to the report, to $330 and $400/share respectively. In total, 12 analysts hiked price targets in response to the beat and raise, as well as the acceleration in growth this quarter.
Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) was up 2% pre-market, perhaps in sympathy, though that high-flying security stock has come down 25% from 52-week highs on valuation concerns, and currently trades down 1.6% in early morning trading.

LONDON/SAO PAULO (Reuters) -A global push to cut methane emissions and end deforestation is at risk of being held back by weak corporate efforts in the livestock industry, an investor group said on Wednesday.
More than 100 countries pledged to cut methane emissions 30% and halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 at last month's COP26 climate talks, much of which will need to come from the livestock industry. The U.N. food agency said livestock accounts for 44% of man-made methane https://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode emissions.
Yet less than a fifth of the world's biggest livestock producers currently measure even some of their emissions, a report from the FAIRR Initiative (FI), whose members manage more than $45 trillion in assets, showed.
""As the largest driver of both methane from human activity and deforestation, the ambitions set at COP26 handed a big slice of responsibility to the food and agriculture sector,"" said FI Chair Jeremy Coller.
""Yet failures from methane to manure management underline the growing sense in the market that cows are the new coal."" 
In its fourth annual report, the group assessed 60 publicly listed animal protein producers worth a combined $363 billion on 10 environmental, social and governance-related (ESG) issues including emissions and antibiotic usage.
Among those to score highly were Norwegian aquaculture firms Mowi ASA and Grieg Seafood, while the highest ranking meat and dairy companies were Maple Leaf, Marfrig and Fonterra, all of which were defined as ""low risk"".
Fellow large producers including the world's biggest meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) and  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), meanwhile, were regarded as ""medium risk."" 
JBS dropped points for reasons including its reporting on animal welfare and employee working conditions, while Tyson was marked down for reasons including that some of its sourcing is from regions at risk of deforestation, FAIRR said.
JBS told Reuters that boosting its ESG performance remained a priority. On FAIRR's ranking, JBS noted it ranked 11 out of 60 companies, with an overall score of 57%, representing a six percentage point improvement on 2020.
Tyson said it engaged with FAIRR and provided feedback about its commitments to preventing deforestation https://www.tysonsustainability.com/downloads/Tyson_Foods_Forest_Protection_Standard.pdf, including to begin sourcing verified deforestation free beef by the end of 2021, with complete transition of its Australasia sourcing by the end of 2025.
FAIRR makes the findings public so other investors can use them when they analyse company performance and in their engagement with company boards.
The report also found that 42 of 45 meat and dairy firms that source soy for animal feed from areas at high risk of deforestation, such as Brazil's Cerrado region, do not have a policy to mitigate deforestation.
The cattle industry has also done a poor job in monitoring its broader supply chain, the report said, and is currently missing up to 90% of the deforestation caused by indirect suppliers.

Nearly a third https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/brazil-audit-finds-32-jbs-cattle-amazon-state-irregular-farms-2021-10-07 of the cattle bought by JBS in the Brazilian Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) state of Para came from ranches with ""irregularities"" such as illegal deforestation, prosecutors found in a 2020 audit.
""The science is clear that to avoid runaway climate change high-emitting sectors such as agriculture must transform themselves in the next decade. Yet FAIRR's latest research shows how far the food sector has to go,"" said Eugenie Mathieu, senior analyst at  Aviva  (LON:AV) investors.

Investing.com — Nio Inc Class A ADR (NYSE:NIO), Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ:LI), and  Xpeng Inc  (NYSE:XPEV) shares are rallying Wednesday. The gains are because it's the start of a new month, which means electric vehicle companies are releasing their delivery reports.
Starting with NIO, the company delivered 10,878 vehicles in November, representing an increase of 105.6% year-over-year, and taking year-to-date deliveries to 80,940, a 120.4% year-over-year rise. The figure is also a big jump from the 3,667 deliveries in October. As a result, NIO shares jumped at the open, hitting a high of $40.78. They are currently up 1.5%.
Li Auto reported 13,485 deliveries during November, representing a 190.2% year-over-year increase and a rise from the 7,649 reported for October. As a result, total deliveries for the 11 months to November 30 hit 76,404. Like its counterpart NIO, Li shares have also rallied, hitting a high of $37.45 in early trading. They are currently up 2.8%.
While NIO and Li reported great numbers, XPeng outperformed both, with November vehicle deliveries reaching 15,613, a 270% increase year-over-year and well above the 10,138 reported in October. Year-to-date deliveries have now hit 82,155 year-to-date, a rise of 285%. However, despite the solid delivery performance, XPeng's share price has been unable to hold onto the gains it achieved at the open, with its stock currently down 1.5% after initially rising to $56.45."

793,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 09:59AM ET</span>",Analysis-European insurers fear sanctions coming down Nord Stream 2 pipe,"By Carolyn Cohn and Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A simmering threat of sanctions against the operator of the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline risks shutting off cover from European insurers for the politically-sensitive project to bring Russian gas directly to Germany. 
Kremlin-backed energy giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) leads the consortium which, despite stiff opposition from the U.S. and some European nations, has built the pipeline under the Baltic Sea - bypassing Ukraine amid a geopolitical battle for influence in the region.
The U.S. stepped up sanctions on companies linked with the project last week https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-imposes-further-sanctions-connection-with-nord-stream-2-gas-pipeline-2021-11-22/this%20week, while Germany's energy regulator this month temporarily halted its certification process. It said the Swiss consortium behind the pipeline had to form a German unit to show it has enough funding and independence from Gazprom.
""I don't think any insurers will touch this project with a barge pole until the situation becomes more settled,"" said Leigh Hansson, a partner at law firm Reed Smith.
The U.S. and some European opponents of Nord Stream 2 say it will make Europe too reliant on Russian gas, allowing Moscow to expand its political, economic and military influence. But other governments say it is vital to secure energy supplies, as gas prices surge and the threat of power outages looms.
Worries over fresh sanctions led top European insurers AXA and Zurich and reinsurer Munich Re to pull out of insuring the construction this year. Without cover, the pipeline operator could also be exposed to costs for damage, delays or litigation and find it harder to secure loans. 
The Biden administration earlier this year waived sanctions on the pipeline's operating company, which theoretically enables non-U.S. companies to provide financing and insurance, while Germany has agreed to take action if Russia uses energy as a weapon in its relations with Ukraine.
But lawyers and political risk analysts say the chances of sanctions being imposed has been heightened as a build-up of troops on Ukrainian borders fuels fears of a Russian invasion.
Moscow has dismissed talk of a new Russian assault as inflammatory, but NATO and the U.S. on Tuesday warned Russia it would pay a ""high price"" for military aggression.
A spokesperson for Nord Stream 2's Swiss-based operating company said ""all construction, operation and other activities of our company are covered by appropriate insurances"". The company did not comment on its contractual partners.
Gazprom declined to comment on Nord Stream's insurance.
In the absence of European insurers, the project could use Russian entities, lawyers say. One Russian insurer Konstanta - now renamed RNCB Insurance - has already been sanctioned.
RNCB Insurance did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
SANCTION THREAT
European insurers, such as those operating in the Lloyd's of London insurance market, could in theory underwrite the pipeline, its Chief Executive John Neal said.
""We've been involved with the Nord Stream project previously, certainly insuring its construction,"" Neal said, adding: ""We need to be hugely respectful of sanctions.""
Lloyd's of London declined to comment further. 
Munich Re CEO Joachim Wenning told Reuters it is not currently involved with Nord Stream 2 due to sanctions issues.
Zurich said it did not comment on potential or existing customer relationships but stressed that it placed high priority on sanctions compliance. AXA declined to comment.
Allianz (DE:ALVG), Europe's biggest insurer, said it could not comment on client relationships, but a spokesperson said the German firm followed ""all sanctions regimes very thoroughly"".
PIPELINE COVER 
With construction complete, insurance for the pipeline itself would protect against problems such as property damage, business interruption and directors' and officers' liability. 
But the delayed approval will likely slow arrangements, said Ross Denton, head of international trade at law firm Ashurst. 
One key risk is that the United States could extend sanctions to European firms at short notice, experts say. 
Nigel Kushner, chief executive of London law firm W Legal, says the U.S. has a reputation for using sanctions against tactics that aggravate NATO and the West.
""The reaction of the U.S. on almost every single occasion is to ramp up sanctions,"" he says. 

""Who in their right minds will jump into something and finance something and provide support to something, because there is a risk they may be sanctioned?
    ""Insurers are prudent and I think they will be reticent.""

By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. bank profits fell 1.2% in the third quarter of 2021 to $69.5 billion as firms were slower to shrink their credit loss provisions and grappled with low interest rates, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported Tuesday.
Bank profits are still up nearly 36% from the same time a year ago when banks were still rushing to set aside funds to guard against pandemic-driven loan losses.
Banks have been shrinking those loan loss provisions for three straight quarters, but slowed the rate of decline in the third quarter, dropping it by $5.2 billion compared to 10.8 billion in the second quarter.
As banks continued to shrink those reserves, the rate of non-current loans for banks fell by 6.3% to 0.94%. The net charge-off rate for loans no longer expected to be repaid fell to 0.19%, the lowest level on record.
Total loan balances were up slightly, as two-thirds of all banks reported annual profit growth. Nearly 96% of banks were profitable.

""With strong capital and liquidity levels to support lending and protect against potential losses, the banking industry continued to support the country's needs for financial services while navigating the challenges presented by the pandemic,"" said FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams in a statement.
The net interest margin for banks rose from a record low in the second quarter to 2.56%, as banks reported a $5.2 billion in increase in interest income, a slight uptick from the quarter prior.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets rose sharply at the open on Wednesday, amid hopes that the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 will not be as economically disruptive as first feared. 
Another strong set of data from the labor market also encouraged participants that the U.S. economy is plenty strong enough to cope with the withdrawal of Federal Reserve stimulus - even if that means earlier interest rate hikes too.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 240 points, or 0.7%, at 34,723 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%.  None of the indices, however, managed to recoup all their losses of Tuesday. 
Earlier, private payrolls processor ADP said that the U.S. private sector added another 534,000 jobs through the middle of November, down from 570,000 a month earlier, but still above forecasts and the second-largest monthly gain in six months. The Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing PMI for November, meanwhile, ticked up to 61.1 from 60.8 the previous month, while the red-hot prices paid component of the index fell a little to 82.4 from 85.7.
Sentiment was helped by increasing signs that the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 will not put any unbearable strain on public health systems, despite appearing to be more highly transmissible than the Delta variant that has dominated this year. Europe's Center for Disease Control said there were 59 identified cases of Omicron-variant Covid across the EU, all of them either mild or asymptomatic. That corroborated early findings from South Africa - the first country to identify the strain - where health experts have also said that there had been no clear pick up in serious infection rates.
Software companies were in focus after a handful of companies reported after the close on Tuesday. Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) stock rose 2.0% after its sales through October came in well above expectations, although it guided for a modest sequential decline in billings in the coming quarter. Going in the other direction, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock fell 7.5% to its lowest in over two months after its guidance came in materially below expectations, the result of intense competition in the Cloud space from the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon Web Services. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 0.8% after a joint announcement saying that AWS will deepen its strategic partnership with Facebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) as it develops its suite of Cloud-based services.
Elsewhere, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock rose another 5.4% as investors reassessed its outlook under new management in the wake of founder Jack Dorsey's departure as CEO. Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) stock, supported in any case by the broader return of risk appetite, rose 3.2% after the dating site operator agreed to pay $440 million to settle a lawsuit by executives claiming they were unfairly denied the opportunity to exercise and sell their stock options.
The morning's big underperformers were - unsurprisingly - vacccine stocks.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock lost 4.9%, while BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock fell 1.6% and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock fell 0.8%."

Thus, we think that based on their solid financials, beaten-down stocks Tredegar (TG), Educational Development (EDUC), and Core Molding Technologies (CMT) could bounce back in 2022. Let’s discuss these names.Investor concerns regarding the spread of the COVID-19 omicron variant have been fostering stock market volatility. The major stock market indexes ended lower yesterday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the Fed might consider accelerating the timing for the tapering of its monthly bond purchases.
Inflation climbed to a record high 6.2% in October, its highest level since December 1990. In its efforts to prevent inflation from spiraling out of control, the Fed is expected to cut its asset purchases and begin increasing interest rates. However, despite the market’s volatility,  Goldman Sachs Group , Inc. (NYSE:GS) expects the S&P 500 to hit 5,100 by the end of 2022. In addition, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (NYSE:JPM) S&P 500 forecast for 2022 is among the most bullish on Wall Street.
Tredegar Corporation (TG), Educational Development Corporation (EDUC), and Core Molding Technologies, Inc. (CMT) are three stocks that have declined significantly in price on a year-over-date basis. However, based on their solid fundamentals, we think they could gain considerably in the near term.

Conversely, we think the poor near-term growth prospects of JPMorgan (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) make their stocks best avoided now. Read on.The Consumer Price Index rose 6.2% in October from a year earlier, its biggest jump in more than 30 years. While soaring inflation might not negatively impact all sectors equally, some sectors are expected to benefit from it.
Due to their rate-sensitive nature, banks tend to benefit when the Fed tightens its monetary policy as an anti-inflationary measure. When interest rates rise, the income on bank assets like bonds and loans climb higher than their liabilities, such as deposits. The Fed will likely raise interest rates soon, which could help banks improve their profits. Furthermore, U.S. bank stocks rose recently when senior bankers and industry experts welcomed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's nomination for a second term.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally strong bank stocks Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB). However, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) do not look well-positioned to see their shares soar in the near term. So, these two stocks are best avoided now.

800,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",Apple Shares in Sweet Spot as Traders Rush to Safety,"(Bloomberg) -- As technology stocks have slumped over the past week, traders have found a haven in the sector: Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The stock rallied Tuesday to close at a record high even as tech shares and the broader market sold off on worries about higher interest rates and the omicron coronavirus variant. The iPhone maker was one of only seven stocks in the S&P 500 to rise, and it’s adding to those gains Wednesday in premarket trading, up 1.6%.
Investors have often prized Apple for its consistent sales growth and hefty cash balance, and the stock now is getting an added boost from the hype around autonomous vehicles and its planned foray into metaverse-related products. 
“Wall Street is viewing it as a safety blanket tech name during this market turbulence,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush who sees the stock gaining another 12% in the next year.
Traders’ embrace of Apple is a turnabout from just a month ago, when the stock was underperforming the S&P 500 and the company warned that a shortage of semiconductors would hamper product sales for the holidays. 
Morgan Stanley analysts have been talking up Apple’s electric car program after Bloomberg News reported this month that the company is accelerating the effort. Even if the firm wins just a 4% share of the global mobility market, its revenue base could double, according to the bank.
Similarly, mass-market adoption of either augmented reality or virtual reality -- a gateway to the metaverse -- will only occur “when Apple enters the race,” Morgan Stanley technology analysts Katy Huberty and Erik Woodring wrote in a report.
“It’s as safe as it gets in the tech space and yet there’s still fantastic opportunities in the coming years,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. “So there’s every reason for investors to feel safe with a stock like that, even in turbulent times.”
Since the report on foray into cars, Apple shares have risen almost 8%, and the stock is now outperforming the S&P 500 for the year.
And those worries about holiday sales may turn out to have been overdone. “Based on retail checks and supply chain it appears iPhone 13 demand is robust coming out of Black Friday,” Ives said.
While Apple has escaped those concerns, e-commerce companies such as Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc. and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY). are suffering backlashes. An index of web merchants has fallen 6% since the day before Thanksgiving, twice the decline in the S&P 500 over the same period. Among the biggest decliners are Wayfair (NYSE:W) Inc. with an 11% drop, eBay at 7.2% and Shopify at 6.6%.
Early data on sales trends over the Thanksgiving weekend have highlighted weaker-than-expected online spending as more shoppers chose to go out and buy from traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. 
Among e-commerce companies, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is best positioned for market share gains this holiday due to its relatively healthy supply chain and buy-now-pay-later option, analysts Justin Post and Michael McGovern wrote in a research note.
In-store purchases jumped in the U.S. by 43% on Black Friday, compared with e-commerce growth of 11%, according to data from Mastercard (NYSE:MA) SpendingPulse, a reversal from last year when e-commerce sales soared. Spending on Cyber Monday shrank this year to $10.7 billion from $10.8 billion in 2020, missing projections, data from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc. showed.
For Mark Stoeckle, chief executive officer and senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, the results aren’t painting a full picture. Early promotions and concerns about adequate inventories probably pulled forward a lot of purchases, he said. Still, e-commerce sales are likely to face pressure from shoppers itching to get out.
“As convenient as shopping online was last year given where we were with the pandemic, it’s just not as much fun,” he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 will gain 7.5% between now and the end of 2022 to finish at 4,910, driven by earnings and economic growth that will extend this year's rally, according to the median prediction in a Reuters poll of strategists.
Those upbeat forecasts come even as growing concerns about the effect of a new coronavirus variant cloud the picture for the near term, with Wall Street https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/wall-st-ends-lower-taper-acceleration-worries-pile-onto-virus-angst-2021-11-30 falling sharply on Tuesday, partly on concerns about the Omicron variant.
Yet the S&P 500 remains up over 21% in 2021, benefitting from an economy reopening from pandemic lockdowns.
For 2022, the benchmark S&P 500 will gain 7.5% from Tuesday's close of 4,567 to end the year at 4,910, according to the median forecast of 45 strategists polled by Reuters over the last two weeks.
That forecast is higher than the 4,725 in the late August Reuters poll, although many of the latest forecasts for 2022 were given before the Omicron news.
""Next year is going to slow a little bit, but it's still going to be stronger than trend"" for the economy, and that's likely to extend the bull market, said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA), which has a 5,050 year-end 2022 target on the S&P 500.
Based on the poll, the Dow Jones industrial average will finish next year at 37,500, up about 8.7% from Tuesday's close.
While profit growth for 2022 is expected to be well below the blowout growth seen this year when businesses bounced back from the start of the pandemic, some strategists think consensus views may be underestimating strength.
""Analysts are still going to be behind the eight ball,"" Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said this week in a virtual chat for his year-ahead outlook. He forecasts the S&P 500 will end 2022 at 5,300.
Strategists in the poll mostly saw earnings expectations improving rather than worsening over the next six months.
Higher costs from supply chain disruptions and labor prompted warnings from companies in the recent earnings season, but many companies so far have been able to pass costs on to consumers.
Wall Street analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 7.9% in 2022, compared with an estimated 49.3% growth in 2021, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Many strategists in the poll, however, viewed a correction or pullback in the S&P 500 in the next six months as likely.
Among the latest reasons for concern, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/powell-yellen-head-congress-inflation-variant-risks-rise-2021-11-30 signaled Tuesday the U.S. central bank would consider speeding up its withdrawal of bond purchases as inflation risks increase.
Earlier this month, the Fed began reducing its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities at a pace that would put it on track to complete the wind-down by mid-2022. The program was introduced in early 2020 to ease the economy through the pandemic.
Savita Subramanian, equity & quant strategist at BofA Securities, told investors in a year-ahead video presentation this week that focus within the large-cap space should be on companies ""with more stable and growing dividends that will benefit, rather than be hurt from, inflation.""

""We like energy and financials for inflation-protected dividends,"" she said. BofA has a 4,600 year-end target on the S&P 500 for 2022.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index will add to its recent record high over the coming year as the domestic economic recovery helps underpin corporate earnings, but gains are expected to slow from 2020's breakneck pace, a Reuters poll found.
The median prediction of 26 portfolio managers and strategists was for the S&P/TSX Composite index to rise 9.1% to 22,540 by the end of 2022.
That's a move that would eclipse last month's record high of 21,796.16 and compares with an August forecast of 22,000. It was then expected to edge up to 23,150 by the middle of 2023.
The index had advanced 18.5% since the start of the year, putting it on track for its second biggest gain since 2009.
""We think the economy and markets will continue to progress further into the mid-cycle phase next year,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""We are past the strongest point of the cycle, but there is plenty of runway ahead, especially from an economic standpoint.""
Canada's economy https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadian-economy-posts-annualized-gain-54-q3-october-gdp-seen-up-08-2021-11-30 grew at an annualized rate of 5.4% in the third quarter, beating analyst expectations, and growth most likely accelerated in October on a manufacturing rebound.
""Banks can continue to benefit from an improving economy and reducing loan loss provisions and resource companies can benefit from higher commodity prices,"" said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management.
Combined, the financial services and resource sectors account for 55% of the Toronto market's valuation.
Nearly all participants that answered a separate question on the outlook for corporate earnings expected earnings to improve. But the pace of growth could slow.
""We expect a decelerating pace of (earnings) growth,"" said Chhad Aul, chief investment officer & head of multi-asset solutions at SLGI Asset Management Inc. ""In particular, we expect the recent strong earnings growth in the energy sector to begin to moderate.""
The price of oil, a key driver of energy sector earnings, has tumbled 24% since October, pressured by rising coronavirus cases in Europe and the detection of the possibly vaccine-resistant Omicron variant.
Another risk to the outlook could be a reduction in policy support, say investors.
With inflation climbing, the Bank of Canada https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bank-canada-signals-it-could-hike-rates-sooner-than-expected-2021-10-27 has signaled it could begin hiking interest rates as soon as April and the Federal Reserve https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/powell-yellen-head-congress-inflation-variant-risks-rise-2021-11-30 is mulling whether to wrap up tapering of bond purchases a few months sooner.

""The key is the pace of both fiscal and monetary policy normalization,"" said Ben Jang, a portfolio manager at Nicola Wealth. ""This process will likely lead to more volatility in markets, potentially returning to an environment where we will see drawdowns of more than 10%.""
Asked if a correction was likely over the coming six months, nearly all respondents said yes.

Klarna https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/payments-firm-klarnas-jan-sep-losses-grow-soured-credits-2021-11-26, which allows shoppers to buy online through its merchant partners and settle their dues in installments, became Europe's most valuable startup in March and was valued at $46 billion https://www.reuters.com/business/payments-firm-klarnas-valuation-rises-46-billion-after-fundraising-2021-06-10 after a funding round in June - higher than several of the region's major banks.
Founded in 2005, the company is among the largest players in the global ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL) sector with over 90 million active users in 17 countries and counts the likes of payments technology giant  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V), private equity firm Permira and venture firm Sequoia Capital among its backers. 
Given the company's success, it is inevitable that it will eventually become a public entity, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in an interview broadcast on Wednesday at the Reuters Next conference.
""I am just hoping for Klarna that by the time we go public, there is a strong enough reputation for the business ... as you have been able to see with somebody like (Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO Elon) Musk or (Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder) Jeff Bezos, where it's almost like nobody reads those quarterly reports,"" he said.
He voiced concerns about the involvement of hedge funds which may provide value but can also lack deep understanding of a company's industry and opportunities, leading to what he called ""very foolish decisions.""
He added: ""Unfortunately one day we are going to have to be public, with that worry still in my stomach."" 
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)'s longtime CEO, Jack Dorsey, who relinquished his post https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-expected-step-down-cnbc-2021-11-29 earlier this week, in 2020 faced calls from Elliott Management Corp to step down, after the hedge fund argued he was paying too little attention to Twitter while also running  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ).
Klarna's investors also include Silver Lake, Bestseller Group, Dragoneer, Ant Group and Atomico.
Siemiatkowski also said the fast-growing BNPL industry needs to be regulated, provided the policies are devised to promote and not hurt market competitiveness.
With pandemic-related lockdowns turning shoppers to online payment platforms, demand for financial technology companies has boomed, with digital payments behemoths like  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square expanding into the BNPL sector through acquisitions.
As activity picks up in the sector, regulators have focused on what they see as inappropriate marketing of credit, with British lawmakers calling for urgent regulation of BNPL fintech services.

""I think if you implement such rules, the downside is that you are making the market less competitive which means in the end the consumer is losing out,"" Siemiatkowski said.

""If there is no solution soon this will become a major conflict,"" IG Metall district leader Daniel Friedrich said on Wednesday.
The dispute centres on a shake-up announced in April under which Airbus's Premium Aerotec unit in Germany would be split off, with part of it combined with other Airbus manufacturing plants and the rest folded into a new business specialising in small mass-produced parts which could be spun off.
The unit has been loss-making for years, and Airbus has argued that with a new owner it could also work for competitors or win customers from other industries, and thus better utilise its workforce.

IG Metall demands that Airbus drop its plan to hive off the business, which makes components for commercial and military aircraft, and safeguard its jobs and sites, mainly in Augsburg and Varel near Bremen. The business has around 3,500 employees.
IG Metall said that workers would stage protests on Thursday and planned a virtual rally on Friday.

By Elizabeth Howcroft
LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) risks missing the point of metaverse - and a coming shift in consumers' behaviour - if it fails to permit digital ownership, according to some of the virtual world's pioneers.
The social media giant made waves last month by changing its name to Meta Platforms and announcing a focus on the buzzy ""metaverse"".
However, with few details beyond the rebrand, metaverse participants doubt it is ready to embrace the spirit driving creativity and profit in the space.
""What Facebook is doing with meta...is a 'fake metaverse,' unless they actually have a real description as to how we can truly own it,"" said Yat Siu, chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, an investor in and builder of metaverse platforms, speaking on a panel at  the  Reuters Next conference.
""Until then, it's just Disneyland. It's a beautiful place to be, but we probably don't want to really live there. It's not the kind of place that we can actually build a business.""
The metaverse refers to an array of shared spaces accessed via the internet. Some use augmented reality, via smart glasses, though current platforms often look more like the inside of a video game than real life.
Serious money is sloshing around in there, with a patch of ""real estate"" in an online world called Decentraland changing hands for the equivalent of $2.4 million last week. 
Such plots and other virtual objects typically transact blockchain-based assets called non-fungible tokens (NFTs), sales of which topped $10 billion in the September quarter, according to market tracker DappRadar. 
Facebook's entry has further turbocharged interest in the space. It had no immediate response to an emailed request for comment on Wednesday, and has not previously responded directly to criticisms of its metaverse plans. 
But Siu said ownership is the bedrock for improvements and new paths for products and commerce, much like car ownership gave rise to baby car seat makers or how home ownership drives demand for furniture and businesses like Ikea.
SAME, SAME, BUT DIFFERENT
For fellow metaverse pioneer Benoit Pagotto, co-founder of virtual sneaker company RTFKT, digital ownership makes room to change the roles of brands and consumers. 
""It's a huge shift in (the way) the relationship between business, creativity and consumerism is working,"" he said at the Reuters Next conference. ""A product is not a one-off thing. You need to think of how you can continue to update it,"" he said.
""It's very, very much more fluid. I think the real world will soon be overwhelmed by that because the possibilities of interaction in a digital world are so much deeper.""
In the meantime, there has been a scramble to catch up, both by brands wanting a slice of the action and lawyers trying to pin down what digital ownership really is. 
NFTs are largely unregulated and fraudsters lurk. Anybody can create and sell an NFT and there is no guarantee of its value.
""It is causing a little bit of headaches to people in the legal profession trying to reconcile the vocabulary with what's happening in fact,"" said Sophie Goossens, a partner specialising in technology and media law at Reed Smith in London.
""Ownership in legal terms means something...(generally) a monopoly over a resource that is enforced by the state,"" she said. ""The type of rights that you are being granted on digital ownership of an NFT are slightly different. You may not have the right to control fully the asset that you own as an NFT.""
Still, that does not appear to be holding back the metaverse's reach into the mainstream, especially for young people who are already video game or fashion consumers.
""I think we're going to see a blend of digital assets seamlessly fitting into our real environment,"" said Natalie Johnson, founder of Neuno, a forthcoming marketplace for fashion brand NFTs, as tech firms launch augmented-reality glasses.

""You don't need to be a hardcore gamer to be embracing and playing with this new technology. It's going to be for everyone.""

811,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 06:52AM ET</span>","Dow Futures Rise 300 Pts; Bouncing Ahead of ADP, ISM Data","By Peter Nurse
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, bouncing in the wake of the previous session’s sharp selloff on worries over the Fed considering a quick departure from its accommodative monetary policy and ahead of key economic data.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 300 points, or 0.9%, S&P 500 futures traded 57 points, or 1.3%, higher and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 250 points, or 1.5%.
The major indices closed significantly lower on Tuesday, hit by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell telling the Senate Banking Committee that the risk of inflation has increased, and that it was therefore time to retire the word ‘transitory’.  He also suggested the central bank could speed up the timeline for cutting back on bond buying to support the economic recovery by a couple of months.
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 650 points, or 1.9%, the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%.
This hawkish turn from Powell came despite the uncertainty surrounding the virulence of the omicron variant, its ability to evade vaccine protection and the extent of the economic damage caused by travel restrictions to curb its spread.
Air travellers to the United States will now face tougher Covid-19 testing rules, joining some 56 countries that were reportedly implementing travel measures to guard against omicron as of Nov. 28, according to the World Health Organisation. 
Powell's testimony continues later on Wednesday, while the economic data slate includes U.S. private payrolls, ahead of Friday’s official monthly jobs report, and the November ISM manufacturing PMI release.
“U.S. data should continue to show strong numbers over the coming weeks (ISM and ADP today) which will foster expectations that the Fed could turn more hawkish at the December 16th FOMC meeting (in spite of omicron),“ said analysts at ING, in a note.  
Turning to the corporate sector, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) will be in the spotlight after the software company issued disappointing guidance for the current quarter late Tuesday. Elsewhere, Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and PVH (NYSE:PVH) all report earnings after the close.
Crude prices traded higher Wednesday, recouping some of the hefty losses of the previous session, ahead of a key meeting of top producers to decide future output levels. 
Expectations are growing that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, will agree to pause plans to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in January given the potential hit to demand from the travel restrictions put in place to tackle the new omicron variant.
The American Petroleum Institute reported a fall of 747,000 barrels from U.S. crude inventories for last week, a smaller draw than expected, and investors now await crude oil supply from the U.S. Energy Information Administration at 10:30 AM ET.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.4% higher at $69.05 a barrel, having slumped 5.4% on Tuesday, while the Brent contract rose 4.6% to $72.40, after falling 3.9% during the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,787.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1322.

The airline said its liquidity of HK$31.7 billion ($4.07 billion) as of Oct. 31 was only slightly down on HK$32.8 billion at June 30 due largely to a strong performance in the air cargo business.
""It is too early to assess the impact on travel demand,"" Cathay Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said of the Omicron variant in an analysts' briefing. 
Cathay last month said it expected its second-half results to improve considerably from the first half, though it still forecast a substantial loss for the full year.
The airline continues to suffer from COVID-19 pandemic-related travel restrictions, operating at only 10% of pre-pandemic passenger capacity in October and posting a 97.2% decline in passenger numbers from 2019.
Cathay last week switched some inbound passenger flights for December to cargo only after not enough pilots volunteered to fly rosters to high-risk destinations that involve five weeks locked in hotel rooms.
Hong Kong this week added countries including Australia, Canada, Germany and Israel to the list of high-risk destinations as it pursues a zero-COVID strategy that it hopes will lead to a border opening with mainland China.
Lam said it was too early to provide a capacity outlook for the first quarter of 2022.
""We do have hope that sometime in 2022 the Chinese mainland government and Hong Kong government may consider opening up,"" he said of international travel.

However, John Grant, chief analyst at travel firm OAG, said Hong Kong's growing alignment with the Chinese mainland border policy meant the financial centre was unlikely to recover its status as a major transit hub anytime soon.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>",Brazil stocks set for bargain-hunt rebound in 2022 but politics risky: Reuters poll,"By Gabriel Burin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Brazil's stocks are likely to rebound in 2022 from this year's steep decline, as investors hunt for bargains but stay on the alert to an uncertain political situation in the run-up to the country's presidential vote, a Reuters poll showed.
The Bovespa stock index is down 13.7% year-to-date, headed toward the deepest annual slide since 2013, when Brazil was descending into a serious domestic crisis. The Bovespa is trading at 102,741 points, close to its lowest level in 12 months.
Local markets face a renewed surge of fiscal worries after the government relaxed its grip on the budget in a move seen as a sacrifice of austerity to shore up President Jair Bolsonaro's dwindling re-election chances.
Fears of a resurgent pandemic due to the Omicron variant of COVID-19 are also weighing on Brazilian assets, as are growing prospects for higher interest rates in the United States.
However, Sao Paulo stock exchange values are now so cheap that the Bovespa should recover 17.3% from its level on Tuesday, finishing next year at 120,500 points, according to the median estimate of 12 equity strategists polled Nov. 16-30.
""The degree of uncertainty in Brazil is such that domestic assets have dropped to historically low levels considering price/earnings ratios,"" Joao Guilherme Penteado, CEO of Apollo Investimentos, said.
""From there, a positive bias for Brazilian assets could easily emerge if uncertainties diminish ... still, the 2022 election could be the most difficult for the country in the last 30 years,"" he added.
Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva leads opinion polls and last week met French President Emmanuel Macron, sparking an angry reaction from Bolsonaro https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/bolsonaro-denounces-macron-lula-meeting-provocation-2021-11-25. Neither has officially declared their candidacy for the Oct. 2022 vote.
The encounter with Macron and its fallout show how Lula aims to capitalize on Bolsonaro's diplomatic isolation. This year, Brazil's Supreme Court overturned Lula's conviction in 2018 on charges of taking bribes from engineering companies.
Mounting doubts about Brazil's politics have weighed on the Bovespa. The survey's median estimate of 114,000 points by mid-2022 was well below 130,000 points seen in August.
Economic worries have added downward pressures on Brazilian stocks. High inflation and slow growth are expected to persist next year, according to a separate Reuters poll.
Meanwhile, Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC stock index is up 11.6% so far in 2021, on track for its biggest annual gain since 2012. On Tuesday the index was at 49,171 points, and investors expect further gains next year.

Mexico's IPC was forecast to reach 56,250 points at the end of 2022, about 14.4% higher from where it was hovering on this week, getting close to this year's record levels just above 53,000 in the second-half.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Forced labour allegations against Malaysian firms are affecting foreign investors' confidence in the Southeast Asian nation, a minister said on Wednesday, days after Dyson cut ties with Malaysian supplier ATA IMS over labour abuse claims.
Dyson told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-dyson-terminates-relationship-with-malaysian-supplier-ata-over-labour-2021-11-25 last week it would sever ties with ATA, which makes parts for its vacuum cleaners and air purifiers, in six months following an audit of the Malaysian company's labour practices and allegations by a whistleblower.
ATA, which gets 80% of its revenue from the home appliance maker, reiterated this week it took the accusations seriously and that findings from a labour audit were inconclusive https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/dyson-supplier-ata-says-forced-labour-allegations-not-conclusive-2021-11-29. It has previously denied the forced labour allegations. 
Human Resources Minister M. Saravanan, in a statement, urged employers and industries to conduct due diligence on workers' rights and welfare to ensure Malaysia is no longer tied to forced labour practices.
Saravanan told parliament on Tuesday that authorities will charge ATA following complaints received by the labour department.
""Forced labour issues linked to local companies in the electronic and rubber gloves manufacturing sector, and palm oil plantations have projected a negative image to the country and this has affected foreign investors' confidence towards Malaysia's supply of products,"" Saravanan said.
Malaysia, a key manufacturing hub, has faced scrutiny this year over claims migrant workers are being subjected to abusive working and living conditions. Foreigners are a significant part of its workforce. 
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection has banned six Malaysian firms, including rubber glove makers and palm oil producers, in the last two years from selling their products to the United States after finding evidence of forced labour.
In July, the U.S. State Department put Malaysia on a list with China and North Korea, saying it had not made progress in eliminating trafficking of workers.

Shares of ATA have dropped nearly two-thirds since the Dyson announcement. The company has warned of sharp revenue declines and cost cuts. 
Saravanan on Tuesday did not say what complaints the labour department had received or specify the charges. He said last week Malaysia was investigating https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/analysts-see-years-losses-malaysias-ata-after-major-client-dyson-cuts-ties-2021-11-26 Dyson's decision to terminate the ATA contract.

""It depends on the partnership model we will establish in the next months. We're open to discuss it. For us it's necessary that we can control ... the technology roadmap, the timing, the costs and the availability to enable our rollout.""
Schmall is overseeing Volkswagen's ambitious plan to build six large battery cell plants in Europe by the end of the decade, a strategic pillar in its bid to overtake Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and become the world's top electric vehicles seller.
Sweden's Northvolt, the first plant in which Volkswagen owns a fifth, will start production premium cells for the German carmaker from 2023. The second plant, to be built jointly with China's Gotion High-Tech in Salzgitter, is to start in 2025.
Four more plants will follow by the end of the decade, most likely in Spain, eastern Europe and two additional locations that have so far not been disclosed.
Costs will be 1 billion to 2 billion euros per plant while capacity will range from 40 up to a maximum of 80 gigawatt hours (GWh), depending on the chemistry as well as whether enough energy supplies are available, Schmall said.
""We have some natural limits in the availability of utilities, energy, water,"" he said.
CLOSED LOOP
But production capacity is only one part of the equation, Schmall said, adding that Volkswagen also had to make sure it gets enough raw materials, such as lithium and nickel.
This requires a more proactive approach and Schmall said that Volkswagen was looking to strike partnerships, with cooperation announcements due ""in some weeks"".
Volkswagen, which plans to submit its next five-year investment plan to the supervisory board on Dec. 9, is pursuing a mix of strategies, which might even include becoming a shareholder in a mining firm.
""You will see the full range,"" Schmall said, also referring to fixed and mixed price contracts with suppliers. ""You have to tailor-fit solutions, necessarily, to specific raw materials.""
This also requires making sure that materials are procured sustainably, which, in Volkswagen's case, includes transparency reports, supplier ratings, and efforts to phase out some materials, most notably cobalt.
In the end, Schmall said, the goal was to ensure that the full production chain was sustainable, adding that producing electric vehicles alone was not enough for Volkswagen, which is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050 at the latest.
""And this altogether brings us in this closed loop and hopefully show you that we are taking care from the beginning on, from the first step, from the mining process, to be sustainable, until the last point of battery lives and car lives and recycling,"" he said.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 04:57AM ET</span>","Prada sees second-hand fashion as opportunity, weighs partnerships","By Lisa Jucca
VALVIGNA, Italy (Reuters) - Italian fashion group Prada (OTC:PRDSY) sees opportunity in the booming second-hand fashion sector which it can develop both in-house and through partnerships, marketing chief and heir designate Lorenzo Bertelli told Reuters. The market for pre-owned chic bags and clothes has surged over the last three years, driven by younger, more environmentally conscious shoppers looking for affordable high-end goods. It is expected to reach 33 billion euros ($37.2 billion) in size this year after growing by 65% between 2017 and 2021, according to consultancy Bain. This compares with 12% growth for brand new luxury goods. Some rival luxury companies are already exploring the sector. Earlier this year, French conglomerate  Kering  (PA:PRTP) took a 5% stake in Vestiaire Collective, a leading platform for second-hand clothes and handbags. Kering's star brand Gucci also formed a partnership nL2N2KZ23T with U.S.-based resale platform The RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL) last year. ""Second hand is a strategy we have been investigating for more than a year,"" Lorenzo Bertelli, the eldest son of co-Chief Executives Patrizio Bertelli and Miuccia Prada and the future brand leader, said in an interview at the Reuters Next conference aired on Wednesday.
""I cannot disclose too much but for sure second hand is there. We will take it as an opportunity.
""It can be a partnership with a player or it can be something more in-house, or both of them, a sort of hybrid solution like for e-commerce,"" he said. The heir to Prada's empire, who told Reuters he wants to keep the family-controlled group independent nL8N2SF4OL when he takes the reins in a few years, doesn't seem fazed by the future challenges of the ever-changing luxury sector. For that, he thanks his experience as a rally driver.
""Rallying and sport in general taught me a lot. (It) teaches you to never give up and also a lot of humility, in the sense that you have to learn,"" he said. ""Sometimes sport is cruel, when you want to measure yourself.""

ZURICH (Reuters) -UBS has recruited former  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) executive Sarah Youngwood as its group chief financial officer, the Swiss bank said on Wednesday, making a rare female appointment in the highest echelons of European banking.
Youngwood will take over from the current CFO Kirt Gardner when he steps down in May 2022, Switzerland's biggest bank said.
The European Central Bank said earlier this year it wanted to see more diversity on the boards of banks and among executives after noting that only 8% of chief executives of European credit and investment institutions were held by women.
Only a fifth of the positions on management bodies of Europe's largest banks are held by women, the ECB's supervisory board noted, as it launched a consultation on a new guide for who would make fit and proper executives and board members.
""The European banking landscape is beginning to include more women, but progress is still too slow,"" Frank Elderson and Elizabeth McCaul, members of the supervisory board wrote in a blog post.
Alison Rose and Katie Murray, CEO and CFO respectively at NatWest Group and Ana Botin, the group executive chairman at  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) are rare examples of women at the top of their companies.
Only three members of UBS's 12-member executive board are women, although the addition of Youngwood would increase the number to four.
UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said he was excited Youngwood was joining the bank. She will join the executive board in March.
""With her strong track record, in-depth finance expertise, and experience across various banking areas, Sarah is ideally suited to lead our finance function into the future."" 
Youngwood, who has joint French-U.S. citizenship, has been the financial chief of JPMorgan Chase's Consumer & Community Banking line of business since 2016, UBS said.
Since 2020, Youngwood's role has included leading finance for JP Morgan Chases's global technology unit, as well as its diversity & inclusion team. 

Between 2012 and 2016, she was the head of investor relations for JPMorgan Chase and before that spent 14 years in various roles in the Financial Institutions Group within JPM's Investment Bank in Paris, London and New York.
Departing CFO Gardner - who has been finance chief since January 2016 - will help Youngwood during her two-month onboarding period before leaving UBS in May, UBS said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The discovery of the new Omicron coronavirus variant towards the end of November has sent markets tumbling - the culmination of a volatile month for almost every asset class globally.
Tuesday's warning from the head of drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), that current vaccines are unlikely to be as effective against Omicron, made for a painful end of the month for markets, with fresh selling across confidence-sensitive asset classes. [MKTS/GLOB]
Below is a series of charts showing the main moves.
1/RELAPSE
Roughly $2 trillion has been wiped off the value of MSCI's 50-country world stocks index since mid-November. Rising COVID-19 case numbers and moves by countries such as Austria and the Netherlands to reimpose restrictions were a warning sign but the selloff accelerated rapidly on Friday after South Africa identified the new Omicron strain. 
An attempted bounce on Monday was then quickly wiped out on Tuesday after the comments from the Moderna CEO and warnings that it could take 3-4 months to rework vaccines.

They have lost over 20% in November and the Refinitiv Global Airline index has fallen back to levels last seen a year ago. 
Graphic: Travel and Leisure, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbvgnbqkzpq/Pasted%20image%201638270358739.png 2/OIL SPILL 
Oil prices are now down 15% for the month which, like travel stocks, is also the worst month since the COVID rout. It does, however, come after a more than 400% surge in prices since that trough.

3/ THE RATE HIKE UNWIND
Money markets, which had built up expectations of how much global policymakers will raise interest rates next year, whittled them down when news of the Omicron variant emerged, only to partly restore them after hawkish comments by Fed boss Jerome Powell. 
They again price the United States to start raising rates from July 2022, having backtracked earlier to September 2022. However, bets at the start of last week had been on June. 
In British money markets too, traders now expect only a 50% probability of a 0.15% hike from the Bank of England on Dec. 16 compared to 80% probability last week, according to Refinitiv data. In Europe, markets don't expect the ECB to increase interest rates at all next year. Graphic: Rate hike bets slip as new COVID variant rattles markets, https://graphics.reuters.com/MARKETS-RATES/mopanleydva/chart.png 
4/FLIGHT TO SAFETY 
The scramble to safety has seen ultra-safe government bond rally strongly, after three monthly of sustained selling, on the theory that major central banks will have to delay plans to raise interest rates again.
Germany's 10-year Bund yield is down roughly 25 basis points this month, set for one of its biggest monthly drops of the past two years.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields - the main propellant of global borrowing costs, will end the month roughly 14 bps lower. That would end three straight months of rises. Britain's 10-year gilt yield has tumbled roughly 23 bps in its biggest monthly drop since January 2020.

5/ TURKEY AND OTHER SUBMERGING MARKETS
Emerging markets have been battered by renewed COVID concerns and dollar strength but also idiosyncratic problems in a handful of big countries. 
Turkey's lira crashed nearly 25% in November, a crisis that was largely of its own making. Under political pressure, the central bank cut interest rates for the third time in quick succession, even as inflation rocketed to 20%. 

Another big mover was South Africa, where Omicron was first detected. The rand has slumped more than 6% against the dollar this month. Omicron saw Thailand's tourism-reliant baht drop 1.5%, bringing year-to-date losses to 11%.

823,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 03:41AM ET</span>",European Stocks Higher; Rebounding After Powell-Induced Selloff,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, rebounding after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell guaranteed a rough end to November with his hawkish turn in Congress on Tuesday.
Powell signalled on Tuesday the U.S. central bank may speed up the pace of its bond-buying taper at its meeting later this month, acknowledging that inflation is proving to be more sustained and troublesome than he had expected.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France also rose 0.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1%. 
The positive start to December comes after global stock markets had ended the previous month with sharp losses as fears about the impact of the new coronavirus variant triggered a broad sell-off.
Helping the tone Wednesday were comments from Israeli Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, who stated that early data showed that those who have three doses of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Covid vaccine are well protected against the new omicron variant. 
Travel and leisure stocks were well bid, with Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) stock, IAG (LON:ICAG) stock and EasyJet (LON:EZJ) stock all rising over 4% and hotel operators Melia (MC:MEL) and  Accor  (PA:ACCP) gaining over 3% each.
That said, the surge in Covid cases remains a potential stumbling block for the region's recovery. Earlier Wednesday, the head of the Germany’s DIVI intensive-care medicine lobby said Europe's largest economy urgently needs stricter measures to check a surge in infections and protect hospitals from a “particularly dangerous situation.”
Turning to economic data, China's factory activity fell back into contraction in November, according to a business survey, with the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dropping to 49.9 in November from 50.6 the month before.
The equivalent data is also due from the Eurozone later Wednesday, while German retail sales fell 2.9% on the year in October, a sharp retreat from the revised -0.6% figure seen the month before. ING analyst Carsten Brzeski said he expects private consumption in Europe's largest economy to be a drag on growth in the fourth quarter, with an eye on soaring energy bills and renewed mobility restrictions.
Crude prices traded higher Wednesday, recouping some of the hefty losses of the previous session, ahead of a key meeting of top producers to decide future output levels. 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, gets together on Thursday. Expectations are growing that the members will agree to pause plans to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in January given the potential hit to demand from the travel restrictions put in place to tackle the new omicron variant.
The American Petroleum Institute reported a fall of 747,000 barrels from U.S. crude inventories for last week, a smaller draw than expected, and investors now await crude oil supply from the U.S. Energy Information Administration at 10:30 AM ET.
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. Crude futures traded 4% higher at $68.81 a barrel, having slumped 5.4% on Tuesday, while the Brent contract rose 4.3% to $72.19, after falling 3.9% during the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,780.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1305.

824,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 03:36AM ET</span>",China Plans to Ban Loophole Used by Tech Firms for Foreign IPOs,"(Bloomberg) -- China is planning to ban companies from going public on foreign stock markets through variable interest entities, according to people familiar with the matter, closing a loophole long used by the country’s technology industry to raise capital from overseas investors.
The ban, intended in part to address concerns over data security, is among changes included in a new draft of China’s overseas listing rules that may be finalized as soon as this month, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Companies using the so-called VIE structure would still be allowed to pursue initial public offerings in Hong Kong, subject to regulatory approval, the people said. 
Companies currently listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong that use VIEs would need to make adjustments so their ownership structures are more transparent in regulatory reviews, especially in sectors off limits for foreign investment, the people said. It’s unclear if that would mean a revamp of shareholders or, more drastically, a delisting of the most sensitive firms -- moves that could revive fears of a decoupling between China and the U.S. in areas like technology. Details of the proposed rules are still being discussed and could change.
The overhaul would represent one of Beijing’s biggest steps to crack down on overseas listings following the New York IPO of ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc (NYSE:DIDI), which proceeded despite regulatory concerns. Authorities have since moved swiftly to halt the flood of firms seeking to go public in the U.S., shuttering a path that’s generated billions of dollars for technology firms and their Wall Street backers.
It’s all part of a yearlong campaign to curb the breakneck growth of China’s internet sector and what Beijing has termed a “reckless” expansion of private capital. Banning VIEs from foreign listings would close a gap that’s been used for two decades by technology giants from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. to sidestep restrictions on foreign investment and list offshore. It potentially thwarts the ambitions of firms like ByteDance Ltd. contemplating going public outside the mainland.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
While a universal ban on the VIE structure isn’t being contemplated, a halt on foreign listings and additional review for Hong Kong IPOs would mean the model will no longer be a viable way for many startups to tap capital markets. Some investment banks have already been advised by regulators to stop work on new deals involving VIEs, a person familiar with the matter said.
The demise of the VIE route would further threaten a lucrative line of business for Wall Street banks, which have helped almost 300 Chinese firms raise about $82 billion through first-time share sales in the U.S. over the past decade.
VIEs have been a perennial worry for global investors given their shaky legal status. Pioneered by Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) Corp. and its investment bankers during a 2000 IPO, the VIE framework has never been formally endorsed by Beijing. 
It has nevertheless enabled Chinese companies to bypass rules on foreign investment in sensitive sectors including the internet industry. The structure allows a Chinese firm to transfer profits to an offshore entity -- registered in places like the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands -- with shares that foreign investors can then own.
While virtually every major Chinese internet company has used the structure, it has become increasingly worrisome for Beijing after technology firms infiltrated every corner of Chinese life and amassed reams of consumer data. Companies holding the data of more than 1 million users must undergo approval when seeking listings in other nations, the Cyberspace Administration of China said in July. 
A cybersecurity review may also be required for firms planning IPOs in Hong Kong if it’s decided that the listing will potentially have an impact on national security. The change hasn’t stopped data-rich companies like music streaming venture Cloud Village Inc. and artificial intelligence giant SenseTime Group Inc. from planning debuts in the city.
Till recently, authorities had little legal recourse to prevent sensitive overseas listings, as with the Didi IPO. Officials have asked the ride-hailing giant to devise a plan to delist from the U.S., people familiar said last week, an unprecedented request.
Since a crackdown on Didi began in early July, only one mainland-based Chinese company has priced a U.S. IPO, while 29 have listed shares in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc.’s Cloud Village will debut in the city on Thursday, while the closely-watched offering of SenseTime is expected to start trading in the week of Dec. 13. 
A senior official at the securities regulator said last week that China fully supports companies that choose Hong Kong as a primary listing venue. China doesn’t think delisting from the U.S. is a good thing for the companies, for global investors or for the China-U.S. relationship, added Shen Bing, director-general of the CSRC’s department of international affairs. 
China’s heightened regulatory scrutiny has been echoed in the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission has halted pending IPOs by Chinese companies until full disclosures of political and regulators risks are made, warning investors may not be aware they are actually buying shares of shell companies instead of direct stakes in businesses.

By Colin Packham
CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison will on Wednesday announce a parliamentary inquiry into the behaviour of the world's largest technology companies and the need for new legislation. Australia has led global efforts to rein in the powers of the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), installing legislation that has been heralded as a model for others to copy.
Raising the possibility of additional regulation, Morrison will say on Wednesday that the new inquiry will have a wide scope, but will include asking the committee lawmakers to investigate the algorithms used by social media platforms, how the companies verify identification and age and the extent to which restrictions on these are being enforced.
""Big tech has big questions to answer,"" Morrison will say, according to extracts of his planned announcement, seen by Reuters. ""Big tech created these platforms, they have a responsibility to ensure they’re safe.""

The announcement of a new inquiry is likely to stoke tensions between Australia's government and Facebook, which recently changed its name to Meta, and Google. Earlier this year Australia implemented tough new legislation that made both tech companies pay local media for content, while Canberra has proposed laws that would force them to share the identities of people with anonymous accounts if another person accuses them of defamation. When Australia proposed legislation forcing both companies to pay local media for news content, Google threatened to close its Australian search engine, while Facebook cut all third-party content from Australian accounts for more than a week. Both eventually struck deals with Australian media companies after a series of amendments to the legislation were offered.
The committee in charge of the new inquiry will report back its findings by Feb. 15, 2022.

The S&P 500 fell 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.9%, or 652 points, the Nasdaq fell 1.6%.
""The economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are high, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, which we actually announced at the November meeting, perhaps a few months sooner,”  Powell said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
In a sign that elevated inflation could persistent for longer than expected, Powell conceded that it was “good time to retire that word [transitory].”
Some, however, welcomed the change in tone on inflation from the Fed chief, and were in favor of a faster taper in the wake of a surge in inflation and a strong consumer.

“The Fed should taper [faster], I scratched my head as to why they're buying the current volume of bonds every month when we're seeing inflation, strong earnings and very strong consumer demand,"" he added.
The update from Powell rattled risk sentiment as it arrived amid uncertainty about the impact of the Omicron variant of coronavirus on the economy.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) chief executive Stéphane Bancel “warned of a material drop,” in vaccine in efficacy against the Omicron variant.
Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) also added to fears about the virus impact after saying its Covid-19 antibody drugs could be less effective against the new variant. Its shares fell more than 2%.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>","Marketmind: Transitory, you are toast","A look at the day ahead from Dhara Ranasinghe. 
If there was a word of the year for financial markets, then ""transitory"" would be a leading contender. Yet, as 2021 approaches its final stretch, its time too may be over. 
Speaking to U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell said it was probably time to ""retire"" the term used by many central banks to describe a short-term inflation surge.
Instead, Powell said a strong economy, stalled workforce growth, and high inflation that's expected to last into mid-2022, was reason enough for the Fed to start discussing whether to end bond purchases earlier than anticipated.
The result? Markets are back to pricing in a first 25 basis-point Fed hike for July 2022, versus September a day ago and U.S. Treasury yields have resumed their climb. 
Working out the Fed's next move is another task for investors -- in addition to assessing how serious an impact the Omicron coronavirus variant might have on the world economy. 
But for now, markets have started December in brighter spirits. U.S. and European share futures are higher, Asian stocks were heading for their best day in nearly two months and oil has rallied around 2%. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets later on Wednesday, ahead of Thursday's meeting of OPEC+, which groups OPEC with other oil producing allies. They will discuss how to respond to the threat of a hit to fuel demand from the Omicron variant. 
The latest U.S. ISM manufacturing survey, out later this session, will also be in focus.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investcorp is gearing up to sell Italian motorcycle clothing brand Dainese in a deal that could value the 49-year firm, favoured by motorcycle racer Valentino Rossi, at about 750 million euros, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Bahrain-based private equity firm, which has a history of turning around upmarket luxury brands including Gucci and Tiffany, has hired Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) to launch a sales process for the company, known for its motorcycling racing wear, at the start of 2022, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Investcorp, which took control of Dainese in 2014 for 130 million euros, aims to cash out for about 750 million euros ($848 million) and if successful, it could make almost six times its money from the sale.
Dainese and Investcorp declined to comment.
Investcorp, with $37.6 billion of assets under management as of June 30, has clinched more than eight acquisitions this year through both its flagship private equity fund and technology fund which focuses on established European tech businesses.
Its co-Chief Executive Hazem Ben-Gacem led the Dainese acquisition in 2014 and acted as vice chairman of the company's board until 2018.
Under Investcorp's ownership, Dainese has more than tripled its core earnings and diversified its product range providing protective gear for winter sports, biking and horse riding.
The company, founded in 1972 in the northeastern Italian town of Colceresa near Vicenza, also ranks as a leading manufacturer of protective helmets for the motorcycle market through its AGV brand.
Dainese fared well during the COVID-19 pandemic as it benefited from increased interest in outdoor activities and wellbeing, the source said.

Its founder Lino Dainese, who has retained a minority stake in the business, has patented the so-called D-Air air bag system which detects a dangerous fall and deploys special airbags to protect motorcyclists.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Wednesday, rebounding after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell guaranteed a rough end to November with his hawkish turn in Congress on Tuesday.
Powell signalled on Tuesday the U.S. central bank may speed up the pace of its bond-buying taper at its meeting later this month, acknowledging that inflation is proving to be more sustained and troublesome than he had expected.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%.
The positive start to December comes after global stock markets had ended the previous month with sharp losses as fears about the impact of the new coronavirus variant triggered a broad sell-off.
Helping the tone were comments from Israeli Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, who stated late Tuesday that early data showed that those who have three doses of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Covid vaccine are well protected against the new omicron variant. 
Investors had been fretting over the efficacy of the current vaccines in combating the new variant after  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) chief Stephane Bancel predicted a ‘material drop’ in their effectiveness earlier this week.
“The only winner in December is likely to be volatility as The Street sells everything on any negative omicron headline, and then buys everything back on any hint that the new variant isn’t as serious as we all thought,” said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at MarketPulse, in a note. 
Turning to economic data, China's factory activity fell back into contraction in November, according to a business survey, with the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dropping to 49.9 in November from 50.6 the month before.
The equivalent data is also due from the Eurozone later Wednesday, while German retail sales fell 2.9% on the year in October, a sharp retreat from the -0.9% figure seen the month before.
Crude prices traded higher Wednesday, recouping some of the hefty losses of the previous session, ahead of a key meeting of top producers to decide future output levels. 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, gets together on Thursday. Expectations are growing that the members will agree to pause plans to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in January given the potential hit to demand from the travel restrictions put in place to tackle the new omicron variant.
The American Petroleum Institute reported a fall of 747,000 barrels from U.S. crude inventories for last week, a smaller draw than expected, and investors now await crude oil supply from the U.S. Energy Information Administration at 10:30 AM ET.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.7% higher at $67.95 a barrel, having slumped 5.4% on Tuesday, while the Brent contract rose 3% to $71.30, after falling 3.9% during the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,789.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1335.

834,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 01:21AM ET</span>",Zero-sugar Oreos see weak China response despite healthy snacking trend,"By Siddharth Cavale and Sophie Yu
(Reuters) - Initial reaction from the launch of Oreo Zero sugar-free cookies in China has been disappointing,  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ)'s CEO said, underscoring some of the challenges facing the global snack giant as it makes a big push in the market.
Mondelez launched Oreo Zero in China in August, taking a cue from social media trends showing reduced-sugar and sugar-free diets as a key trend, and the limited availability of zero-sugar biscuits in the country. 
""The reaction of the consumer has been a little bit disappointing ... for one reason or the other, the consumers feel it is not the real thing,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dirk Van de Put told Reuters.
""This indicates the dilemma,"" he said. ""We can offer the products to the consumer, but it's not given that the consumer will buy and eat them.""
Mondelez, which also makes Ritz crackers, belVita biscuits, Cadbury chocolates and Trident gum, has set a target to grow Oreo sales by $1 billion by the end of 2023. The brand surpassed $3 billion in global sales in 2019.
Oreo Zero cookies contain maltitol instead of traditional sugars like sucrose and glucose, and the tweak gives a very slight difference in taste that only heavy consumers of regular Oreos would be able to identify, according to the company.
The lukewarm consumer response underscores a challenge for global snack firms with a well-known brand and product. Mondelez varies the amount of sugar it includes in Oreos in different markets around the world. In China, Oreos have less sugar than do Oreos in the United States, which could make for an easier transition to no-sugar cookies.
Chinese consumers, however, remain cautious about packaged foods' no-sugar claims, said Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina. 
For example, sugar-free drinks commanded only 1.25% of China's soft drinks market in 2019, according to a June Dongxing Securities report, though Genki Forest's sugar-free fizzy drinks and Suntory's Oolong tea are gaining popularity. 
FOR CHINA
Despite weak initial demand, Van de Put said Mondelez will continue to sell Oreo Zero in China, comparing it to Diet Coke, a sugar-free soda which he said also received muted consumer response at first, but has now become one of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)'s top selling product globally.
""The consumer's mind is very difficult to identify in this area,"" he said.
Chicago, Illinois-based Mondelez, in an emailed statement, declined to say whether it would sell Oreo Zero globally. Its biscuit sales in China rose by mid-single digits during the third quarter, with Oreos being the ""standout performer,"" Luca Zaramella, Mondelez's chief financial officer said on a November conference call.
Mondelez does not disclose sales figures for the new Oreo product. 

""Winning in India and China is absolutely critical,"" said Van de Put, who became CEO in 2017. Both countries have high rates of diabetes. 
Van de Put also told Reuters that he expects Mondelez's business in Asia, the Middle East and Africa (AMEA) to overtake North America as its second-biggest market within five years. Of Mondelez's $26.5 billion total revenue in 2020, AMEA accounted for 22%, North America 31%, while Europe accounted for 38%, its annual report showed.

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic has not dented prospects for European stocks to hit record highs in 2022, boosted by a recovery in corporate profits, according to a Reuters poll of 23 fund managers, strategists and brokers.
The poll, conducted over the past two weeks, predicted Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 blue chip indexes would hit uncharted highs by mid-2022, rising about 8% and 6% from Monday's close respectively. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 would gain 7% and reach 500 points by July, 10 points above the lifetime peak hit on Nov. 17, according to the Nov. 15-30 poll.
Although European stocks tumbled 3.7% on Friday when fears about the impact of the new coronavirus variant triggered a broad sell-off, they are still up about 17% since the start of the year. 
A robust bounce back in profits from the lockdown-triggered recession of 2020 lies behind this year's strong performance.
According to the latest Refinitiv I/B/E/S data, the third-quarter earnings season saw profits jump 58.8% after surges of 96.4% and 152.6% in the first two quarters.
""We expect earnings to be the key driver for global equities, and this is also true for the euro zone,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) chief global strategist Philipp Lisibach.
He expected high single-​digit equity returns in 2022 compared to double-​digit returns in 2021.
However, the resurgent pandemic in Europe and announcements of new social restrictions in Austria and elsewhere have knocked morale.
HEADWINDS 
Euro zone economic sentiment eased in November amid consumer concerns about a fourth wave of the coronavirus, while German business morale deteriorated for the fifth consecutive month in November as supply bottlenecks hit manufacturing.
""Headwinds in Europe are suddenly increasing with rising energy prices, rising infections and delays in deliveries. This creates short-term uncertainty, but the situation should abate going into next year,"" said Tomas Hildebrandt, senior portfolio manager at Evli Bank in Helsinki. 
Most analysts still have a positive outlook going forward, but some predict a grim year ahead for stocks. 
Stephane Ekolo, a strategist at the brokerage Tradition, sees the STOXX 600 losing about 30 points to 430 points at the end of 2022, as economic growth slows.
""I believe corporate earnings are likely to deteriorate over the coming six months ... on the back of continued supply-chain disruptions, reopening boost fading, potential risk of restrictions and rising real rates,"" Ekolo said.
Among risks cited by the poll respondents was a spike in inflation that would force the European Central Bank to speed up the reduction in monetary stimulus.
Consumer prices in Germany rose 6% year on year after a rise of 4.6% in October, increasing pressure on the ECB to react.
But a rise in interest rates would likely boost European banks, already up 28% this year, as they typically thrive when interest rates expectations go up.
The French presidential election in April offers further uncertainty in 2022, with incumbent Emmanuel Macron likely to face far-right challenger.
""A victory for a euroskeptic president would be a risk for European integration,"" Credit Suisse's Lisibach noted.

The law firm, Phi Finney McDonald, filed a class-action suit in the federal court against Australia's No. 4 lender for charging interest between July 2010 and January 2019 on purchases that should have been interest-free.
""The terms of ANZ's contract made it impossible for a typical consumer to understand that they would be charged retrospective interest, even on purchases which they repaid on time,"" the law firm said in a statement.
Australia outlawed charging retrospective interest in January 2019.
The lawsuit alleged ""unfair contract terms and unconscionable conduct"" by the bank, but did not specify the damages it was seeking against ANZ in the federal court.
ANZ said in a statement it would review the claim that its contract contravened the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act.

The lawsuit is the latest in a string of legal actions faced by Australia's top banks, ranging from breach of consumer protection credit laws to charging financial advice fees to dead customers. 
Scrutiny of Australian lenders and financial institutions has ramped up significantly since a Royal Commission inquiry in 2018 found widespread shortcomings in the sector, forcing companies and regulators to take swift action.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 12:00AM ET</span>",U.S. FDA panel narrowly backs Merck's at-home COVID-19 pill,"By Michael Erman and Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - A panel of expert advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday narrowly voted to recommend the agency authorize Merck & Co's antiviral pill to treat COVID-19.
If the FDA authorizes the drug, it would be the first at-home treatment for the virus nearly two years into the pandemic. The authorization would likely be limited to patients at high risk of developing severe disease, although the exact population would be defined by the agency.
Merck published data last week suggesting the drug was significantly less effective than previously thought, reducing hospitalizations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk individuals by around 30%. 
""COVID-19 is still an emergency situation,"" said committee member Dr. David Hardy, who voted yes. ""There is a need for something like this. This is the first opportunity that an oral outpatient medication for mildly symptomatic to moderately symptomatic persons would be available, although I do have questions about its overall longer-term efficacy.""
The vote comes as fears about the new Omicron variant have rattled financial markets and sparked concerns about the strength of the global economic recovery as the world continues to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Merck's oral therapy called molnupiravir, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, targets part of the virus called the RNA polymerase that has not been changed much by mutations in the Omicron variant. The pill - and a potentially more promising drug being developed by  Pfizer  - could become even more vital if vaccine-induced and natural immunity are threatened by the variant.
""If you look at the sequence of the of the RNA polymerase, the sequence of the Omicron variant is not very different from all of these other variants, so you would predict that it should be equally active,"" Merck scientist Daria Hazuda said in an interview.
Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s rival pill Paxlovid showed an 89% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths in its clinical trial. The FDA could consider that drug within the next few months.
The FDA's Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee voted 13-10 to recommend the agency authorize the drug after discussing concerns the drug could cause the virus to mutate as well as safety concerns about the potential for birth defects. Both FDA staff scientists and Merck have suggested the drug should not be recommended during pregnancy.
Several members said the reduced number of COVID-related deaths in people who received the drug in the trial convinced them to vote in favor of recommending authorization. Only one patient in the molnupiravir arm died, versus nine in the placebo group.
The United Kingdom conditionally approved molnupiravir, branded as Lagevrio, earlier this month.

Merck expects to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of this year, with at least 20 million set to be manufactured in 2022. 
The U.S. government has a contract to buy as many as 5 million courses of the drug at a price of $700 per course. By comparison, the U.S. paid around $20 a dose for its supply of the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

Powell said the next Fed meeting should discuss whether to wrap up asset tapering a few months earlier, and did not use the word “transitory” to describe high inflation. This could also mean earlier-than-expected interest rate hikes.

Markets have recently been volatile as central banks begin withdrawing monetary policy support and omicron’s impact on the economic recovery remains unknown.
The gap between yields on 5-year and 30-year U.S. Treasuries shrunk during the U.S. session and remained near its narrowest since March 2020.

She added that “alarm bells go off in terms of recession” when the curve gets closer to inverting, and recommended also monitoring lower quality-corporate bond spreads for a gauge on sentiment

NEW YORK (Reuters) -New York state's attorney general on Tuesday asked a state judge to appoint a monitor to oversee worker safety at an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) fulfillment center in New York City, citing the retailer's alleged rollbacks of COVID-19 safety measures that were ""already inadequate."" 
Letitia James, the attorney general, also wants a court order requiring the rehiring of Christian Smalls, who Amazon fired for allegedly violating a paid quarantine by leading a March 2020 protest over conditions at the Staten Island facility.
James, a Democrat running to become New York governor, sued https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-complaint/new-york-attorney-general-sues-amazon-over-covid-19-shortfalls-idUSKBN2AH0C2 Amazon in February in a New York state court in Manhattan over its safety protocols for thousands of workers at the Staten Island facility and a distribution center in the New York City borough of Queens.
She said Amazon is valuing profit over safety and ""acting as if the pandemic is over"" by rolling back safety protocols even as the Omicron variant https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/omicron-variant-could-outcompete-delta-south-african-disease-expert-says-2021-11-30 of the COVID-19 virus threatens to increase transmission rates.
The alleged rollbacks include making the Staten Island facility ""mask-optional"" for vaccinated workers while not requiring masks for unvaccinated workers, and failing to enforce social distancing.
In her motion for a preliminary injunction, James said the proposed monitor would oversee upgraded cleaning, hygiene and social distancing procedures.
""While case rates, hospitalizations, and deaths rise, Amazon rescinds protections and packs in more workers for its holiday rush,"" James said in her motion. ""Amazon's ongoing - and worsening - failure to protect workers must be halted."" 
Amazon said in a statement it has taken a ""comprehensive approach"" to COVID-19 safety.
""It's disappointing that the Attorney General is seeking to politicize the pandemic by asking for 'emergency' relief now despite having filed this lawsuit nine months ago,"" Amazon said.

The Seattle-based company is appealing a judge's refusal in October to dismiss James' lawsuit.

Even though we are past Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there's plenty of shopping left, especially for consumers that like to wait until the week before Christmas. In fact, a lot of businesses count on the holidays for a huge revenue boost.
This is especially true of consumer companies. While consumer businesses typically see steady sales over the course of the year, they really count on the holidays to boost their profits. This year is expected to be no different. If you think of gifts that people really want, aside from the latest tech device, its products like fragrances, apparel, and jewelry.
These are the types of gifts that fit perfectly in stockings. And the companies that sell these gifts can also make great investments, especially if they're ranked highly in our POWR Ratings system.

Last month, Microsoft reported strong growth in its Azure segment, its flagship cloud-computing business. While Google Cloud's third-quarter revenue rose 45% to $4.99 billion. 
On a post-earnings call, Taylor touted the performance of Slack, a workplace messaging app Salesforce bought in a $27.7 billion deal, but signaled the company was not keen on any M&A in the near term. 
However, Salesforce reported better-than-expected revenue for the third quarter, boosted by strong demand for its cloud-based software.

Revenue rose 27% to $6.86 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31, beating analysts' estimate of $6.8 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Stripping one-time costs, the company reported earnings of $1.27 per share, also above estimates of 92 cents per share.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 06:47PM ET</span>",Officials offer vaccine reassurance; WHO advises against travel bans,"By Ludwig Burger and Emma Thomasson
FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - The World Health Organization warned countries on Tuesday not to impose blanket travel bans over the new Omicron coronavirus variant as governments and scientists try to determine how much protection current vaccines would offer against the strain.
Financial markets fell sharply after the head of drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said existing COVID-19 vaccines would be less effective against the Omicron variant. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.39% a day after broad declines in Europe and Asia.[MKTS/GLOB]
BioNTech's chief executive struck a cautiously positive note, saying the vaccine it makes in a partnership with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) would likely offer strong protection against severe disease from Omicron, which was first reported in southern Africa a week ago.
The questions over vaccine effectiveness came as cases of the new variant spread, with the first reported case in Latin America emerging in Brazil. The country's health regulator, Anvisa, said a traveller arriving in Sao Paulo from South Africa and his wife were both apparently infected.
Canada will extend its ban on travellers from southern Africa to also cover those from Nigeria, Malawi and Egypt, health officials said on Tuesday, for a total of 10 countries. Canada will require people arriving by air from all nations except the United States to take a COVID-19 test, Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday advised Americans against travel to Niger, Papua New Guinea, Poland, and Trinidad and Tobago. The CDC now lists about 80 destinations at its ""Level 4: Very High"" classification after the White House announced new travel restrictions in response to Omicron.
The World Health Organization (WHO) asked countries to apply ""an evidence-informed and risk-based approach"" with any travel measures, including possible screening or quarantine of international passengers. Blanket travel bans would not stop the spread of Omicron, it said.
The WHO issued a statement advising a postponement of travel for those who are unwell or at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, including those 60 years or older who are not vaccinated.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he understood the concerns about Omicron.
But he added: ""I am equally concerned that several member states are introducing blunt, blanket measures that are not evidence-based or effective on their own, and which will only worsen inequities.""
VACCINE QUESTIONS
The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) executive director, Emer Cooke, told the European Parliament that existing vaccines will continue to provide protection. 
Andrea Ammon, chair of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), said the cases of Omicron so far confirmed in 10 European Union countries were mild or without symptoms, although in younger age groups.
News of Omicron's emergence wiped roughly $2 trillion off global stocks on Friday, after it was first identified in southern Africa and announced on Nov. 25.
U.S. markets on Tuesday reacted mainly to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments signalling a possible speed-up in the taper of the Fed's asset purchase program, but concerns over Omicron's impact added to jitters, market analysts said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 652.22 points, or 1.86%, to 34,483.72, and the S&P 500 lost 88.27 points, or 1.90%, to 4,567.
""There is no world, I think, where (the effectiveness) is the same level...we had with Delta,"" Moderna's CEO, Stephane Bancel, told the Financial.
""I think it's going to be a material drop. I just don't know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I've talked to ... are like, 'this is not going to be good'.""
Reuters could not reach Moderna for comment.
The University of Oxford said there was no evidence that current vaccines would not prevent severe disease from Omicron, but that it was ready to rapidly update its shot, developed with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), if necessary.

The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden suffered two more legal setbacks on vaccine policy on Tuesday. A federal judge blocked a vaccination rule for healthcare workers and applied the ruling nationwide where the mandate was still in effect.
Another federal judge blocked the U.S government from enforcing a vaccination mandate on government contractors in three states.
LAB TESTS
Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) Pharmaceuticals said its COVID-19 antibody cocktail and other similar antiviral treatments could be less effective against the latest variant.
EMA's Cooke said ""cross neutralisation,"" a lab test for whether the approved vaccines are effective against Omicron, would take about two weeks. If there was a need to change COVID-19 vaccines, new ones could be approved within three or four months, she said.
""Vaccination will likely still keep you out of the hospital,"" said John Wherry, director of the Penn Institute for Immunology in Philadelphia.
Moderna and fellow drugmakers BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are already working on vaccines that specifically target Omicron. Moderna has also been testing a higher dose of its existing booster.
BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters that BioNTech and Pfizer's vaccine was likely to offer strong protection against severe disease from the new variant.
Sahin said he expects lab tests to show some loss of protection against mild and moderate disease due to Omicron but the extent of that loss was hard to predict.
BORDER CONTROLS
Border closures have already cast a shadow over economic recovery, with parts of Europe now seeing a fourth wave of infections as winter sets in. 
Japan confirmed its first case of the new variant on Tuesday, in a traveller from Namibia. Australia found that a person with Omicron had visited a busy shopping centre in Sydney while probably infectious. 
Graphic: The spread of COVID-19 variants of concern: https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/VARIANTS/jznpnyoorvl/spread_of_voc.jpg 
Australia on Monday delayed the reopening of its international borders by two weeks, less than 36 hours before foreign students and skilled migrants were to be allowed back. 
Britain and the United States have both pushed their booster programmes in response to the new variant. London said international arrivals would have to self-isolate until they get a negative result in a PCR test.
Greece said vaccination would be compulsory for those over 60, the group seen as most vulnerable to COVID-19.
The picture of COVID cases was mixed.
In Germany, a current hotspot of the previous significant variant, Delta, the seven-day average infection rate fell slightly for the first time in three weeks after new restrictions to slow transmission.

France registered its highest daily infection tally since April. And the Dutch health authority said Omicron was already spreading in the Netherlands, where intensive care beds are running out and measures including restrictions on hospitality have yet to take effect.
The curbs on travellers from southern Africa have highlighted the inequality of vaccine distribution, which may have given the virus more opportunities to mutate.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The U.S. labor secretary on Tuesday met with unions and employers at the nation's busiest port complex in Southern California as anxiety builds ahead of next year's contract negotiations covering roughly 22,000 West Coast dockworkers.
The contract expires in July, and the stakes are particularly high at the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex that handles some 40% of U.S. imports. Docks at the side-by-side ports are crowded with cargo boxes and more than four dozen container ships are waiting to unload as retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) scramble to stock shelves with holiday gifts. 
The last round of talks in 2014 and 2015 were contentious, leading to temporary port shutdowns. A repeat of that could harm a U.S. economy already grappling with inflation fueled by soaring shipping costs and product shortages.
Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said interested parties are talking and that he is available, should the two sides reach an impasse. ""If need be and I'm asked, I would definitely step in anytime to offer my support to try and get to resolution,"" Walsh said. 
The International Longshore & Warehouse Union (ILWU) that represents workers at 29 ports in California, Oregon and Washington recently rejected a one-year contract extension offer from the 70 ocean carriers and terminal operators represented by the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA).
The PMA in a statement said it believed that a one-year contract extension with the ILWU would be in the best interests of the national economy, but that it ""will be prepared to meet at the bargaining table next year."" 
The ILWU said its members had already approved an earlier extension to the contract and that members have been waiting seven years to address issues that are important to dockworkers. 
The contract expiration coincides with a resurgence of interest in organized labor. U.S. workers - frustrated that wages have severely lagged soaring profits at companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) are fighting for better pay and the right to unionize. 
To that end, container shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, AP Moller-Maersk and other international carriers are reaping big profits from the record-setting, pandemic-fueled cargo surge.

ILWU International President Willie Adams in a statement called on shipping companies and terminal operators to invest in good jobs in the communities that support their bottom lines.
""These profits show why collective bargaining ... is necessary and hugely beneficial for America's economy,"" Adams said.

Hence it could be best to avoid retail stocks with weak financials — Gap (GPS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN).Black Friday sales increased but reflected the supply chain challenges. According to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics data, customers spent about $8.9 billion online on Black Friday, slightly less than the spending in 2020.
As per Sensormatic Solutions data, Black Friday traffic at retail stores was down 28.3% from its 2019 level due to the popularity of online purchases and shoppers spreading out their holiday spending throughout the season. Moreover, the newly identified omicron coronavirus variant triggered a worldwide alarm that caused stores on Black Friday to experience the lowest level of clearance goods for sale in five years.
Given this backdrop, fundamentally weak retail stocks, The Gap, Inc. (GPS) and Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN), could be best avoided now.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the U.S. central bank would consider speeding up its withdrawal of bond purchases as inflation risks increase, piling pressure onto a market already nervous about the latest COVID-19 variant. 
In a testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Powell indicated that he no longer considers high inflation as ""transitory"" and that the Fed would revisit the timeline for scaling back its bond buying program at its next meeting in two weeks.
""Powell's comments threw a monkey in the wrench in market thinking in terms of potential taper timing. You're seeing as a result of that, risk-off across the board,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. 
""You also have to factor in the Omicron variant concerns. You can argue whether they're more headline risk or reality risk but regardless, it's having a significant impact on oil, and everything that's tied to economic growth.""
Powell's comments also prompted speculation among some investors about a potential acceleration in interest rate hikes. 
""The principal contributor to the decline in stock prices today is the Powell commentary, regarding the upcoming Fed meeting, about accelerating the tapering of their bond buying program, which obviously leads to the prospect that rate hikes come sooner next year,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
""That somewhat hawkish shift in tone caught the market flatfooted,"" Luschini said. 
Meanwhile, the market was also left waiting for information about how dangerous the Omicron variant might be, the degree to which current vaccinations could offer protection and the additional restrictions governments might have to impose that could hurt the economy, Luschini said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 652.22 points, or 1.86%, to 34,483.72, the S&P 500 lost 88.27 points, or 1.90%, to 4,567 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 245.14 points, or 1.55%, to 15,537.69.
For the month, the S&P registered a decline of 0.8%, while the Dow dropped 3.7% and the Nasdaq eked out a 0.25% gain. 
Only seven of the benchmark S&P 500 components gained ground on Tuesday.
For the day, all the 11 major S&P industry sectors fell with seven of those sectors falling more than 2%. Communication services lead the losses with a 3% drop followed by Utilities' 2.9% drop. As oil prices tumbled, energy were under pressure throughout the session, closing down 2.5%.
The top performer was information technology, falling just 0.96%, with help from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which boasted a recording closing high and a 3.2% gain for the day. 
Tuesday's decline was a sharp reversal after Monday's rally in which stocks regained some ground they had lost on Friday when the market sold-off swiftly on news of the virus variant. 
""The market is clearly in some treacherous waters right now. You've had two significant pullbacks out of the last three trading days. This is certainly shaking some of the complacent longs in the market,"" said Wedbush's James. 
While the Food and Drug Administration said it hopes to have information about the effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines against Omicron, vaccine companies were divided.
BioNTech's chief executive said the vaccine his company supplies in partnership with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) will likely offer strong protection from severe illness in variant cases. But  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's CEO told the Financial Times that COVID-19 shots are unlikely to be as effective against the new variant as they have been previously.
Moderna shares fell 4.4% while Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) lost 2.7% after it said its COVID-19 antibody treatment and other similar drugs could be less effective against Omicron. 
Travel and leisure stocks slumped, with the S&P 1500 Hotels, Restaurant and Leisure indexes fell more than 2% while the S&P 1500 Airlines index lost 0.6%.
The small-cap Russell 2000 index fell 1.9%.
The virus uncertainty has triggered fresh alarm at a time when supply chain logjams are weighing on economic recovery and central banks globally are contemplating a return to pre-pandemic monetary policy to tackle a surge in inflation.
Meanwhile, data showed U.S. consumer confidence slipped in November amid concerns about the rising cost of living and relentless COVID-19 pandemic.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.82-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and 45 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 28 new highs and 572 new lows.
Tuesday registered the highest volume trading session for U.S. exchanges since June with 16.13 billion shares changing hands, compared with the 11.12 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock benchmarks and oil prices fell sharply on Tuesday after drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) warned that existing vaccines are unlikely to be as effective against the new coronavirus variant, spurring investors to pile into safe-haven assets such as government bonds and the yen. 
""There is no world, I think, where (the effectiveness) is the same level,"" Moderna's chief executive, Stephane Bancel, told the Financial Times in an interview, comparing the effectiveness against the new Omicron variant to prior variants.
""I think it's going to be a material drop. I just don't know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I've talked to ... are like 'this is not going to be good,'"" Bancel said. 
Bancel said earlier on CNBC that there should be more clarity on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines against the Omicron variant in about two weeks, but it could take months to begin shipping a reworked vaccine designed for it.
""It's not good news, and it's coming from someone who should know,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency strategist Joe Capurso. ""Markets have reacted in exactly the way you'd expect them to.""
Losses accelerated after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress that high inflation will persist until the middle of next year, leaving the central bank ""likely"" to discuss speeding up the tapering of the asset-buying program it introduced last year to support the economy during the pandemic.
""We've long maintained that the Fed is the ultimate owner of the 'transitory' characterization and the chair's decision to move beyond that is a decidedly hawkish step,"" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets. 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.39% following broad declines in Europe and Asia. Concerns that the new variant would lead to more travel restrictions continued to hammer European travel and leisure stocks, which posted their biggest monthly fall since the initial COVID-19 lockdowns in March 2020.

Societe Generale agreed to the payment in November 2018 to resolve federal and New York state claims that from 2003 to 2013 it handled billions of dollars of transactions for parties associated with countries subject to embargoes or sanctions, including Cuba, Iran, Libya and Sudan.
U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan on Tuesday signed an order in which the Justice Department said it ""will not now proceed with the prosecution"" of Societe Generale because the bank complied with its three-year agreement.
Societe Generale reached a separate agreement at the time to pay $95 million to resolve a New York regulator's claims it had violated anti-money laundering regulations.
The bank at the time acknowledged and regretted the shortcomings identified in its settlements, and said it had cooperated with authorities to resolve them.
Societe Generale's $1.34 billion payout was the second-largest against a bank for violating U.S. sanctions.

The largest was an approximately $8.9 billion payout by France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA in 2015.
Deferred prosecution agreements are sometimes viewed as a form of probation that let companies avoid criminal charges if they comply with the terms.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday questioned whether members of the Sackler family that owned Purdue Pharma abused the bankruptcy system, as she considers whether to overturn a ruling that shielded the Sacklers from liability over the opioid epidemic.
U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan said she wanted more information about more than $10 billion that the Sacklers, according to court documents, received from Purdue between 2008 and 2018, when they left the company’s board. 
“I’m looking for whether there was abuse,” she said during a hearing. 
One Sackler family lawyer replied that there was no evidence to suggest abuse. The Sacklers have denied wrongdoing and did not themselves file for bankruptcy. They contributed $4.5 billion to the bankruptcy settlement in exchange for protection against future litigation. 
McMahon's remarks came during arguments over appeals of a bankruptcy court’s approval in September of Purdue’s reorganization plan, which included releases of future opioid-related civil claims against the Sacklers. 
The U.S. Department of Justice’s bankruptcy watchdog and a small group of states are challenging the plan's approval, claiming the Sacklers should not receive the legal protections it provides.
McMahon suggested that the Sacklers may have protected their wealth by taking as much money from Purdue as they could in the years before the bankruptcy. 
“People were aware claims were going to be asserted. Advisors told them to take steps to protect the family,” she said.
A lawyer for the Mortimer Sackler side of the family, Maura Monaghan of Debevoise & Plimpton, told the judge there was “not a shred of evidence” that the Sacklers made any decisions with the intention that Purdue would ultimately wind up in bankruptcy. She noted that the Sacklers left the Purdue board in 2018, before the 2019 bankruptcy filing, and that the last distributions they received from the company occurred around 2016.
Monaghan said the judge’s concern about potential bankruptcy abuse “would be based on nothing but speculation.”

But the judge said she may send the matter back to the bankruptcy judge who approved the deal this fall.
Around 500,000 people have died from opioid overdoses since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Purdue filed for bankruptcy in September 2019 in the face of 3,000 lawsuits accusing it and Sacklers of contributing to the opioid crisis.

The catalyst for this sell-off looks to be the fact that the general markets have become much turbulent following the discovery of a new strain of the virus, omicron, in South Africa.
With inflation on the rise, supply chains continuing to be pressured, and valuations in nosebleed territory, it’s no surprise that the market has softened these developments. However, while higher inflation and negative real rates are good for precious metals, silver seems to be at mercy to the general markets temporarily. Let’s take a closer look below:
As noted above, we’ve seen an increase in volatility in the markets this week, and it’s put a major dent in the silver price, which is down more than 4% for the month after starting the month up 3%. This has the silver/gold ratio teetering on a major support level (weekly moving average), and the key will be keeping the gold/silver ratio below 80 to prevent further weakness.

Therefore, prominent apparel retailers  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) should benefit. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU) and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) are two popular companies in the apparel retail industry. LULU designs, manufactures, and distributes men’s and women’s athletic apparel and accessories. The company sells its products through its Lululemon and Ivivva-branded stores, outlets and warehouse sales, yoga studios, health clubs, fitness centers, mobile apps, and lululemon.com e-commerce website. On the other hand, ANF offers an assortment of apparel, personal care products, intimates, and accessories for men, women, and children. The company sells its Abercrombie and Hollister brand products through its stores, direct-to-consumer channels, third-party wholesalers, franchises and licensing arrangements, and e-commerce platforms.
The strong digital presence established by most apparel retailers has enabled them to rebound from their pandemic-lows, introduce new fashion in sync with the changing consumer trends, and expand their reach. Moreover, rising foot traffic, declining jobless claims, and increasing consumer spending led to strong retail sales. The National Retail Federation (NRF) forecasts holiday retail sales to rise between 8.5% -10.5% during November and December. 
Although the recent breakout of the omicron coronavirus variant is expected to slow down foot traffic to the brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce sales are to help the industry generate solid earnings this holiday season. Investors’ interest in retail stocks is evident from the SPDR S&P Retail ETF’s (XRT) 2.5% returns over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 1.2% gains. So, both LULU and ANF should benefit.

While oil prices retreated on concerns over the omicron coronavirus variant, analysts expect the prices to hit $100 per barrel. Therefore, it could be wise to buy the dip in oil & gas stocks such as China Petroleum & Chemical (NYSE:SNP), APA Corp.

Moreover, oil prices rose more than 50% this year, with demand outpacing supply as countries came out from lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed last year. In an effort to bring down prices, President Biden announced that the federal government would be releasing 50 million barrels of crude oil from its strategic oil reserves. However, desired effects may not be achieved, and analysts anticipate the strategy could drive prices to $100 per barrel.
According to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) analysts, Brent prices can reach $120 per barrel in 2022 and $150 per barrel in 2023, with the OPEC+ cartel keeping a tight supply. Moreover, the recent drop in oil prices is tied to concerns over the omicron coronavirus variant and is expected to be short-lived.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 05:25PM ET</span>",Brazil's Nubank slashes IPO valuation target to about $40 billion,"(Reuters) -Brazilian digital bank Nu Holdings slashed the targeted price range for its U.S. stock market flotation by about 18% on Tuesday, to roughly $40 billion, as a recent global sell-off in technology stocks weighs on year-end initial public offerings. 
The company, known as Nubank, had earlier aimed for an IPO valuation of more than $50 billion on the back of a record-breaking boom in U.S. capital markets.
But a recent rise in Treasury yields has dampened investor sentiment toward major tech stocks, while the new coronavirus variant, Omicron, has raised fears of fresh damage from the almost two-year-long pandemic.
In a statement on its blog, Nubank said it decided to trim its price range to align with current market conditions. ""Our focus is and has always been in the long term. For this reason, we sought to set a price range in line with markets at this moment.""
In an amended filing with the U.S. securities regulator, Sao Paulo-based Nubank said it now planned to sell about 289.2 million shares priced between $8 and $9 each. At the top end of the range, it would raise $2.6 billion at a valuation of $41.5 billion.
Affiliates of Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global Management, SoftBank Latin America Funds, Dragoneer, TCV, Sands Capital,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are expected to anchor the IPO and buy shares worth at least $1.3 billion, Nubank said.
Backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, the company had earlier planned to raise nearly $3 billion by selling shares priced between $10 and $11 apiece.
Even at the lowered target valuation, Nubank would be worth more than Brazil’s largest traditional lender, Itau Unibanco Holding SA, which has a market capitalization of $37.5 billion. 
The digital bank's planned stock market float comes on the heels of several big U.S. IPOs in 2021, including fintech heavyweights like  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) and Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Inc. 
Investors, however, have been wary of backing Latin American fintech companies with questionable business models after Brazilian payments firm StoneCo posted hefty losses in its most recent quarterly results. StoneCo shares have declined more than 80% this year. 

Nubank was founded in 2013 by David Velez, a Stanford-educated Colombian, as an issuer of credit cards that charged no annual fee. The company said last month it had managed to turn a profit in the first half of 2021 in its Brazilian operations.
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and NuInvest are the lead underwriters for Nubank's offering.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 05:00PM ET</span>","Jack Dorsey chases crypto, fintech dream post Twitter","By Krystal Hu and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - At a packed Miami conference in June, Jack Dorsey, mused in front of thousands of attendees about where his real passion lay: ""If I weren't at Square or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), I'd be working on bitcoin.""
On Monday, Dorsey made good on one part of that, announcing he would leave Twitter for the second time, handing the CEO position to a 10-year veteran at the firm. The 45-year-old entrepreneur, who is often described as an enigma with varied interests from meditation to yoga to fashion design, plans to pursue his passion which include focusing on running  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) and doing more philanthropic work, according to a source familiar with his plan. 
Well before the surprise news, Dorsey had laid the groundwork for his next chapter, seeding both companies with crypto-related projects.
Underlying Dorsey's broader vision is the principle of ""decentralization,"" or the idea that technology and finance should not be concentrated among a handful of gatekeepers, as it is now, but should, instead, be steered by the hands of the many, either people or entities.
The concept has played out at Square, which has built a division devoted to working on projects and awarding grants with the aim of growing bitcoin's popularity globally.
Dorsey has been a longtime proponent of bitcoin, and the appeal is that the cryptocurrency will allow for private and secure transactions with the value of bitcoin unrelated to any government. 
The idea has also underpinned new projects at Twitter, where Dorsey tapped a top lieutenant - and now the company's new CEO Parag Agrawal - to oversee a team that is attempting to construct a decentralized social media protocol, which will allow different social platforms to connect with one another, similar to the way email providers operate. 
The project called Bluesky will aim to allow users control over the types of content they see online, removing the ""burden"" on companies like Twitter to enforce a global policy to fight abuse or misleading information, Dorsey said in 2019 when he announced Bluesky.
Bitcoin has also figured prominently at both of his companies. Square became one of the first public companies to own bitcoin assets on its balance sheet, having invested $220 million in the cryptocurrency.
In August, Square created a new business unit called TBD to focus on bitcoin. The company is also planning to build a hardware wallet for bitcoin, a bitcoin mining system, as well as a decentralized bitcoin exchange.
Twitter allows users to tip their favorite content creators with bitcoin and has been testing integrations with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a type of digital asset that allows people to collect unique digital art.
Analysts see the transition as a positive signal for Square, the fintech platform he co-founded in 2009. Square’s core Cash App, after a bull run in its share in 2020, has experienced slower growth in the most recent quarter. It is also trying to digest the $29 billion acquisition of Buy Now Pay Later provider Afterpay, its largest acquisition ever.

But these ambitions will not pay off until years from now, analysts cautioned. 
""The blockchain platform they're trying to develop is great but also fraught with technical challenges and difficult to scale for consumers. I think he'll focus more on Square and crypto will be part of that,"" said Christopher Brendler, an analyst at DA Davidson.

So, will the company be able to maintain its growth trajectory following its price increase? Let’s find out.Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR), which is headquartered in Chesapeake, Va., is a leading discount retailer operating in 48 states in the United States and Canada. It owns and operates more than 15,500 stores in the United States. Its subsidiary Family Dollar is one of the fastest-growing retailers in the country. The company has offered its products at $1 for 35 years.
However, on November 23, 2021, DLTR announced that it is raising prices by 25% to $1.25. Management has stated that the price increase will allow the company to materially expand its offerings by introducing new products and sizes. Also, DLTR is expected to reintroduce many customer favorites and key traffic-driving products that were previously discontinued due to its $1 pricing constraints. The price hike is expected to be implemented across more than 2,000 legacy Dollar Tree stores by next month and to all stores by the first quarter of 2022. Regarding this, DLTR President and CEO Michael Witynski said, “Lifting the one-dollar constraint represents a monumental step for our organization, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to meaningfully improve our shoppers’ experience and unlock value for our stakeholders.”
Shares of DLTR have declined 2.3% in price since the news release to close yesterday’s trading session at $141.35. While analysts expect the company’s revenues to improve, its EPS might fall amid continuing supply chain disruptions despite the price hike.

Instead of ignoring a company's valuation, which many investors do with high-growth stocks, we only invest in growth stocks that look cheap.

867,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 03:36PM ET</span>","Analysis: As Omicron plays havoc with markets, shares of vaccine makers surge","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The emergence of a worrisome coronavirus variant is benefiting shares of vaccine makers  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, BioNTech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) as investors search for winning bets in markets roiled by uncertainty in recent days.
Moderna shares have jumped 28% since last week when the variant, named Omicron, triggered global alarm. Shares of vaccine partners Pfizer and BioNtech have also climbed over that time, with Pfizer up 6% and U.S. shares of BioNTech jumping 15%, in contrast to a decline in the S&P 500 of 2.5%.
Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are the predominant vaccines used in the United States, and it is expected they will be able to re-engineer their products to address the new variant if required.
“They are clear COVID plays and anything that ramps up the intensity of COVID is going to benefit them,"" said Kevin Kedra, pharmaceuticals analyst at GAMCO Investors. ""They are the front line of defense against COVID.”
Along with the rise in vaccine stocks, the market reactions to the new variant included a sell-off in travel and leisure stocks and brief increases in stay-at-home stocks that thrived during lockdowns in 2020.
The companies have already reaped enormous profits from their vaccines, juicing their stock prices this year. Moderna shares are up 240%; shares of Pfizer, which also is seeking emergency authorization for its experimental antiviral COVID-19 treatment, are up 47%, while BioNTech has seen a 340% gain.
Buying vaccine stocks is part of ""a playbook that we have learned over the last 18 months, give or take. I think it is more mechanical than thoughtful,” said Les Funtleyder, a healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Capital.
“We don’t have all the information. People are jumping the gun,"" Funtleyder said. ""They may be making the right choice, but we are not going to know for a little while.""
Much remains uncertain about Omicron, including how contagious it is, whether it will cause more severe disease than other variants and how protective existing vaccines are against it.
The head of Moderna, Stéphane Bancel, said vaccines are unlikely to be as effective against Omicron as they have been against previous variants, while BioNTech's chief said the company's vaccine would likely offer strong protection against any severe disease from the new variant.
Kedra said Bancel's comments may have been one factor weighing on shares of Moderna and BioNTech on Tuesday. Moderna was down 5% and BioNTech was down 3%.
Pfizer's shares were up 3.5% Tuesday.
Analysts have been scrambling to assess the business implications from the new variant. 
“It seems much more likely that we are going to have at least one more round of boosters,"" said Daina Graybosch, senior research analyst at SVB Leerink.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said in a note that the ""emergence of Omicron represents an increase in need for continued protection against COVID-19 and its variants through the use of primary vaccination for some, and administration of boosters for many.""
The emergence of Omicron has also reverberated through shares of makers of treatments for COVID-19. Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR), which said its antibody therapy will likely maintain potency against the variant, has seen its stock rise some 45% since last week.

Shares of Adagio Therapeutics have soared 130% in volatile trading over that time. The company said it expects its experimental antibody therapy will retain activity against Omicron.
Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) Pharmaceuticals said on Tuesday its antibody drug could be less effective against Omicron and was doing further study to quantify the potential impact using the variant's genetic sequence. Regeneron shares have fallen 1% since Omicron emerged.

Stocks tumbled on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the risk of inflation has increased and the central bank could speed up the timeline for cutting back on bond buying to support the economic recovery.
Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that it was time to retire the word “transitory” from the Fed’s inflation vocabulary, though he hasn’t backed off on his view that price increases are temporary and would eventually ease back down.
Ominous words from vaccine executives also dampened Wall Street’s mood on Tuesday. Moderna’s CEO told the Financial Times that current Covid-19 vaccines could see a big drop in effectiveness against the new Omicron variant.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 600 points, with just a half-hour of trading left in the U.S. session.
Omicron is the market’s latest buzz kill after signs the U.S. economy was getting back in gear. Travel restrictions are popping up around the world, though limited to travelers from certain countries in Africa, where the new variant was first identified.
Still, stocks of travel and leisure companies slumped over concerns about prolonged slowdowns.
U.S. consumer confidence declined in November over worries about the rising cost of living and the enduring pandemic.
Here are three things that could affect  markets tomorrow:
1. Powell’s words
The Federal Reserve chief’s hint that the bond tapering would be moved up and completed at a faster pace pushed the U.S. Dollar to a strong rally against other major currencies Tuesday, and investors will likely still be digesting the significance on Wednesday.
Speaking to the Senate Banking Committee, Powell said, ""At this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, perhaps a few months sooner.""
At the Fed's November meeting, it said it would reduce bond purchases by $15 billion a month. 
Furthermore, Powell said the risk of persistently higher inflation has increased, and he expects high inflation through next year, although the baseline expectation is that it will move back down over the course of 2022.
2. Oil prices
The major oil producing nations are set to meet this week about planning production levels for January. Some expect they might lower production to answer the U.S. and other countries getting together to release oil from their national reserves to ease gasoline prices. But the work has been done for them in the last few days.
Oil prices have plunged since last week’s announcement of the Omicron variant of Covid, sparking global concerns about economic growth. Crude oil fell another 6% on Tuesday, to below $70 a barrel.
3. Pharmaceuticals in the news
 Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) shed 3.5% on Tuesday after CEO Stephane Bancel told the Financial Times that existing Covid vaccines would struggle to cope with the Omicron variant, predicting a ""material drop"" in their effectiveness.
Fellow pharmas also struggled. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) fell more than 1% after releasing a statement on Tuesday indicating that analysis suggested its Covid-19 antibody cocktail could have reduced activity against the new variant. Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK) shares were down 0.6% as it awaited an advisory panel meeting at the Food and Drug Administration, which is considering its antiviral pill.

The TSA’s screening number was the highest since February 15, 2020. However, airlines are now scrambling to navigate a fast-degrading travel outlook amid deep concerns over the COVID-19 omicron variant.
In addition, the Biden administration has plans to restrict travel from South Africa and seven other countries for non-U.S. citizens. This is expected to cause negative repercussions aplenty in the coming months.
So, we think it could thus be wise to avoid airline stocks Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL), Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY), United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL), and Azul S.A. (AZUL) for now.

In addition, investors’ interest in the gambling sector seems to have dwindled following the arrest of the Suncity Group CEO. So, against this backdrop, we think it could be wise to avoid gambling stocks Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) and Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN), given their weak financials. Read on.With increasing legalization and digitization, the gambling industry has been recovering steadily from the worst of the COVID-19 effects from last year. According to a Statista report, the casino and online gambling sector worldwide is expected to reach $230.86 billion this year. This is still below the 2019 level of roughly $265 billion, however.
But current COVID-19 related uncertainties continue to impact the gambling sector. According to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, the emergence of the omicron variant poses downside risks to the economy. Furthermore, the CEO of gambling group Suncity Group Holdings Ltd, Alvin Chau, was arrested recently, fostering even more investor pessimism about the sector.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to avoid gambling stocks Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (CZR) and Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN) now. They have declined significantly in price over the past month and could continue losing in the near term.

873,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 03:00PM ET</span>",Who’s to Blame for the Pain at the Pump? It’s Complicated,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden didn’t mince words as he blamed the oil industry for gasoline prices running at a seven-year high.
“Gas supply companies are paying less and making a lot more,” he said in televised remarks from the White House last week. “That’s unacceptable.”
Within minutes, the oil industry and its congressional backers pointed fingers right back at the Biden administration, blaming it for policies to reduce the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels and the president’s decision to block construction of an oil pipeline from Canada. 
The reality of who’s to blame for high prices -- and what could be done to lower them -- is more complicated. Here’s a closer look:
Claim: The oil companies can just open the taps
Yes, they could, but really they don’t want to.
The U.S. oil industry is still producing less crude than it did before the pandemic curtailed travel and cratered demand for fuel. Even as demand returns, oil companies are keeping production flat while using profits to reward shareholders.
“Oil production is lagging behind as the economy roars back to life after the shutdown,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said recently during a White House briefing.
This year, explorers boosted output 4.5% and are expected to keep up the same pace next year. Total U.S. oil production remains 12% below pre-pandemic highs of 13.1 million barrels a day, with no sign of surpassing that in the next couple of years.
That follows a blistering four-year run that saw U.S. oil producers boost output by more than 50% between 2016 and 2020. Investors are now demanding greater returns so oil companies are forgoing crude expansion and instead returning cash to shareholders while vowing to keep spending in check. 
Claim: Companies aren’t drilling all the federal tracts they’ve leased
Yes, but energy companies have a long history of renting federal land and waters with the intention to drill when the price is right. 
Granholm has challenged them to take advantage of the leases they hold, noting in January that some 23 million acres of offshore and onshore tracts were leased but not producing. 
But the roughly 48% of leased onshore acreage that was actually churning out crude or gas as of Sept. 30, 2020 -- the most recent data available, cited by Granholm -- represents a nearly two-decade high. It’s not unusual for federal leases to remain idle. Sometimes the tracts don’t contain enough crude to justify the investment and sometimes they are snapped up by speculators on the cheap. 
“Companies are buying an option -- not an obligation” to use the leases, said Kevin Book, managing director of research firm ClearView Energy Partners. “It’s not market manipulative behavior, it’s market-responsive behavior.”
Oil companies, which must pay rental fees to retain leases over their 10-year lifespans, make decisions about using them based on crude price forecasts and the costs of those acquisitions. 
Moreover, drilling all the federal leases today would not yield crude immediately, if at all. 
Claim: The Keystone XL pipeline could have eased the supply crunch
Even if Biden hadn’t yanked its permit, the Keystone XL pipeline wouldn’t have been operational now. But there could have been a long-term impact and some lawmakers -- including Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- have cited it in blaming the administration.
“If you had built it a decade ago, maybe oil prices are a little cheaper, maybe fuel prices are a little cheaper,” said Benjamin Salisbury, director of research with Height Capital Markets. 
Within hours of his swearing-in, Biden revoked a presidential permit for the controversial pipeline, which would have transported up to 900,000 barrels per day of Canadian crude to U.S. refineries. 
By simply giving oil sands crude in Alberta, Canada, a new avenue to market, the pipeline could have encouraged more production of it, activists said. That would have meant more oil barrels in North America and added to world supplies. 
“It probably would have taken taken a little bit of the edge off of prices, just like a little bit of drilling here in the United States might have helped,” Book said.
Still, the Canadian crude Keystone would have carried is a particularly heavy oil that’s more expensive to produce and refine, said Jay Hakes, who served as administrator of the U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration. That means Keystone XL would not have been “bringing a low-cost product into the mix,” Hakes said, adding he’d be surprised if it made as much as a penny difference in prices at the pump.
Claim: Oil companies are raking in record profits 
The world’s publicly traded independent oil producers will make record profits this year, surpassing the levels reached when crude hit an all-time high near $150 a barrel more than a decade ago, according to Rystad Energy, an energy consultant based in Oslo.
Next year should be even better, particularly for U.S. drillers, with free-cash-flow growth of 15% to almost $66 billion forecast for 2022, according Bloomberg Intelligence.  
Meanwhile, as the world faces higher energy prices for the foreseeable future, oil and natural gas producers are resisting the urge to drill again, according to  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX).’s top executive. 
“We could afford to invest more,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said in September in an interview at Bloomberg News headquarters in New York. “The equity market is not sending a signal that says they think we ought to be doing that.”
Oil companies that took a beating when prices plummeted during the pandemic are being more cautious about investments now and in some cases have “finally achieved profitability after so many years of underperforming investor expectations,” Book said. “Private companies are supposed to earn profits for their investors, and the providers of capital are saying ‘we don’t want you to keep drilling wells.’” 
Claim: Gasoline suppliers aren’t passing on savings when oil falls
Biden has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate possible illegal conduct in U.S. gasoline markets. The administration alleges consumers should be paying 25 cents less per gallon given what refiners are charging for fuel and what motorists are paying for it. 
While there is always a lag between changes in oil prices and resulting gasoline prices, this year what drivers pay at the pump has been especially sticky. The gap between gasoline futures and retail pump prices widened to $1.20 a gallon earlier this month, the most since 2008, excluding the early part of the pandemic. 
When wholesale prices decline rapidly, it provides a window for retail operators to sell at high prices for a few weeks before lowering prices, said Ernie Barsamian, chief executive officer at the Tank Tiger, a storage broker. Eventually, pump prices will come down, but for now, some refiners and gas stations are enjoying the fatter margins, he said.
Republican members of the commission have asked the Biden administration for evidence to back up its assertion that illegal conduct could be driving high gasoline prices.
“Similar claims have been made in the past and in recent memory the FTC has never found that to be the case,” Commissioner Noah Phillips said in an interview. “He’s not the first president to do this.”
Claim: Biden’s green agenda discourages U.S. oil production
Top House Republicans issued a statement last week blaming surging costs on “the Biden administration’s anti-American energy policies.”
The lawmakers, Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, Fred Upton of Michigan and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, said that under the right policies, the U.S. “could produce more here at home to lower energy costs.”
In reality, most of Biden’s climate policies are yet to be enacted. But just the threat of them has chilled some investment in new oil fields and wells according to Salisbury. 
“There is a plausible argument to make there would be more supply if there was an administration supportive of that supply,” he said.
Oil and gas companies that are already wary of volatile energy demand amid the pandemic, heeding investors’ calls to be cautious and trying to green up their portfolios are also nervously eyeing the political landscape in the nation’s capital. 
Over time, Biden’s climate policies could translate into less volatile energy prices, by divorcing power and fuel demand from finite fossil resources. In the short term, however, that policy pivot can retard spending.
“Uncertainty stalls investment,” and federal land policies could be deterring capital spending on new wells today, suppressing production below what it would be otherwise, Book said. “Knowing there are environmental strictures coming that could strand your investment probably isn’t a favorable environment for investing.”
Claim: Oil and fuel demand is just out-pacing supply
At its core, recent prices for oil -- and the gasoline made from it -- track supply and demand fundamentals. A big up-tick in demand outpaced production. 
“We had very, very low prices as demand decreased,” Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk said in a Nov. 23 Bloomberg Television interview. “And now we’re having demand increase that supply is not keeping up with.”
Gasoline demand has soared in 2021 after last year’s plummet, with the Covid vaccine causing Americans to return to the roads. Gasoline supplied, a measure of demand, is well above seasonal averages. 
But as gasoline consumption has risen to surpass pre-pandemic levels, oil production continues to lag. That’s meant that refineries are paying more for the crude they process into fuel; crude oil made up about 57% of production costs for those facilities last month. Further adding to the pressure on retail fuel prices, several U.S. refineries have been closed over the last two years.

875,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 02:43PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. Senate panel invites airline CEOs to testify at Dec. 8 hearing,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chair of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, concerned about worker shortages at airlines that received billions of dollars in government assistance, has invited CEOs of seven major U.S. carriers to testify at a Dec. 8 hearing, airlines and a committee official told Reuters.
Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat who chairs the panel, is inviting the chief executives of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), United Airlines, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Alaska Airlines and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) to testify, the official added.
The airlines declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters first reported plans for the hearing on Nov. 3 but it was not clear at the time if Cantwell would ask the CEOs to appear.
Starting in March 2020, Congress approved three separate rounds of taxpayer bailouts totaling $54 billion to cover much of U.S. airlines' payroll costs through Sept. 30 as a result of COVID-19.
The heavy U.S. Thanksgiving travel week would not have been possible without the government payroll assistance program and union-negotiated incentives, Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, representing workers at 17 airlines, said Tuesday in a statement. 
""We made sure aviation workers were in place to meet the return demand for air travel after access to vaccination,"" Nelson added.
Last month, Nelson noted that the airline industry ""created a COVID-19 relief plan that no other industry got.""
Airlines that received government assistance were not allowed to issue involuntary layoffs or cut worker pay. They also had to limit executive compensation and halt share buybacks and dividend payments. 
Staffing shortages in recent months have prompted some airlines to cancel hundreds of flights at times even as they worked to boost staffing.
In July, Cantwell asked several airlines detailed questions about ""workforce shortages, flight cancellations, and delays, creating havoc and frustrating consumers as more Americans resume travel.""
That letter said each airline ""poorly managed its marketing of flights and workforce as more people are traveling, and, at worst, it failed to meet the intent of tax payer funding and prepare for the surge in travel.""
This month, Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson said difficulties with some airline operations are ""due more to changes in consumer behavior"" like a jump in leisure travel.

""They probably don't have as much buffer in their schedule as they had previously,"" he added.
A group of U.S. senators this month led by Democrat Richard Blumenthal reintroduced legislation to expand protections for air travelers aimed at ensuring ""airlines provide passengers with fair compensation, refunds, and recourse in the event of airline-caused flight delays and cancellations.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) Inc on Monday followed through on its threat to sue Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc over the ""copycat products"" in the exercise bike company's new clothing line.
The Canadian athletic apparel maker sued Peloton in Los Angeles federal court, seeking triple damages for its rival's alleged ""willful"" infringement of six design patents.
Lululemon filed its lawsuit five days after Peloton brought its own case https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/peloton-sues-lululemon-dispute-over-new-apparel-line-2021-11-26 in Manhattan federal court, seeking a declaration that Lululemon's claims had no merit.
Peloton and its lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The dispute arose from Peloton's launch https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/peloton-apparel-launch in September of a private-label apparel brand, following the end of the companies' five-year co-branding relationship.
Lululemon said five Peloton women's bra and legging products - Strappy Bra, High Neck Bra, Cadent Peak Bra, Cadent Laser Dot Bra and Cadent Laser Dot Leggings - infringed its patents.
It also said another Peloton product, One Lux Tight, is a knockoff of its Align (NASDAQ:ALGN) pants, one of its all-time best sellers.
Peloton ""intended to closely copy Lululemon's proprietary designs and pass off its goods as Lululemon's high quality products to misappropriate the immense goodwill that Lululemon has spent enormous time, effort, and expense to cultivate,"" Lululemon said in its complaint.
The Vancouver, British Columbia-based company had in a Nov. 11 letter to Peloton threatened to sue unless sales of the alleged knockoffs were halted.
Peloton maintained in its lawsuit that customers would not have trouble telling the companies' products apart, and Lululemon's designs were not special enough to merit patent protection.

New York-based Peloton has sought to diversify its revenue streams, after sales growth for its bikes and treadmills slowed https://www.reuters.com/business/peloton-plunges-loss-bike-price-cut-higher-costs-2021-11-04 as more people received COVID-19 vaccines and stayed home less often.

881,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 01:51PM ET</span>",Analysis: KKR's Telecom Italia approach may call time on Italy discount,"By Joice Alves
LONDON (Reuters) - A $12 billion takeover proposal for  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) by private equity giant KKR has highlighted an 'Italian discount', which a surge in investor interest and a European fund aimed at supporting its struggling economy could help narrow.
At a 36% discount to world stocks, based on 12-month forward earnings, Italian equities trade at the widest discount in nine years and at more than twice their own 20-year average of 16%.
Meanwhile, the broader euro zone equity market trades at a 13.8% discount to world indices and only 1.2 times the discount to its own 20-year average.
Explanations for this disparity include Italy's index composition, which is heavy in ""old economy"" energy and banking stocks with nearly two-thirds of Italian blue chips made up of financial firms, utilities, telecom, oil and gas companies, while only around 20% of the 50 largest companies in the euro zone operate in those sectors.
But above all, two decades of near-zero economic growth, an ageing population and Italy's high debt levels have dragged down equity prices in the country.
""Italian equity markets are cheap in a global context and this has given us the opportunity to own some great companies that would trade on much higher valuations if they were to be listed in other countries like the U.S.,"" said James Matthews, European equities fund manager at Invesco, citing small appliances maker De' Longhi as an example. 
Although De' Longhi shares rose from 11 euros in March 2020 to a price of 29 euros now, after touching record high of 40 euros in September 2021, their price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 13.5 times is lower than French competitor Seb's 15.6 and below the average of 17 for the STOXX 600.
ITALIAN DISCOUNT
In the case of Telecom Italia, even after a 50% share price jump following KKR's proposal it remains among the cheapest in its sector with the offer implying an enterprise value below 6 times core earnings against a sector average of 7 times, according to BofA Global Research.
But those who are more sceptical on Italian equities say that they can find better returns elsewhere. 
""There are some good companies in Italy but on a global basis the same types of businesses in other parts of the world are more profitable and can generate higher returns on capital,"" Peter Rutter, head of equities at Royal London Asset Management, said.
Even though Telecom Italia has a higher operating profit margin than rivals Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) and BT Group (LON:BT), it has a lower return on equity, according to Refinitiv data.
Meanwhile, investors have started to take a shine to Italy's mid-cap segment with the FTSE Italia Star index, an index of 75 small and mid-sized companies, soaring 165% since the start of the pandemic to a record high in November. 
Alberto Chiandetti, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International has increased allocations to Italy, arguing such a hefty price discount is not justified for many companies as Italy stands to be the biggest beneficiary of the European Union's 750 billion euro recovery fund.
An iShares MSCI Italy ETF has around 18.7 million shares outstanding, up almost 180% from November last year, far outstripping inflows into an MSCI euro zone ETF, while UBS is advising higher allocations to Italy and Amundi said it is selectively repositioning in Milan-listed stocks.
As Italy plans to use some of the EU cash to upgrade its internet infrastructure, technology enabling companies have been obvious beneficiaries with shares of technology service company Reply climbing 300% since the beginning of the pandemic to reach a market capitalisation of 6.3 billion euros.

""If you think about where the discount is today, I don't think it is in small caps anymore. The discount today is more in mid, big caps or in single stock names that are still maybe undiscovered,"" Chiandetti said.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -The head of Qatar Airways on Tuesday called on Airbus to admit that it had a problem with flaws on the surface of its A350 jets and ruled out buying freighter planes from the European company, effectively handing a potential deal to rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker confirmed that the Gulf airline had grounded 20 of the long-range A350 jets in a months-long dispute over paint and other surface damage that has also prompted the airline to halt further deliveries.
""Qatar Airways cannot sit with its arms folded and legs crossed. We need to solve it. Airbus has made a very large dent in our widebody operations,"" Al Baker said.
""It is a serious matter; we don't know if it is an airworthiness issue; we also don't know that it is not an airworthiness issue. The real cause of it has not been established by Airbus,"" he told The Aviation Club in London.
""Now they have, at last, accepted that there are other airlines, several of them that have the same condition.""
A Reuters investigation published on Monday found that at least five other airlines had raised concerns over surface flaws since the A350 entered service and that in at some cases damage extended below paint to a layer of lightning protection.
Airbus, https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/costly-airbus-paint-flaw-goes-wider-than-gulf-2021-11-29 which until recently maintained that the problem was confined to Qatar Airways, has said the plane is safe and that it understands the root cause of the problem.
An Airbus spokesperson said it had nothing to add to earlier statements.
On Monday, Airbus confirmed it was looking at updating the lightning system to a more flexible material called Perforated Copper Foil, a move first reported by Reuters.
""They have acknowledged that they are working to find a solution, which means they still don't have a solution,"" Al Baker said on Tuesday, adding the Airbus problems were worse than current production flaws faced by the Boeing 787.
""And they don't have a solution because they still don't know why it is happening. You know it is always better when there is a problem to admit, not to put your customer in a corner and blame them for something which is actually your own problem.""
NO AIRBUS FREIGHTER DEAL
Al Baker suggested that any plans to replace the A350 anti-lightning system, known as Expanded Copper Foil, with a new material may require certification. Airbus declined comment.
Qatar's national carrier has said it is progressively grounding its 53 A350s on orders from its regulator, until reasons for what witnesses describe as the blistered and pock-marked appearance of some the aircraft can be confirmed.
The Qatar Civil Aviation Agency has declined comment.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency has said that there is ""no indication that the paint and protection degradation"" affects the structure or safety of the A350.
So far Qatar Airways is the only airline to ground the jets.
Al Baker was also asked about a possible purchase of Boeing 777X freighter aircraft to replace the airline's current fleet of 34 dedicated cargo planes, following his recent comments that Qatar was looking at an ""attractive proposition from Boeing"". 

Asked if this would close the door on buying the new A350 freighter, he said ""yes"". Asked if the order could reach around 50 freighters, he said nearly, without giving more details.

While researchers are still trying to understand the efficacy of existing vaccines concerning the new variant, we think prominent vaccine stocks  Pfizer  (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) could rally in the coming months. Read on.Based on the data submitted to the TAG-VE, the WHO last week recognized the COVID-19 omicron variant as a concern. The data indicate that omicron contains several new qualities that might affect how it behaves. After a few patients began exhibiting unusual symptoms that differ slightly from those associated with the Delta variant, the WHO warned that this variant poses a ""very high"" global risk and could have “severe consequences for some areas.”
Omicron contains more than 30 mutations to its spike protein, and the effectiveness of existing vaccines may be lower. Scientists in South Africa are now exploring omicron. Also, vaccine makers have already started working on boosters to address the omicron variant, and a new omicron-specific vaccine could be ready in the near term.
Given this backdrop, we believe fundamentally sound vaccine stocks Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) could be solid bets now.

In today’s commentary, I want to make the argument that this is a bottom and provide my reasoning. It’s also a good opportunity to update our market outlook and strategy going into what looks to be a promising year-end setup. Read on below to find out more….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary published November 29th, 2021 from the POWR Growth newsletter).
First, let’s take a look at how much has changed over the past week:
As we can see, the deterioration in market conditions that we discussed last week, started to also matter for the S&P 500. From its peak last Monday to Friday’s low, the S&P 500 was down by a little more than 3% before clawing back a little more than a third of its losses in today’s session.

The potential return of travel restrictions and remote work and lifestyles should drive the demand for solutions offered by Zoom Video (ZM), Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), CrowdStrike (CRWD), and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU). Therefore, Wall Street analysts expect these stay-at-home stocks to deliver solid upside in the near term. So, let’s examine these names.The omicron variant was first identified by scientists in South Africa last week. Since then, several other countries have confirmed cases of the new strain, with few other reporting suspected cases. Consequently, several countries have begun imposing fresh travel restrictions.
Scientists fear that the omnicron strain could be more transmissible and have higher resistance to vaccines. Due to the omicron threat, people may again prefer to stay indoors, and companies may return to remote working. As a result, the demand for digital platforms and solutions could increase.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be worth betting on stay-at-home stocks  Zoom Video Communications , Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), Twilio Inc. (TWLO), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), and DocuSign, Inc. (DOCU). Wall Street analysts expect these stocks to witness a solid upside in the near term.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -BioNTech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine will likely offer strong protection against any severe disease from the new Omicron virus variant, BioNTech's Chief Executive told Reuters, as the firm weighs the need to upgrade its commonly used shot.
Lab tests are underway over the next two weeks to analyse the blood of people who had two or three doses of BioNTech's Comirnaty vaccine to see if antibodies found in that blood inactivate Omicron, shedding light on whether new vaccines are needed.
""We think it's likely that people will have substantial protection against severe disease caused by Omicron,"" said BioNTech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin. He specified severe disease as requiring hospital or intensive care. 
Sahin added he expects the lab tests to show some loss of vaccine protection against mild and moderate disease due to Omicron, but the extent of that loss was hard to predict.
The biotech firm is speedily working on an upgraded version of its vaccine, of which well over 2 billion doses have been delivered, although it remains unclear whether that is needed, he added. 
Sahin said getting a third vaccine shot known as a booster will likely confer a layer of protection against Omicron infections of any severity compared to those with just a two-shot course. 
""To my mind there's no reason to be particularly worried. The only thing that worries me at the moment is the fact that there are people that have not been vaccinated at all,"" Sahin added.
BioNTech's guarded confidence contrasts with a sense of alarm conveyed by the chief executive of rival vaccine maker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Stephane Bancel, who has raised the prospect of a material drop in protection against the new coronavirus lineage from current vaccines.
Sahin said antibodies brought about by vaccination could struggle latching on to the new virus lineage but he added that t-cells, another line of immune defence, were set to recognise the vast parts of Omicron's spike protein that remain unchanged.
While antibodies bind to viruses directly and prevent infections, longer lasting t-cells attack cells that have already been hijacked by the virus, warding off viral replication and severe disease.
Pfizer and BioNTech have already created versions of their established mRNA-based vaccine - based on the original virus found in China - to target the so-called Alpha and Delta variants, with clinical trials continuing.
Those efforts are not meant to yield commercial products but to establish a routine with regulators that will help speed up any future vaccine relaunch.
Sahin said that was why regulators would unlikely require testing on human volunteers and an analysis of their immune reaction for any Omicron-specific vaccine upgrade. 
""The advantage is that we have been practicing this pit stop for months and if we change tires for real we will be able to say we've demonstrated this before for one variant and for two variants,"" Sahin said.
He said he still expects a market launch with an initial batch of 25-50 million doses would take about 100 days, provided regulators are satisfied.

Sahin would not be drawn on whether Omicron will become as dominant as the Delta variant. ""But even if, that in itself is no reason to panic,"" he said.
The EU drug regulator said on Tuesday it could approve vaccines adapted to target Omicron within three to four months if needed, but that existing shots would continue to provide protection.

Investing.com —  Plug Power  Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares fell more than 6% despite its announcement that it has finalized the 50-50 joint-venture with ACCIONA Energía.
The JV, announced earlier this year, is named AccionaPlug and will see the companies develop, operate, and maintain green hydrogen projects in Spain and Portugal.
Plug Power, which has announced a number of deals in the past few weeks, including the acquisition of Frames Group and Applied Cryo Technologies, is accelerating its push to become the dominant player in the green hydrogen industry. The joint venture with ACCIONA aims to have a substantial market share of the green hydrogen industry in Spain and Portugal by 2030, with medium-term plans to produce over 100 tons of green hydrogen per day.
Previously the Chief Executive Supervisor at ACCIONA Energía Internacional, Alan Ripa has been named CEO of AccionaPlug.
""AccionaPlug is the platform that will leverage ACCIONA Energía's presence and track record in renewable energy and Plug Power's technology and knowledge in the hydrogen sector to ramp up the deployment of green hydrogen,"" commented Ripa.
The deal will boost both the companies and the EU, which prioritized the green hydrogen economy in their climate and economy recovery strategies. The European Union's Hydrogen Strategy is encouraging the installation of at least 6 gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers in the EU, producing 1 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2024.
Despite the potential positives for Plug, its shares have fallen as low as $38.30 so far on Tuesday."

The 37-year-old will take over as chairwoman of the group working with a new chief executive, the last step in handing over to a new generation of leaders that began a decade ago, the Zara-brand owner said.
Following are key facts about Marta Ortega:
* The youngest daughter of Amancio Ortega started work with the group 15 years ago by stacking shelves in Inditex's Bershka shop in central London.
* She graduated from the European Business School in London. She previously studied in La Coruna in northern Spain, where her family comes from, and also in Switzerland.
* As chairwoman, Ortega will continue to oversee Zara's image and fashion business, her current responsibilities after working in different international and business areas.
Under her leadership Zara has developed campaigns with the most renowned creative people in the sector, such as Steven Meisel, Fabien Baron, Karl Templer and Luca Guadagnino.

* Ortega is also known for her passion for horse riding and has competed in show jumping events.
However, she is far from being a flashbulb-loving influencer, keeping her Instagram profile private with only 1,329 followers. Married for a second time and with two children, she is very discreet about her personal life, in keeping with other members of the family.

891,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 12:48PM ET</span>","Inditex founder's daughter to chair company, new CEO named","By Inti Landauro and Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) -Marta Ortega, daughter of the founder of Spanish fashion retailer  Inditex  (MC:ITX), will replace Chairman Pablo Isla, who led the company's global expansion for more than a decade, in a succession some analysts called premature.
Ortega, 37, takes over as chairwoman of the group that owns the Zara brand in April with a new chief executive, the last step in handing over to a new generation that began a decade ago, the company said.
Shares in Spain's largest listed company were down 5.8% by 1300 GMT.
Isla told a video news conference it was the right time for the change thanks to the company's solid position, with sales in the second quarter climbing above 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
""These changes that we are announcing today are very well thought out changes, which are part of a process within the company and we understand that now is the right time to address this new stage,"" Isla said.
""With the changes...we are confident that the company will continue to develop successfully,"" he added at a virtual briefing where he was accompanied by the incoming CEO Oscar Garcia Maceiras but not by Marta Ortega herself.
Isla dismissed Tuesday's share fall as a short-term move.
He had taken over from Amancio Ortega, now 85, as chairman in 2011 after six years as deputy chairman.
Under Isla, Inditex's share price rose eight-fold and its market value skyrocketed to almost 93 billion euros ($106 billion), while over the same period shares of its main rival H&M climbed by about 50%.
Most brokers said Ortega was the natural successor to her father but said she was taking the lead faster than expected, along with a young CEO with little retail experience.
Oscar Garcia Maceiras, who became general counsel and board secretary in March, takes over from Carlos Crespo, who spent two years as CEO and will stay on as Chief Operating Officer.
'A LOT TO PROVE'
""We think that the changes are bad news for Inditex,"" Spanish investment firm Alantra said. ""We would have expected a more orderly and smoother transition period, with Isla supervising in a non-executive role.""
Brokerage Kepler said the reshuffle was ""moderately negative"", adding: ""Both Marta Ortega and the CEO Oscar Maceiras have a lot to prove when it comes to their ability to run this big monster in the middle of the COVID crisis.""
But other analysts said Inditex, which fared well during the pandemic, was unlikely to see a shift in strategy under the changes and was relatively well-positioned to manage global supply chain issues.
""Given the orderly handover process and long-term strategy of the group, these changes are unlikely to provide any scope for a material change in strategic direction,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Adam Cochrane wrote. 
Ortega, known for her equestrian passion, has worked for the company for 15 years, starting as an assistant in one of the company's cheaper retail brands, Bershka. Isla said she would continue to oversee Zara's image and fashion business.

Ortega said in a statement: ""I have always said that I would dedicate my life to building upon my parents' legacy, looking to the future but learning from the past and serving the company, our shareholders and our customers.""
Amancio Ortega, the world's 11th wealthiest man with $77 billion according to Forbes, still owns 59.29% of Inditex, while Sandra Ortega, a daughter from his first marriage, is the second largest shareholder with 5.05%, Refinitiv data showed. ($1 = 0.8803 euros)

Investors retreated on concerns over disruptions the company is facing because of organized retail crimes at its stores, which are squeezing its margins. Nevertheless, analysts are optimistic about the company’s growth prospects as holiday spending kicks into high gear. So, will it prove profitable to buy BBY on its price dip? Keep reading to learn our thoughts. Best Buy  Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY), in Richfield, Minn., retails technology products in the United States and Canada. The shares of the electronics retailer have gained 11.2% in price year-to-date. However, the stock fell sharply last week despite the company posting its fiscal third-quarter earnings, which topped estimates and raised its sales outlook for its fiscal 2022. Over the past five days, the stock slumped 4.9% in price to close yesterday’s trading session at $110.95.
The share price retreat was likely due to the company reporting a decline in its gross margin. Its gross margin in the third quarter was 23.5% versus 23.6% a year earlier. The decline can be mainly attributed to stepped-up promotional activity and a drag from a new membership program. The company also cited more organized retail crime at its stores, which is negatively affecting its financials. “We are definitely seeing more and more particularly organized retail crime and incidents of shrink in our locations,” said Best Buy CEO Corie Barry.
However, with analysts expecting increased consumer spending in the holiday season, BBY should benefit. The company expects to generate revenue within the range of $16.4 billion - $16.9 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter. Ethan Chernofsky, vice president of marketing at Placer.ai, a foot traffic analytics company, expects BBY to witness significant growth in offline sales in this holiday season. Moreover, improving its retail context and “the brand’s creative approaches to problem-solving” should enable the company to garner substantial gains over the holiday period. ""We are looking forward to a strong holiday season and believe we are extremely well-positioned with both the tech customers want and fast and convenient ways to get it,"" said Matt Bilunas, Best Buy CFO.

Global markets tumbled after comments from Moderna's chief executive officer rekindled worries that the variant may weigh on a nascent global economic recovery. 
Based on its study of Omicron's individual mutations, ""there may be reduced neutralization activity of both vaccine-induced and monoclonal antibody conveyed immunity"", Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) said, adding that the analysis included its COVID-19 antibody cocktail, REGEN-COV. 
The company said it was doing further study to quantify the potential impact using the variant's genetic sequence.
One of the antibodies used in the treatment will likely take a hit, the other less so, CEO Len Schleifer said in a CNBC interview.
""Just like vaccines will have to adapt, we're probably going to have to constantly adapt our monoclonals.""

Volkswagen's supervisory board will meet next Thursday to agree on a five-year investment plan.
But the lead-up to the meeting has been clouded by uncertainty over whether Diess will remain in his position and disagreements over the future of the Wolfsburg plant, which workers fear is being left behind in the transition to electric vehicles.
A decision on whether Diess will stay or go is expected by the end of this week, two sources close to negotiations who declined to be named told Reuters, with the latest round of discussions on the matter taking place last weekend.
On the question of Wolfsburg, management and the works council were discussing assembling the electric ID.3 model at the plant - ""it could certainly make sense to produce such a model,"" Diess said.

The plant would become unrecognisable by 2030, he promised, with changes underway that would make it ""very competitive to Gruenheide"" - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s giant electric vehicle factory just hours away which, pending final approval, could kick into gear in December.
Diess has in recent weeks issued frequent warnings about Tesla's efficiency and speed compared to Volkswagen's, expressing fear that the German carmaker will quickly fall behind on its own turf.

Chief Executive John Elkann said Exor (OTC:EXXRF) was not aiming to create a luxury group, after it became the largest shareholder in Chinese group Shang Xia last year and in March it took a 24% holding in high-end shoemaker Louboutin for 540 million euros, fuelling speculation of further expansion in the luxury sector.
""But luxury is definitely an interesting industry for us,"" he said presenting the company's strategy for the coming years.
Elkann, however, dismissed rumours of an interest in Italian luxury group Armani.
""We've got an excellent relationship with Giorgio Armani and his group. The company is not for sale, it's important that rumours on our potential interest for it end,"" the scion of the Agnelli family said.
Exor in October signed a preliminary accord to sell Bermuda-based PartnerRe to French insurance group Covea for $9 billion in cash, reviving a deal that had been derailed by the coronavirus pandemic. The deal is expected to be completed in mid-2022.
Elkann said Exor would deploy its cash on companies it already owns and new investments focusing on the luxury, healthcare and technology sectors, especially in North America and Europe but also Asia.
""They're expensive sectors,"" he said.
The company will remain open to other industries and geographies, he added. 
Exor is the single largest shareholder in carmaker Stellantis and has controlling stakes in luxury sports car maker Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and in industrial vehicle maker CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI). It also has a controlling stake in Serie A soccer team Juventus.
Following PartnerRe's sale, Exor will also make available another 500 million euros to spend on a share buyback between 2022 and 2024 and 500 million euros to reduce debt next year to 4 billion euros, Elkann added. 
Exor Managing Director Suzanne Heywood told analysts Exor saw no reasons to take further actions on Iveco, CNH's truck-making unit which is going to be spun off from CNH Industrial and separately listed at the start of next year.

""Of course if we receive approaches for Iveco, the board will look at it,"" said Heywood, who's also CNH Industrial chairman and chairman-designate of Iveco.

But can the stock rebound based on the company’s numerous strategic collaborations? Let’s find out.Leading fashion retailer Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN) operates 100 full-line stores and 248 Nordstrom Rack locations in 40 U.S. states and Canada, two clearance stores, five Nordstrom Local service hubs, and online stores. The stock of the Seattle, Wash.-based concern has declined 21.6% in price over the past month to close yesterday’s trading session at $22.53. Moreover, the stock has lost 29.8% since the company reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings on November 23.
JWN’s total revenues came in at $3.64 billion for its fiscal third quarter ended October 30, 2021, up 17.7% year-over-year. The company’s net earnings came in at $64 million, versus $53 million in the year-ago period. However, its net sales for Nordstrom Rack decreased 8% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Furthermore, its digital sales declined 12% year-over-year.
The timing of this year’s Anniversary Sale, with approximately one week of the sale falling in its third quarter of 2021, had a positive impact to the tune of approximately 200 basis points on JWN’s net sales compared with its fiscal 2019. However, analysts at Cowen lowered their price target on the stock on November 24. Labaton Sucharow announced on November 29 that it is investigating potential securities violations and breaches of fiduciary duty claims against the company. Furthermore, hedge hedge funds’ interest in the stock has recently declined. So, JWN’s near-term prospects look uncertain.

Z’s shares plummeted in price following the report and are currently trading at less than $60. Also, because the historic run in U.S home prices is beginning to lose some steam, Z is now grappling with several challenges and low-profit margins. So, will the real estate giant be able to reverse its losses and strengthen its bottom line anytime soon? Read on to learn our thoughts.Digital real estate company Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG), Inc. (Z), which is headquartered in Seattle, Wash., operates real estate brands on mobile applications and websites in the United States. It operates through three segments: Homes; Internet, Media & Technology; and Mortgages. Z's shares have declined 57.2% in price year-to-date and 41.7% over the past month to close yesterday's trading session at $54.26. The stock is currently trading well below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, near its 52-week low.
The stock plunged 25% on November 3, after the company announced plans to exit the home-flipping business because of an inability to predict housing prices accurately. ""We determined that further scaling up Zillow Offers is too risky, too volatile to our earnings and operations, too low of a return on equity opportunity, and too narrow in its ability to serve our customers,"" CEO Rich Barton said. Furthermore, supply chain bottlenecks and the high costs have chipped away Z's margins.
The company reported a $328.17 million third-quarter net loss, attributable mainly to its iBuying unit. The iBuying, or instant buying, unit allowed homeowners to sell their homes to Z for cash, eliminating the lengthy processes typically associated with such sales. The company further expects to incur losses of no more than $240 million, and $265 million in write-downs in the fourth quarter, tied to inventory it has already agreed to purchase. KeyBanc analyst Edward Yruma's research note states that two-thirds of the homes owned by Z are currently worth less than what the company paid for them.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A major hit to the peak December travel season because of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus would cause ""significant traumas"" in the global aviation business, Emirates airline President Tim Clark said on Tuesday. 
Clark said Emirates was working on the basis the newly discovered variant could be dealt with effectively by vaccines, but acknowledged the next few weeks would prove critical for the industry as scientists assess the risks. 
""I would say probably by the end of December, we'll have a much clearer position,"" Clark said in an interview for the Reuters Next https://reutersevents.com/events/next conference. 
""But in that time, December is a very important month for the air travel business,"" he added. ""If that is lost, or the winter is lost to a lot of carriers, there will be significant traumas in the business, certainly the aviation business and the periphery."" 
The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Monday that the heavily mutated Omicron coronavirus variant is likely to spread internationally and poses a very high risk of infection surges that could have ""severe consequences"" in some places.
Omicron was first reported on Nov. 24 in southern Africa, where infections have risen steeply. It has since spread to more than a dozen countries, many of which have imposed travel restrictions to try to seal themselves off. Japan on Monday joined Israel in saying it would close its borders completely to foreigners.
""It's likely to arrest, inhibit, but not stall the uptick in demand that we've all had the benefit of in the last month or two,"" Clark said.
He noted, however, that it could also ""go the other way"", with more draconian measures in response to a greater threat from the variant. 
Clark said the airline's decision to close down flights out of South Africa and a handful of surrounding countries was difficult, given strong demand for the December period. 
However, he said bookings generally remained strong despite the reintroduction of measures in some European markets such as track and trace, quarantine and PCR testing.
""People haven't made that decision to cancel or pull off, so we're hoping that it doesn't worsen, that the border procedures for re-entry are not so draconian that it prevents them from travelling at all,"" he said.
FLEET PLANS
Emirates Chief Executive Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum said just two weeks ago at the Dubai Airshow that the airline planned to deploy a further 60 A380s in response to improving demand, adding to the 47 currently in operation.
""That will be tempered by whatever form this variant takes,"" Clark said on Monday. ""If it's mild and its accepted as being mild in its effect and the efficacy of the vaccine shield is able to deal with it, then we hope to have all our aircraft flying, including all the 380s by the summer of next year.""
Clark said re-embedding cabin crews, pilots and engineers and re-training them for safety and other procedures was currently the ""greatest inhibiter"" for the airline. 

""We are continuing to move as if this variant will be dealt with,"" he said. ""If it isn't ... we will retard our plans accordingly.""

903,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 10:57AM ET</span>","Scotiabank profit beats estimates on provisions, lifts dividend by 11%","By Nichola Saminather and Manya Saini
TORONTO (Reuters) -Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) kicked off Canadian banks' fourth-quarter results reporting on Tuesday with better-than-expected profits driven by lower provisions, and lifted its divided by 11% with executives saying the bank was comfortable with current allowances despite the new COVID-19 variant.
Canada's third-largest lender announced its first dividend hike in nine quarters, of C$1 a share, becoming the first major bank to do so following the lifting of restrictions by the country's financial regulator this month.
Scotiabank will also buy back 24 million shares, or around 2% of its outstanding shares, it said.
But shares fell 0.6% to C$80.92 in morning trading in Toronto, compared with a 0.5% decline in the benchmark, as earnings excluding the impact of taxes and provisions, particularly in the international business, disappointed.
The broader market was weighed down after a warning from vaccine maker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s chief executive on the effectiveness of COVID-19 shots against the Omicron variant.
Scotiabank took provisions of C$168 million ($131.56 million), down from C$1.1 billion a year ago. Excluding the impact of provisions and taxes, the bank posted adjusted profit of C$3.6 billion, up 4% from a year ago.
For investors looking for Canadian banks to show growth outside of core mortgages, Scotia largely disappointed. While mortgage lending rose sequentially and year or year, credit card, personal and business lending growth, while recovering, remained sluggish, and its net interest margin fell. 
Canadian banks and investors have been hoping for an improvement in non-mortgage lending, as earnings beats over past quarters have been driven by home loans and the release of loan-loss reserves set aside last year.
Scotiabank's average non-mortgage loans grew 1.5% from the prior quarter in Canada and 2.8% in the international unit, compared with a 4.9% increase in Canadian home loans and 3.2% overseas. 
Canadian mortgage growth is expected to slow in fiscal 2022 as the central bank raises rates, executives said on an analyst call. 
Higher fees in Canadian banking and wealth management helped offset weakness in the capital markets unit. 
Excluded from the adjusted profit was a pre-tax restructuring charge of C$126 million in international banking to reduce branches and employees. This will be recouped through expense savings in fiscal 2022, executives said on the call. 
While net interest income in Canada rose 7% due to stronger lending, margins fell, as loan growth remained skewed to residential mortgages, which have lower rates. 
Loan mix also weighed on margins in the international business, despite policy rate hikes in some of Latin American countries.
The bank expects sequential margin expansion next year, particularly in the international business, executives said.

Adjusted profit rose to C$2.10 a share, in the three months ended Oct. 31, compared with C$1.45 a year earlier and analysts' average estimate of C$1.90.

The holding company, whose approval by each country's regulator is pending, would be based in Chile, the exchanges said in a joint statement late on Monday published by Colombia's financial regulator. 
The Chilean exchange will control 40% of the holding company, Colombia's bourse another 40% and Peru's the remaining 20%.
""The boards of the three countries have today approved this integration, so we are giving our all for this great achievement,"" Juan Pablo Cordoba, head of Colombia's stock exchange, said in a video.
""This integration will mean moving borders and having a grander vision for the development of Colombia's and the region's capital markets,"" he said.
The integration will take place based on an average valuation of each stock exchange of some $259 million for Chile, around $248 million for Colombia and about $138 million for Peru, the statement said.
The long-planned integration will increase the number of debt issuers, attract international participation, increase regional investment in pension funds and up the volume of derivatives.

""In this way, we can attain a greater development of the regional market through the standardization of business models and the creation of technological and operational synergies,"" the statement said.

906,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>","Electric Vehicles May Control Half of Major Markets by 2030, Auto Execs Predict","(Bloomberg) -- Electric vehicles will account for about half of auto sales in the world’s major markets by 2030 as sticker prices reach parity with gasoline-fueled cars, according to a survey of automotive executives.
EVs will make up 52% of the U.S., Japanese and Chinese markets and 49% of Western Europe, according to average estimates in the survey of more than 1,000 global automotive leaders released Tuesday by consultant KPMG. The significant uptake from less than 10% of the global market now will be driven by battery-powered models achieving a cost equal to vehicles propelled by traditional internal combustion engines, the executives predicted.
Despite the bullish outlook on EV growth, the market-share predictions varied widely, leading KPMG to conclude there is no consensus yet on exactly how dominant plug-in models will become. Beyond price, a key to enticing consumers to go electric is reducing charging times to under 30 minutes, from more than 3 hours now, three quarters of the executives said.
“EV adoption in many markets has been constrained by the limited number of models available,” Megumu Komikado, a KPMG partner in Japan, wrote in the study. “The strong pipeline of new EV model launches in the next 24 months will create more options for consumers.”
Automakers are pouring billions into electrifying their lineups. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). has set a goal to offer only plug-in models by the middle of the next decade, while Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. has said as much as half its global sales will be battery powered by 2030. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., which now dominates the global EV market, is constructing big new factories in Texas and Berlin.
As auto executives go on a building binge to gear up for the coming electric age, they are worried about finding enough workers. Some 55% of those surveyed worldwide said that are very or extremely worried about labor shortages. In the U.S., 70% of executives fear they won’t be able to fill all the jobs they have coming.
Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed there were more than a half million unfilled job openings in durable goods manufacturing in September.

In a decision on Wednesday, Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga of the federal court in Miami found no proof of an illegal conspiracy to cut off social media-fueled trading of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc,  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY) and six other stocks.
Investors in the proposed class action said the brokerages and Citadel Securities LLC colluded to halt a ""short squeeze"" that was causing billions of dollars of losses for hedge funds that were betting on falling stock prices.
The investors said the late January trading curbs left them ""no option"" but to sell at plummeting prices.
But Altonaga said in her 51-page decision that the investors fell ""far short"" of providing direct evidence of an antitrust conspiracy, despite emails among senior Robinhood and Citadel executives that lent ""some credence"" to their claims.
""(A)re a few vague and ambiguous emails between two firms in an otherwise lawful, ongoing business relationship enough to nudge plaintiffs' claims across the line from conceivable to plausible?"" Altonaga wrote. ""The court thinks not.""
Altonaga also dismissed related claims against E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) Corp and four other defendants.
Frank Schirripa, a lawyer for the investors, said on Thursday they were disappointed but expected to amend their complaint in the next few weeks.
Robinhood said in a statement: ""This further confirms that the conspiracy theory of collusion has no basis in fact.""
Citadel said it was pleased with the decision. E*Trade declined to comment. A separate proposed class action accuses Robinhood of negligence.

The company will sell the studio located in the highly competitive Los Angeles studio marketplace to Hackman Capital Partners LLC and Square Mile Capital Management LLC. The more than 1 million square feet property includes 22 stages, a production office and other buildings.

ViacomCBS said in September it was restructuring the operations of Paramount Pictures' movie and television production unit, in a broader shakeup aimed at ramping up content on its cable and streaming services.
The transaction, expected to close this year, comes amid a boom in the studio sector as media companies race to ramp up content production in a streaming-first world.

Investing.com — Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:CPIX) Shares have more than doubled Tuesday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved expanded labeling for Caldolor, an intravenously delivered formulation of ibuprofen.
While the news may not sound all that exciting, investors have jumped at the chance to purchase Cumberland shares, with the stock hitting a high of $4.76 shortly after the open. They currently trade around the $4.40 mark.
Cumberland said the non-narcotic pain reliever can now be administered before surgery to enable patients to wake up from their procedure in ""significantly less pain.""
The new labeling, which the FDA approved, includes numerous information, including the product's expanded usage, clinical study results, potential side effects, patient safety details, and more.
""Before the pandemic began, healthcare systems across the country were in the midst of a public health mission to control surgical pain while decreasing opioid consumption,"" said A.J. Kazimi, CEO of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals. 
The company said a study of orthopedic surgical pain in 185 patients confirmed the significant pain reduction when the product was administered every six hours, a benefit not overlooked by surgeons, with Dr. Stephen Southworth, an orthopedic surgeon at the Orthopedic Institute of North Mississippi saying that ""when administered immediately prior to surgery, patients given Caldolor experience less postoperative pain and a decrease in their opioid use.""
Cumberland's CEO concluded that they ""are proud to see the continued support for Caldolor's use in surgical care, with the product's approved labeling now including the expanded use of the product prior to surgery,"" added Kazimi. "

HONG KONG (Reuters) -The arrest of Macau's ""junket mogul"" is expected to shrink business in the world's largest gambling hub, with authorities in China underlining their intent to crack down on what they see as a dangerous outflow of funds from the mainland.
Alvin Chau, the CEO of gambling group Suncity Group Holdings Ltd, is the founder of the biggest of Macau's junket operators - outfits that bring in high rollers to play at casinos.
He was arrested on Sunday by Macau authorities over alleged links to cross-border gambling. A warrant for his arrest has also been issued in China.
Analysts say his arrest heralds a new era of zero tolerance towards the promotion of gambling in China, where all forms of gambling are illegal. 
It has also dealt a blow to the junket industry that will further erode Macau's reliance on high rollers and accelerate a shift to the mass market. 
The crackdown on Suncity has direct implications for casino marketing staff, who promote Macau gambling to clients in mainland China. 
""After this, now they know that arranging players to come to Macau, promoting gambling in China, even if it’s a phone call in China, could land them in hot soup,"" said Ben Lee, founder of Macau gaming consultancy IGamiX.
Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that Suncity Group would close all of its VIP gaming rooms in Macau casinos as of Dec. 1, and cease salary payments for at least one third of its Macau staff. Suncity did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Any closures would also harm Macau's embattled economy, according to IGamiX's Lee.
""The loss of jobs, in the thousands, will be a huge deal for Macau,"" he said.
Cross-border flows of money due to gambling have long irked the Chinese government, and Macau authorities said their investigation has been in train for two years.
Carlos Lobo, a Macau-based gambling consultant, said the crackdown - which comes amid broad regulatory efforts by Beijing to rein in a range of sectors - had only been a matter of time after China ruled in July last year that cross-border fund flows due to gambling were a national security risk.
Miao Shengming, an official with China's prosecutorial agency, told a news conference on Monday that some overseas casinos and online gambling websites primarily target mainland clients, harming China's ""economic security"".
JUNKET PAIN
Chau's junket operations, by some estimates, account for roughly one quarter of gaming revenues in the city known as the Las Vegas of Asia.
The damage to them spells further earnings declines for casino operators, already reeling since the onset of the pandemic as China's quarantine requirements have made it too costly for most mainland tourists to travel to Macau.
Macau logged 4.4 billion patacas ($550 million) in gambling revenue in October, down 40% from a year earlier.
Macau-listed units of U.S. casino operators have plunged in the past two days, with shares in MGM China (OTC:MCHVY) slumping 15%,  Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF) tumbling 11% and Sands China (OTC:SCHYY) falling 9%.
Macau authorities accused Chau and 10 others of using the former Portuguese colony as a base for an illegal ""live web betting platform"" in the Philippines that attracted mainland Chinese. 
Authorities in the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou have separately accused Chau of forming a junket agent network that helps citizens engage in offshore and cross-border gambling activities and setting up a company that helps gamblers make cross-border fund transfers.
Suncity Group - which has a broad range of interests in the gambling sector but does not include Chau's junket operations - said Chau, who is both CEO and chairman, intended to resign.
Its stock plunged 48% on Tuesday to a record low after being suspended from trade a day earlier, valuing it at HK$880 million ($113 million). Suncity said its operations would not be impacted in the event that it ceased to have Chau's support. 
Part of the Macau investigation involves Russia's Tigre de Cristal resort which is close to China's northeast border and is controlled by Summit Ascent Holdings which in turn counts Suncity as its controlling shareholder. Shares in Summit Ascent slid 63%.
Suncity Group said allegations in the media that Tigre de Cristal was involved in cross-border gaming because it had solicited customers in mainland China were untrue.
Chau could not be reached for comment. The junket operator Suncity has not responded to requests by Reuters for comment.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Tuesday but were well off the lows seen by futures in the overnight session as uncertainty continued to swirl around the implications of a new dominant Covid-19 strain for the global economy and financial markets. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 262 points, or 0.8%, at 34,874 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2%. 
The Dow was weighed on, and the Nasdaq supported, by the rapid change in expectations for U.S. interest rates that the news flow around Omicron has caused. Short-term interest rate futures now expect the first interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve no earlier than September, rather than in June as was the case last Thursday, before the Omicron news was discounted.
Futures had sold off heavily overnight after the Financial Times published an interview with  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) CEO Stephane Bancel, in which he warned of a ""material drop"" in vaccine effectiveness against the so-called Omicron strain.  Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) followed up by saying that preliminary results showed that its experimental antiviral pill was also less effective against Omicron than against other variants of the disease.
However, Oxford University in England, which was behind the vaccine more commonly known as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s, said there was no evidence yet that vaccines will be less effective. In addition, case numbers in South Africa, where the strain was first detected, have fallen for the last two days. 
Moderna stock sold off 7.5% after Bancel's comments, while BioNTech stock fell 7.0%. Regeneron stock was more resilient, however, falling only 0.7%. BioNTech's partner  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) saw its stock even rise 1.7%.  Adagio Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:ADGI), which on Monday said that its experimental antibody product ADG20 performed well in early trials against the Omicron strain, rose another 50%. The stock has almost quadrupled in the last four days. 
Another biotech performing well was Cumberland Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CPIX), which doubled after receiving Food and Drug Administration approval for its intravenous ibuprofen solution Caldolor.
Broadly speaking, the news flow hit travel, hospitality and banking stocks hardest, without generating much in the way of gains for stay-at-home stocks such as Zoom Video - which fell 0.6% - or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which eked out only a 0.6% gain. Roblox stock continued its recent impressive run, however, rising 5.4%. Business software provider  Intuit  (NASDAQ:INTU) saw its stock fall 2.3% after pricing a secondary offering at a modest discount to the market.
Elsewhere, the slump in oil prices continued, but with a relatively muted impact on oil and gas stocks.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 1.4% and Occidental (NYSE:OXY) stock fell 2.0%, but  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock limited losses to 0.3% even as U.S. crude futures slumped another 2.8% to their lowest since early September.

Hunt (JBHT), Forward Air (NASDAQ:FWRD), and Radiant Logistics (NYSE:RLGT). Read on for an explanation.The freight and logistics sector has been crucial in supporting economic activities because it helps transport raw materials, packaged goods, and other goods via air freight, railroad, or ships. The freight and logistics sector boom can be partly attributed to rapid digitization, leading to a surge in e-commerce.
According to an eMarketer report, U.S. consumers will spend $933.30 billion on e-commerce in 2021, up 17.9% year-over-year. This increased spending suggests that freight and logistics companies will play a massive role in ensuring the seamless delivery of goods. Furthermore, investors’ interest in the sector is evident in the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF’s (XTN) 31.7% gains over the past year.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to scoop up the shares of fundamentally sound freight and logistics stocks Expeditors International (NASDAQ:EXPD) of Washington, Inc. (EXPD), J.B.

The plan follows the recent extensions granted by the European Commission for support measures and was in line with a Reuters report last week.
A set of measures aimed at helping companies cut excess debt and boost solvency, including 3 billion euros ($3.36 billion) in debt restructurings, was approved in March, embedded in a voluntary code of practice to be implemented by banks.
As the focus of relief measures switched to solvency issues from liquidity across Europe, Spanish companies were also able to apply for participatory loans, a hybrid instrument that companies can convert into capital.
The government also extended these until June 2022 from December for firms considered solvent and prolonged the deadline for the self-employed and companies to apply for an extension of their repayment period.
The code of good practice will also be amended to allow companies and households affected by the volcano eruption in La Palma to apply for credit support measures.
Under the code, Spanish banks apply for voluntary write-offs of existing state loans as part of debt restructurings for firms whose revenues have fallen significantly.

At the beginning of the pandemic, the government approved state-backed loans worth 100 billion euros to help firms and households meet their liquidity lines, followed later by 40 billion euros in investments loans. Both measures were extended this month.
The write-offs are seen as a measure of last resort under a loss-sharing scheme set by each loan.

LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta has been told by the UK competition watchdog to sell popular animated images platform Giphy in Britain's first such move against so-called Big Tech in its efforts to bolster regulation of the sector.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had found that last year's acquisition of Giphy would reduce competition between social media platforms and in display advertising.
Facebook, which was recently rebranded as Meta Platforms, said it could appeal against the CMA's decision. It has four weeks to appeal.
""The tie-up between Facebook and Giphy has already removed a potential challenger in the display advertising market,"" said Stuart McIntosh, chair of the independent investigation on Facebook-Giphy for the CMA.
""By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social media users and promoting competition and innovation in digital advertising.""
Facebook said it disagreed with the decision. 
""We are reviewing the decision and considering all options, including appeal,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.
The CMA in October fined https://www.reuters.com/technology/britain-fines-facebook-70-mln-breaching-order-giphy-deal-2021-10-20 the company a record $70 million for breaching an order imposed during its investigation into the acquisition, having said in August that it may need Facebook to sell Giphy https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-may-have-sell-giphy-britains-competition-concerns-2021-08-12.
COMPETITOR ACCESS
Facebook bought Giphy, a website for making and sharing animated images, or GIFs, for a reported $400 million in May 2020 to integrate the operation with its Instagram photo-sharing app. It has defended the deal to the CMA. 
Another major provider of GIFs is Google's Tenor.
The regulator, however, was concerned that Meta could deny competitors access to Giphy GIFs, or force the likes of TikTok, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snapchat to provide more user data to use them.
It also said that innovative advertising services launched by Giphy in the United States before the deal could have been expanded to other markets such as Britain, where Meta controls nearly half of the 7 billion pound ($9.3 billion) display advertising market. 
The CMA has been stepping up regulation of the Big Tech sector.

Last week Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google pledged more restrictions https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-proposes-new-commitments-browser-cookies-uk-competition-regulator-2021-11-26 on its use of data from its Chrome browser to address CMA concerns about plans to ban third-party cookies that advertisers use to track consumers.

922,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",Fattest Profits Since 1950 Debunk Inflation Story Spun by CEOs,"(Bloomberg) -- In the second year of a pandemic that began by wiping out 20 million jobs, American workers are doing surprisingly well. It’s just that American business is doing even better. 
In the past two quarters, U.S. corporations outside of the finance industry posted their fattest margins since 1950 -- one reason why stock markets keep hitting all-time highs. 
On earnings calls, plenty of executives complained about the squeeze from rising costs of labor as well as materials. But overall, profits were up 37% from a year earlier, according to data out last week from the Commerce Department. 
Businesses have been paying out more cash to their employees too, with total compensation up 12% in the last quarter from a year earlier. That’s partly because millions of Americans went back to work -- but also because many got a raise when they did so. Hourly earnings broadly kept up with the fast-rising cost of living, and in some low-pay industries like leisure and hospitality they comfortably outpaced it. 
Viewed that way, it looks like everyone’s coming out ahead, and so much for the great zero-sum struggle between labor and capital. At Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co., for example -- the tractor maker that’s seen the highest-profile strike of the pandemic -- workers held out to get a 10% raise, yet the company is still expected to earn even more next year than the record profit it posted Wednesday. 
But that rosy scenario doesn’t apply everywhere, nor is there any guarantee it will last. 
Most U.S. workers, unlike the ones at Deere, aren’t in unions, which means they probably have less bargaining power. Superstar tech firms may be raking in cash, but many small businesses -– restaurants, say -- are struggling to stay afloat as their costs rise. Incomes are beating inflation for now, but that race isn’t over yet.
‘An Illusion’
In a U.S. economy that’s surging toward a post-pandemic era, the share of growth that workers and businesses can eke out for themselves is going to be a key part of the answer to a lot of big questions. 
Among them: Can President Joe Biden keep his thin congressional majorities next year, and get his spending plans through? Where is policy headed at the Federal Reserve? And, linked to both, how long will the pandemic price-surge last? 
U.S. consumer prices rose 6.2% in the 12 months through October, the most since 1990. The new data on corporate earnings suggest business can comfortably pass on all its higher costs, which means there may be more inflationary pressure to come. 
“If profits are strong, there’s going to be continued demand for workers, and in a tight labor market there’s going to be continued upward pressure on wages and compensation,” says Robert C. King, director of research at the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center in Mount Kisco, New York.
What all of that shows, says King, is a strong economy, not one that’s about to be tipped into recession by surging prices. As for how that growth gets shared out, King acknowledges there’ll be local fights between labor and capital but reckons that, overall, the idea is “somewhat an illusion” –- because when firms dole out cash to workers, they generally hand it right back.
“Individual firms might not see that,” he says. “But businesses in the aggregate can safely say that when they spend more money on workers, that’s going to be a situation where there is more revenue coming back to them.” 
‘Pocketing the Difference’
The most important reason why both companies and workers are earning more than they did in February 2020, even though the economy’s been through a record-busting recession since then, is America’s Covid-era fiscal policy. Ample support for households meant their incomes actually rose, an unprecedented outcome in a slump, so they bought more stuff from businesses too.
Unfortunately for Biden, many naysayers -– including centrist Democrats in Congress whose votes he needs to pass legislation –- point to the pandemic spending as a primary driver of rising inflation. That’s one reason why clean energy and childcare bills, slated to be the historic achievements of his administration, are getting pared back.
The president has promised higher wages. He’s under pressure to rein in high prices. He hasn’t said a whole lot about high profits, the third leg of that stool, but Biden did call out companies in one politically sensitive industry: gasoline.
Wholesale prices actually fell in recent weeks but the price at the pump “hasn’t budged a penny,” the president said Nov. 23. If that margin had held in line with historical norms, “Americans would be paying at least 25 cents less per gallon right now as I speak. Instead, companies are pocketing the difference as profit. That’s unacceptable.”
Biden ordered a Federal Trade Commission probe. He’s been pressed to take action over “price-gouging” in other industries too. Still, a president has limited power over prices, and polls suggest high inflation is among the big threats to Biden’s Democrats in mid-term elections next November.
Locked-In Low
The institution that’s supposed to have tools to tackle inflation is the Fed, and much of the outlook for labor will hinge on what it decides to do next.
With their benchmark interest rate near zero, U.S. central bankers have been downplaying pandemic price spikes as “transitory.” But they’re getting less comfortable with that view, and pivoting toward tighter policy -- which puts downward pressure on inflation by reining in growth in jobs and wages.
That could have implications for how the balance of income between labor and capital evolves. 
“That’s a lens by which I’m going to be listening to so many business reports on wage effects and price increases,” Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, one of the central bank’s more dovish policy makers, told reporters Nov. 18.
The Fed has been arguing for low rates partly on the grounds that they help create a hot jobs market with better pay. After sinking to the lowest levels in decades following the 2008 crisis, labor’s share of national income began to pick up again in recent years amid historically low borrowing costs.
When wages rise faster than productivity, though, Fed officials tend to worry more about inflation. The problem with that view, Evans said, is that it can end up “locking in” a lower share of income for workers than they otherwise might be able to attain, effectively making monetary policy anti-labor. 
‘Could Afford More’
The fading of Covid-era commitments by the Fed and the politicians in charge of public spending may be a longer-run risk for workers. In the near term, there’s likely enough fuel in the economy already to sustain the demand that creates jobs and boosts pay. Households have cash saved up. Companies have earnings they can invest.
Much of that is down to macroeconomic policy, but efforts by workers themselves make a big difference too. At Deere, they did -– and the company’s high profits likely played a key part.
Employees went on strike in October, the busiest time of year for the company’s customer base on America’s farms. They turned down one deal that management and union leaders had agreed to. Then they turned down a second, significantly better one. The company was showing signs of panic, asking software engineers to fill in on factory lines. 
“Workers may be tired of seeing the fruits of their labor go to corporations making record-breaking earnings,” Chris Rhomberg, a professor of sociology at Fordham University, said at that point. “The Deere workers evidently felt that the company could afford more.”
Just a few days later, they were proven right.

Conversely, Victoria's Secret (VSCO) and Naked Brand (NAKD) do not look well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. We think these companies’ bleak financials make their stocks best avoided now. Let’s discuss.The intimate apparel market, or lingerie industry, offers a wide range of necessary and fashionable products. The sector experienced a downturn last year due to pandemic-related closure of physical stores and a decline in consumer spending on fashion items. However, efforts to strengthen digital platforms, customized product innovations, a wide range of designer products based on various outfits and body types, rising consumer spending, and pent-up demand for comfortable and hygienic intimate apparel have been driving the market’s growth since. The global lingerie market is expected to register a 7.8% CAGR by 2026.
This industry is projected to witness a significant boost in both e-commerce and brick-and-mortar store sales. Therefore, we think fundamentally sound intimate apparel stocks  Gildan Activewear Inc . (GIL) and Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI) could be solid bets now.
However, amid remote lifestyles, consumers’ preferences are shifting from fashionable intimate wear toward more comfortable and necessary products.

Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) has always been an outlier.
Monday’s news that Jack Dorsey is stepping down as chief executive officer of the social media company comes after the stock rose just 63% during the co-founder’s six-year tenure. That’s a far cry from the multi-fold gains in peers such as Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) or Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on the NYFANG+ Index. Twitter has also lagged behind the 280% rally for the Nasdaq 100 and the 134% gain in the S&P 500 in that time.
While the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Jensen Huang were all focused “solely on one thing” -- running the company they started -- Dorsey had fingers in more than one pie, said Jim Dixon, an equity sales trader at Mirabaud Securities.
A key one has been  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ), the digital-payments platform he co-founded and continues to serve as chief executive officer. Unlike Twitter, Square has been a stellar performer in recent years, more than tripling in 2020 alone.
Square’s gains are more typical of founder-led companies. An exchange-traded fund of such firms has risen 134% since its inception in Feb. 2017, outstripping a 99% advance for the S&P 500 Index. Square is the fund’s third-best performer in that time with a gain of more than 2,200%.
“Other CEOs, while they may do a good job, aren’t married emotionally to a company the way a founder is,” said Mirabaud’s Dixon.
Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) Inc., owner of a platform for buying digital advertisements run by co-founder Jeff Green, is the biggest gainer on the Global X Founder Run Companies ETF after its shares soared more than 30-fold. Other big winners include cybersecurity company Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) Inc. and car-retailer Carvana Inc., both up more than 1,800% since the fund’s 2017 inception.
Tesla, run by Musk, who is also the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., has jumped more than 2,400% over the same span. Closely held SpaceX hit a valuation of $100 billion with the sale of shares on a secondary market last month.
Softening Software
Expensive software stocks have been hit hard in the past two weeks amid rising U.S. treasury yields and a hedge fund exodus. A  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). basket of software companies with an enterprise value exceeding eight times sales has fallen 10% from a Nov. 16 record. 
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), with an enterprise value about 13 times trailing revenue, will get a chance to justify its valuation when it reports earnings on Tuesday along with several other software companies later this week. Analysts expect the maker of customer management software to show strong revenue growth as businesses continue to prioritize spending on cloud-based services.
Salesforce’s earnings will be followed by cloud-computing company Snowflake Inc. and cybersecurity firm Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) Inc. on Wednesday and Asana Inc. and DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) Inc. on Thursday.

Asked whether Novartis could merge Sandoz with either Israel's Teva or U.S.-based Viatris or divest it, Joerg Reinhardt said: ""All options are open for us."" He said listing Sandoz on the Swiss stock exchange, a merger or keeping the business were all possible.
""We said we'd look at that and make a decision within the next 12 months,"" he said. 
Reinhardt said Novartis's innovative pharma business and the generics business had drifted further apart over the last years so it made sense to examine options now.
Novartis said last month it might divest Sandoz, as price pressures mount in the off-patent drug sector.
Asked how Novartis could use the proceeds from the sale of its Roche stake, Reinhardt said: ""We prefer investing in our business rather than doing a share buyback. We'll decide that within the coming months.""

Reinhardt didn't rule out acquisitions, saying it was important to see whether a possible target would strengthen Novartis's core business of oncology, cardiovascular and immunology.
""We'll examine, review and decide,"" he said.

The company sells a variety of tests for COVID-19, including antigen and PCR tests. In October, it started shipping at-home rapid COVID-19 tests in the United States that can confirm results using an entirely automated smartphone app.
Becton also said it had conducted analyses of the variant using all available genome sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) — the largest database of novel coronavirus genome sequences in the world.
The company added that it has evaluated millions of genomes so far and no undetectable variants have been identified.
Its announcement comes a day after Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (NYSE:TMO) confirmed that its diagnostic tests can accurately detect the Omicron variant.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) last week classified the Omicron variant as a SARS-CoV-2 ""variant of concern,"" saying it may spread more quickly than other forms.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global fund management firms recommended holding equity allocations steady at a near four-year high in a model portfolio this month, according to a Reuters survey taken mostly before the latest COVID-19 related turbulence in stock markets.
The Nov. 15-30 poll of 35 fund managers and chief investment officers in Europe, the United States and Japan showed no change in suggested equity exposure at an average 50.3%, the highest since late 2017, with bonds also steady at 39.0%.
Late last week, traders and investors dumped stocks following the detection of a new and possibly vaccine-resistant coronavirus variant, Omicron, marking the worst week for global shares since early October.
But stock markets have since rebounded.
""These COVID-19 risks had been priced out, but will still be a major risk to markets...it must be stressed it is far too early to tell if the Omicron variant will lead to vaccine escape,"" Craig Hoyda, senior quantitative analyst at abrdn, said.
""While there is a strong argument to take risk off the table - a modest cut to equity positions - it would be inadvisable to react in the extreme by completely rotating portfolios.""
The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow Jones indices are up 24% and 15% respectively on the year, with their British and European counterparts, the FTSE and Stoxx 600 up about 9% and 16%.
The Omicron variant surfaced when investors are focused on how soon major central banks like the Federal Reserve - which started tapering its support for the economy this month - will start hiking interest rates to curb inflation.
""There is a sense of complacency in the market and in central bank action which scares us the most. Central banks continue to reiterate the transitory narrative, in a sort of benign neglect of inflation risk,"" said, Matteo Germano, global head of multi-asset at Amundi. 
""Inflation is now everywhere: it was a U.S.-only story and now it is spreading around in developed and emerging markets, with the main exception of China.""
Asked on the more likely outlook for corporate earnings in their local markets, respondents were almost evenly split. Eleven of 21 respondents said they would improve, while the rest said they would worsen. 

""We remain positive on the corporate earnings outlook for 2022, however, the recent rise in inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and pullback in global GDP is a short-term concern,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum. 
""Consumer spending will undoubtedly help numbers in the fourth quarter and the global economy should pick-up through 2022 along with some corporate earnings surprises.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - Auto industry executives expect electric vehicles will make up just over half of new vehicle sales in the United States and China by 2030, and could do so without receiving government subsidies, according to a new survey by accounting and consulting firm KPMG. 
But combustion vehicles, including hybrids, are expected to retain a significant share of most major vehicle markets for years to come, according to KPMG's latest annual survey of 1,000 auto industry executives.
The speed at which automakers can phase out combustion engines and the carbon dioxide they emit is a pivotal issue for the global auto industry. A group of automakers and countries signed a statement earlier this month calling for phase-out of combustion vehicles globally by 2040 https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/six-major-carmakers-agree-phase-out-fossil-fuel-vehicles-by-2040-uk-says-2021-11-10, and by 2035 in richer nations.
But the world's two largest automakers by sales, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, and three of the world's biggest vehicle-buying nations - China, the United States and Germany - did not sign on.
The KPMG survey of auto industry executives found that they believe that electric vehicles will account for 52% of sales by 2030 in the United States, China and Japan, with lower percentages for Western Europe, Brazil and India. But behind those aggregate forecasts, industry executives have widely varying views. 
For China, some auto industry executives expect EV sales by 2030 to be less than 20% of the market, while others believe the world's largest market could be 80% electric by then.
Electric vehicle sales around the world have been fueled so far by government subsidies. But 77% of the respondents to KPMG's survey said electric vehicles can achieve mass adoption within ten years without government aid as battery costs drop to parity with petroleum-fueled engines. However, 91% of auto executives said they support government subsidies.
The wide-ranging survey also found that 75% of executives surveyed expect their companies to sell ""non-core"" assets in the coming years as they re-evaluate what business lines will be viable as more new vehicles shift to battery-electric technology.
""There is going to be a lot of M&A,"" said Gary Silberg, global leader of KPMG's automotive practice.

Despite the supply-chain and pandemic disruptions of the past year, about 53% of the executives surveyed said they were confident the industry can achieve profitable growth over the next five years. 
The most bullish executives were in the United States and China, the most pessimistic were in France, the survey found.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Tuesday, with investors rattled by fresh worries over the ability of current vaccines to cope with a surge of the new Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 420 points, or 1.2%, S&P 500 futures traded 50 points, or 1%, lower and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 110 points, or 0.7%.
The major indices closed higher on Wall Street Monday after President Joe Biden reassured investors that lockdowns were off the table and there would be no new travel restrictions.
However, sentiment abruptly turned negative early Tuesday after  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) chief Stephane Bancel stated, in a Financial Times interview, that existing vaccines would struggle to cope with the omicron variant, predicting a ‘material drop’ in their effectiveness.
He also warned that it would take months before the drugmakers can manufacture the new variant-specific injections in sufficient quantities to be effective. 
Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) added Tuesday that analysis suggested its Covid-19 antibody cocktail could have reduced activity against the Omicron variant.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had stated, in prepared testimony released Monday, that the Omicron variant poses risks to both sides of the central bank’s mandate to achieve stable prices and maximum employment.
Investors will be looking to see whether the Fed chief adds to these comments when he appears before the Senate Banking Committee later Tuesday. 
Turning to the corporate sector, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) will be in focus the day after founder and CEO Jack Dorsey confirmed he is to step down from his role at the social media giant, to be replaced by former chief technology officer Parag Agrawal.
Staying with social media, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will also be in the spotlight after Britain's competition regulator directed Meta Platforms, Facebook’s owner, to sell animated images platform Giphy for competitive reasons.
Crude prices retreated as the Omicron concerns returned, with traders fretting about fresh lockdowns and the associated hit to global demand. 
That said, expectations are growing that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, will put on hold the plans to add 400,000 barrels a day in January when it meets later in the week.
The American Petroleum Institute is also due to release its latest estimate of U.S. crude inventories later in the session. 
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude  futures traded 2.6% lower at $68.10 a barrel, having climbed 2.6% on Monday, while the Brent contract fell 2.7% to $71.22, after rising 1% during the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,795.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.5% higher at 1.1347.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo Cars warned on Tuesday that the sector-wide semiconductor shortage would continue into next year, as its first quarterly report since listing on the stock market a month ago confirmed a dip in revenue and profit.
The Gothenburg-based carmaker said supply chains were still constrained but while production remained lower than demand, it had ""improved month by month"" since September.
""The supply situation has improved going into the fourth quarter, but we expect the industry-wide shortage of semi-conductors to remain a restraining factor,” Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.
Volvo's initial public offering (IPO) on Oct. 29 was the biggest in Europe so far this year, a sign of strength for the European automotive industry which is in the midst of a challenging transition towards electric vehicles (EVs).
The chip shortage has forced many automakers around the world, including Volvo, to cut production. Chief Financial Officer Bjorn Annwall said he expected that to be the major issue in the fourth quarter. 
""No extra lockdown related problems,"" he told Reuters.
Volvo, majority owned by China's Geely Holding, said preliminary sales volumes were around 52,000 cars in November, down year-on-year due to lower production and a build-up of in-transit inventory.
It confirmed a previously announced third-quarter operating profit figure of 3.3 billion Swedish crowns ($362.6 million), versus 4.6 billion in the year-ago period, and revenues down 7% to 60.8 billion crowns.
It also maintained its full-year outlook of sales volume and revenue growth with improved profitability to pre-pandemic levels.
Shares of Volvo Cars fell 2.9% in early trade, having surged almost 30% since their stock market debut.

The company has committed to becoming a purely electric carmaker by 2030. It has a 49% stake in EV venture Polestar, which said in September it would go public through a $20 billion deal.

JPMorgan said in the letter it was ready to lift its commitment above 45 billion euros if necessary, the newspaper added.

933,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 06:01AM ET</span>",Airlines bosses worry about impact of Omicron variant,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Kate Holton
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Airline bosses voiced concern on Tuesday that travel restrictions linked to the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus risked blowing an industry recovery off course.
The strongest warning came from Emirates airline President Tim Clark who said a major hit to the peak December travel season would cause ""significant traumas"" in the global aviation business.
British budget airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) also spoke of a softening in demand in recent weeks as the resurgence of the virus in parts of continental Europe prompted customers to rethink city break plans.
The discovery of the Omicron variant, first reported in southern African last week, dealt a blow to the industry just as it had recovery in its sights, especially following the easing of U.S.-bound travel https://www.reuters.com/world/us/international-travellers-head-united-states-flights-reopen-2021-11-08 earlier in November.
Multiple countries including Japan, the United States, Britain and Israel have imposed travel curbs in order to slow the spread of the new variant which it is feared could prove more resistant to vaccines.
Clark said the next few weeks, the run-up to the Christmas and New Year holiday season, would prove critical for the airline industry as scientists assess the risks. 
""I would say probably by the end of December, we'll have a much clearer position,"" Clark said in an interview for the Reuters Next https://reutersevents.com/events/next conference. 
""But in that time, December is a very important month for the air travel business,"" he added. ""If that is lost, or the winter is lost to a lot of carriers, there will be significant traumas in the business, certainly the aviation business and the periphery.""
LOSING MONEY
The impact of travel restrictions was evident in financial results published on Tuesday by easyJet and Scandinavian operator SAS.
EasyJet reported a headline loss before tax of 1.14 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) for the year to the end of September, at the higher end of forecasts, while SAS remained in the red in the August to October quarter.
EasyJet said it was difficult to gauge the effect of the new variant but that broader concerns over the coronavirus were still influencing travellers.
""We do see that there has been an impact, particularly on the short-term departures, but it's not to the same level of impact and drop-off we've seen in previous times when restrictions have been introduced,"" easyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren told reporters.

Both easyJet and SAS noted that there was strong appetite for travel when curbs were removed.
""We remain cautious due to prevailing uncertainties, but see that underlying demand is healthy once restrictions are lifted, both for business and leisure travel,"" SAS said.

LONDON (Reuters) -British airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) said it had seen a softening in demand as COVID-19 outbreaks and the discovery of the Omicron virus variant forced customers to cancel city breaks, although longer-term bookings have held up well.
Reporting full-year results five days after news of the new coronavirus variant hammered airline stocks, easyJet said it had seen some short-term drop off in demand, with customers delaying flights into early next year. It has not seen an increase in 'no-shows' at airports however. 
""We do see that there has been an impact, particularly on the short-term departures, but it's not to the same level of impact and drop off we've seen in previous times when restrictions have been introduced,"" Chief Executive Johan Lundgren told reporters. 
The airline's shares bounced around in early trading, and were down 2% at 0910 GMT. 
EasyJet said despite the uncertainty, its new Oct.1 financial year had started well and for summer 2022 - the fourth quarter of its financial year - it expects capacity to have recovered to close to pre-pandemic levels. 
The group came through the pandemic by cutting costs, bolstering its balance sheet and switching capacity to the busiest routes. It is now increasing its fleet plan by 25 aircraft, with slots added at Gatwick, Porto, Lisbon and Milan's Linate.
Airlines have been on a roller-coaster of a ride this year, steadily recovering in the first half as first Europe and then Britain reopened for travel, before fears started to grow about the pace of the recovery, and as new COVID-19 outbreaks emerged. 
Airline shares plunged on Friday after news of the Omicron variant broke. Low-cost group Ryanair had already warned that European airlines were in for a fraught end to the year as infection rates on the continent surged. 
""There is no getting away from the fact there's further to climb and the coming months will be patchy at best,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). 
""But a newly refreshed liquidity position and competitive advantages means there are some reasons for optimism where easyJet's concerned."" 
EasyJet reported a headline loss before tax of 1.14 billion pounds ($1.52 billion) for the year to end-September, at the higher end of forecasts, and said first-quarter capacity was expected to be up to around 65% of 2019 levels. 

It had previously forecast 70%. It did not give a full financial outlook however as customers book flights closer to departure, preventing clear visibility.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Shares of Malaysia's ATA IMS extended losses on Tuesday after a decision last week by appliance maker Dyson to cut ties over accusations of forced labour, while a research house raised doubts about its ability to add new customers. 
ATA, which gets 80% of its revenue from Dyson, reiterated on Monday that it took the accusations seriously and that findings from a labour audit were inconclusive. It also warned of revenue decline and cost cuts.
The firm, which makes parts for Dyson's vacuum cleaners and air purifiers, faces high operational risks in the short term and will be challenged to find new customers to replace Dyson, AmInvestment Bank said.
""ATA may not be in the most favourable position to negotiate with potential new customers,"" it said in a research note.
""Hence, we believe ATA's recovery from the current crisis will be bumpy, exacerbated by the labour shortage crisis."" 
ATA said this month it was unable to recruit foreign workers because of coronavirus curbs. 
Its shares fell as much as 27% on Tuesday, before paring some losses to end the day down 13.5%. It has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since the Dyson termination. 
Two other ATA customers are monitoring the accusations, they told Reuters. 
Ecobee, a maker of Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats, said it was recently made aware of the accusations and was reviewing the information to decide its next steps. 
Cricut, which makes electronic crafting machines, said it took the accusations seriously and was monitoring the issue to determine further action.
France's Sagemcom, which makes communications devices, signed up as an ATA customer late in 2019, but said it cut ties with the Malaysian firm this year, ""given the supplier's shortcomings and its inability to meet our standards"".
It did not say what standards ATA fell short of.

French electrical equipment group Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) said its due diligence on an ATA subsidiary it sources from had not raised any issues warranting further investigation. The French firm said it would continue to monitor the situation.
ATA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Tuesday, weighed by fresh concerns about the effectiveness of the current vaccines in combating the newly discovered omicron Covid variant.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France also fell 1.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 1.3%. 
Sentiment slumped Tuesday after  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) chief Stephane Bancel suggested in a Financial Times article that existing Covid-19 vaccines would struggle to cope with the omicron variant, predicting a ‘material drop’ in their effectiveness.
He also warned that it would take months before the drugmakers can manufacture the new variant-specific injections in sufficient quantities to be effective.
Moderna, along with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), have supplied most of the developed world with the vaccines to combat the Covid-19 virus.
The omicron variant has now spread to more than a dozen countries, prompting the introduction of new travel curbs. 
A major hit to the peak December travel season would cause ""significant traumas"" in the global aviation business, Emirates airline President Tim Clark said on Tuesday.
Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) stock fell 2.5%, IAG (LON:ICAG) stock dropped 0.8%, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock fell 0.7%, while easyJet (LON:EZJ) stock only fell 0.2% after the budget airline stated that it is expecting passenger numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels next summer despite uncertainty hitting the winter months.
Elsewhere,  Inditex  (MC:ITX) stock fell 4.9% after the owner of the Zara and Massimo Dutti chains announced a shake up at the top of its management, with Marta Ortega Perez, the daughter of founder Amancio Ortega, taking over as chief executive from April.
Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) stock fell 0.9%, matching the overall weakness, even after the Swedish telecom equipment maker raised its global forecast for 5G mobile subscriptions to 660 million by the end of this year, citing stronger-than-expected demand in China and North America.
Turning to economic data, French inflation rose unexpectedly in November to hit its highest level in 13 years, with consumer prices up 0.4% from last month, giving a 12-month inflation rate of 3.4%, the highest since September 2008.
This could put upward pressure on the flash November Eurozone CPI figure, due later in the session. This was already expected to climb to an annual 4.5% from October’s 4.1%, more than double the European Central Bank’s 2% target. German unemployment figures for November also fell to their lowest since March last year, extending a series of substantial declines with a steeper-than-expected drop of 34,000 in seasonally-adjusted terms.
Earlier Tuesday, China recorded a surprise growth in factory activity in November, the first in three months, with the country’s manufacturing purchasing managers index coming in at 50.1 in November, above the previous month’s 49.2 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI was at 52.3, higher than the previous month’s 52.4 figure.
Crude prices retreated as the omicron concerns returned, with traders fretting about fresh lockdowns and the associated hit to global demand. 
That said, with a further hit to demand likely, expectations are growing that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, will put on hold the plans to add 400,000 barrels a day in January when it meets later in the week.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The Dubai government is considering an initial public offering of Emirates airline, the flagship carrier's President Tim Clark said on Monday, as authorities work to boost activity on the local stock market.
The emirate's government is planning to list 10 state-backed companies on its stock exchange and set up a 2 billion dirham ($545 million) market maker fund to encourage trading activity.
""Yes, there has been talk about it. Yes, there has been, perhaps a little bit more flesh on the whole subject than there has been in the past,"" Clark said in an interview for the upcoming Reuters Next conference when asked if a listing was a possibility.
""I'm waiting instructions as to how this is going to affect the Emirates Group. What the government of Dubai decides to do...is up to them, I would basically do as I am bid.""
Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum said earlier this month that it was possible to list the carrier or its subsidiaries.
Governments have pumped billions of dollars into airlines during the coronavirus pandemic and state-owned Emirates has received around $3.8 billion in equity injections from Dubai, including $2 billion disclosed last year.
The airline posted a loss of 5.8 billion dirham ($1.6 billion) for the April-September period, down from a 12.6 billion dirham loss for the same period last year.
However, Clark said he does not expect further government support over the next year so long as the new variant of the coronavirus does not cause too much disruption.
""We are restoring our cash position at pace. So it is unlikely, notwithstanding the Omicron variant and its effects... if it's not as bad as people think it may be, then we see no further recourse to the owner putting equity into the business.
Clark said that although Emirates would still suffer a loss this year, it would be considerably smaller than in the preceding 12 months. For 2022, he expected the airline to break even or make a profit.

""I am very pleased to say we have returned to profitability already, over the last six, seven weeks, we've been profitable,"" he said.

940,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 03:25AM ET</span>",Sweden's Ericsson sees 660 million 5G subscriptions by year end,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) on Tuesday raised its global forecast for 5G mobile subscriptions to 660 million by the end of this year, citing stronger than expected demand in China and North America.
The telecom equipment maker, which had previously forecast 580 million subscriptions, said it expected 4.4 billion 5G subscriptions by the end of 2027, accounting for almost half of all mobile subscriptions at that time.
Ericsson said in its biannual Mobility Report that the strong demand in China and North America was driven partly by decreasing prices of 5G devices.

While 5G will become the dominant mobile access technology by subscriptions in 2027, Ericsson foresees 4G subscriptions to peak in Q4 2021, then decline as subscribers migrate to 5G.
Ericsson, which competes with China's Huawei and Finland's Nokia (NYSE:NOK), added that 75% of the world's population will have access to 5G coverage in 2027.

941,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 03:15AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Long COVID,"A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao. 
World stocks' 0.6% rise on Monday came nowhere close to recouping Friday's 2.2% loss, but even that is under threat after  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) CEO Stephane Bancel predicted existing vaccines would struggle with the Omicron variant. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will also tell U.S. lawmakers later in the day the variant could imperil economic recovery, prepared remarks show. Those comments have already sent 10-year Treasury yields down 7 basis points this morning. 
So a loss-making Asian session has given way to red ink in Europe, where German markets appear headed 2% lower. Futures point to hefty Wall Street losses, the yen and Swiss franc are again catching a bid and oil prices have slid more than $1.
COVID headlines overshadowed a pickup in official Chinese PMIs, which showed factory activity cranking up in November and services coming in steady from the previous month. 
And for those still in data watching mode, euro zone inflation data could show a big number, accelerating from October's 4.1%. Remember, Monday brought German November CPI of 5.2% year-on-year, the highest since 1992. The picture is one of economic growth under threat, even as a possible COVID comeback risks exacerbating supply chain glitches. 
What happens next is anyone's guess. Citi analysts write that Friday's selloff wiped out investors' bullish bias on the S&P 500, while European positioning had already turned neutral in Europe. 
There is room for more position unwinding, but also scope for a bounce. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: 
- ECB likely to keep buying bonds through 2022; could resume PEPP - ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos
-South Korea, global trade bellwether, saw October factory output shrink at the sharpest pace in nearly 1-1/2 years

944,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>","Analysis-Ready to pounce: Investors prepare for swings, opportunities as Omicron variant spreads","By Maiya Keidan
(Reuters) - The latest COVID-19 virus variant has sparked a wild ride in markets. 
Investors say the volatility probably isn't over yet, as they look for selective opportunities to pounce on while protecting their portfolios as the year-end nears. 
The emergence of the Omicron variant saw the S&P 500 notch its worst one-day percentage loss in nine months on Friday - only to rebound on Monday as hopes grew that the variant might be milder than first feared. While the World Health Organization (WHO) cautioned of a very high risk of infection surges, U.S. President Joe Biden said America would not go back to lockdowns.
Some investors saw opportunity in those swings. 
""We have been endeavoring to take advantage of sharp sudden concerns (such as Omicron) to add to positions where we believe the value more than outweighs any new/incremental risk,"" Shawn Kravetz, founder of Esplanade Capital, told Reuters by email. He is looking to swoop in if markets take another dive. 
London-based hedge fund Westbeck Capital Management took advantage of Friday’s sharp drop in oil to take a position in Brent crude. The fund is waiting for more details on the Omicron variant to become clear before making a bigger bet on a bounce in oil prices. 
“We need to wait to see how this new variant develops. My gut feel is that this is a big buying opportunity,"" said Jean-Louis Le Mee, the firm's co-founder. 
Still, not everyone is sanguine. Tim Pickering, chief investment officer at Auspice Capital, a Canadian computer-driven commodities-focused fund, reduced equity exposure on Friday.
""I think the biggest takeaway is the market is fragile and we should expect volatility,” he said.
The Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's most widely followed fear gauge, was down on Monday but still elevated from its range over the last couple of months. 
Steven Oh, head of credit at PineBridge Investments, said the Omicron variant has introduced more risks to the downside on the heels of the market’s sharp rally. 
“If you have less confidence in the base case you may get a bit more defensive in positioning,” he said.
While there may be hopes that the virus may not be severe as initially thought, it shouldn't be dismissed, others warned. 
Omicron ""definitely has the potential to change the game globally,"" said Grant Wilson, head of Asia Pacific at Exante Data, who said other factors such as transmissibility and vaccine evasiveness needed to be taken into account.
Indeed, the Financial Times on Tuesday quoted the chief executive of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) as saying existing vaccines would be less effective at fighting Omicron. S&P 500 e-mini futures were trading lower. [nL4N2SL1R3] 
Wilson said large asset managers take time to make decisions and he expected a lot of investment committee meetings would be scheduled where a key question would be if the outlook for 2022 has changed.
How central banks respond to the threat is also key. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Monday warned that the new strain muddies the outlook.
""The question now is does the Omicron variant mean that the Federal Reserve won’t hike rates next year?"" said Troy Gayeski, chief market strategist for FS Investments, who still sees rate hikes on the horizon and thinks there will be a near-term peak to the market sometime between mid-January and April. 
YEAR END NEARS 
Despite the concerns, big Wall Street firms including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Citi advised clients to stay invested or buy on weakness.
BlackRock’s analysts on Monday said if vaccines prove effective “the strain only delays the restart of economic activity,"" while Citi analysts said while ""a market sell-off seems logical"" it ""would buy into any dip."" 
Others have noted that stocks managed to move higher in the face of the Delta variant this year. The S&P 500 is up about 10% since early May, when the WHO designated the variant now known as Delta a ""variant of concern."" Graphic: The U.S. stock market and the Delta variant, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akvezmdaypr/Pasted%20image%201638209351790.png 
However, a strong year in markets may mean some investors will look to protect their profits as year-end nears, rather than assume more risk. 
The average hedge fund, for example, ended October up 11.4% for the first 10 months of the year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research, compared to an 11.8% gain for all of 2020. The S&P is up 24% year-to-date. 

Marc LoPresti, co-managing director of alternative investment management firm The Strategic Funds, said hedge funds had already taken off some riskier positions as the COVID-19 situation deteriorated last week in Europe to protect gains going into year-end. 
""They did the majority of the derisking, (but) they may do some more,"" LoPresti said.

945,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Sharply Lower; Omicron Fears Resurface,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open sharply lower Tuesday amid fresh concerns about the effectiveness of the current vaccines in combating the newly discovered omicron Covid variant.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.8% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 1.2%.
Global stock markets had bounced Monday after Friday’s rout as investors reassessed the likely damage caused by the omicron variant, helped by South African health experts indicating that the symptoms have been mild so far.
However, sentiment changed abruptly early Tuesday after  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) chief Stephane Bancel suggested in a Financial Times article that the existing vaccines would struggle to cope with the omicron variant, predicting a ‘material drop’ in their effectiveness.
He also warned that it would take months before the drugmakers can manufacture the new variant-specific injections in sufficient quantities to be effective.
Moderna, along with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), have supplied most of the developed world with the vaccines to combat the Covid-19 virus.
The omicron variant has now spread to more than a dozen countries, prompting the introduction of new travel curbs. The World Health Organization said on Monday that the modification posed a very high risk of infection surges, although the UN body added it is still unclear how severe the new variant is.
There was some positive news for investors to digest Tuesday after China recorded a surprise growth in factory activity in November, the first in three months, as a surge in raw material prices and power rationing both eased.
The country’s manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 50.1 in November, above the previous month’s 49.2 figure, while the non-manufacturing PMI was at 52.3, higher than the previous month’s 52.4 figure. 
Back in Europe, the main economic release will be the flash Eurozone CPI for November, which is expected to climb to an annual 4.5% from October’s 4.1%, while German unemployment figures for November will also be of interest.
In corporate news, earnings from the likes of EasyJet (LON:EZJ), Greencore (LON:GNC), SAS (ST:SAS) and Volvo Cars (ST:VOLCARb) will be released Tuesday.
Crude prices retreated as the omicron concerns returned, with traders fretting about fresh lockdowns and the associated hit to global demand. 
That said, with a further hit to demand likely, expectations are growing that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, will put on hold the plans to add 400,000 barrels a day in January when it meets later in the week.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.4% lower at $67.57 a barrel, having climbed 2.6% on Monday, while the Brent contract fell 3.6% to $70.57, after rising 1% during the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,795.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1325.

The disbarred lawyer was handed a six-month imprisonment sentence in October for criminal contempt arising from a lawsuit brought by the oil company.
The Democrats including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib on Monday said in a letter addressed to Attorney General Merrick Garland that the lawyer was jailed for ""petty contempt of court"". 
""As the United States is a party to the District Court case against Mr. Donziger, we request that you act immediately to reclaim control of this case, dismiss the charges, and free Mr. Donziger from his imprisonment,"" the letter said.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska sentenced Donziger after finding him guilty in May of ""willfully"" defying court orders, including by failing to turn over his computer and other devices.
Donziger had represented villagers in Ecuador's Lago Agrio region who sought to hold Chevron liable for water and soil contamination by Texaco - which was acquired by the company in 2000 - between 1964 and 1992. Donziger won a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in an Ecuadorian court in 2011.

In 2014, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled in favor of Chevron, saying the Ecuadorian judgment had been secured through fraudulent means. 
Chevron did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment sent during overnight hours.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission started court proceedings against Mazda in October 2019 in a case involving seven different Mazda vehicles and 10 customers.
It said the court found that Mazda made 49 separate false or misleading representations to nine consumers, who sought refund or replacement after facing serious and recurring faults with their vehicles within a year or two of purchase.
Mazda either ignored or rejected the claims of the customers and told them that the only available remedy was another repair, the ACCC said.
""Mazda's conduct towards these consumers was not just appalling customer service as noted by the judge, it was a serious breach of the law,"" ACCC Chair Rod Sims said in a statement.

Mazda Australia said it was carefully considering the federal court finding, but declined to comment further.
The court, however, dismissed the regulator's allegations that Mazda engaged in ""unconscionable conduct"" in its dealings with these customers. It will decide on penalties and other orders sought by the ACCC at a later date.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A regional director for the U.S. National Labor Relations Board on Monday called for a rerun of a union election at an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) facility in Alabama, setting the stage for another high-profile organizing battle at the world's largest online retailer.
Workers at the warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, rejected forming a union by a more than 2-to-1 margin in April after an organizing drive that garnered support from U.S. lawmakers and President Joe Biden. In August, an NLRB hearing officer said the company's conduct around the previous vote had interfered with the election.
The decision for a redo adds pressure on Amazon, which has recently faced union campaigns in New York and Canada. Worker groups view organizing the company as a landmark goal that would invigorate the U.S. labor movement.
“Today’s decision confirms what we were saying all along – that Amazon’s intimidation and interference prevented workers from having a fair say in whether they wanted a union in their workplace,"" Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), said in a statement.
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement that the company's employees overwhelmingly voted against joining the RWDSU this year. ""It’s disappointing that the NLRB has now decided that those votes shouldn’t count.""
Amazon and the RWDSU have already restarted their campaigns in anticipation of a second election. The company has forced thousands of employees to attend meetings about unions and posted signs critical of unions in bathrooms.
In Monday's decision, the NLRB regional director said that Amazon ""engaged in objectionable conduct that warrants setting aside the election.""

The decision pointed to moves by the company encouraging staff to vote via a mailbox it had the Postal Service install at its warehouse, surrounding the mailbox with its campaign slogan and locating it where workers may have thought Amazon was surveilling them.
The NLRB decision did not specify the second election's date or whether the vote will take place by mail or in person.

949,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 10:52PM ET</span>",Cyber Monday spending expected to slow as shoppers see fewer deals,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -U.S. retailers' online sales likely slowed this Cyber Monday, as fewer discounts and limited choices due to global supply-chain disruptions deterred shoppers, but other data points suggested American consumers are in pretty good health. 
Retailers had also spread out promotional deals across more weeks to protect profit margins from surging supply chain costs and to better manage inventories amid widespread product shortages ahead of the Christmas shopping season.
Those attempts have pinched sales on what are traditionally some of the biggest shopping days of the year, with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics data over the weekend showing spending online during Black Friday fell for the first time ever. 
""Online sales on big shopping days like Thanksgiving and Black Friday are decreasing for the first time in history, and it is beginning to smooth out the shape of the overall season,"" said Taylor Schreiner, director, Adobe Digital Insights.
U.S. spending on Cyber Monday crossed $7 billion as of 9 p.m. ET, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index.
Adobe now expects consumers to spend between $10.4 billion and $11.1 billion and forecast that customers could spend $2.5 billion between 7 p.m. PT and 11 p.m. PT.
Early estimates showed spending to be between $10.2 billion and $11.3 billion. That translates to roughly flat growth at the midpoint compared to last year's $10.8 billion, which was a near 15% jump from 2019. 
Excitement on social media around Cyber Monday is also ebbing.
""Cyber Monday continues to be extremely relevant, particularly in the digital world, but the buzz has been more muted than we've seen in recent history,"" said Rob Garf, general manager of retail at Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).
Discount rates in the United States in the week leading up to Cyber Monday were on average 8% lower than last year, according to Salesforce. 
The holiday season kicks off just as the new Omicron coronavirus variant has triggered uncertainty over the economic reopening, but experts say it is too early to predict the impact on consumer spending.
On Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, U.S. shoppers spent roughly $8.9 billion online, down from $9 billion a year earlier, according to Adobe data. 

A separate data point released Monday by MasterCard SpendingPulse, which calculates overall U.S. retail sales across payment methods, found U.S. shoppers spent 14% more on merchandise excluding automobiles from Nov 26 to 28, compared to the same holiday weekend a year earlier. The estimates include purchases made in stores. 
Shoppers' spending online increased 5% over the three-day period compared to a year earlier, and by 28.7% when compared to the same period in 2019, according to MasterCard SpendingPulse.

Australia's financial sector has faced intense scrutiny since a Royal Commission inquiry in 2018 found widespread shortcomings across the industry, with charging the dead among the most common and damaging revelations.
""The issues raised in these matters should not have occurred, and our processes, systems and monitoring should have been better,"" Westpac CEO Peter King said in a statement https://yourir.info/resources/af4e3362f19eeecc/announcements/wbc.asx/2A1342281/WBC_Westpac_and_ASIC_reach_agreement_on_six_regulatory_matters.pdf.
ASIC and Westpac will together propose the A$113 million penalty to the federal court, and the lender will remediate about A$80 million to customers, the ASIC said.
""The conduct and breaches alleged in these proceedings caused widespread consumer harm and ranged across Westpac's everyday banking, financial advice, superannuation and insurance businesses,"" ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said.
""Westpac must urgently improve its systems and culture to ensure these systemic failures do not continue.""
The lender's shares traded 1% higher at 0137 GMT, after rising as much as 1.7% earlier in the day.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, ending November on a high note as Chinese data indicated improved factory activity.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.30% by 9:15 PM ET (2:15 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.21%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.92%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.99%, with October’s employment data showing that the jobs/application ratio was at 1.15 and the unemployment rate was down to 2.7%. Industrial production also grew 1.1% month-on-month.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.52%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.26%, with building approvals contracting 12.9% month-on-month and private sector credit growing 0.5% month-on-month in October. The current account for the third quarter of 2021 stood at AUD23.9 billion ($17.06 billion).
Data released earlier in the day showed that China’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was at 50.1, while the non-manufacturing PMI was at 52.3, in November. The Caixin manufacturing and services PMIs are due later in the week.
However, investors also continue to monitor the omricron variant of COVID-19, which is still under evaluation by scientists. U.S. President Joe Biden cautioned against panicking over the new variant and said lockdowns will not be necessary, while pharmaceutical firms such as  Moderna  Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) are already at work adapting vaccines.
“We’ll get a new variant, we’ll get new waves but the market, and we all as investors, see how that might play out,” Thornburg Investment Management president Jason Brady told Bloomberg.
“I’m much more interested in inflation and potentially rising rates causing some of the market leaders of 2020 and 2021 to falter a little bit more.”
The discovery of the new strain has already impacted international travel and could increase inflationary pressures if supply chains are disrupted.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Monday that omicron poses risks to both sides of the Fed’s mandate for stable prices and maximum employment. However, he did not specify any actions or indicate an adjustment in the pace of asset tapering.
Powell will testify at a Senate Banking Committee hearing alongside U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen later in the day. The pair will testify again at the House Financial Services Committee a day later.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The broad market relief rally on Monday left many so-called stay-at-home stocks behind, dealing another blow to Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation fund. 
The $18.6 billion ARK Innovation fund, which outperformed all other U.S.-based equity funds last year due to its outsized holdings of stocks that rallied during the economic lockdowns, dropped 0.5% in morning trading Monday, well behind the 1% gain in the S&P 500. 
The benchmark index dropped nearly 2.3% Friday on news a new coronavirus variant, now known as Omicron, had been identified in southern Africa, spurring new travel restrictions worldwide. Yet global equity markets made up some of that lost ground Monday on reports the new variant may produce mild symptoms.
Signs Omicron will not deal a severe blow to the economy are prompting investors to remain in cyclical stocks, said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI).
""This is not February of 2020 when the world is about to shut down. If anything we think the economy will continue to improve from here,"" he said. 
ARK Innovation's declines were widespread Monday, with 8 out of the fund's 10 largest holdings down for the day. Telemedicine company Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc, the fund's second-largest holding, fell 5.1%, while streaming company  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc shed 2.6% and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc lost 3.2%. 

For the year, ARK Innovation is down 14%, while the benchmark S&P 500 is up 23.4%. That underperformance places ARK Innovation among the worst-performing mid-cap growth funds for the year to date, according to Morningstar. It remains among the top-performing funds over the last 5 years. 
Ark did not respond to a request to comment for this story.

As the reimposition of travel restrictions and lockdowns could lead to a market crash, fundamentally sound stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Kroger (NYSE:KR) might help hedge your portfolio against the current market risk. The stock markets witnessed a sharp pullback since the detection of the highly contagious omicron coronavirus variant in South Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the new variant is a “cause for concern,” leading to the reimposition of travel restrictions and lockdowns across the globe. Over the past five days, the S&P 500 index fell 2.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined 2.7%. The CBOE Volatility Index, on the other hand, rose 29.2% last week. Crude oil witnessed its worst day in 2021 on November 26, as prices fell 13% due to the new variant scare.
As the reimposition of the travel ban is expected to affect international trade amid continued supply chain disruptions, the markets are expected to remain volatile for some time until the transmission rate of omicron is determined. While renowned U.S. health official Dr. Fauci has stated that it is “too early to say” whether lockdowns will be reimposed, the probability of the same cannot be negated. However, as more than 80% of U.S. adults are vaccinated, the country is expected to remain shielded from extreme repercussions.
Given the volatile market conditions, investing in relatively stable stocks with a beta of less than 1 is ideal. Thus, fundamentally sound stocks Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and The  Kroger Co .

The company’s net loss came in at $152 million, reflecting a substantial decline from the year-ago net profit of $95 million. Loss per share came in at $0.40, missing the analyst estimates by 46%. Following the third-quarter earnings release, the stock declined 26.3% to close Friday’s trading session at $17.33.
GPS has cited supply chain constraints due to factory closures and port congestions as the main reason behind its poor performance in the last quarter. The significant delays in deliveries affected the company’s inventory margins as well as sales, as it was not able to meet the strong market demand.
GPS’ management stated that it has been working to increase air freight and port diversification to meet the demand this holiday season. However, with the rising concerns surrounding the omicron coronavirus variant leading to the reimposition of travel restrictions worldwide, GPS’ inventory shortfall will likely continue throughout the fiscal fourth quarter (ending January 2022).

(Reuters) -Pandemic-weary corporations struggled to assess the impact of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus on Monday, with industries from Hollywood movie studios to airlines and autos awaiting more details to help determine how it might affect their operations and profits.
The World Health Organization warned on Monday the Omicron variant carries a very high global risk of infection surges. Spooked investors wiped roughly $2 trillion off global stocks on Friday, but markets regained some ground on Monday.
Countries have swiftly imposed bans on travel from southern Africa, where the variant was first uncovered. Japan and Israel went even further, announcing bans on all foreign visitors.
Some airlines said they were not heavily changing schedules, but industry sources said big carriers moved swiftly to protect their hubs by curbing passenger travel from southern Africa.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary saw no reason to cancel flights although he was worried about some countries potentially shutting air travel. Lufthansa, Germany's flagship airline, said its flights were still well booked.
U.S. President Joe Biden met with chief executives of major retailers and other companies on Monday to discuss how to move goods to shelves as the U.S. holiday shopping season begins in the shadow of Omicron.
Before the meeting, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) CEO Doug McMillon cited improvement in the supply chain, noting the retailer had seen a 26% increase in shipping containers going through U.S. ports over the past four weeks.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday it was too soon to tell if Omicron will have any impact on global supply chains.
The prospect of a fast-spreading variant has raised fears of a return of the sort of restrictions that shut down a swathe of industries in 2020.
In Hollywood, where production on film and television shows returned to pre-pandemic levels this summer thanks to stringent health and safety precautions, the studios were waiting to learn more about this latest mutation of the coronavirus.
""With COVID, it keeps shape shifting. It's like mercury -- we can't get our hands around it,"" said Dr. Neal Baer, a physician who was a longtime producer of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit."" 
""It's going to take a couple of weeks for us to know, one, how well vaccinations protect us, two, whether you need a booster and whether a booster helps or three, whether the vaccine needs to be modified to make it effective against this mutation.""
Movie theater attendance has been returning in fits and starts since the summer, but a spokesman for the National Association of Theatre Owners said variants remain a concern -- especially after the pullback in attendance that accompanied the Delta variant. 
In the United States, auto plants were closed for two months last year. Even after automakers restarted operations, they have curtailed production schedules due to semiconductor chip shortages and other supply-chain constraints. Automakers said it was too soon to predict the impact of Omicron.
""This is new,"" Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co's U.S. spokeswoman Lloryn love-Carter said. ""We're monitoring of course, but we still have a lot of pretty strict COVID protocols in place.""
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), the largest U.S. automaker, said it was watching closely and its COVID-19 safety protocols remain in place at its plants.
""We continue to strongly encourage our employees to get vaccinated given the broad availability of safe and highly efficacious vaccines,"" GM spokeswoman Maria Raynal said in an email. ""We will continue to review and adjust our protocols as new information regarding this variant becomes available.""

 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said its U.S. management team will meet on Tuesday to discuss the Omicron variant.
""Right now we're in the 'gathering info' mode,"" Toyota's U.S. spokesman Scott Vazin said. ""Since most of our employees are based in plants, we've never stopped COVID protocols such as social distancing, health screenings, masking up.""

(NASDAQ:SAFM).While the economic rebound has helped propel the market over the last year, there's no question, continued broad-based earnings gains have kept the party going. According to Factset data through November 19th, the third quarter blended earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 39.6%, which would mark the third-highest year-over-year rate since 2010.
This followed the second quarter's 90.9% growth rate, the highest ever, and the first quarter's 50.3% growth rate. Growth is expected to continue, albeit at lower rates. This is because much of this year's growth is a reflection of how growth fell in the previous year due to the unique circumstances of the pandemic.
However, we have entered a new economy where market leaders will be determined by new demand, especially from companies that prosper in a growing economy.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ingka Group, the owner of most IKEA stores world-wide, reported on Tuesday a jump in annual profit on the back of record demand for home furnishing as people stay at home more due to the pandemic.
Despite more temporary store closures due to pandemic related restrictions than the year before, and product shortages due to the global supply chain crisis, operating profit in the 12 months through August was up 31% at 1.9 billion euros. Sales were up 6%, to above pre-pandemic levels, with online sales jumping to account for 30% of total sales, against 18% the year before.
Compared to the pre-pandemic fiscal 2019, profit was still down, by 8%, due to high investment levels. Capital expenditure was up 52% on the year, at 3.2 billion euros, as Ingka accelerated investments in digitalisation, new inner-city store formats, existing stores, and distribution and delivery networks. 
Chief Financial Officer Juvencio Maeztu told Reuters he expected sales to grow also in the current fiscal year, and profits to be at least as high as in the past year. Investment levels would probably remain at least as high as in the past year, he said.
""Our journey to create a better IKEA forges ahead in a world that faces unprecedented challenges. COVID-19 will continue to impact our business and the communities we are a part of,"" the company said in a statement. 
""The global supply and transport crisis will require a resilient, flexible response. Efforts across the value chain will continue to mitigate the challenges with product availability, inflation, prices of raw materials and transport that are expected to continue into FY22.""
Budget furniture brand IKEA operates through a franchise system, with Ingka the main franchisee to brand owner Inter IKEA with 392 stores including city stores, and 73 smaller store formats. 

Inter IKEA, which is in charge of design and supply, in the past year absorbed substantially higher costs for raw materials and transports, but has flagged it will raise prices to its retailers this year in the face of continued high supply related costs. 
Ingka's Maeztu said in the interview that he could not rule out that Ingka would also raise prices this year.

(Reuters) - Wall Street stocks closed higher on Monday, regaining some of the ground they lost in Friday's sell-off, as investors were hopeful that the Omicron coronavirus variant would not lead to lockdowns after reassurance from U.S. President Joe Biden.
The Nasdaq led gains among the major averages with help from the technology sector, while the S&P and the Dow advanced after suffering their biggest one-day percentage declines in months in Friday's holiday-shortened session as investors worried that the latest COVID-19 variant would cause economic disruption.
Biden said on Monday that Omicron-related lockdowns were off the table for now and he urged Americans not to panic about the variant. However, he did recommend vaccination and mask wearing indoors to combat the virus and said the United States was working with pharmaceutical companies to make contingency plans if new vaccines were needed.
Those comments and indications from drug companies that they are taking the variant seriously were reassuring for investors, who had been anxious about the potential for further COVID restrictions.
""Friday was a major de-risking event. You had the market go back to its worst fears of COVID spreading and the return of lockdowns,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. 
""Now you're starting to see there is some optimism when you listen to the President, when you listen to the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) CEO. The Omicron panic is easing, and we're into a period of wait and see.""
Vaccine makers such as Pfizer, its partner BioNTech and their rivals  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said Monday they are working on vaccines that specifically target Omicron in case existing shots are not effective against the variant. nFWN2SK0VH]
""It's not like the start of the pandemic all over again,"" said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer for the BMO family office in Minneapolis who also noted that after Friday's knee-jerk reaction, investors have been trained this year to buy the dip. ""People are willing to just take a deep breath and try to reassess, be a little more patient.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 236.6 points, or 0.68%, to 35,135.94, the S&P 500 gained 60.65 points, or 1.32%, to 4,655.27 and the Nasdaq Composite added 291.18 points, or 1.88%, to 15,782.83.
Among the S&P's 11 major sectors, technology was the leading percentage gainer, up 2.6%, followed by the consumer discretionary sector, which closed up 1.6%, with boosts from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Other big boosts from single stocks in the S&P came from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which gained ground after HSBC raised its price target for the iPhone maker. 
While the Dow advanced, it underperformed its peers with pressure from Merck & Co Inc, which closed down 5.4%. The drugmaker extended losses from Friday when updated data from a study of its experimental COVID-19 pill showed lower efficacy in reducing risk of hospitalization and deaths than previously reported. 
Britain said it would offer a COVID-19 booster vaccine to all adults and give second doses to children aged between 12 and 15, in light of concern about the spread of the Omicron variant. It also said Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were the preferred boosters. 
After the U.S. market close, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said everyone aged 18 years and older should get boosters six months after Pfizer or Moderna COVID vaccines or two months after a Johnson & Johnson shot.
Moderna rose 11.8% on the day, while Pfizer fell almost 3% and Johnson & Johnson rose 0.34%. 
The Philadelphia semiconductor index outperformed the broader market with a 4% gain as chipstocks rose broadly. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) provided the biggest boost with a 5.9% gain. 
Tesla's shares gained 5% after a report that chief Elon Musk urged employees to reduce the cost of vehicle deliveries.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) closed down 2.7%, reversing early gains after the social media firm said CEO Jack Dorsey will step down and be succeeded by Chief Technology Officer Parag Agrawal. Dorsey had been in the unusual position of having the CEO job at two major technology companies, the second being digital payments firm  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ).
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.35-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and 21 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 39 new highs and 344 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges, 11.13 billion shares changed hands on Monday compared with the 10.84 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

In its lawsuit, the government asked Judge Leo Sorokin to order the airlines to end their ""Northeast Alliance"" partnership, saying it would lead to higher fares in busy Northeastern airports.
The agreement allows American and JetBlue to sell each other's flights in their New York-area and Boston networks and link frequent flyer programs, giving them more muscle to compete with United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in the Northeast.

American and JetBlue have denied wrongdoing and asked Sorokin to dismiss the lawsuit.
The Justice Department's lawsuit signaled the Biden administration's interest in trying to inject more competition into the airline industry, where American and three other airlines control 80% of the domestic market.

""Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare & it's not over!"" Musk said in a tweet https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1465423422238994436 on Monday, in response to a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users' request on a Cybertruck update. 
""I will provide an updated product roadmap on next earnings call,"" he added. 
Musk said during Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s earnings call in July that he would not necessarily be present at such future events, unless he had something really important to say, indicating that he may have an update on Cybertruck and the company's other products.
Tesla unveiled the futuristic electric pick-up truck in 2019 that is made of stainless steel used in rockets. Musk has touted receiving several hundred thousand orders for the Cybertruck when preorders were opened.

At a shareholder meeting in October, Musk said Cybertruck production will begin next year and reach volume production in 2023.

(Reuters) - Airlines are scrambling to limit the impact of the latest coronavirus variant on their networks, while delays in bookings are threatening an already-fragile recovery for global tourism.
Shares in airlines performed better on Monday following a sharp sell-off Friday on the discovery of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
The latest outbreak, first reported in southern Africa, dealt a blow to the industry just as it had recovery in its sights, especially following the easing of U.S.-bound travel.
Multiple countries including Japan, the United States, Britain and Israel have imposed travel curbs in order to slow the spread of the new variant.
""The hope for U.S. and European carriers had been that opening the Atlantic would allow them to operate long-haul routes on a cash-positive basis, but border restrictions make it even harder to get the demand in,"" said James Halstead, managing partner at consultancy Aviation Strategy.
A pickup in long-haul traffic is seen critical for many carriers, which have been left with severely strained balance sheets following the plunge in air travel last year.
Southern Africa accounts for only a tiny portion of the world's international travel, but sudden border restrictions and route suspensions have left some carriers with an uncertain future.
Spain's Air Europa, caught in a months-long acquisition process by IAG-owned rival Iberia, which British and European regulators have so far been loath to approve, is especially vulnerable to renewed travel curbs.
President Joe Biden said while the restrictions were needed to give the United States time to get more people vaccinated, he did not anticipate the need for additional curbs. 
But Willie Walsh, head of global airlines industry body IATA, called the restrictions a ""knee-jerk reaction."" In an interview with BBC Radio, he urged authorities to institute ""sensible"" testing regimes and avoid measures that have caused ""massive"" financial damage to the industry in the past.
""This virus cannot be beaten in the way some of these measures would have people believe,"" said Walsh. ""We have to adjust. We have to take sensible measures.""
Rising COVID-19 cases as well as the new border restrictions have prompted analysts to adjust their outlook for the industry. Analysts at HSBC, for example, expect the industry's recovery would be pushed back by a year.
It is a setback for companies including the interconnecting Gulf carriers and Lufthansa, which depends heavily on transit traffic at its Frankfurt base, analysts said.
Big carriers acted swiftly to protect their hubs by curbing passenger travel from southern Africa, fearing that the spread of the new variant would trigger restrictions from other destinations beyond the immediately affected regions, industry sources said.
BOOKINGS DELAYED
Singapore deferred plans to open its borders to vaccinated travellers from the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia because those countries are transit hubs for African travel.
Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) said it had converted some of its flights to Johannesburg and Cape Town to cargo-only.
Qatar Airways said it would no longer accept passengers travelling from five southern African countries, but would fly passengers to those countries in line with current restrictions.
In the United States, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are the only passenger carriers with direct flights to the region. Both airlines said on Monday they have not made any adjustments to their flight schedules.
Delta said it is offering fare difference waivers to customers looking to change travel to, from or through South Africa, Israel and Japan. Both Israel and Japan have banned the entry of foreign travellers.
Concerns have also been raised about future bookings.
Some Australian travellers booked through Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd have cancelled or delayed trips amid new requirements for arrivals to isolate at home or a hotel for 72 hours while awaiting the results of a COVID-19 test, a spokesperson for the travel agency said.
In Germany, DER Touristik said that after very positive bookings at the beginning of autumn it had seen a reluctance to book, including for southern African destinations. 

Some companies seemed exasperated by the latest threat to business-as-usual.
""It's too early to make any predictions,"" a spokesperson for Spanish carrier Iberia said. ""As for contingency plans, do the flexibility and capacity to adapt that we have demonstrated throughout the pandemic seem insignificant to you?""

(Reuters) - Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) has settled federal charges that it routinely discriminated against employees who were not U.S. citizens because of their immigration status, the Department of Justice said on Monday.
The accord requires the San Francisco-based clothing retailer to pay a $73,263 civil fine, provide back wages to two employees who lost work because of its practices, and upgrade its employee training worldwide.
It ends a 3-1/2-year-old probe into Gap, which did not admit wrongdoing and said its actions did not violate a 1986 federal law against immigration-related employment discrimination.
Gap was accused of unnecessarily ""reverifying"" the employment eligibility of some lawful permanent residents and naturalized U.S. citizens, and requiring some employees to provide specific immigration documents to confirm their eligibility to work.

The Justice Department said Gap's reliance on an electronic program used for employment eligibility contributed to the discriminatory conduct.
Gap had no immediate comment on the settlement.

Major stocks plunged last Friday on concerns over the recent discovery of Omicron coronavirus variant taking a toll on the global economic recovery. This, along with the supply chain constraints and surging input costs, could keep the stock market under pressure in the near term.

The goals of the study will be to determine if supply chain problems have led to particular bottlenecks, anti-competitive practices or higher prices, the agency said in a statement.
It comes as the Biden administration battles a surge in inflation amid concerns that supply chain woes in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic are pushing up consumer prices.
The National Grocers Association has also expressed concern that large retailers have been able to use their heft to compel sellers to keep supplies flowing, putting smaller competitors at a disadvantage.
At the White House, President Joe Biden met Monday with chief executives of major retailers to discuss how to move goods to shelves as the U.S. holiday shopping season begins in the shadow of the Omicron coronavirus variant.

FTC Chair Lina Khan said she hoped the study would ""shed light on market conditions and business practices that may have worsened these disruptions or led to asymmetric effects.""
In its information requests, the agency asked the companies to detail what is behind any shortages they have experienced and what that has meant for them in terms of higher prices.

They have also asked for internal documents with strategies for maintaining their supply chain and determining pricing, as well as data on profit margin and market shares.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A group of former Google employees sued the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit on Monday alleging that it breached their employment contracts by not honoring its famous motto ""don't be evil.""
In the lawsuit filed in California state court in Santa Clara county, former Google employees Rebecca Rivers, Sophie Waldman and Paul Duke alleged that they were fired two years ago for fulfilling their contractual obligation to speak up if they saw Google violating its ""don't be evil"" pledge. 
Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has said before that the employees violated data security policies.
Their firings also have led to an ongoing National Labor Relations Board trial over whether the company engaged in unfair practices to stem growing worker organizing. Rank-and-file engineers and others working at tech companies in recent years have sought greater say over policies and projects. Management has pushed back, seeking to maintain control.
The three former Google software engineers had raised concerns at town halls and other forums inside Google about the company potentially selling cloud technology to U.S. immigration authorities, which at the time were engaging in detention tactics considered inhumane by rights activists, including separating migrant children from their families. 
The workers considered the potential immigration work ""evil"" under Google's policies, which call for ""acting honorably and treating each other with respect"" and engaging in ""the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct,"" according to the lawsuit. The company's code of conduct says workers who think the company may be falling short of its commitment should not stay silent, the lawsuit said.

The workers are seeking an unspecified amount of damages.
Google has promoted ""don't be evil"" as a core value for over 20 years, including when it went public in 2004.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A semblance of calm returned to world markets on Monday as investors waited for more details to assess the severity of the Omicron coronavirus variant on the world economy, allowing battered stocks and oil prices to rebound.
Global stocks rallied, oil prices bounced and safe-haven bonds lost ground as markets latched onto hopes the new variant would prove milder than initially feared.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 236.6 points, or 0.68%, to 35,135.94; the S&P 500 gained 60.61 points, or 1.32%, at 4,655.23; and the Nasdaq Composite added 291.18 points, or 1.88%, at 15,782.83.
The pan-European STOXX 600 ended up 0.7%, logging its best day in a month and recovering some of Friday's 3.7% slump triggered by concerns around the newly discovered variant.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.67%.
News of the variant triggered alarm and a sell-off on Friday that wiped roughly $2 trillion off the value of global stocks as countries imposed new restrictions for fear the variant could resist vaccinations and upend a nascent economic reopening after a two-year global pandemic.
Omicron, detected in South Africa last week, has been found as far as Canada and Australia. The World Health Organisation said on Monday the heavily mutated variant poses a very high risk of infection surges.
Still, investors drew comfort from signs that its impact might not be as grave as feared. In South Africa a top infectious disease expert said existing COVID-19 vaccines are probably effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalisation.
""Right now the market is reacting positively to statements that this variant is not going to be a major issue but there still remains a fair amount of concern,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
A South African doctor who was one of the first to suspect a new strain said on Sunday patients so far appeared to have mild symptoms.
""It was reported the new strain of the virus is 'unusual but mild' and that seems to be the driving force behind the rally in stocks today,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.4%, but found support ahead of its 2021 low. Japan's blue-chip Nikkei fell 1.6% as the country moved to bar foreigners to head off the Omicron strain. 
Oil prices rallied, after plunging more than 10% on Friday in their biggest one-day drop since April 2020. 
U.S. crude futures settled at $69.95 per barrel, up 2.6%. Brent futures settled at $73.44 per barrel, up 1%. 
Speculation that oil producing group OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, may pause an output increase in response to the spread of Omicron aided the oil price rebound.

SHIFTING EXPECTATIONS
European Central Bank policymakers sought to reassure investors rattled by the new variant, arguing that the euro zone's economy had learned to cope with successive waves of the pandemic.
This encouraged a move out of safe-haven bond markets, which had rallied on Friday as investors priced in the risk of a slower start to rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and less tightening by some other central banks.
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 9/32 in price to yield 1.5141%, from 1.485% late on Friday day.
European sovereign bond yields rose, with latest inflation numbers highlighting the challenges ahead for the ECB.
German inflation is set to surpass the 5% threshold in November for the first time in nearly three decades, regional data from several states suggested on Monday. 
Gold prices eased, resuming a broad decline from the previous week, as the dollar firmed and risk sentiment recovered.
U.S. gold futures settled 0.2% lower at $1,782.30.
The dollar index rose 0.07%, with the euro down 0.32% to $1.1281.

982,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 04:20PM ET</span>",Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey hands reins to technology chief Agrawal,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey is stepping down from his role and Chief Technology Officer Parag Agrawal will now lead the company, the social networking site announced on Monday. 
The appointment of Agrawal, a 10-year veteran of Twitter, signaled a tacit endorsement by the board of a strategy the company previously laid out to double its annual revenue by 2023, even if investors were not so sure. 
Twitter shares surged nearly 10% after the announcement and closed down 2.7%. 
Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter in 2006, is leaving after overseeing the launch of new ways to create content through newsletters or audio conversations while simultaneously serving as CEO of his payments processing company  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ).
He also navigated the tumultuous years of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration before banning the Republican from the platform after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
The CEO change is effective immediately and Dorsey will remain on the board until his term expires at the 2022 annual shareholder meeting, the company said. 
In an email to employees on Monday, Dorsey said he chose to step down due to the strength of Agrawal's leadership, the naming of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Chief Operating Officer Bret Taylor as the new chairman of the board and his confidence in the ""ambition and potential"" of Twitter's employees.
""I'm really sad ... yet really happy,"" he wrote. ""There aren't many companies that get to this level,"" adding that his move to step down ""was my decision and I own it.""
""We recently updated our strategy to hit ambitious goals, and I believe that strategy to be bold and right,"" Agrawal said in an email to employees. ""But our critical challenge is how we work to execute against it and deliver results.""
Over the past year, Twitter has fought to end years-long criticism that it has been slow to introduce new features for its 211 million daily users and was losing ground to social media rivals like Instagram and TikTok. 
Under Dorsey's leadership, Twitter acquired email newsletter service Revue and launched Spaces, a feature that lets users host or listen to live audio conversations. 
The company also rolled out advertising improvements to help brands find Twitter users likely to be interested in their product, a key component of the company's goal to double annual revenue by 2023. 
However, shares of Twitter have slumped in recent months, adding pressure on Dorsey to end his unusual arrangement of being CEO of two public companies.
In early 2020, Dorsey faced calls from Elliott Management Corp to step down, after the hedge fund argued that he was paying too little attention to Twitter while also running Square Inc.
Dorsey fended off the pressure by giving Elliott and its ally, buyout firm Silver Lake Partners, seats on Twitter's board.
In a joint statement issued after the announcement, Elliott Managing Partner Jesse Cohn and Marc Steinberg, a senior portfolio manager, endorsed the baton passing. ""We are confident that they (Agrawal and Taylor) are the right leaders for Twitter at this pivotal moment for the company.""
Dorsey will now focus on leading Square and other pursuits such as philanthropy, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The company's board has been preparing for Dorsey's departure since last year, the source said.
ENGINEERING FOCUS
The appointment of Agrawal as Twitter's new CEO suggests the company has picked engineering as its top priority.
Agrawal has helped lead Twitter's work on incorporating cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies into the company and also pursue its long-term ambition to rebuild how social media companies operate.
He has been a key figure in Bluesky, a Twitter-funded organization that is seeking to build a ""decentralized"" common standard for social media companies. Such a standard would allow different social platforms to operate on the same technology and let users post content across the services, for instance. 
Bluesky's work will likely take years to complete, Dorsey has said.
For now, investors are hoping Agrawal's technical prowess will help Twitter's advertising ""engine"" grow, said analysts from Baird Equity Research in a note on Monday.
Twitter earns the majority of its revenue from selling advertising on its website and app. But its ability to offer highly targeted advertising to drive product sales has lagged far behind larger rival Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) , advertising experts have said. 

The company previously said it sought to grow its highly targeted advertising segment to 50% of its business -- it currently constitutes just 15%. 
As investors digested the news, the market likely realized Agrawal's ""mountain to scale"" to reach the company's revenue targets and felt ""some disappointment that a Twitter outsider hasn’t been brought in to offer fresh ideas,"" said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).

983,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 04:18PM ET</span>",Walmart CEO says Biden supply chain push is easing bottlenecks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc Chief Executive Doug McMillon on Monday hailed the Biden administration's efforts to ease supply chain bottlenecks as the holiday season gets underway, noting the decision to extend port hours was having a positive impact on the flow of goods.
""We are seeing progress. The port and transit delays are improving,"" McMillon told President Joe Biden during a White House meeting with CEOs to discuss supply chain issues.
""Because of what you all did to help with overnight hours, and because of the team's work to reroute to other ports, to extend our lead times, and have other creative solutions, we have seen an increase in throughput over the last four weeks of about 26% nationally in terms of getting containers through ports,"" he said, joining the meeting virtually.
McMillon added that Walmart had noticed a 51% improvement in flow through Southern California ports, a big help for key holiday categories like toys.
Biden, who is wrestling with U.S. inflation that recently hit a 31-year high, has taken measures to try to break supply chain logjams, including unclogging ports and expanding trucker hours.
The Democratic president has also sought investigations into excessive shipping fees and possible illegal conduct into oil and gas markets that are keeping fuel prices high.
The meeting also featured participation from the CEOs of  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY), Food Lion, Samsung (KS:005930) North America, Qurate Retail Group (NASDAQ:QRTEA), Todos Supermarket, Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Inc,  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, the White House said.
CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) CEO Karen Lynch also participated virtually.
Biden was scheduled to make remarks about the supply chain, economy and efforts to combat inflation following the meeting, but the White House unexpectedly moved the speech to Wednesday less than an hour before it was slated to begin.
The president ""wanted to ensure ample time spent with the business leaders who traveled to the White House today,"" a White House official said by way of explanation, noting that the press was able to attend the beginning of the summit. 
Monday's meeting follows the start of the year-end shopping season. Black Friday retail sales were up 29.8% versus 2020 through 3 p.m. that day, according to Mastercard (NYSE:MA) SpendingPulse. 

Bargain hunters who ventured out to buy Christmas gifts on the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday found stores less crowded amid a shift online, COVID fears and less-steep discounts.
U.S. retailers are estimated to generate online sales of up to $11.3 billion on Cyber Monday, a decline in growth from a year earlier as fewer discounts and limited choices due to global supply chain disruptions deter shoppers.

Other reasons for positive ratings: strong organic traffic, consumer trust, brand recognition, platform content quality, and credit cards offering near-term upside. 
The only analyst with a less than positive view of NerdWallet was Morgan Stanley's James Faucette, who initiated the stock with an equal weight rating and $24 price target. Faucette said he is mindful of the cyclicality and margin implications of sales and marketing spending. "

986,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 03:54PM ET</span>","Omicron, Vaccine Stocks, Twitter: 3 Things to Watch","By Sam Boughedda
Tech stocks roared back Monday after last week’s rout that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its worse day of the year.
Investors bought the dip, taking advantage of the sharp sell-off in tech stocks. But there was also a bit of news. Twitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said he would step down from the social media company. 
Initially Twitter stock jumped 10% only to turn lower as the day went on.
Investors seemed to take the news of the new Omicron variant of coronavirus in stride after a weekend of headlines. Multiple countries around the world, including Japan and Israel closed their borders to foreigners or instituted partial travel bans to contain the variant’s spread.
The variant’s existence is what sent the major index into a freefall on Friday, which was a shortened trading session in the U.S. Airline stocks were in the spotlight, on concern new travel restrictions would affect their recovery, though the weekend was one of the busiest for business since the beginning of the pandemic.
President Joe Biden said Monday the U.S. would outline its plans for combatting the latest variant, though he advised those Americans who have yet to be vaccinated to get their shots and urged others to get their boosters. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Omicron fears
The WHO said on Monday the Omicron coronavirus variant carried a very high risk of infection and multiple countries joined the list of those who have identified cases. Oil recovered after Friday’s big sell-off as hopes grew that the variant might prove to be milder than initially feared.
The World Health Organization advised its 194 member nations that any surge in infections could have severe consequences, but said no deaths had been linked to the new variant.
2. Vaccine stocks
 Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) rallied Monday after Omicron prompted vaccine makers to examine whether a new booster shot will need to be produced. Moderna's CEO, Stephane Bancel, told CNBC that it will take months to develop a booster shot explicitly designed for the new variant, but a higher dose of its current shot could be ready much sooner. However, he also acknowledged that the variant is likely to be in most countries already. On Sunday, Moderna's Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said he suspects the new variant may elude current vaccines, but they will know more in the next couple of weeks. 
3. Twitter changes
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey is to step down from his role, the social media company confirmed Monday. Investors will likely continue to guess at what his departure means for the future of Twitter, which has faced criticism in the last year for content on its platform. The new CEO Parag Agrawal is a former chief technology officer. ""I've decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders,"" Dorsey said in a note he posted to Twitter.

This growth should accelerate in the coming years amid growing demand for low emission vehicles. Moreover, governments support through subsidies and tax rebates should boost the EV industry as well. According to Allied Market Research, the global electric vehicle market is expected to reach $802.81 billion, growing at a CAGR of 22.6% between 2020 and 2027. So, both NIO and FFIE should be able to capitalize on this growth. 
However, the EV industry came under pressure because of the semiconductors shortage. In addition, EV stocks have recently experienced a sell-off amid investors’ concerns regarding a new COVID-19 variant in South Africa. Which is why today we're going to take a look at NIO Inc.

Founded in 2014, NIO develops, manufactures, and sells EVs in China, targeting the luxury electric SUVs segment. The company also offers an innovative subscription-based model for its batteries.

Investing.com —  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares have rallied Monday after the emergence of the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron, which has vaccine makers examining whether a new booster shot will need to be produced. 
Moderna shares are trading around 11.3% above Friday's close.
Moderna's CEO, Stephane Bancel, told CNBC that it will take months to develop a booster shot explicitly designed for the new variant, but a higher dose of its current shot could be ready much sooner.
However, he also acknowledged that the variant is likely to be in most countries already. On Sunday, Moderna's Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said he suspects the new variant may elude current vaccines, but they will know more in the next couple of weeks.

Initial comments from a South African doctor who was one of the first to raise the alarm about the strain said the symptoms were so far very mild and could be treated at home. If that is the same for most cases — which may be true if it is already prevalent globally — a specifically designed booster shot may not be warranted.

CD Projekt has been mired in efforts to fix the Cyberpunk game ever since a bug-ridden launch in December led  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) to pull it from its PlayStation Store for six months.
The Polish company has also delayed the launch of the game's next-generation console version until next year, meaning it will miss out on the key Christmas selling season this year. 
CD Projekt said its third-quarter net profit came in at 16.3 million zlotys ($4 million), down 30% from the same period last year and well below an average analyst forecast of 36 million.
""This year-on-year reduction in net profit is mainly due to expenses related to updating Cyberpunk and exploratory work on new projects at an early stage of development,"" finance chief Piotr Nielubowicz said in a statement.
Revenue in the three months to Sept. 30 jumped 40% from last year to 144 million zlotys but the company's selling costs surged 77% to 55.3 million zlotys, which included 17.9 million zlotys of service costs related to Cyberpunk.
The video game maker did not say how many units of the game it had sold in the quarter. Now selling at half price, it was one of the top sellers on streaming platform Steam last week.
Nielubowicz told a conference call that the level of service spending related to Cyberpunk should decrease more substantially after the game's next-generation console version is released.

CD Projekt said it was on track to release the next-gen versions of Cyberpunk in the first quarter next year and ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" in the second quarter.
Cyberpunk's next-gen version is now in a testing phase, company officials said during the call, adding that they saw improvement in sentiment around the game on every platform.

The stock retreated due to the company’s update on supply chain and other issues it is facing. However, analysts expect strong earnings growth by URBN this quarter. So, should one scoop up shares of URBN on the dip? Let’s discuss. Read on.Shares of apparel retailer Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN) retreated last week despite the company’s upbeat third-quarter earnings report. Over the past five days, the stock has declined 11.9% to close its last trading session at $31.85. Investors were concerned about the company’s business update, which discussed how the company’s supply chain disruptions and elevated costs have negatively impacted its operations. URBN also highlighted the declines in its in-store sales. The company reported a 14% year-over-year increase in comparable retail segment net sales, driven by strong double-digit growth in digital channel sales. But it was partially offset by mid-single-digit negative retail store sales due to reduced foot traffic. URBN is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pa.
However, as the holiday season approaches, top apparel brand URBN will likely witness a spike in in-stores and online sales. According to the National Retail Federation, holiday sales during November and December are expected to rise between 8.5% and 10.5%, for a total of between $843.4 billion and $859 billion, marking an all-time high for holiday sales growth and topping last year’s record. In addition, URBN is expected to attract more in-person shoppers as solid progress on the vaccination front has allowed its stores to reopen.
The company’s stable top-line and bottom-line growth reflect URBN’s ability to maintain its growth trajectory. Also, the company ended its third fiscal quarter with inventories up 28.2% from the same period last year. So, as holiday shopping kicks into high gear, URBN should benefit.

(Reuters) - Wall Street banks are not immediately changing their U.S. return-to-work plans in response to the new COVID-19 variant, but they are monitoring the situation, they said.
The World Health Organization said as more countries report cases, the new COVID-19 variant dubbed Omicron carries a ""very high"" global risk of surges. Scientists, however, said it could take weeks to understand its severity. 
New York Governor Kathy Hochul issued a COVID-19 ""disaster emergency"" declaration on Friday, citing increasing rates of infections and hospitalizations and the threat from the new variant, which has not yet been detected in the United States.
Emboldened by aggressive vaccination drives and falling COVID-19 cases in major financial hubs, banks had been pushing ahead with plans to bring workers back to their U.S. and other offices around the globe, albeit at varying paces.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have been the most aggressive. Goldman and JPMorgan have had most workers back at offices on a rotational basis since the summer.
Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman had been pushing over the summer for workers to return, although insiders say that stance has since softened.
Others, like  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) have taken a more flexible stance. 
Wells Fargo pushed its return-to-office plans back to January 2022, while Citigroup employees in New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. have been working from the office at least two days a week since Sept. 13. 
Bank of America has allowed vaccinated staff to return to its offices since early September, while encouraging other employees to get inoculated.

Spokespeople for the six banks said that for now their plans had not changed, with some adding they would continue to monitor the situation and take their cue from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
""We will continue to follow the science as we have from the start,"" a Wells Fargo spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""Our number one priority is the safety of our employees and our customers.""

Considering their solid growth prospects, the dip in their share prices offers an attractive entry point. Read on.Stocks and other assets plunged in the post-Thanksgiving trading session as the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a heavily mutated strain of the COVID-19 virus that is a matter of concern. The WHO said, “Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs.” The WHO has designated B.1.1.529 as a VOC, named Omicron.
Investors were already treading with caution due to the spike in COVID-19 infections in Europe. And the emergence of the new strain of COVID-19 has left them further spooked. Global markets plunged as initial reports suggested that this variant could be more transmissible than the Delta variant. Tech stocks had driven the market indexes higher in 2020 due to an unexpected surge in digitization and work-from-home arrangements. The tech industry is further expected to grow in the foreseeable future due to the increasing applications of tech solutions across several sectors, and the continuing hybrid working trend. According to Forrester's report, the U.S. tech spending is expected to expand by 7.4% in 2021 and 6.7% in 2022.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to scoop up quality large-cap tech stocks Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO). They are currently trading below their respective 52-week highs. However, they have immense growth potential and could offer stable returns even if the market remains volatile.

(Reuters) -Three U.S. House Democrats on Monday asked the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to provide more details of the agency's oversight of Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s 737 MAX and questioned whether the planemaker had been held fully accountable.
The best-selling, single-aisle airplane, which was grounded for 20 months after two crashes killed 346 people in the space of five months, returned to service in late 2020.
The lawmakers, including House Transportation and Infrastructure chairman Peter DeFazio, asked FAA Administrator Steve Dickson in a letter Monday what the agency had done, if anything to hold Boeing employees responsible for various transgressions. It asks for a response by Dec. 13.
The letter said these included Boeing's apparent violation of its approved 737 MAX type design, as well as evidence of an internal plan to downplay the significance of a key safety system called MCAS tied to both fatal crashes.
An FAA spokeswoman said the agency would respond directly to the committee. Boeing did not immediately comment.
The letter said the lawmakers were ""deeply troubled by the absence of rigorous accountability for Boeing's past transgressions related to the 737 MAX and the FAA's failure to hold those who violated the public's trust accountable"".
Earlier this month, the FAA's Dickson told a U.S. congressional panel that Boeing had more to do as the U.S. planemaker continues to face scrutiny.
""Boeing is not the same as it was two years ago but they have more to work to do,"" Dickson said. ""We have reset the relationship with Boeing in no uncertain terms.""
In a Nov. 2 letter, acting manager for aviation safety in the local FAA office that oversees Boeing, Ian Won, told the planemaker that company appointees performing work for the agency did not have the required expertise and some employees were not meeting FAA expectations.
Dickson said the FAA was delegating fewer responsibilities to Boeing for aircraft certification and was ""demanding more transparency"" from manufacturers.
The FAA is currently scrutinizing a number of issues involving Boeing airplanes.

Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in January including $2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 MAX crashes.
Last month, a former Boeing chief technical pilot was charged with fraud for deceiving federal regulators evaluating the company's 737 MAX jet.

Wall Street analysts expect these names to gain significantly in the coming months. Read on.With Europe witnessing a sharp rise in COVID-19 infections, some countries, including the Netherlands and Austria, have imposed partial lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus. Investors were watching the European situation closely when the World Health Organization last week announced the emergence of a heavily mutated strain of the COVID-19 virus named ‘Omicron.’
As of November 28, 2021, the Omicron variant had spread worldwide, with thirteen infection cases reported in the Netherlands and two each in Denmark and Australia. U.K. Health Minister Sajid Javid said that the variant “may be more transmissible” than the Delta strain and that “the vaccines that we currently have may be less effective.” Against this backdrop, the work from home trend could be sustained in the near term. According to a Small Business Trends report, 32% of all employees worldwide will be remote workers by the end of 2021, up from 17% of employees in 2019.
So, with countries once again imposing social distancing norms and travel restrictions to keep the new variant at bay, it could be wise to add work-from-home stocks DoorDash, Inc. (DASH), Roku, Inc.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday issued guidance to listed companies around how to properly recognize and disclose share-based compensation arrangements made to executives ahead of company earnings and other releases.
The regulator said its new guidance spells out how companies must consider the impact such 'spring-loaded awards' would have on market-moving releases.
""Companies should not grant spring-loaded awards under any mistaken belief that they do not have to reflect any of the additional value conveyed to the recipients from the anticipated announcement of material information when recognizing compensation cost for the awards,"" the agency said in staff guidance.
Spring-loaded awards are share-based compensation arrangements where a company grants stock options or other awards shortly before it announces market-moving information such as an earnings release with better-than-expected results or the disclosure of a significant transaction.
Non-routine, spring-loaded grants merit particular scrutiny by those responsible for compensation and financial reporting governance at public companies, the SEC said of its new guidance. 
The SEC is seeking to revive https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-sec-breathes-new-life-into-2015-executive-compensation-clawback-rule-2021-10-14 a rule left unfinished from the 2007-2009 global financial crisis that would require U.S.-listed companies to implement a plan to recoup executive compensation in the event they have to correct financial statements due to compliance failures.

The guidance is also part of a broader push by the Democrat-led SEC to crack down on corporate malfeasance by augmenting its demand for more disclosure.
""It is important that companies' accounting and disclosures reflect the economics and terms of these compensation arrangements,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.

(Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday after their worst selloff in more than a year as investors awaited clues on whether the Omicron variant of coronavirus would hamper economic recoveries and monetary tightening plans by central banks.
The pan-European STOXX 600 ended up 0.7%, logging its best day in a month and recovering some of Friday's 3.7% slump triggered by concerns around the newly discovered variant. 
While the variant was spotted in several countries across the globe, a South African doctor, who was one of the first to suspect a different strain, said that symptoms were so far mild and could be treated at home.
Travel and leisure stocks rose, with Wizz Air, Lufthansa, TUI Group and Ryanair and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) all rising between 1% and 5.5% after double-digit falls on Friday on fears of renewed travel restrictions.
Financial stocks added 1.7%, while energy and basic material stocks were also among the biggest boosts as prices of the underlying commodities rose. 
London's FTSE 100 jumped 0.9% with investors also betting the Bank of England may be forced to rethink monetary policy tightening next month.
""The emergence of the Omicron variant has now crystalised fears that we're not out of the woods just yet... and led to a shift in monetary policy expectations,"" said Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell.
""The fact that markets have now alighted on February as the likely month for a UK interest rate rise shows there is still considerable optimism that Omicron is a stumbling block, rather than a brick wall."" 
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank argued that the euro zone's economy had learned to cope with successive waves of the pandemic.
But increasing pressure on the central bank, German consumer price inflation rose further in November to hit another record high, data showed on Monday. The German DAX gained the least among regional peers, up 0.2% 
BT Group (LON:BT) jumped 6.1% after a report that Indian oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance was considering an offer for the UK telecom firm. Reliance denied the report, capping the stock's gains.

Faurecia dropped 7.9% drop after the car parts group trimmed its full-year guidance, citing a drop in European automotive production.
Despite clocking several record highs in November, the STOXX 600 is on course to post monthly losses of about 1.7% as a strong earnings season and diminishing fears around tighter monetary policy were outweighed by concerns around the new variant and fresh restrictions in Europe.

1009,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 11:52AM ET</span>",Nissan unveils $18 billion electrification push in bid to draw level with rivals,"By Tim Kelly
YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co announced it will spend 2 trillion yen ($17.59 billion) over five years to accelerate vehicle electrification to catch up with competitors in one of the fastest growth areas for car makers.
This is the first time Japan's No.3 automaker, one of the world's first mass-market electric vehicle (EV) makers with its Leaf model more than a decade ago, is unveiling a comprehensive electrification plan. 
Nissan will be spending twice as much as it did in the previous decade for a share of the EV market as rivals, including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and newer entrants such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, move ahead with their electric-car plans.
Nissan said on Monday it will launch 23 electrified vehicles by 2030, including 15 electric vehicles (EVs), and wants to reduce lithium-ion battery costs by 65% within eight years. It also plans to introduce potentially game-changing all solid-state batteries by March 2029.
Those commitments, Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said, would make EVs affordable to more drivers.
""We will advance our effort to democratise electrification,"" he said in an online presentation.
Shares of Nissan slid 5.6% on Monday, underperforming its major rivals and compared to the benchmark Japan index's 1.6% drop.
Some analysts were unimpressed with Nissan's plan, noting it was already behind its rivals in electrification.
Masayuki Otani, senior analyst at Securities Japan Ltd, also said auto shares were falling on Monday because of concerns the new coronavirus variant would squeeze production.
""Nissan's long term vision comes at a time when the market is perhaps not receptive to it. It can be said that it represents a huge increase in investment, it feels cautious,"" he said.
Nissan's electrification plan comes as it pulls back from a pursuit of sales volume pushed by former chairman Carlos Ghosn, slashing production capacity and model types by a fifth to improve profitability.
""It's very important for Nissan to show where we are going next, and today's plan is a vision and direction which is talking about the future,"" Chief Operating Officer (COO) Ashwani Gupta said when asked about the share price at the gallery at its headquarters in Yokohama where it is displaying only electrified vehicles. 
Graphic: Nissan shares https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykdxeepg/image-1638174919146.png 
Although still only a small portion of vehicles on the road, global electric car registrations in 2020 grew 41% even as the overall car market contracted by almost a sixth, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). 
At the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow this month, major car makers, including General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, signed a declaration that committed them to phase out fossil fuel vehicles by 2040.
Nissan, however, has not committed to abandoning gasoline vehicles. It said on Monday half of its vehicles mix will be electrified by 2030, including EVs and its e-Power hybrids. COO Gupta said the goal was a reference point that may change.
As it readies to compete for the growing demand for EVs, Nissan in July pledged $1.4 billion with its Chinese partner Envision AESC to build a giant battery plant in Britain that will power 100,000 vehicles a year including a new crossover model.
Rivals, including Toyota, which also declined to sign the Glasgow pledge, are also ramping up their battery production. 
The world's biggest automaker by production volume plans to have 15 battery electric vehicle (BEV) models globally by 2025 and will spend $13.5 billion by 2030 to develop cheaper, more powerful EV batteries and their supply system. 

Toyota has said it is aiming to introduce solid-state batteries by the mid-2020s.

Matthew Harrison, an analyst at the investment bank, said the current evidence suggests the new variant will become the dominant strain in the short term, and due to the high transmissibility, there should be increased demand for antibodies that can neutralize the variant.

Harrison increased his price target on the stock to $49 from $33, around $8 above its current price, while forecasting 4 million doses of government stockpiling of ADG20 and $1.8 billion in sales. 
Slightly earlier in the day, Adagio released a statement saying none of the mutations in the Omricon variant escape from ADG20 neutralization. They added that further studies are ongoing and there are plans for an emergency use authorization submission in mid-2022."

(Reuters) -Walmart Inc said on Monday longtime executive Brett Biggs will step down from his role as chief financial officer of the world's largest retailer next year.
Biggs, the finance chief since 2015, helped oversee a period of rapid change at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) as the brick-and-mortar retailer launched and expanded a number of initiatives to help fend off competition from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Walmart made its biggest overseas investment in 2018 with a $16 billion deal to buy a majority stake in Indian online marketplace Flipkart, and beefed up its U.S. e-commerce business through the purchase of apparel retailers Modcloth and Bonobos.
Monday's announcement came as a surprise to some analysts who had viewed Biggs as next in line for Walmart's top job.
""Bret Biggs was a candidate to ultimately succeed Doug McMillon as CEO, given his long tenure at the company and broad experience across business units and functions outside of finance,"" said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group.
""However, we expect McMillon to serve many more years at the helm,"" Benowitz added.
Walmart's shares were down 1% in late morning trade.
Biggs had held several finance positions, including CFO of the company's international division and U.S. business, since joining the company in 2000.
Biggs will remain in the role until a successor is named next year, Walmart said, adding he will continue to represent the company as a board member of its fintech startup until January 2023.

The startup, a joint venture with investment firm Ribbit Capital, aims to develop financial products for Walmart's employees and customers.
Walmart said it was considering internal and external candidates to replace Biggs, as the company deals with surging labor and supply chain costs that have eaten into its profit margins.

By Jane Lanhee Lee
(Reuters) -Canadian power chip maker GaN Systems on Tuesday said it raised $150 million in a funding round led by Fidelity Management & Research as it seeks to expand its market share, including a big push into the electric car market.
While a chip shortage has been plaguing the automotive industry, GaN Systems’ Chief Executive Jim Witham said his company has secured production volume with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to continue its growth. 
BMW and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp have been investors in GaN Systems for several years, and Witham said GaN recently signed its first “capacity agreement” with BMW to guarantee delivery of power chips. He said about 100 power chips are used in each electric vehicle.
GaN Systems uses gallium nitride (GaN), a material more recently applied for chip making that is able to achieve four times reduction in power loss compared with traditional silicon-based power chips, said Witham. While the gallium nitride chips only make up 1% of a $16 billion power chip market, Witham said they are growing fast.
“There's a big play in automotive, EV, and now's the time to really capitalize the company for that rapid growth and to gobble up market share,” said Witham.

In addition to automotive clients, Witham said, GaN Systems chips were picking up traction in power chargers for consumer goods as they are smaller and more energy efficient than silicon power chips. They are also finding use in robots, servers, industrial motors and renewable energy facilities.
Witham declined to disclose the company’s valuation.

Investing.com — Shares of gene therapy company  Krystal Biotech  Inc (NASDAQ:KRYS) soared 117% on Monday after the announcement of positive data from its trial of a drug to treat a rare skin disease.
The drug, called VYJUVEKTM, is being tested as a potential treatment for dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (dystrophic EB), a rare, severe skin disease. The GEM-3 trial met its primary endpoint of complete wound healing at six-month timepoints and its secondary endpoint of complete wound healing at three-month timepoints.
Krystal Biotech shares hit a high of $102.99 on the news.
The company's Founder and CEO Suma Krishnan said Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa is ""referred to as 'the worst disease you've never heard of' because of the incredibly devastating reality that patients with this genetic condition face."" 
""We are thrilled to announce positive results from our pivotal GEM-3 trial of VYJUVEKTM which showed that this topical gene therapy led to durable wound healing in dystrophic EB wounds,"" added Krishnan.
The drug was well tolerated. No drug-related serious adverse events or discontinuations were reported.

1018,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",Omicron May Make Megacap Tech Even More Expensive,"(Bloomberg) -- Megacap tech stocks are already pricey, but the omicron coronavirus strain may make them even more expensive given their defensive characteristics.
Strategists say the group has the potential to outperform from here due to expectations for interest-rate hikes being pushed back and the focus turning to stocks that can prove shockproof. The tech heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, home to the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., opened 1.5% higher on Monday, outshining the S&P 500, after Friday’s brutal selloff.
Elsewhere, China’s growth-heavy Chinext Index jumped 1% on Monday, even though Asian stocks broadly extended losses. China’s Covid-zero strategy seems to be proving a boon for the gauge, which is dominated by technology and health-care names.
“I think big tech are the new defensives, with strong all-weather growth and fortress balance sheets, and given this their valuations are undemanding,” said Ben Laidler, eToro global markets strategist.
Recent history backs up this theory. Since the onset of the delta variant in late May, the NYFANG+ Index has risen 16%, outpacing a 9% gain for the S&P 500. The average 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for the NYFANG+ Index now stands at about 46 times, versus 21 times for the broader benchmark. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp. scan as the most expensive stocks.
Falling U.S. bond yields also bode well, but due to uncertainties over omicron and sky-high valuations, a rally is not a given.
“With sentiment frothy, valuations extended, monetary policy tightening and bad Covid news accumulating ... a market sell-off seems logical,”  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). strategist Robert Buckland wrote in a note.
Still, Buckland recommends buying the dip, as does Wedbush Securities Inc. technology analyst Daniel Ives, who sees “a clear buying opportunity given our bullish view of the tech sector set up into 2022.”

(AAPL) has been the biggest name in the consumer electronics industry for some time. While the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is a market leader and enjoys substantial brand loyalty, the recent crackdown on its anti-trust practices and an increasing focus on developing autonomous vehicles will likely put pressure on its consumer electronics business. Furthermore, supply chain disruptions and a semiconductor shortage are expected to shrink AAPL’s profit margins as its cost of goods sold (COGS) rises substantially. Consequently, analysts expect AAPL’s EPS to decline 5.7% in its fiscal first quarter (ending March 2022).

The group's electric vehicle unit, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd, also dropped more than 5% after it said the company was still exploring ways to pump capital into the unit with different investors.
Evergrande has been scrambling to raise capital as it grapples with more than $300 billion in liabilities and Chinese authorities have told its chairman, Hui Ka Yan, to use some of his personal wealth to help pay bondholders, sources have said.
Evergrande failed to pay coupons totalling $82.5 million due on Nov. 6 and investors are on tenterhooks to see if it can meet its obligations before a 30-day grace period ends on Dec 6.
The developer disclosed late on Friday that Hui had sold 1.2 billion shares in the company at an average price of HK$2.23 each, lowering his stake in the Shenzhen-based real estate developer to 67.9% from 77%.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Azul SA confirmed making an offer this month to combine with Chile's LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ) Group, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, but the Brazilian airline said it had since decided to focus on its own operations.
LATAM shares plunged on Monday by as much as 85% in Santiago trading, before paring losses to around 45%.
Azul shares rose 2.8% in Sao Paulo after saying in a securities filing late on Sunday it would consider potential partnerships only in the future.
The Brazilian airline said its non-binding proposal submitted on Nov. 11 had included around $5 billion in equity financing and was backed by some creditors of LATAM.
However, Azul added that LATAM's valuation in the bankruptcy proceedings had become higher than it found acceptable, citing ongoing uncertainty in the aviation industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in long-haul markets.
LATAM filed a reorganization plan on Friday in which it proposed an $8.19 billion infusion of capital into the group in a bid to exit its Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
The Chilean company previously said it had received several offers to fund the exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, each of which was worth more than $5 billion.
Azul said in its filing that it believed its non-binding proposal would have provided significant increased network growth and generated synergies estimated at more than $4 billion.
It added that ""the standalone plan presented by LATAM is, by definition, unable to generate synergies from a combination"".
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts warned in a note to clients that any tie-up between the airlines would have held more 60% of Brazil's domestic air travel market, which could have attracted ""extensive"" scrutiny from antitrust regulator CADE.

Azul said it will continue to focus on the competitive advantages of its own network, while evaluating future partnerships and consolidation opportunities.
The rise in the group's shares on Monday followed a steep fall last week, when travel-related stocks were dragged down by the detection of a new coronavirus variant in South Africa.

Investing.com —  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey is to step down from his role, the social media company confirmed Monday.
Initial reports saw Twitter shares react positively to the news, jumping 11% to a high of $52.25. Soon after, the NYSE then halted the shares for ""news pending,"" before the official announcement.
""I've decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders,"" Dorsey said in a note he posted to Twitter. 
The company said it has appointed Parag Agrawal as CEO and a member of the board effective immediately, although Dorsey will remain a member of the Board until his term expires at the 2022 meeting of stockholders. Parag Agrawal started at Twitter in 2011, serving in his current role of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) since October 2017, helping to lead its technical strategy.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, recovering from the abrupt sell-off on Friday that happened in reaction to news of a new variant of Covid-19. 
The Omicron variant, as it is now called, appears to be more highly transmissible than the Delta variant that has caused most Covid-19 deaths this year, and World Health Organization officials have officially termed it a ""variant of concern."" However, there is no evidence yet to suggest that it is more deadly than Delta, and stocks have been supported on Monday by a number of analysts calling Friday's sell-off an over-reaction.
Scientists in South Africa, where the variant was first detected, said that existing vaccines appear likely to prevent severe infection even by the new variant, something that - if confirmed - would greatly reduce the risk of new measures that would hurt economic activity.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose 7.5%, after being hit by fears on Friday that its Covid-19 vaccine could be outflanked by Omicron.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 160 points, or 0.5%, at 35,075 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4%. All three indices had suffered their worst day in months on Friday, in a move that was exacerbated by low liquidity due to the holiday. 
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock stood out in early trade, rising as much as 12% on reports that founder Jack Dorsey may step down as chief executive. It quickly gave up most of its gains, however, to trade up 4.4%. Dorsey has been heavily criticized by some shareholders for allotting plenty of time to other projects, notably payments company Square (NYSE:SQ), where he is also CEO. The company has also struggled to grow advertising revenue as quickly as some other social media rivals, and while its repeated failures in reining abusive behavior by its users has generate significant concern among lawmakers and regulators.
Twitter has been targeted by activist investor Elliott Management, which now has a seat on its board.
Travel stocks epitomized the trend, with Carnival (NYSE:CUK) stock rising 2.8% after plummeting to a 12-month low on Friday, while Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock rose 3.0% after hitting a one-month low in response to fears that the new variant would swiftly lead to fresh lockdowns.
Hertz Global (NASDAQ:HTZ) stock rose 3.7% after announcing a $2 billion stock buyback, the latest in a series of moves designed to reduce its cost of capital as it puts its bankruptcy episode behind it. The company had already announced its intention ot refinance expensive preferred stock with new debt last week. Hertz repeated its intention not to exceed a net leverage level of 1.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Elsewhere, ADRs of Chinese electric vehicle maker Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) rose 9.1% after an upbeat quarterly update. "

As such, Wall Street analysts expect low-priced oil & gas stocks Comstock Resources (NYSE:CRK), Tellurian (NYSE:TELL), and W&T Offshore (WTI) to gain more than 35% in price in the near term. So, we think it could be worth adding these stocks to one’s watchlist. Read on.Increasing demand for energy with the economy’s reopening and limited supply has caused crude oil and natural gas prices to rise this year, benefiting the oil & gas industry. The oil and gas market is expected to reach $7.43 trillion by 2025, registering a 6% CAGR.
The EIA said in its latest STEO that “crude oil prices have risen over the past year as a result of steady draws on global oil inventories, which averaged 1.9 million barrels per day during the first three quarters of 2021”. Also, according to a Deloitte report, the oil and gas industry has rebounded strongly throughout 2021. The report also stated that oil and gas companies are rebuilding themselves for a strategic transformation in 2022.

So, we think it could be worth adding renewable energy stocks Equinor (EQNR), TPI Composites (NASDAQ:TPIC), and Beam (BEEM) to one’s watchlist. Wall Street analysts recommend buying these stocks. So, let’s discuss these names.Favorable government policies, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), and the declining cost of energy storage technologies are expected to propel the renewable energy industry’s growth. The renewable energy market is expected to reach $2.17 trillion by 2030, representing a 10.1% CAGR .
According to a Deloitte report, concerns over climate change and support for environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) policies should drive the renewable energy sector’s growth in 2022. Moreover, President Biden’s support for building a clean energy economy and increasing renewable energy adoption should further fuel the industry’s growth.
Given this backdrop, Wall Street analysts recommend buying renewable energy stocks Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), TPI Composites, Inc. (TPIC), and Beam Global (BEEM). So, we think it could be worth adding these stocks to one’s watchlist.

The proposed project would serve Capital Power's Genesee Generating Station near Warburg, Alberta, which currently provides over 1,200 megawatts of baseload electricity generation to Albertans.
Alberta, home to Canada's oil sands, is aiming to become a hub for carbon storage and hydrogen production as the world moves away from fossil fuel consumption and tries to cut climate-warming carbon emissions.
Enbridge would be the transportation and storage service provider, while Capital Power would be the carbon dioxide provider on the project, which could be in service as early as 2026.
The captured carbon dioxide emissions from the re-powered units would be transported and stored through Enbridge's open access carbon hub that could also serve several other local industrial companies. 

Enbridge is applying to develop an open access carbon hub in the Wabamun area through the government of Alberta's request for full project proposals process, which is expected to start as early as December 2021.
Companies including TC Energy (NYSE:TRP), Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) also plan to build new CCS storage facilities.

""In loving memory of Virgil Abloh, Louis Vuitton pays tribute to the life and legacy of a creative genius with a presentation of his Spring-Summer 2022 Collection,"" said the brand, which belongs to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH.PA), in an Instagram post featuring a teaser video showing a girl setting off on a bicycle tour that ends on a beach lined with palm trees. 
Abloh, 41, died on Sunday after privately battling a rare form of cancer, taking the fashion industry by surprise, including those who worked closely with him.
""On Saturday evening, @virgilabloh and I wrote our last words for his @louisvuitton show in Miami,"" said British Vogue fashion critic Anders Christian Madsen.
""He never stopped, and neither did those of us around him,"" he added, noting that he had booked Sunday for the ""inevitable stream of ideas"" he's always sent me for our 90-page LV show notes a day before showtime.
Abloh, the American-born son of Ghanaian immigrants, studied architecture before rising to become fashion's highest profile Black designer, symbolizing the arrival of streetwear in the realm of luxury when he took up creative direction of men's designs for Louis Vuitton in 2018. 
Fashion shows for his Italian luxury streetwear label Off-White were famously packed events, drawing crowds that spilled out into the streets. Abloh was known for inviting industry outsiders, mixing students and skateboarders with stars from the worlds of design, music and sports, to catwalk presentations. 

""Everything I do is for the 17-year-old version of myself,"" he was quoted as often saying, as relayed by an Instagram post announcing his passing on his account.
""As a devoted supporter of his community through his charities and passions, he was an eternal optimist who believed anything was possible,"" Michael Burke, chairman and chief executive officer of Louis Vuitton, said in a statement.

High-tech home appliance maker Dyson told Reuters last week it was ending its contract with ATA, which derives 80% of its revenue from the firm, after an audit of the company's labour practices and allegations by a whistleblower.
Dyson did not disclose the audit findings but ATA, which makes parts for Dyson vacuum cleaners and air purifiers, had said the audits found forced labour allegations, which it viewed seriously.
On Monday, ATA said in a statement it only received a summary of the audit and that auditors said they were unable to ""conclusively determine whether all allegations are true or false"".
The audit summary alleged poor living conditions, issues regarding zero-recruitment fees for foreign migrant workers, unethical recruitment practices by agents, use of irregular workers, concerns of retaliation, unpaid allowances and bonus during COVID-19 in 2020 and unlawful deductions for meals, ATA said. 
""The company reiterates that it takes the forced labour allegations seriously and had engaged professional advisers to assist the company to review, verify and validate the audit findings,"" ATA said. 
ATA said it would see revenue drop by 30% in its 2022 financial year and by 40% in 2023, following the Dyson contract termination. 
The company expects to undertake cost-cutting measures in response to the termination of the Dyson contract, it said.
ATA also said it was taking legal advice on what its options were relating to the contract termination by Dyson. 

Dyson had ended its contract with a notice period, citing insufficient efforts by ATA to address the audit findings. ATA had said it would continue to manufacture and supply for Dyson until June 1, 2022. 
Shares of ATA have halved in value since Dyson said it would end its contract.

But although most solar companies can overcome current supply-chain challenges, some might struggle in the near term. So, Wall Street analysts recommend buying Sunnova Energy (NOVA) and FTC Solar (FTCI). But they fear SunPower Corporation (NASDAQ:SPWR) could witness a downtrend. Let’s discuss.The recent passage of a $1.75 trillion infrastructure bill, which offers significant funding and tax credits for the renewable energy and electric vehicle (EV) industries, should bode well for the solar industry. The growing demand for solar power units for household and industrial uses is expected to incentivize solar companies to develop efficient photovoltaic panels, energy storage solutions, and grid-tied systems. The global solar energy market is expected to grow at a 20% CAGR to reach $200 billion by 2026.
Although ongoing supply chain bottlenecks could affect the industry’s production in the near term, rising government support should help the industry keep growing. Investors’ interest in solar stocks is evident in the Invesco Solar Portfolio ETF’s (TAN) 14.3% returns over the past six months.
Given this backdrop, Wall Street analysts recommend buying  Sunnova Energy International Inc . (NYSE:NOVA) and FTC Solar, Inc. (FTCI). However, they recommend that SunPower Corporation (SPWR) be avoided.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Shares of LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ), Latin America's largest air transport group, plunged on the Chilean stock exchange on Monday after an announcement by the indebted carrier over the weekend of a restructuring plan that would dilute shares in the company.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Norilsk Nickel said it has raised its 2021-2030 investment estimate by $6 billion to $35 billion to reflect higher construction costs and increased investment in energy infrastructure upgrades.
This will allow the world's largest producer of palladium and refined nickel to invest more in upgrading its production infrastructure, its senior vice president in charge of strategy said, raising the mining group's 2030 output forecast.
""Within 10 years, we see an increase of up to $6 billion in addition to the figures we have given. But the bulk of the increase is on the horizon beyond 2025. We are essentially talking about extending our investment cycle,"" Sergey Dubovitsky told Reuters in an interview.
The amount invested by the mining group is important for its largest shareholders, businessman Vladimir Potanin and aluminium producer Rusal, who have a history of disputes over the size of Nornickel's dividends.
The company, whose investments were previously expected to pass their peak in 2026, now expects this to happen in 2028.
Dubovitsky said Nornickel regards 2021 as a transitional year when it enters its investment cycle after spending an average of $1.7 billion a year in the previous eight.
Nornickel recommended an interim dividend of $3.2 billion and its management expects to stick to its dividend policy with the final payment for 2021, he added.

From the additional spending of $6 billion, about $1 billion is the result of rising prices for materials used in construction projects amid global inflation driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The rest of the extra capital expenditure, $5 billion, is needed for an upgrade of Nornickel's main energy and production infrastructure, which has been in the spotlight for investors after a spate of accidents in 2020-2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened 2.45 million airline passengers on Sunday, the highest number of daily passengers since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency said Monday.
The tally was the highest for one day since mid-February 2020. Volume for the 10-day Thanksgiving travel period was 20.9 million, about 89% of pre-pandemic travel numbers, TSA added, and more than twice the volume over 2020.
Despite fears the jump in demand could strain the system, U.S. air travel was relatively smooth over the holiday period, in part due to favorable weather. U.S. airlines have been racing to add more staff and flights to handle the rising number of travelers, offering bonuses and other incentives for current staff.
Airlines are also worried about new travel restrictions that the United States imposed Monday on eight southern African countries that bar nearly all foreign nationals in response to a new COVID-19 variant, and are concerned these curbs may expand to other routes with higher traffic.
On Nov. 8, the Biden administration lifted travel restrictions for fully vaccinated air travelers from 33 countries including China, Brazil and much of Europe. 

Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said that in the week ended Nov. 14, U.S. airline passenger volumes were 10% below pre-pandemic levels, with domestic air travel down 8% and international down 25%. 
Travel group AAA had forecast 53.4 million people would travel for the Thanksgiving holiday, up 13% from 2020, with most travelers going by car.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 07:16AM ET</span>",Record number of U.S. firms change tack on political spending after Jan. 6 attack,"By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of S&P 500 companies that have either stopped political giving or plan to disclose it hit a record in 2021 after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and recent social justice protests, according to a study viewed by Reuters. 
According to the study from the Center for Political Accountability, U.S. companies see new risks in political giving in light of the country's hyper-partisan environment, leading corporations to either halt contributions or disclose them. The center advocates for corporate transparency.
""Unrest and angry political conflict have defined the past two years,"" according to the study, which cited as examples the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol, the two-time impeachment of former President Donald Trump and attempts to overturn the 2020 election. ""In these explosive times, companies are taking action. 
""They’ve adopted political spending policies to avoid or mitigate heightened risk,"" according to the study. 
Political spending came under closer scrutiny earlier this year after a raft of major companies suspended contributions to lawmakers who voted against President Joe Biden's election certification. [L1N2JN2ZQ] 
At the same time, some companies, such as Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), are becoming outspoken on social and political issues, including voting rights. [L1N2OP2UL]
The new study found that 370 companies disclose some or all of their political spending, or ban at least one type of it, such as contributions to trade associations. That figure is up from 332 companies last year. [L1N2H31BW]
The Center for Political Accountability considers disclosure or outright banning of political giving a mark of top flight corporate governance policy, said Bruce Freed, the group's president.
The study found that one of the biggest changes over the past six years among companies related to so-called ""dark money"" groups, which are tax-exempt organizations that influence politics. There was nearly a 100% increase from 2015 to 2021 in the number of companies who prohibit or disclose contributions to those organizations. 

 Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) was highlighted by the study for adopting a corporate political contribution policy stating that the chipmaker reviews recipients' voting records and public statements, and that it will communicate directly with them. 
The study also highlighted videogame maker Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) and artificial intelligence computing company NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), among others, for improving their policies by prohibiting payments to the ""dark money"" groups.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Macau casino stocks slid on Monday, rattled by the arrests of 11 people over alleged links to cross-border gambling and money laundering, with the founder of the gaming hub's biggest junket operator among those detained.
Shares in MGM China (OTC:MCHVY) plunged 10%, while  Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF) lost 7.8% and Sands China (OTC:SCHYY) fell 5.3% as investors fretted about the near-term potential loss of business as well as the longer-term implications of the watershed hardline stance being taken towards the sector by authorities in Macau and mainland China.
Alvin Chau, the founder of Suncity - a junket operator that brings in high rollers to play at casinos, extending them credit and collecting on their debts - as well as the CEO of gambling sector investment firm Suncity Group Holdings, was among those arrested, Macau broadcaster TDM reported.
Macau authorities have previously said police were questioning a 47-year-old businessman surnamed Chau, without elaborating on his identity. 
On Friday authorities in Wenzhou, a city in eastern China, issued an arrest warrant for Alvin Chau, accusing him of operating gambling activities in mainland China where gambling is illegal.
""Suncity accounts for over 50% of junket revenue (in Macau), which accounts for roughly 50% of gaming revenues, so Suncity accounts for 25% of gaming revenues,"" said Carlos Lobo, a Macau-based gaming consultant. 
""The impact on the gambling industry is huge ... But (Suncity) is no longer too big to fail, the system will not collapse.""
Suncity Group Holdings did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Macau police said on Sunday the 11 people arrested had admitted some allegations, including establishing overseas gambling platforms and conducting illegal virtual betting activities, but had declined to cooperate on other issues. 
Wenzhou authorities have accused Chau of forming a junket agent network on the mainland to help citizens engage in offshore and cross-border gambling activities as well as setting up an asset management company on the mainland to help gamblers make cross-border fund transfers.
NEW GAMBLING ERA
The tougher stance - which comes amid a broad regulatory clampdown in China on a range of sectors including tech and property - signals a new era for gambling in Macau and its relationship with mainland China, said Ben Lee, founder of Macau gaming consultancy IGamiX. 
""It means that China will no longer tolerate Macau promoting in any form or manner gambling into the mainland,"" he said.
He added that authorities, having learnt they could control the flow of visitors into Macau with the advent of COVID-19 border controls, had now moved on to controlling the type of visitors and that the special administrative region would now have to rely on mass-market gamblers instead of high-rollers.
Casino operators in the former Portuguese colony have recorded historic losses since the onset of the pandemic as China's quarantine requirements have made it too costly for most mainland tourists to travel there.
The Macau units for U.S. casino operators Sands, MGM and Wynn each saw revenue plummet roughly 80% last year and the sector will also now have to contend with the potential threat to tourism posed by the new coronavirus variant Omicron.
Shares in Suncity Group, which has a market valuation of HK$1.7 billion ($220 million), were suspended from trade on Monday after tumbling 165% so far this year.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Macau's government obtained more than 80% of its tax revenues from the gambling industry, which employed about three-quarters of the territory's 600,000 population, either directly or indirectly.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, rebounding after Friday’s plunge as investors reassess the potential impact of the new Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus on the economic recovery and future monetary policy.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 235 points, or 0.7%, S&P 500 Futures traded 40 points, or 0.9%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 175 points, or 1.%.
The Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa, has been detected in locations from Australia to the U.K. and Canada, although not in the U.S. yet. It poses a ""very high"" global risk of infection surges that could have ""severe consequences"" in some areas, the World Health Organisation said on Monday.
That said, South African health experts have indicated that the symptoms from the new variant have been mild so far, adding that they see the vaccines currently available protecting patients from severe diseases.
This has enabled investors to reappraise the situation in the wake of Friday’s selloff, in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 905 points, or 2.5%, lower, its worst day since October 2020. The S&P 500 dropped 2.3% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.2%. 
This week also sees the release of the important monthly official jobs report, with a strong November jobs report on Friday likely to underline the case for the Federal Reserve to speed up the phase-out of its $120 billion-a-month stimulus program at its next meeting in mid-December. 
That said, “the emergence of the new variant has naturally questioned whether central bankers can stick to planned goals for policy normalization,” analysts at ING said, in a report.
The retail sector is likely to be in focus Monday as investors try to work out the impact of the Black Friday sales volumes on the sector, while the travel and hospitality sectors should rebound after being severely hit Friday from the news about Omicron.
Crude prices climbed strongly Monday with traders reassessing the risks to global crude demand from the new omicron variant ahead of this week’s meeting of top producers to decide production levels moving into the new year.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, meets on Thursday, and is set to discuss the threat from the new variant as well as the decision of a U.S.-led coalition of major consumers to add output to the global supply from their emergency reserves. The timeline may be due to some slippage after the meeting of OPEC's technical committee of experts was delayed by the Omicron news.
The group had been widely expected to continue with its plan of gradually adding 400,000 barrels a day in January as demand recovers, but speculation is mounting that OPEC+ may decide this week to pause output increases.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 5% higher at $71.58 a barrel, having slumped over $10 in the previous session, while the Brent contract rose 4.8% to $74.99, after falling $9.50 on Friday.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,795.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1293."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Moscow-listed developer Samolet Group plans a secondary public offering in 2023 and would choose New York if it can convince investors it is a technology firm rather than just a builder, CEO Anton Elistratov said.
After a three-year drought on the Russian initial public offering market, Samolet became the first non-state company to list shares in 2020, opening the way for a continued IPO drive https://www.reuters.com/business/russian-companies-prepare-new-ipo-surge-2021-10-08 next year.
Elistratov said his ""optimal model, scenario"" envisaged changing the perception of his business from a traditional residential property developer to a property technology, or proptech company.
""And then in 2023, we can carry out the SPO (secondary public offering) in New York,"" Elistratov told Reuters.
The other option would be a secondary listing on the Moscow Exchange, which has advantages over a foreign listing, including a better chance of higher bids, Elistratov said.
Samolet, named after the Russian word for aircraft, expects the listing in the spring of 2023 to increase its free float to 30%-35% from over 10%, he said.
In October 2020, Samolet free-floated 5% of shares in a Moscow IPO and the share price has since jumped nearly 400%, supported by the company's financial results.
Samolet's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 179% to 21.6 billion roubles ($288.16 million) in the first nine months of 2021, unaudited management accounts showed.
The company plans to double its EBITDA in 2023 versus this year, Elistratov said. 
Samolet is Russia's No.1 developer by the size of the land bank. 
Rather than build homes, it hires constructors and itself focuses on high-tech solutions to create eco-systems around the real estate it sells and provide residential quarters with services such as cafes, co-working spaces, schools, supermarkets and roads.
Elistratov said the company studied its peers' experience in Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, and launched its own enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that helps manage dozens of projects online.
""The ERP system tracks how much time a person spent at the construction site and if the daily plan was fulfilled. We have drones flying over construction sites that scan the size of our completed work and compare it against models,"" Elistratov said.

""Our know-how is to try implementing the things that are present in higher real-estate grades and other countries in the economy segment here.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. tech giants should bear some of the costs of developing Europe's telecoms networks because they use them so heavily, chief executives of Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY), Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and 11 other major European telecoms companies said on Monday.
The call by the CEOs comes as the telecoms industry faces massive investments for 5G, fibre and cable networks to cope with data and cloud services provided by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Investments in Europe's telco sector rose to 52.5 billion euros ($59.4 billion) last year, a six-year high.
""A large and increasing part of network traffic is generated and monetized by big tech platforms, but it requires continuous, intensive network investment and planning by the telecommunications sector,"" the CEOs said in a joint statement seen by Reuters.
""This model – which enables EU citizens to enjoy the fruits of the digital transformation – can only be sustainable if such big tech platforms also contribute fairly to network costs,"" they said. 
The CEOs did not mention any tech firms by name, but Reuters understands that U.S.-listed giants such as Netflix and Facebook are companies they have in mind.
Signatories to the letter include the CEOs of Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), Orange, KPN, BT Group (LON:BT), Telekom Austria (OTC:TKAGY), Vivacom, Proximus, Telenor, Altice Portugal, Telia Company and Swisscom.
The CEOs also criticised high spectrum prices and auctions, used by EU governments as cash cows, saying that these artificially force unsustainable entrants into the market.
EU lawmakers' attempts to scrap surcharges on intra-EU calls also got short shrift from the CEOs who see this sector as a source of revenue from business users.
""We estimate that they would forcibly remove over 2 billion euros revenues from the sector in a 4 year period, which is equivalent to 2.5% of the sector's yearly investment capacity for mobile infrastructure,"" the companies said.

EU lawmakers have to discuss their proposal with EU countries before it can be adopted and may struggle to find agreement.

Qatar's national carrier has grounded 20 of its 53 A350s, saying it is acting on orders from its local regulator, until reasons for what witnesses describe as the blistered and pock-marked appearance of some of its A350s can be confirmed.
Airbus says there is no risk to the A350's safety - a point echoed by the other airlines, which have not grounded any jets and describe the issue as ""cosmetic."" 
The planemaker said in response to queries from Reuters there had been some problems with ""early surface wear"" that in some cases had made visible a sub-layer of mesh designed to absorb lightning, which it is working to fix.
Three people with direct knowledge of the situation said that at Qatar Airways and at least one other airline the mesh had in some instances itself developed gaps, leaving the carbon-fibre fuselage exposed to possible weather or other damage.
The A350, in service since 2015, is designed with ample protection to resist storms and is deployed around the world with high reliability, Airbus said in an emailed statement.
Asked about gaps in the mesh, it said some airlines were subject to higher swings in temperatures than others, apparently referring, for example, to desert conditions in Qatar.
Qatar Airways has called for a definitive cause to be identified and a permanent fix that satisfies its regulator. The Qatar Civil Aviation Authority declined to comment. 
Two people familiar with the grounding decision said it was based on ongoing uncertainty over the cause and impact of surface degradation and gaps in lightning protection. 
Airbus says it has found a root cause, but sources with two affected airlines said they had not been notified of one.
The row has set the clock ticking on a compensation battle that sources said could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars after Qatar Airways halted deliveries of 23 more A350s on order.
The clash between two of aviation's most powerful players became public in May, six months after Qatar Airways sent an A350 to be stripped and repainted in special livery for the FIFA World Cup to be held in the Gulf state next year.
But what for months had been widely presented as an isolated issue related to Qatar's severe heat is more widespread, according to a private maintenance message board used by Airbus and A350 operators and reviewed by Reuters. 
Messages show Finnair, which operates in the colder north, raised paint concerns as early as 2016, and reported in October 2019 that damage had spread below to the anti-lightning mesh. 
Cathay Pacific, Etihad, Lufthansa and Air France - acting in its capacity as maintenance provider for Air Caraibes - also complained of paint damage.
Following those previously unreported problems, Airbus last year set up a ""multi-functional task force,"" while studying new material for lightning protection in future A350 jets, two people familiar with the matter said. 
Finnair, Cathay Pacific and Lufthansa confirmed some of their A350s had suffered what they described as cosmetic damage. Air Caraibes said it and sister airline French Bee had seen ""no major paint problems,"" and especially none regarding safety. Air France said its own A350s had operated normally since it began flying them in 2021 and declined to comment on Air Caraibes. Etihad declined to comment.
To be sure, Qatar Airways has had disputes with suppliers in the past before reaching compromise deals. Its CEO Akbar Al Baker has periodically criticised both Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) over perceived manufacturing and strategy errors.
Analysts say the dispute coincides with efforts by many airlines to reduce their exposure to long-haul jets following the pandemic. Gulf industry sources deny commercial motives for the grounding, noting Qatar badly needs jets for the World Cup.
Airbus is also not alone in facing problems. Boeing has had paint issues and a phenomenon known as rivet rash, or flecks of missing paint, on its competing 787s. A spokesperson said it was not safety-related and was being resolved.
However, the unusual partial grounding by Qatar comes at a sensitive time for Airbus as it races to meet an end-year delivery target and as Qatar Airways studies offers from Boeing https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/qatar-airways-expects-take-delivery-boeing-777x-aircraft-2023-ceo-2021-11-17 to replace a fleet of 34 freighters.
'UNFORTUNATE'
In October 2016, a year after becoming the A350's first European operator, Finnair reported paint damage, according to the message board. It later complained ""paint is in very bad condition.""
Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific, which uses a different paint supplier, reported similar problems the same month. Almost a year later, it said it ""continue(s) to experienced paint peeling problems on multiple aircraft.""
In one posting, it disclosed that problems had been found on an A350 just two weeks after delivery. 
""We can confirm that we have experienced some issues with A350 painting, and have been working together with ... Airbus to solve these issues,"" a Finnair spokesperson said, adding the problem was ""cosmetic, but naturally unfortunate."" 
Cathay Pacific confirmed some of its A350s had experienced ""to some extent cosmetic deterioration."" The issue has been fully investigated and there is no safety impact, it said.
By October 2017, the messages show, Lufthansa had also found areas of peeling, some spanning more than a square metre. 
Lufthansa said occasional cosmetic defects had been corrected and that safety had never been affected.
MAKING PAINT STICK 
Paint has played a major branding and diplomatic role in the jet age, projecting the image of airlines and nations across the world. But a switch to new lightweight jets brought a hitch.
When Airbus 15 years ago launched the A350, it chose to follow Boeing's new 787 in using carbon-fibre instead of metal.
Experts say the lighter jets consume less fuel but are harder to deck out in a way that makes paint stick.
The new jets also need a layer of metallic mesh to dissipate lightning strikes because carbon-fibre is not conductive.
Finally, unlike metal, carbon does not expand and shrink as temperatures change. Yet paint does, resulting in a tug of war between plane and paint that can cause peeling over time. 
Problems reported by Qatar Airways and some - though far from all - other A350 operators suggest this is happening earlier than expected, two people familiar with the design said.
The problem may have been compounded by the paint's especially weak adhesion to titanium rivets, they added.
Some industry experts have questioned whether other manufacturing flaws may also have contributed to the problem.
Pictures submitted on the message board by Finnair in 2019, seen by Reuters, appear to show corroded or missing mesh known as Expanded Copper Foil. Finnair and Airbus declined to comment on the photos, but Airbus officials said that particular problem may have stemmed from an early production issue, since resolved.
""We have seen no effect on the structure of the aircraft and operators continue to fly with high levels of operational reliability,"" A350 Chief Engineer Miguel Angel LLorca Sanz said of the broader paint issue.
""This is not at all affecting the lightning strike protection due to the substantial (safety) margins ... It is not at all an airworthiness issue,"" he said in an interview.
Airbus is nonetheless looking at updating the lightning system to a more flexible material called Perforated Copper Foil, industry sources said. 
Airbus confirmed it is one option under review.
That still leaves a war of words over existing planes sitting idle with their windows taped up in Qatar.
Photographs obtained by Reuters show cracked or missing paint and exposed or corroded lightning protection on at least two of the jets. 

Now regulators must try to break an impasse over whether that kind of damage is within the allowable margins for dealing with lightning, which Airbus insists would still wash safely over the jet. That in turn may determine whether compensation clauses will be triggered.
While European regulators have said there is no evidence of safety risk, Qatar is pressing for deeper analysis and shows no immediate signs of backing down.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Amazon has asked India's antitrust regulator to revoke its approval for Future Retail's $3.4 billion sale of retail assets to Reliance, saying it was ""illegally obtained"", violating an order suspending the deal, a letter seen by Reuters shows.
The approval for the deal was a ""nullity in the eyes of law"" as an arbitrator's order was still in force, according to the letter sent by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) last week. 
The battle between two of the world's richest men, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Reliance Industries Ltd boss Mukesh Ambani, marks a contest for preeminence in India’s booming, nearly trillion-dollar retail market.
The winner in the fight for Future Retail Ltd, India’s second-largest retailer and Amazon’s estranged local partner, will get pole position in the race to meet the daily needs of more than a billion people.
The CCI, Amazon, Future Group and Reliance did not respond to requests for comment. 
Future has said the arbitrator's suspension order was invalid but Indian courts have declined to overturn it.
If the regulator agrees with the previously unreported letter, it would be a major setback for oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance.
Amazon won an injunction https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-india-future-reliance-idCNL4N2RN47P against the deal from a Singapore arbitrator last year, alleging Future had violated contracts that prevented it from selling the assets to entities including Reliance.
But the CCI later cleared the deal.
Future misled the CCI and continued to seek approval for the deal, Amazon said in the letter dated Wednesday, calling the injunction a ""brazen attempt to subvert the rule of law"".
Amazon asked for a personal hearing from the CCI to make its case. 

The letter comes as Amazon is also battling allegations that it misrepresented facts and concealed information while seeking antitrust clearance for a 2019 deal with Future Group.
Amazon has so far successfully used this deal's contracts to block Future's deal with Reliance.

Aeroflot, whose shares rose by 1.6% to 0941 GMT, said its net profit in the third quarter was 11.6 billion roubles ($155 million) compared to a loss of 21.14 billion roubles a year ago.
Aeroflot's domestic traffic has grown as Russia refrained from imposing a complete lockdown during a new wave of infections. 
In the third quarter, Aeroflot's passenger numbers on the domestic market were 27.4% higher than the same period in 2019, before the pandemic.
""We also took maximum advantage of the gradual lifting of restrictions in the international segment, and this also had a significant positive impact on the results,"" Andrey Chikhanchin, Aeroflot’s Deputy CEO for Commerce and Finance, said.
Berenberg analysts said on Monday new lockdowns in parts of Europe and the spread of the new Omicron coronavirus variant threatened the global recovery in air travel. 
Aeroflot's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) in the third quarter was 54.05 billion roubles, compared to 20.09 billion roubles a year ago. 
The company said it planned to maintain strict cost control as its fuel costs jumped by 41.7% year on year in the first nine months of 2021.

Aeroflot said this month it would raise the fuel charge on its domestic and international routes because of rising jet fuel costs.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, only partially unwinding Friday’s hefty losses, with travel stocks benefiting as investors reassess the potential economic damage the newly discovered omicron Covid variant might cause.
Fears gripped the market last week that the variant could resist vaccinations and crush the economic recovery. However, South African health experts have indicated that the symptoms from the new variant have been mild so far, while drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) indicated Sunday it could roll out a reformulated vaccine early next year. 
At 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France also rose 0.9% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.9%. These indices fell around 4% on Friday.
The omicron variant is likely to spread internationally, posing a ""very high"" global risk where Covid-19 surges could have ""severe consequences"" in some areas, the World Health Organisation said on Monday.
New cases have been found in a number of countries, including the U.K., the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia, prompting more travel restrictions as countries try to isolate themselves.
IAG (LON:ICAG) stock rose 2.1%, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock climbed 1.7%, while Tui (DE:TUIGn) stock rose 1.5% as the airline and travel sector rebounded from last week’s rout. Additionally BP (NYSE:BP) stock gained 2.7%, Eni (MI:ENI) stock rose 2.4% and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) climbed 3.1% as crude oil prices rose.
Traders are now reassessing the risks to global crude demand from the new omicron variant ahead of this week’s meeting of top producers to decide production levels moving into the new year.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, meets on Thursday, and is set to discuss the threat from the new variant as well as the decision of a U.S.-led coalition of major consumers to add output to the global supply from their emergency reserves.
The group had been widely expected to continue with its plan of gradually adding 400,000 barrels a day in January as demand recovers, but speculation is mounting that OPEC+ may decide this week to pause output increases.
By 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 5.2% higher at $71.69 a barrel, having slumped over $10 in the previous session, while the Brent contract rose 4.5% to $75.04, after falling $9.50 on Friday.
In economic news, Spanish inflation hit its highest in nearly three decades in November as increases in food and fuel costs pushed consumer prices up 5.6% year-on-year. The German equivalent data is due later in the session, and is also expected to climb to the 5% level, increasing the pressure on European Central Bank policymakers ahead of their next meeting on December 16.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,800.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1279."
1051,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 02:50AM ET</span>",Buying the Omicron dip,"A look at the day ahead from Danilo Masoni.
Sell first, get answers later. With stocks near lifetime peaks, the Black Friday reaction to the new fast-spreading virus strain Omicron was hardly surprising.
But a weekend later, investors look heavily engaged in buying the dip, as markets take a more balanced view of risks attached to what the WHO called a ""variant of concern"".
After their ninth biggest drop ever on Friday, gains in crude prices topped 5% earlier in Asia and stock futures point to a solid bounce across Europe and America.
A South African doctor said patients with Omicron have ""very mild"" symptoms and investment houses don't look to have budged that much.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), for example, made no portfolio changes, staying slight overweight on equities.
Perhaps more telling is that retail traders poured north of $2 billion into U.S. stocks on Friday, setting the second biggest daily inflow on record, per Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research data.
Of course there are uncertainties and that will likely make for volatile days heading into the Christmas shopping season. 
Understanding the level of severity of the variant ""will take days to several weeks"", said WHO. And vaccine maker BioNTech needs up to two weeks to figure out whether the shot it makes with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) needs to be reworked.
So while Omicron has spread from Australia to the Netherlands and governments ban travel and mull lockdowns, markets may also gamble on central bankers turning more patient in their path towards rates normalisation.

Lots of speakers from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are lined up for today. On Sunday, speaking about risks to the recovery, ECB's Lagarde said: ""We now know our enemy and what measures to take."" 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday: * ECB speakers: Governor Lagarde, ECB board members AndreaEnria, Isabel Schnabel, Pentti Hakkarainen; ECB Vice PresidentLuis de Guindos * Euro zone consumer sentiment/inflation expectations * German preliminary CPI/HICP * Fed speakers: Chairman Jerome Powell, New York PresidentJohn Williams, Governor Bowman * Emerging markets: Kenya central bank meets; Turkey tradebalance and bank NPL ratios (This story refiles to fix chart)

Investing.com – Developer China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) shares fell as much as 4.8% on Monday after chairman Hui Ka Yan divested some of his stake in the company to raise about $344 million.
The company’s Hong Kong shares tumbled 8.40% to HK$2.29 ($0.29) by 11:53 PM ET (4:53 AM GMT). Shares in electric vehicle unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd. also tumbled 13.11% to HK$4.11 after China Evergrande said it was still exploring ways to pump capital into the unit with different investors.
Hui sold a total of 1.2 billion China Evergrande shares, the company said on Friday. The shares had an average price of HK$2.23 each, a 20% discount to the closing price on Nov. 24, and lowered Hui’s stake to 67.9% from 77%. The buyers were not disclosed.
China Evergrande has been desperately raising capital to tackle its more than $300 billion in liabilities and Chinese authorities have reportedly told Hui to use part of his personal wealth to help pay bondholders.
Investors are now waiting to see if the company will be able to meet its obligations on coupon payments totaling $82.5 million that were due on Nov. 6. The 30-day grace period for the payment ends on Dec 6.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.11%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.42% while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.02%. A Peking University study said China would face a major surge in COVID-19 cases on a scale beyond anything any other country has yet seen if it were to reopen in a similar manner to the U.S.
U.S. shares were up, and the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose above 1.50%. These moves suggested that the market has calmed after riskier assets plunged on Friday over the discovery of the omicron strain of COVID-19.
Two South African health experts, including South African Medical Association chair Angelique Coetzee, suggested the omicron variant is presenting with mild symptoms so far. However, the World Health Organization cautioned that it will take time to assess the strain and has classified it as a ""variant of concern”.
 Moderna  Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) chief medical officer Paul Burton said a reformulated shot for the new strain could be available in early 2022.
Whether the omicron outbreak is a brief scare or a more serious blow to an economic recovery already pressured by the prospect of tighter monetary policy is still open to debate.
“We really need some more answers to figure out the impact on growth. Risk assets are pricing in uncertainty,” TD Securities global head of rates strategy Priya Misra told Bloomberg.
Other investors were more optimistic.
“Markets have traded through all previous COVID-19 variants and just touched all-time highs. My expectation is we will do the same for this one,” Tribeca Investment Partners Pty. portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu told Bloomberg.
Investors last week pushed back the expected timing of a first 25-basis-point rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve to July from June 2022. However, Fed Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic played down economic risks from a new COVID-19 variant, saying he was open to accelerating asset tapering to curb rising inflation."
1058,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2021 07:36PM ET</span>","Even in tech hub Shenzhen, China's property market succumbs to chills","By David Kirton
SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Life used to be good for Jerry Tang, who left his rural hometown in 2014 to become a real estate agent in Shenzhen - China's tech megacity and one of the world's hottest property markets.
Just a few years ago Tang could make up to 50,000 yuan ($7,800) in a good month selling apartments. Last year, he was making around 15,000 yuan a month, but this year that's fallen to about 5,000 yuan and mostly comes from commission on rentals.
""It's definitely much harder to sell this year,"" he said. ""Buyers are waiting to see what happens with the market, while developers are cash-strapped, they are taking time to pay commission to agents.""
In Shenzhen - home to 17.6 million people and firms like gaming powerhouse Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd and telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies - some smaller realtor offices have closed. Eight real estate agents Reuters spoke with also say at least a third of their colleagues have either left the industry or are thinking about it.
Lianjia, a major realtor, plans to shut down a fifth, or about a hundred, of its offices in Shenzhen, financial news service Caixin reported in September, citing an internal memo. Lianjia and its parent company KE Holdings did not respond to requests for comment.
The lack of turnover in Shenzhen's property market and the fallout on the city's real estate brokers stems in part from deliberate policy efforts over the past year by local authorities to make apartment prices more affordable, including requiring higher down payments for second homes and capping resale prices. 
But real estate agents say it also due to the current crisis of confidence hitting China's property industry, highlighting just how extensively the sector's woes are reverberating. If Shenzhen - emblematic of China's meteoric economic rise over the past 40 years - is not immune, then few places in the country are.
China's property market, which accounts for a quarter of GDP by some metrics, has been suffering unprecedented stress after policymakers this year introduced debt caps to rein in excessive borrowing by developers. 
That in turn has helped lead to liquidity crises at developers such as China Evergrande Group, the world's most indebted developer, and Kaisa Group Holdings. Both of them also happen to be headquartered in Shenzhen. Policymakers are, however, widely expected to stand firm on the new rules which are perceived as necessary reform.
Prices for new homes in Shenzhen fell 0.2% in October from a month earlier - their first drop this year - and in line with the national average. It remains to be seen, however, if Shenzhen's property prices will suffer the more sustained, albeit still small declines that have hit some second-tier Chinese cities this year.
In its favour, the southern tech hub's economy is not much smaller than that of fellow megacity Shanghai's but Shenzhen has only a third of the land, ensuring strong underlying demand for apartments.
""Buyers are concerned about Evergrande and contagion, but in Shenzhen they know other developers would step in to finish projects if they had to,"" Tang said. 
For some, the tougher curbs and subsequent property market chills are a sign that speculative buying - often rampant in China as traditionally there have been few other investment options - could become a thing of the past.
""My parents' generation could close their eyes and point somewhere to invest their money and get a great return - they could gamble,"" said Lisa Li, who works in the investment industry and recently bought a small studio apartment but found the process nerve-wracking.
""Our generation can't do that, we'd be in trouble,"" she said.
That's cold comfort, however, for Tang, 30, who says he is thinking of changing jobs.

""I need savings if I'm to find a girlfriend, and I'm supporting my mum back home.""

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2021 07:00PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: COVID-19 fears reappear as a threat to market,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - COVID-19 has resurfaced as a worry for investors and a potential driver of big market moves after a new variant triggered alarm, long after the threat had receded in Wall Street's eyes. 
Worries about a new strain of the virus, named Omicron and classified by the World Health Organization as a variant of concern, slammed markets worldwide and dealt the S&P 500 index its biggest one-day percentage loss in nine months. The moves came a day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday when thin volume likely exacerbated the moves.
With little known about the new variant, longer term implications for U.S. assets were unclear. At least, investors said signs that the new strain is spreading and questions over its resistance to vaccines could weigh on the so-called reopening trade that has lifted markets at various times this year.
The new strain may also complicate the outlook for how aggressively the Federal Reserve normalizes monetary policy to fight inflation.
""Markets were celebrating the end of the pandemic. Slam. It isn't over,"" said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. ""All policy issues, meaning monetary policy, business trajectories, GDP growth estimates, leisure and hospitality recovery, the list goes on, are on hold.""
The S&P 500 fell by a third as pandemic fears mushroomed in early 2020, but has more than doubled in value since then, though the pandemic's ebb and flow has driven sometimes-violent rotations in the types of stocks investors favor. The index is up more than 22% this year.
Before Friday, broader vaccine availability and advances in treatments made markets potentially less sensitive to COVID-19. The virus had dropped to a distant fifth in a list of so-called ""tail risks"" to the market in a recent survey of fund managers by BofA Global Research, with inflation and central bank hikes taking the top spots.
On Friday, however, technology and growth stocks that had prospered during last year's so-called stay-at-home trade soared, including Zoom Communications, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON). 
At the same time, stocks that had rallied this year on bets of economic reopening may suffer if virus fears grow. Energy, financials and other economically sensitive stocks tumbled on Friday, as did those of many travel-related companies such as airlines and hotels.
The new Omicron coronavirus variant spread further around the world on Sunday, with 13 cases found in the Netherlands and two each in Denmark and Australia, even as more countries tried to seal themselves off by imposing travel restrictions.
First discovered in South Africa, the new variant has now also been detected in Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Botswana, Israel, Australia and Hong Kong.
Friday's swings also sent the Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, soaring and options investors scrambling to hedge their portfolios against further market swings.
Andrew Thrasher, portfolio manager for The Financial Enhancement Group, had been concerned that recent gains in a handful of technology stocks with large weightings in the S&P 500, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), were masking weakness in the broader market.
""This set the kindling for sellers to push markets lower and the latest COVID news appears to have stoked that bearish flame,"" he said.
Some investors said the latest COVID-19 related weakness could be a chance to buy stocks at comparatively lower levels, expecting the market to continue rapidly recovering from dips, a pattern that has marked its march to record highs this year. 
""We've had numerous days when economic optimism collapses. Each of these optimism collapses were a good buying opportunity,"" wrote Bill Smead, founder of Smead Capital Management, in a note to investors. Among the stocks he recommended were Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and  Macerich Co  (NYSE:MAC), down 7.2% and 5.2% respectively on Friday.
One of several wild cards is whether virus-driven economic uncertainty will slow the Federal Reserve's plans to normalize monetary policy, just as it has started unwinding its $120 billion a month bond buying program.
Futures on the U.S. federal funds rate, which track short-term interest rate expectations, on Friday showed investors rolling back their view of a sooner-than-expected rate increase.
Investors will be watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's appearance before Congress to discuss the government's COVID response on Nov. 30 as well as U.S. employment numbers, due out next Friday.

Investors held out hope that markets could stabilize. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management, said moves may have been exaggerated by lack of liquidity on Friday, with many participants out for the Thanksgiving holiday. 
""My first reaction is anything we are going to see today is overdone,"" Ablin said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -After years of expansion in Hong Kong, cash-strapped Chinese developers are reducing their presence in one of the world's most expensive property markets, allowing firms in the financial hub to scoop up some of their assets at distressed prices.
Developers including China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd, struggling under billions of dollars in debt, have sold some assets in recent months to Hong Kong developers to help ease liquidity stress back home.
There's more to come - Aoyuan Group, which this week extended the redemption date of onshore asset-backed securities, is trying to offload more Hong Kong properties to raise capital, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Aoyuan is planning to sell a redeveloped office building in Kwai Chung in eastern Hong Kong, and the bidders will likely be local investors or family offices, said the sources, declining to be named as the information is confidential. 
The deal is expected to be sold at less than what Aoyuan paid for it, the sources added. Aoyuan bought the building for HK$950 million ($121.83 million) in 2018, and property agents estimate its current valuation at less than HK$800 million.
This will follow a deal in mid-November, when Aoyuan sold some assets in a residential development in the Mid-Levels to a Hong Kong investor at a loss of HK$177 million.
Aoyuan could not be reached for comment via its officially-listed email and calls to the company went unanswered.
The trend will help Hong Kong property tycoons to further boost their dominance in the Chinese-controlled territory.
Once deep-pocketed Chinese developers had moved aggressively into Hong Kong, outbidding their cross-border rivals for prime sites in the city as they searched for investment opportunities outside the mainland.
But now those developers are facing an unprecedented cash crunch due to regulatory curbs as Beijing tries to reduce leverage in the sector, causing some to miss bond and wealth management product payments.
Some builders have resorted to selling their assets to meet near-term repayment obligations.
TREND REVERSAL
""It's a reversal of the trend,"" said Reeves Yan, CBRE head of capital markets in Hong Kong. ""Chinese developers with liquidity crunch are now selling, and it is expected that there will be more selling in the next few months (in Hong Kong).""
Kaisa, which missed coupon payments totalling $88.4 million due earlier this month, sold a residential land parcel in Kai Tak, where Hong Kong's old airport was situated, to local peers Far East Consortium and New World Development on Wednesday for a consideration of HK$7.9 billion, a stock exchange filing said.
It recently sold another parcel in Tuen Mun in northern Hong Kong to local investor Francis Choi for HK$3.78 billion, Reuters reported this week. The sale helped Kaisa recover around HK$1.3 billion cash after repaying the loans it borrowed for the land. 
Kaisa declined to comment.
Evergrande, which is grappling with more than $300 billion in liabilities, has transferred unsold units worth HK$2 billion in a residential development to its joint-venture partner VMS Group, a Hong Kong financial company, a separate source told Reuters.
Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment.
So far this year, taking into account only government land sales and not private ones between developers, only one Chinese property firm was involved in a land purchase worth HK$7.3 billion, which it jointly invested in with four Hong Kong peers.
That compared with a total of HK$39 billion spent last year and a record of HK$58 billion in 2017, according to data compiled by CBRE.
Some financially stronger Chinese developers are, however, still active in the market, sector observers said. 

In the city's last residential land auction in October, state-owned China Overseas Land was the only Chinese company among the sixteen bidders, though it did not win. 
""The state-owned developers are still cash-rich, but the property market will be led more by Hong Kong investors going forward,"" said Tom Ko, Cushman & Wakefield (NYSE:CWK)'s Hong Kong capital markets executive director.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2021 03:05PM ET</span>",Amazon exec says Omicron's impact on holiday spending uncertain,"By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A senior Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) executive said it remains too early to predict how the Omicron coronavirus variant will impact consumer spending during the holiday season but suggested that shoppers will press ahead for now. 
""It’s very early in the process of understanding what’s happening with the new variant,"" said Dave Clark, chief executive of Amazon's worldwide consumer business, during a Sunday morning interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""
Clark said he was ""incredibly optimistic"" about the ability of scientists and pharmaceutical companies that have developed effective vaccines to respond to the new variant while shoppers take stock of developments. 
""Consumers are going to wait and see in terms of what happens ... but are going to move on with their lives into this holiday season,"" Clark said. 
Clark's comments came amid a backdrop of recent supply chain disruptions the Biden administration has linked to the spread of another coronavirus variant, Delta. 
The United States and other countries are now imposing travel restrictions after the emerging Omicron variant, first detected in South Africa, began spreading to other parts of the world. In the Netherlands, Dutch health authorities said 13 cases were found among passengers on two flights that landed in Amsterdam on Friday after departing South Africa.
Britain, Denmark and Australia have also found cases in recent days. While there are not documented cases yet in the United States, health experts said the variant could already be present.
Clark said consumers for now are forging ahead with reconnecting after prolonged periods of government-mandated lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions. 
""People want to have a very thoughtful holiday season and want to prepare themselves to go back out into the world, if you will. And that’s what we’re seeing in their spending,"" Clark said.
Separately, he said the pandemic had induced people to reconsider how they structure their lives and work, contributing to hiring challenges.
""People are looking at their lives so differently through the course of the pandemic,"" Clark said. ""People have evaluated what kind of jobs do they want to have, do they want to be in the food service business, do they want to be in retail, do they want to be in fulfillment, do both people in the family want to work? What’s the life structure and setup?""
While Amazon has successfully hired people during the current labor shortage, ""it is a challenge,"" he said. 

Inflation, meanwhile, is not currently dragging down consumer spending, Clark said. Amazon had ""a record-breaking Black Friday,"" he said. 
Shoppers are spending on apparel and home decor, an indication they are planning to come back together, he said. Spending on electronics has dipped, he said, after people invested in home offices for remote work.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Disney has reclaimed its rightful place at the top of Thanksgiving box office charts. ""Encanto,"" the studio's new animated musical fable, collected $40 million since Wednesday, a robust tally at a time when family audiences haven't been eager to return to cinemas. 
It's become holiday tradition for Disney to release a family friendly movie around Turkey Day, and ""Encanto,"" an animated movie with critical acclaim, serves as a promising sign that parents are gaining confidence to bring their young kids back to the movies. The movie's five-day total is considerably short of the studio's recent Thanksgiving releases, such as ""Frozen II"" in 2019 ($123.7 million), ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" in 2018 ($84.6 million) and ""Coco"" in 2017 ($71 million). However, ""Encanto"" has landed the best opening weekend for an animated film during the pandemic. That's notable because movies geared toward family crowds have struggled to sell tickets and in a normal year, animation is regularly one of the highest-grossing (if not the highest-grossing) genre. 
Moviegoers also feasted on MGM's A-list crime drama ""House of Gucci,"" which brought in $14.2 million over the traditional weekend and $21.8 million in its first five days of release, proving there's still an audience for adult dramas, as long as Lady Gaga is featured in a starring role. 

Because of its $75 million production budget, ""House of Gucci"" will rely on substantial overseas ticket sales to turn a profit. Already, the R-rated drama has earned $12.8 million from 40 international countries, bringing its worldwide total to $34 million. Among foreign markets, ""House of Gucci"" had the biggest turnout in the United Kingdom and Ireland ($3.4 million), France ($1.9 million) and Mexico ($1 million). 
""Encanto"" was similarly pricey, costing the studio $120 million to make before accounting for marketing fees. Both ""Encanto"" and ""House of Gucci"" are playing exclusively in theaters, which should prove to be beneficial in the way of ticket sales. 
Also new to theaters this weekend is  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s ""Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City,"" a reboot of the long-running horror series, landed in fifth place. The R-rated thriller earned $8.8 million over the five-day holiday stretch, a result that fell short of expectations. It cost only $25 million to produce, so ""Raccoon City"" won't have as much of an uphill battle to get out of the red. "

The police said in a statement that people involved in the case acknowledged the group had operated gambling websites or telemarketing activities in other places. 
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that at a news conference on Sunday, Macau's judiciary police did not name the individuals but said they included a 47-year-old Macau businessman surnamed Chau.
It was not clear if this was Alvin Chau, who is chairman of Suncity Group Holdings Ltd. He is also the founder of a separate legal entity also called Suncity, the special administrative region's biggest ""junket operator"", which runs VIP gambling rooms across Asia.
Junket operators are go-betweens who bring high rollers to play at casinos, extending them credit and collecting on their debts. Macau itself is known as the Las Vegas of Asia and has grown rich from the gambling industry.
The Suncity junket operator could not be reached for comment. Representatives of the Hong Kong-listed Sun City Group Holdings could not be reached by phone and did not respond to email inquiries seeking comment on the company's or Chau's behalf.
A Macau judiciary police duty spokesperson did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. 
Authorities in the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou said on Friday that an investigation had found Alvin Chau formed a junket agent network in the mainland to help citizens engage in offshore and cross-border gambling activities.
The Macau government said on Saturday he was taken to the police station for questioning, based on earlier evidence and after it received a notification about the arrest warrant from the mainland authorities. 
GGRAsia, a news outlet on the Asia casino industry, quoted a Suncity spokesperson as saying by email early on Saturday: ""All businesses are normally operating in accordance with the law and under the supervision of the Macau Special Administrative Region Government."" 

Chau is also a controlling shareholder of Sun Entertainment Group Ltd., a film production and cremation services firm, which said in a Sunday exchange filing its board had noted news coverage about the investigations in Wenzhou and Macau. 
""The Board wishes to emphasis that the News Coverage is relating to the personal affairs of Mr. Chau. The Board is of the view that the Incident does not have any material impact on the financial position, business nor operation of the Group,"" the filing said.

1069,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2021 09:06AM ET</span>","It's raining dividends, hallelujah! Canadian banks set to post strong results","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's top six banks are expected to resume raising dividends and share buybacks after nearly a two-year hiatus and report strong quarterly earnings this week, which could boost the sector's appeal to yield-hungry investors even as stocks trade close to all-time highs.
The market will also be looking for clues on the banks' expected expense growth into next year as wage pressures intensify, and long-awaited improvements in net interest margins as interest rates rise. 
The ""big six"" Canadian banks - Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank), Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) - on average have a dividend yield of 3.3%, according to Reuters calculations.
That compares with the global sector median of 2.5%, according to Refinitiv data.
The dividend increases, which would be the first since the country's financial regulator imposed a moratorium in March 2020 that was lifted earlier this month, could range from 10% for Scotiabank at the lower end to 34% at National Bank, Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank Financial, wrote in a Nov. 22 note describing the coming hikes as a ""dividend growth tsunami.""
The banks are also expected to announce repurchases of about 2% of their outstanding shares on average.
""It's going to be a significant (dividend) increase, and will help them reduce excess capital on their balance sheets,"" said Steve Belisle, portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. ""That flows through to better ROE (return on equity).""
Even without the higher dividends or buybacks, Canadian bank shares have rallied to record highs, driven in part by better-than-expected earnings due to the release of reserves set aside to cover loan losses that haven't materialized.
LOAN GROWTH ACCELERATION
The Canadian banks will be reporting their fourth-quarter earnings, with Scotiabank kicking off the results on Tuesday. 
Analysts expect adjusted earnings for the top six lenders to jump about 37% from the year-earlier period, helped by a pick-up in business and credit card lending, strong mortgage growth and continued reserve releases.
An acceleration in loan growth is expected, as savings built up during the COVID-19 pandemic have lifted consumers' and businesses' purchasing power even at higher prices, with the broader economic recovery adding fuel to the fire, said Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at IG Wealth Management.
The one blot on the horizon may come in the form of non-interest expenses. They could be 1% higher than in the third quarter, with much of the anticipated rise driven by variable compensation, and up 4% in fiscal 2022 on rising labor costs and continued investments in technology, CIBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. 
Earnings from capital markets earnings could also decline, although higher-than-expected trading revenues could help offset lower investment banking fees, some analysts said.
Profits are expected to be 6.6% lower than in the third quarter, largely due to releases of reserves, which are difficult to estimate and have driven better-than-expected results in past periods, and could again lead to positive surprises, analysts said.
The banks' improving revenue growth, strong capital positions and expectations for returns on equity to remain in the mid-teens for longer than expected are positives, National Bank's Dechaine said.

Wealth and asset management units are also likely to have seen further growth, as consumers continued to deploy cash piles they've amassed during the pandemic, Petursson said.
""It's really hard to see where the warts would be on the banks' earnings,"" he added.

The government has been looking at the extent of the responsibility of platforms, such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), for defamatory material published on their sites and comes after the country's highest court ruled that publishers can be held liable for public comments on online forums.
The ruling caused some news companies like CNN to deny Australians access to their Facebook pages.
""The online world should not be a wild west where bots and bigots and trolls and others are anonymously going around and can harm people,"" Morrison said at a televised press briefing. 
""That is not what can happen in the real world, and there is no case for it to be able to be happening in the digital world.""
The new legislation will introduce a complaints mechanism, so that if somebody thinks they are being defamed, bullied or attacked on social media, they will be able to require the platform to take the material down.
If the content is not withdrawn, a court process could force a social media platform to provide details of the commenter. 

""Digital platforms - these online companies - must have proper processes to enable the takedown of this content,"" Morrison said.
""They have created the space and they need to make it safe, and if they won't, we will make them (through) laws such as this.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) has complained to the U.S. government that India's ""informal and formal"" promotion of domestic payments rival RuPay hurts the U.S. giant in a key market, memos seen by Reuters show.
In public Visa has downplayed concerns about the rise of RuPay, which has been supported by public lobbying from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that has included likening the use of local cards to national service.
But U.S. government memos show Visa raised concerns about a ""level playing field"" in India during an Aug. 9 meeting between U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai and company executives, including CEO Alfred Kelly. 
Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has raised similar concerns privately with the USTR. Reuters reported in 2018 that the company had lodged a protest https://reut.rs/3cQA2La with the USTR that Modi was using nationalism to promote the local network.
""Visa remains concerned about India's informal and formal policies that appear to favour the business of National Payments Corporation of India"" (NPCI), the non-profit that runs RuPay, ""over other domestic and foreign electronic payments companies,"" said a USTR memo prepared for Tai ahead of the meeting.
Visa, USTR, Modi's office and the NPCI did not respond to requests for comment.
Modi has promoted homegrown RuPay for years, posing a challenge to Visa and Mastercard in the fast-growing payments market. RuPay accounted for 63% of India's 952 million debit and credit cards as of November 2020, according to the most recent regulatory data on the company, up from just 15% in 2017.
Publicly, Kelly said in May that for years there was ""a lot of concern"" that the likes of RuPay could be ""potentially problematic"" for Visa, but he stressed that his company remained India's market leader. 
""That's going to be something we're going to continually deal with and have dealt with for years. So there's nothing new there,"" he told an industry event.
'NOT SO SUBTLE PRESSURE'
Modi, in a 2018 speech, portrayed the use of RuPay as patriotic, saying that since ""everyone cannot go to the border to protect the country, we can use RuPay card to serve the nation.""
When Visa raised its concerns during the USTR gathering on Aug. 9, it cited the Indian leader's ""speech where he basically called on India to use RuPay as a show of service to the country,"" according to an email U.S. officials exchanged on the meeting's readout.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last year that ""RuPay is the only card"" banks should promote. The government has also promoted a RuPay-based card for public transportation payments.
While RuPay dominates the number of cards in India, most transactions still go through Visa and Mastercard as most RuPay cards were simply issued by banks under Modi's financial inclusion programme, industry sources say.
Visa told the U.S. government it was concerned India's ""push to use transit cards linked to RuPay"" and ""the not so subtle pressure on banks to issue"" RuPay cards, the USTR email showed. 

Mastercard and Visa count India as a key growth market, but have been jolted by a 2018 central bank directive for them to store payments data ""only in India"" for ""unfettered supervisory access"".
Mastercard faces an indefinite ban on issuing new cards in India after the central bank said it was not complying with the 2018 rules. A USTR official privately called the Mastercard ban ""draconian"", Reuters reported in September.

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2021 03:17PM ET</span>","U.S. Black Friday shoppers tapered online splurge, as some returned to stores","By Arriana McLymore and Richa Naidu
RALEIGH, North Carolina (Reuters) - U.S. shoppers spent slightly less online during Black Friday this year, with many venturing back to physical stores despite coronavirus fears, tight supplies, and retailers' efforts to encourage earlier holiday purchases. 
For the first time ever, spending online during Black Friday - traditionally one of the biggest shopping days of the year - fell, reversing the growth of recent years, according to data from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics, a wing of Adobe's business that specializes in data insights and tracks transactions at 80 of the top 100 U.S. retailers.
Retailers lured shoppers to make holiday purchases online as early as September this year, because the supply-chain logjam has prevented them from quickly replenishing year-end merchandise. Shoppers' total outlay online during Black Friday was roughly $8.9 billion, less than the $9 billion in 2020, Adobe said. Spending online during Thanksgiving Day was flat at $5.1 billion, Adobe said.
Many retailers closed physical stores on Thanksgiving this year, as they did in 2020, amid a labor shortage and the coronavirus pandemic. Stores reopened the day after Thanksgiving, and shopper visits increased by 47.5% compared to 2020, but fell by 28.3% when compared to 2019, the last pre-pandemic year, according to data from Sensormatic Solutions. 
Supply-chain challenges and shipping delays may have prompted shoppers to visit stores in order to increase the chances of securing gifts in time for Christmas. More are making purchases online that they can pick up in-store, which keeps shipping costs down. 
Macy’s, Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), for example, gave shoppers the flexibility to shop online, in stores or through hybrid methods, walked away as winners on Black Friday, said Louis Navellier, chairman of investor Navellier & Associates. 

Of those purchasing online, slightly more used their smartphones. Canadian e-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) said the number of shoppers on its platform who used smartphones to make purchases increased this year to 72% from 67% last year. 
Retailers' moves to encourage buying holiday gifts earlier could also lessen the importance of Cyber Monday, the first Monday after Thanksgiving.

But this notion was destroyed faster than yesterday's pecan pie, when I glanced at the market futures. Today saw more than a 2% decline for the S&P 500 (SPY) and a more than 3% pullback for the Russell 2000 in a half days’ worth of trading. So today's abbreviated commentary will focus on this drop. And then, we will address the elephant in the room - is it the culmination of the market's rough patch which we discussed last week, or the start of another leg lower? Read on below to find out more….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary published November 26, 2021 from the POWR Stocks Under $10 newsletter).
In last week’s commentary, we discussed that the S&P 500’s 1% gain was masking weakness under the surface as the Russell 2000 was down by 2%. And, these trends got only more extreme as the S&P 500 is down by 2.4%, while the Russell 2000 is down by 5% since last Thursday.
Of course, the bulk of the selling took place today in an abbreviated trading session. The biggest reason was reports of another coronavirus variant, B1.1.529, that is spreading rapidly in South Africa at much faster rates than previous variants. Some cases have been identified in Europe and parts of Asia, and there are doubts about the vaccine’s efficacy against it.

The financing proposal will include a mix of new equity, convertible notes and debt, the group said in a statement, adding that it intends to launch an $800 million equity rights offering to shareholders, upon confirmation of the plan.
""While our process is not yet over, we have reached a critical milestone in the path to a stronger financial future,"" said Roberto Alvo, chief executive of the largest airline in Latin America. 
Recently, LATAM said it received several offers to fund the exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, each of which are worth more than $5 billion. The group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York in May 2020 as world travel came to a halt amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Upon emerging from Chapter 11, LATAM expects to have total debt of about $7.26 billion and liquidity of about $2.67 billion, the company said in the statement. 

The Santiago-based company reported losses of some $692 million in the third quarter, as the indebted company was still battling challenges from the pandemic.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's Snam has agreed to buy a stake in pipelines carrying Algerian gas into Italy in a move that could pave the way for hydrogen imports from Africa into Europe.
Europe's biggest gas infrastructure group said on Saturday it would pay energy company Eni 385 million euros ($436 million) for a 49.9% stake in the pipelines to jointly control the assets with its fellow Italian company.
Snam, which makes most of its money from managing Italy's natural gas transport grid, has pledged to spend more on new, clean business lines such as green hydrogen. 
Like other European gas grid operators, it is upgrading its national network to be hydrogen ready.
""In the future, North Africa could also become a hub for producing solar energy and green hydrogen,"" Snam CEO Marco Alvera said in a joint statement with Eni.
Snam, which runs most of Italy's gas storage facilities, also owns 20% of the TAP pipeline that carries Azeri gas into Italy. 
The deal reflects the accelerating pace of planning taking place in the global oil and gas industry, keen to adapt as governments and activists ramp up the pressure to slash greenhouse gases.
Eni is working on spinning off a series of oil and gas operations into new joint ventures to help reduce debt and fund its shift to low-carbon energy.
""This transaction allows us to free up new resources to be used on our energy transition path,"" Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said.
Eni, one of the biggest foreign oil and gas producers in Africa, has a series of strategic agreements with Algerian state-owned energy group Sonatrach.
Italy imports more than 90% of its overall gas needs and Algerian gas currently accounts for around 30% of flows.
The pipeline companies involved in the deal posted net income of around 90 million euros in 2020.

Snam was advised by UniCredit, while Eni was advised by Rothschild.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) said on Friday it expects more data on a worrying new coronavirus variant detected in South Africa within two weeks to help determine whether its vaccine produced with partner  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) would have to be reworked.
Pfizer and BioNTech said that if necessary they expect to be able to ship a new vaccine tailored to the emerging variant in approximately 100 days.
""We understand the concern of experts and have immediately initiated investigations on variant B.1.1.529,"" BioNTech said in a statement when asked to comment.
""We expect more data from the laboratory tests in two weeks at the latest. These data will provide more information about whether B.1.1.529 could be an escape variant that may require an adjustment of our vaccine if the variant spreads globally,"" it added. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc said in a statement it is working to advance a booster candidate tailored to the new variant and has also been testing a higher dose of its existing booster and to study other booster candidates designed to protect against multiple variants. 
""A booster dose of an authorized vaccine represents the only currently available strategy for boosting waning immunity,"" Moderna said in the statement. 
Escape variants are those that elude the targeted immune response brought about by vaccination. Pfizer and BioNTech would be able to redesign their shot within six weeks and ship initial batches within 100 days, BioNTech added.
BioNTech ADRs gained 14.2% to close at $348 on Friday and Pfizer shares rose 6.1% to end at $54. Moderna gained 20.6% to close at $329.63.
Global authorities reacted with alarm on Friday to the new variant, with the EU and Britain among those tightening border controls as scientists sought to find out if the mutation was vaccine-resistant. 
Pfizer and BioNTech have already created versions of their established mRNA-based vaccine - based on the original virus found in the Chinese city of Wuhan - to target the so-called Alpha and Delta variants, with clinical trials ongoing.
Those efforts are not meant to yield commercial products; the exercise is carried out to establish a routine with regulators that will help speed up any future vaccine relaunch. 

Analysts at Evercore ISI said data from Qatar on another recent variant showed a high level of initial efficacy by current vaccines that faded significantly four months after dosing. 
Johnson and Johnson said it is also closely monitoring emerging strains of COVID-19 and is testing the effectiveness of its shot against the new variant.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Macau said police were questioning Alvin Chau on Saturday, after a Chinese city issued an arrest warrant for the junket mogul, accusing him of operating gambling activities in mainland China.
The Macau government said in a statement that Chau, founder of the special administrative region's biggest junket operator Suncity, was taken to the police station in the morning, based on earlier evidence and after it received a notification about the arrest warrant from the mainland authorities. 
Suncity operates VIP gambling rooms across Asia. Junket operators are go-betweens who bring high rollers to play at casinos, extending them credit and collecting on their debts.
Casino gambling is illegal in China outside Macau, the world's largest gambling hub.
Authorities in the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou said on Friday their investigation had found Chau formed a junket agent network in the mainland to help citizens engage in offshore and cross-border gambling activities. 
Chau also set up an asset management company in the mainland to help gamblers to make cross-border fund transfers, the Wenzhou City Public Security Bureau in the coastal city in Zhejiang province said on its Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account.
Chau and Suncity could not be reached by phone for comment, and did not immediately respond to email inquiries.
GGRAsia, a news outlet on the Asia casino industry, quoted a Suncity spokesperson as saying by email early on Saturday that ""all businesses are normally operating in accordance with the law and under the supervision of the Macau Special Administrative Region Government."" 
Suncity's publicly listed entity in Hong Kong, Suncity Group Holdings Ltd, does not include its junket operations.
The Wenzhou authority said that as of July 2020, the ""crime syndicate"" led by Chau had 199 shareholder-level agents, more than 12,000 gambling agents and over 80,000 punter members.
""The amount of money involved was exceptionally large, seriously damaging our country's social management order,"" the security bureau said. ""The security authorities urges (Chau) to surrender himself as soon as possible, in order to get a lenient treatment.""
Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, told Reuters, ""Chau's arrest warrant is no doubt sending shockwaves through organised crime in Hong Kong and Macau, but also Cambodia, Laos and the Philippines.
Douglas said Suncity has been linked to major drug traffickers and money laundering for many years.

Chau has grown Suncity from operating a high-roller table in  Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF)'s casino in 2007 to a sprawling conglomerate with thousands of employees and businesses ranging from property to autos.
In 2019, Suncity was singled out https://www.reuters.com/article/china-casinos-idINL4N24A13F by state-backed Chinese media which attacked online gambling for causing what it described as great harm to China's social economic order. Suncity said it did not operate any online gaming at the time.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Bargain hunters ventured out in chilly weather to buy Christmas gifts on Black Friday only to discover that many U.S. retailers offered smaller price markdowns this year amid tight supplies.
COVID fears and fewer ""doorbuster"" sales thinned crowds the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, which kicks off the year-end holiday shopping season.
On the same day, the World Health Organization named the newly identified omicron variant of the coronavirus as a ""variant of concern,"" triggering worldwide alarm and a selloff in the U.S. stock market.
Stores on Black Friday had the lowest level of clearance goods for sale in five years or more, Cowen analysts said in a note. Many shoppers chose to pick up merchandise curbside rather than venturing inside stores.
Black Friday retail sales are up 29.8% versus 2020 through 3 p.m. ET, according to Mastercard (NYSE:MA) SpendingPulse.
Consumers spent $6.6 billion up until 9 p.m. ET on Friday, according to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Digital Economy Index, which expected total spending of between $8.8 billion and $9.2 billion for the day. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) stood to outperform other retailers in part because of their buy-online-pick-up-at-store services, Cowen said. Target added more than 18,000 ""drive-up"" parking spaces, more than doubling spots versus last year. The company said its most popular Black Friday deals included $219.99 for a KitchenAid professional stand mixer that regularly sells for $429.99, and savings of up to $60 on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watches and AirPods.
Several retailers - including Walmart, Target and Best Buy - are expected to post lower fourth-quarter profit margins because of tight inventory and higher costs for raw materials, freight and labor. ""Even though the holiday season should be okay from a sales standpoint -- because retailers are discounting less -- the margins won't necessarily be higher because of inflation,"" said  Forrester Research  (NASDAQ:FORR) analyst Sucharita Kodali.
U.S. consumers are entering the holiday season flush with cash thanks to a still-hefty pile of savings from multiple rounds of government pandemic relief and double-digit wage increases as businesses compete for workers. Yet retailers had lured shoppers to make holiday purchases as early as September this year, because the supply chain logjam https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/containergeddon-supply-crisis-drives-walmart-rivals-hire-their-own-ships-2021-10-07 has prevented them from quickly replenishing year-end merchandise. 
A Deloitte survey showed people had spent 80%-85% of their holiday gift budgets even before Black Friday. For November and December, online sales are estimated to hit a record $207 billion, up 10% from last year, according to Adobe Digital Economy Index. The National Retail Federation has forecast combined brick-and-mortar and online holiday sales to reach between $843.4 billion and $859 billion, 8.5% to 10.5% higher than last year. 

Elver Gomez, a 21-year-old student in Chicago, said he didn't find the Apple and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) laptops he wanted while shopping at a Best Buy store Friday morning. ""It seems like this year it's either out of stock"" or for sale at what he said was ""not that great of a price."" Best Buy added a message to its website warning of ""limited qualities"" and ""no rainchecks."" 
Electronics - in short supply due to a global chip shortage - had the highest out-of-stock levels, followed by personal care, and home and garden, according to Adobe. Through most of November, out-of-stocks were up 261% versus 2019.

MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) lost its fourth chief executive in six years on Friday after Luigi Gubitosi threw in the towel, following a clash with top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), a week after a $12 billion takeover proposal by U.S. fund KKR.
The former phone monopolist said in a statement the head of TIM Brazil, Pietro Labriola, had been named general manager so as to ensure the group continued to operate smoothly, confirming what sources had told Reuters earlier on Friday.
Chairman Salvatore Rossi, a former central bank official, took on Gubitosi's remaining powers, including the oversight of TIM's assets which matter for Italy's national security. 
The CEO had offered to relinquish its responsibilities on Thursday, saying in a letter he did not want to stand in the way of the board giving prompt consideration to KKR's approach.
TIM said it had set up a special committee headed by Rossi to study the offer with the help of advisers it was preparing to appoint.
TIM's nominations committee will work with headhunters Spencer Stuart to ensure a stable leadership for the group over the medium term, taking into account the evolution of TIM's structure and assets, it said.
Sources had said the board would also discuss the threat to earnings from a soccer rights deal that has failed to help revenue and has contributed to two profit warnings.
TIM's disappointing results have strengthened Vivendi's hand in pushing out Gubitosi who had been brought in by rival TIM investor Elliott in 2018.
Gubitosi remained on as a director, preventing Labriola from joining the board and being named as CEO on Friday, a role which sources said he may take on at a later stage. 
STALLING
Gubitosi, in his letter to the board, criticised directors for stalling on KKR's offer to please some shareholders.
The statement TIM issued at the end of a six-hour board meeting made no mention of granting KKR access to TIM's data for due diligence.
Gubitosi had rejected speculation that he was close to KKR, which he first brought on board last year, striking a 1.8 billion euro deal that handed the fund a 37.5% stake in TIM's so-called last-mile network reaching into people's homes.
TIM's board first examined on Sunday KKR's non-binding proposal to take it private in a 33 billion euro deal including debt.
The offer followed a downgrade of TIM's debt that pushed it further into junk territory a week ago, which two sources said had hastened KKR's decision because TIM was at risk of breaching bank covenants.
Auditors have raised fresh concerns over the 1 billion euro deal Gubitosi struck with DAZN to stream Italy's top-flight soccer matches, another two sources close to the matter told Reuters.
One of the sources said a further downgrade to TIM's financial outlook cannot be ruled out, in what would be a fresh blow to holders of its debt, already equal to around four times TIM's core profit.
STRATEGIC ASSET
The face-off between Gubitosi and Vivendi is the latest boardroom crisis at TIM, which has had three CEOs since 2015, when the French media group began building its 24% stake.
The takeover offer for the whole of TIM comes as Italy prepares to spend 6.7 billion euros of European Union recovery fund to speed up ultra-fast broadband rollout across the nation.
TIM's fixed network, which the government is keen to see upgraded to fibre, is Italy's main telecoms infrastructure and Rome has said its response to KKR will hinge on plans for the network.

Rome has special powers to block moves on strategic companies such as TIM but the executive of Prime Minister Mario Draghi has hailed KKR's interest as good news for Italy.
Sources have said KKR, which consulted the government before tabling its offer, plans to carve out the network and give state investor CDP - currently TIM's second-biggest shareholder - a leading role in overseeing it. ($1 = 0.8874 euros)

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone government bond yields dropped sharply across the board on Friday as investors reacted to a newly identified coronavirus variant spreading in South Africa by piling into safe haven assets.
The variant was considered by scientists to be the most significant yet found, Britain said on Friday, adding that authorities needed to ascertain whether or not it rendered vaccines ineffective.
""It's a classical risk-off move into safe havens such as government bonds, with equities and other risky assets under pressure,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) rates strategist Rainer Guntermann. 
""It is still early days, but going into year-end, investors may prefer to keep a bit more in safe havens and we also have to assess how it feeds into central bank risk assessments even if this variant turns out not to be of huge concern,"" he said. 
""It's a reminder that the pandemic could pop up again at virtually any time."" 
Safe havens, such as government bonds, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and gold were in demand, while Asian and European equity markets recorded losses. 
Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the bloc, was down 9 bps at -0.33% at 1530 GMT. Other highly rated euro zone government bond yields were lower by around 8 bps. 
Italy's 10-year government bond yield dipped below the 1% mark and was at 0.97%, down 9 bps on the day. 
U.S. Treasury yields slipped around 7-10 bps across the curve. 
Meanwhile, rate-hike expectations in the single currency bloc fell, with money-market investors pricing in a roughly 50% chance of a 10 basis point rate hike from the European Central Bank in December 2022, having fully priced in such a move earlier this week. 
ECB policymakers Ignazio Visco and Luis de Guindos said on Friday the euro zone economy was still rebounding but the pandemic was once again a source of worry.

The central bank is still on course to end its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme in March, ECB vice-president de Guindos said.
ECB President Christine Lagarde was quoted as saying to a German daily that the central bank expected inflation to fall from January.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Shares tumbled on Wall Street on Friday as they reopened after Thanksgiving, while European stocks saw their biggest sell-off in 17 months and oil prices plunged by $10 per barrel as fears over a new coronavirus variant sent investors scurrying to safe-haven assets.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday designated a new COVID-19 variant detected in South Africa with a large number of mutations as being ""of concern,"" the fifth variant to be given the designation.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.53% at 34,899.34 in its largest percentage drop in more than a year. The S&P 500 lost 2.27%, its worst one-day drop since Feb. 25, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.23%, the biggest one-day route in two months.
U.S. markets closed early on Friday after being shut all day on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
The benchmark STOXX 600 index ended 3.7% lower on the day, leaving it down 4.5% for the week. The volatility gauge for the main stock market hit its highest in nearly 10 months.
Companies that had benefited from an easing of COVID-related restrictions this year, including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), plane engine maker Rolls Royce (LON:RR), easyJet (LON:EZJ), United Airlines and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp all fell.
Retailers dropped as Black Friday, the start of the holiday shopping season, kicked off as the new variant fuelled concerns about low store traffic and inventory issues.
In Europe, the travel and leisure index plummeted 8.8% in its worst day since the COVID-19 shock sell-off in March 2020.
""Bottom line is this is showing that COVID is still the investor narrative, a lot of today’s movement is driven by the South African variant,"" said Greg Bassuk, chief executive officer of AXS Investments in Port Chester, New York. 
""We have been talking about four or five factors that have been driving the last couple of months' activity – inflation fears, some economic data, Fed policy – but what we have seen over the last year is that big developments with respect to COVID really have ended up eclipsing some of those other factors by a substantial degree and that is what is driving today’s market activity.""
Little is known of the variant detected in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong, but scientists said it has an unusual combination of mutations and may be able to evade immune responses or make the virus more transmissible. 
Britain said the new variant was the most significant variant to date and was one of several countries to impose travel restrictions on southern Africa.
The European Commission also said it wanted to consider suspending travel from countries where the new variant has been identified, though the WHO cautioned against hastily imposing such restrictions.
Global shares fell 1.81%, their biggest down day in more than a year. France's CAC 40 shed 4.8%. The UK's FTSE 100 dropped 3.6%, while Germany's DAX fell 4.2% and Spain's IBEX lost 5.0%.
Malaysian rubber glove maker Supermax, which soared 1500% during the first wave of the pandemic, leapt 15%. 
MSCI's index of Asian shares outside Japan dropped 2.44%, its sharpest fall since late July. 
In commodities, oil prices plunged. Gold prices reversed earlier gains seen amid the move away from riskier assets.
U.S. crude was last down 12%, at $69.02 per barrel by 1:21 p.m. EST (1812 GMT). Brent crude dropped 10.5% to $73.59.
Spot gold prices were down 0.09%.
As investors dashed for safe-haven assets, the Japanese yen strengthened 1.87% versus the greenback, while sterling was last trading at $1.3331, up 0.08% on the day. 
The dollar index fell 0.757%, with the euro up 1% to $1.1318.
U.S. Treasury debt yields posted their sharpest drop since the pandemic began. Treasuries benchmark 10-year notes last rose to yield 1.4867%. The 2-year note last rose to yield 0.4941%, from 0.644%. [US/]
""A flight to safety is underway with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield down,"" said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. ""The proximate cause of the sell-off is yesterday’s announcement of a new COVID-19 variant in South Africa, which investors fear could weigh on economic growth.""

The market swings come against a backdrop of already growing concern about COVID-19 outbreaks driving restrictions on movement and activity in Europe and beyond.
Markets had previously been upbeat about the strength of economic recovery, despite growing inflation fears.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 suffering their biggest one-day percentage drops in months, and pandemic-hit sectors that had gained from a reopening falling sharply after a new coronavirus mutation was found.
Authorities worldwide reacted with alarm on Friday to the coronavirus variant found in South Africa, with the European Union and Britain among those tightening border controls as researchers sought to establish if it was vaccine-resistant.
Cruise operators Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp,  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) each plunged more than 10%, while shares in United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) also tumbled. The NYSE Arca Airline index fell 6.45% in its biggest one-day percentage decline since September 2020. 
Retailers dropped 2.04% as Black Friday kicked off the holiday shopping season with worries that the new variant would depress store traffic and curb supply.
Selling was broad, with big declines of more than 1% in all 11 major S&P sectors except healthcare, which fell just 0.45% thanks to COVID-19 vaccine makers  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) rising 6.11% to close at a record high of $54, and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc jumping 20.57%.
""It is déjà vu all over again for like the eighth time,"" said Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at Global Investments in Atlanta. 
""What we understand about this variant could accelerate over the weekend, if there is more concerning news than good news, a lot of people don't want to be holding risk assets on Monday morning, or are afraid of what that could look like Monday morning.""
Despite the sell-off, market participants noted the drop was likely exaggerated by the thin volume during the shortened post-Thanksgiving holiday session.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 905.04 points, or 2.53%, to 34,899.34; the S&P 500 lost 106.84 points, or 2.27%, to 4,594.62; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 353.57 points, or 2.23%, to 15,491.66.
The domestically focused Russell 2000 small-cap index fell 3.67%. Both the S&P 500 and small cap Russell index posted their biggest one-day percentage drops since Feb. 25. 
The S&P 500 banks index dropped 3.87% as investors dialed back expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes. Energy, this year's best performing sector, dropped 4% on the day, its biggest decline in more than eight months, as crude prices plunged $10 a barrel.
Elevated U.S. inflation, coupled with strong economic data and the renomination of Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair by U.S. President Joe Biden, had fueled expectations the central bank might hike interest rates sooner than expected.
The CBOE volatility index, popularly known as Wall Street's fear gauge, hit its highest level since early March. 
Stocks such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), known as ""stay-at-home"" names, all scored solid advances.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 5.84-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.96-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and 23 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 18 new highs and 334 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines said on Friday they do not plan any changes to their South Africa-U.S. routes after the White House said it plans to impose new travel curbs on southern Africa starting Monday amid concerns about a new COVID-19 variant.
Delta and United are the only U.S. passenger carriers that have direct flights to southern Africa.
Delta currently operates service between Johannesburg and Atlanta three times weekly and the U.S. airline said ""there are no planned adjustments to service at this time.""
The White House said it plans to bar entry to most non-U.S. citizens who have been in South Africa and seven other African countries within the last 14 days.
Airlines for America, a trade group representing major U.S. passenger and cargo carriers, said Friday it remains ""in communication with the U.S. government as specifics remain unknown at this time and there are many unanswered questions. Amid this rapidly evolving situation, it is critical that U.S. government decisions regarding international travel restrictions and requirements be rooted in science.""

1089,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 07:37PM ET</span>",South Africa says travel bans over new variant unjustified,"By Alexander Winning and Tim Cocks
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -South Africa said on Friday that imposing restrictions on travellers from the country because of a newly identified COVID-19 variant was unjustified, after a British ban on flights from southern African countries that others have followed.
Health Minister Joe Phaahla told a media briefing that South Africa was acting with transparency and travel bans were against the norms and standards of the World Health Organization (WHO), which held an emergency meeting over the variant named omicron. 
Scientists have so far only detected the variant in relatively small numbers, mainly in South Africa but also in Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel. But they are concerned by its high number of mutations which raised concerns that it could be more vaccine-resistant and transmissible.
The WHO designated omicron as ""of concern,"" its most serious level, following a meeting of its technical advisory group.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke on Friday afternoon and discussed ways to reopen international travel, a Downing Street spokesperson said.
""Our immediate concern is the damage that this decision will cause to both the tourism industries and businesses of both countries,"" South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor said in a statement.
Ramaphosa will convene an advisory council on Sunday to consider evidence on the variant.
The rand currency slumped as much as 2% against the dollar, and South African hospitality stocks plummeted as investors were unnerved.
Britain said the variant was the most significant found yet and banned flights from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia. European Union states also agreed to suspend travel to southern Africa, the presidency of the EU said.
However, Salim Abdool Karim, one of South Africa's top epidemiologists, said a global response was important, noting the delta variant spread to 53 countries within three weeks of being identified.
""So it doesn't really help to close borders... We've got to find solutions to this variant together. And part of that is not to overreact,"" he told Reuters in an interview, characterising the British travel ban as a ""panic reaction"" that was understandable.
VACCINE FOCUS
Scientists expressed frustration at the travel bans, saying the focus should be on getting more people vaccinated in places that have struggled to access sufficient shots. It could take weeks for scientists to fully understand the impact of the variant's mutations.
""This virus can evolve in the absence of adequate levels of vaccination. It's upsetting that it takes this to happen to get the point across,"" Richard Lessells, a South Africa-based infectious disease expert, told Reuters.
In South Africa about 35% of adults are fully vaccinated, higher than in most other African nations, but half the government's year-end target. While the continent struggled initially to obtain sufficient doses, some countries including South Africa now have too much stock, with vaccine hesitancy and apathy slowing the inoculation campaign.

South Africa has been the country worst affected in Africa in terms of total reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, with nearly 3 million infections and more than 89,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. It had been experiencing a lull after a severe third wave of infections, until last week when new infections started to pick up.
On Thursday, it reported 2,465 new cases, almost double the previous day's number. On Friday, there was a more modest rise in daily infections to 2,828 new cases.

However, the meeting he was referring to was later postponed after the new variant led to travel restrictions that would have prevented many participants from reaching Geneva.
""The news about this new variant should make clearer than ever why this pandemic will not end until we have global vaccinations,"" Biden said in a statement.

""This news today reiterates the importance of moving on this (waiving intellectual property protections) quickly.""
The Biden administration faces fresh criticism over a failure to get vaccines to poorer countries while supplying free booster shots to Americans, after the new variant named Omicron was identified.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - COVID-19 has resurfaced as a worry for investors and a potential driver of big market moves after a new variant triggered alarm, long after the threat had receded in Wall Street's eyes. 
Worries about a new strain of the virus, named Omicron and classified by the World Health Organisation as a variant of concern, slammed markets worldwide and dealt the S&P 500 index its biggest one-day percentage loss in nine months. The moves came a day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday when thin volume likely exacerbated the moves.
With little known about the new variant, longer term implications for U.S. assets were unclear. At least, investors said signs that the new strain is spreading and questions over its resistance to vaccines could weigh on the so-called reopening trade that has lifted markets at various times this year.
The new strain may also complicate the outlook for how aggressively the Federal Reserve normalizes monetary policy to fight inflation.
""Markets were celebrating the end of the pandemic. Slam. It isn't over,"" said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. ""All policy issues, meaning monetary policy, business trajectories, GDP growth estimates, leisure and hospitality recovery, the list goes on, are on hold.""
The S&P 500 fell by a third as pandemic fears mushroomed in early 2020, but has more than doubled in value since then, though the pandemic's ebb and flow has driven sometimes-violent rotations in the types of stocks investors favor. The index is up more than 22% this year.
Before Friday, broader vaccine availability and advances in treatments made markets potentially less sensitive to COVID-19. The virus had dropped to a distant fifth in a list of so-called ""tail risks"" to the market in a recent survey of fund managers by BofA Global Research, with inflation and central bank hikes taking the top spots.
On Friday, however, technology and growth stocks that had prospered during last year's so-called stay-at-home trade soared, including Zoom Communications, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON). 
At the same time, stocks that had rallied this year on bets of economic reopening may suffer if virus fears grow. Energy, financials and other economically sensitive stocks tumbled on Friday, as did those of many travel-related companies such as airlines and hotels.
U.S. officials said Friday they would impose travel restrictions on eight southern African countries in response to the new variant found in South Africa. It has also been reported in Israel and Belgium.
Friday's swings also sent the Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, soaring and options investors scrambling to hedge their portfolios against further market swings. 
Graphic: Fear gauge - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/znpnekwnmvl/chart.png 
Andrew Thrasher, portfolio manager for The Financial Enhancement Group, had been concerned that recent gains in a handful of technology stocks with large weightings in the S&P 500, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), were masking weakness in the broader market.
""This set the kindling for sellers to push markets lower and the latest COVID news appears to have stoked that bearish flame,"" he said.
Some investors said the latest COVID-19 related weakness could be a chance to buy stocks at comparatively lower levels, expecting the market to continue rapidly recovering from dips, a pattern that has marked its march to record highs this year. 
""We've had numerous days when economic optimism collapses. Each of these optimism collapses were a good buying opportunity,"" wrote Bill Smead, founder of Smead Capital Management, in a note to investors. Among the stocks he recommended were Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and  Macerich Co  (NYSE:MAC), down 7.2% and 5.2% respectively on Friday.
One of several wild cards is whether virus-driven economic uncertainty will slow the Federal Reserve's plans to normalize monetary policy, just as it has started unwinding its $120 billion a month bond buying program.
Futures on the U.S. federal funds rate, which track short-term interest rate expectations, on Friday showed investors rolling back their view of a sooner-than-expected rate increase.
Investors will be watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's appearance before Congress to discuss the government's COVID response on Nov. 30 as well as U.S. employment numbers, due out next Friday.
Investors held out hope that markets could stabilize. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management, said moves may have been exaggerated by lack of liquidity on Friday, with many participants out for the Thanksgiving holiday. 

""My first reaction is anything we are going to see today is overdone,"" Ablin said.

(Reuters) -Novavax Inc said on Friday it had started working on a version of its COVID-19 vaccine to target the variant detected in South Africa and would have the shot ready for testing and manufacturing in the next few weeks.
The company's COVID-19 shot contains an actual version of the virus' spike protein that cannot cause disease but can trigger the immune system. The vaccine developer said it had started developing a spike protein specifically based on the known genetic sequence of the variant, B.1.1.529.
""The initial work will take a few weeks,"" a company spokesperson said. Shares of the company closed up nearly 9% on Friday. 
 Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX)'s vaccine received its first emergency use approval earlier this month in Indonesia followed by the Philippines. 
The company has said it is on track to file for U.S. approval by the end of the year. It has also filed for approvals with the European Medicines Agency as well as in Canada.
Other vaccine developers, including Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), have said they are testing the effectiveness of their shots against the new variant, which is named Omicron by the World Health Organisation.
Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:INO) Inc said it had begun testing its vaccine candidate, INO-4800, to evaluate its effectiveness against the new variant. The company expects the testing to take about two weeks. 
Inovio also said it was simultaneously designing a new vaccine candidate that specifically targeted Omicron.

""Best case scenario, INO-4800 ... will be completely resilient against omicron, but if that's not the case then we will have a newly designed vaccine ready to go if need be,"" said Kate Broderick, senior vice president of Inovio's R&D division. 
Earlier this month, Inovio resumed a late-stage trial of its vaccine in the United States after 14 months on clinical hold.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain looks to be on track for record sales over the Black Friday discount weekend despite supply chain disruption, with data indicating nearly one quarter more shopper transactions so far compared with last year.
Barclaycard, which processes nearly 1 pound ($1.33) in every 3 pounds spent on credit and debit cards in the United Kingdom, said the volume of payment transactions as of 1700 GMT was up 2.4% versus the same period in 2019 and up 23% on 2020, when non-essential stores were closed due to a COVID-19 lockdown.
""Consumers have retained their love for grabbing a Black Friday bargain, proving this event remains a firm fixture in the annual shopping calendar,"" said Rob Cameron, CEO of Barclaycard Payments.
Analysts at GlobalData for the VoucherCodes Shopping for Christmas report forecast total sales of 9.15 billion pounds over the four day Black Friday to Cyber Monday period - up 15.1% on the 7.95 billion pounds taken in 2020 and up 6.8% on the 8.57 billion pounds taken in 2019.
Black Friday, taking place against a backdrop of shortages of both products and drivers to deliver them, is particularly important for department store group John Lewis, consumer electricals retailers Currys and AO World and general merchandise retailer Argos, which is part of supermarket group Sainsbury's. 
While Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Britain's biggest retailer, and Asda are also participating, some major retailers, including Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) and Next, shun the event. 
On Thursday, UK retailers reported the strongest pre-Christmas demand since 2015 but also the biggest price rises since 1990, as fears of shortages led shoppers to buy gifts early, figures from the Confederation of British Industry showed.
On Tuesday, AO warned of limited supplies of games consoles, including  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s PlayStation and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xbox, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iphones, blaming the global shortage of semiconductor chips. 
Earlier this month, Sainsbury's similarly warned shoppers to expect a shortage of electronics products.
Currys, however, has said it is well stocked.
Delays in international supply chains are being compounded by labour shortages in domestic transport and warehousing networks, with a shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers particularly acute.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Black Friday was disrupted by climate targeting 15 depots across Europe and it also faced protests by workers and delivery drivers in Germany, France and Italy.
In the U.S. stores were less crowded than in years past as major retailers opened their doors early.

CALAIS, France (Reuters) -French fishermen temporarily blockaded the port of Calais and Channel Tunnel rail link in an effort to disrupt trade between Britain and the continent on Friday, escalating a row over licences to fish in British waters.
Fishing rights plagued Brexit talks for years, not because of their economic importance but because of their political significance for both President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Britain and the EU agreed to set up a licensing system to grant fishing vessels access to each other's waters but France says it has not been given the full number it is due, while Britain says only those lacking the correct documentation have not been granted.
Several trawlers manoeuvred inside the port to hold up the passage of two ferries operated by DFDS and P&O as they approached Calais earlier on Friday, a major entry point to the European market for British goods.
At the Channel Tunnel terminal in nearby Coquelles, trucks and cars quickly tailed back towards the highway after the fishermen erected barricades of burning wooden pallets and lit smoke canisters.
The fishermen manning the roadblocks said they wanted to see progress by Dec. 10.
""If we don’t get anywhere ... believe me, the English will not have a magic Christmas. We’ll ruin the party,"" said Jean Michel Fournier, a fisherman from near Boulogne. 
Britain says it is respecting the post-Brexit arrangements while France says Britain is not honouring its word.
A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain's position on issuing fishing licences hadn't changed and London was monitoring the protests.
""We look to the French authorities to ensure the free flow of traffic and trade to ensure the trade is not disrupted,"" he added.
France last week said it was still waiting for 150 licences from Britain and the Channel Islands. The dispute focuses on access to territorial water 6-12 miles from the coast.
Britain denies discriminating against French fishermen and says 98 percent of fishing licences have been granted to European Union boats since Brexit.
That figure includes the roughly 1,700 licences issued to EU vessels to operate in more distant waters situated in the UK’s exclusive economic zone, which extends 12-200 nautical miles from the coast.
BREXIT FALLOUT
Dover (NYSE:DOV) - Calais is the shortest sea route between Britain and the EU and has been one of Britain’s main arteries for European trade since the Middle Ages. Before Brexit and the pandemic, 1.8 million trucks per year were routed through Calais.
Earlier in the day, fishermen blocked a small British cargo vessel outside the port of Saint-Malo. The Normandy Trader plies the short route between Jersey and France. France says Jersey, a British Crown Dependency, has also failed to issue licences due to its fishermen under a post-Brexit deal.

""The negotiations continue and we want them to know that we will not be the forgotten consequence of Brexit,” said fisherman Nicolas Descharles, who would normally operate in British waters every day through the autumn but has not received a permit.
In October, France briefly seized a British scallop dredger off its northern coast for allegedly operating without a legitimate permit, and both countries have this year sent patrol vessels to waters off Jersey.

Investing.com – Shares of energy companies traded sharply lower Friday as oil crashed more than 10% amid fears that a new strain of the coronavirus could halt the still-fragile recovery in global economies.
Both upstream and downstream companies were caught in the broad market selloff.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) was amongst the biggest losers, shedding over 10%, with  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) losing just short of that mark. Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) was down 8.3%, while Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) and Valero (NYSE:VLO) fell around 6% each.
ADRs of BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (NYSE:RDSa) were down 7.6% and 5.6%, respectively.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) traded 5% lower. 
Both WTI Crude Oil WTI Futures and Brent Brent Oil Futures tumbled as fears of lockdowns returning and hurting oil demand if the economic environment becomes adverse gripped the market. The plunge comes ahead of a key OPEC+ meeting next week.
Bloomberg quoted UBS as saying that the oil cartel could choose to pause its current planned output hike of 400,000 barrels a day or even cut output. The group will have to consider internal projections, published before the news of the variant broke, that showed an expected surplus early next year, UBS said."

(Reuters) - European stocks plummeted amid widespread selling on Friday, as reports of a newly identified and possibly vaccine-resistant coronavirus variant stoked fears of a fresh hit to the global economy and drove investors out of riskier assets.
The benchmark STOXX 600 index ended 3.7% down in its worst session since June 2020, while the volatility gauge for the main stock market hit a near 10-month high. 
The day's losses saw the STOXX 600 lose 4.5% this week. 
Little is known of the variant detected in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong, but scientists said it has an unusual combination of mutations and may be able to evade immune responses or make it more transmissible.
France's CAC 40 shed 4.8%. UK's FTSE 100 dropped 3.6%, while Germany's DAX fell 4.2% and Spain's IBEX lost 5.0%.
""With Europe and some northern parts of the U.S. in a stretched situation due to an already high number of new cases and hospitalisations, this new virus strain comes at the worst possible time,"" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. 
""Equities are reacting negatively because it is unknown at this point to what degree the vaccines will be effective against the new strain, and thus it increases risk of new lockdowns.""
Among the European stock sectors, travel and leisure plummeted 8.8% in its worst day since the COVID-19 shock sell-off in March 2020. 
Britain announced a temporary ban on flights from South Africa and several neighbouring countries from 1200 GMT on Friday. The European Union is also planning similar moves.
Travel stocks were the worst performers this week, down 13.6%. Concerns over rising COVID-19 cases had pulled European stock markets from record highs last week amid fears of more restrictions. 
The virus scare prompted euro zone money markets to scale back bets of a rate hike from the European Central Bank next year. Odds of a 10 basis point rate hike in December 2022 almost halved from 100% earlier this week.
Euro zone government bond yields dropped, pressuring European bank stocks, which lost 6.9%. 

Oil & gas producers slumped 5.8%, while miners tumbled 5.0% as oil and metal prices lost ground as reports of the new virus variant fuelled economic slowdown worries. [O/R] [MET/L] 
The technology sector had relatively smaller losses, thanks to gains in stay-at-home stocks. Defensives such as healthcare and utilities fell the least.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc, the exercise bike company, has sued  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) Inc after the athletic apparel maker threatened its own lawsuit over Peloton's new apparel line.
The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday night, 2-1/2 months after Peloton launched https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/peloton-apparel-launch its apparel brand following the end of its five-year co-branding relationship with Lululemon, a break Peloton called amicable.
Peloton said Lululemon's claims that five of its women's bra and legging products - Strappy Bra, High Neck Bra, Cadent Peak Bra, Cadent Laser Dot Bra and Cadent Laser Dot Leggings - infringed six Lululemon design patents ""lack any merit.""
The apparel line could help New York-based Peloton rely less on its bikes and treadmills, after sales growth slowed https://www.reuters.com/business/peloton-plunges-loss-bike-price-cut-higher-costs-2021-11-04 because more people received COVID-19 vaccines and stayed home less.
In a Nov. 11 letter, Lululemon's lawyer said the Vancouver, British Columbia-based company would sue Peloton unless it stopped selling its new apparel.
But Peloton said its products and Lululemon's designs are easy to tell apart, and Lululemon's designs are too ""obvious"" to deserve patent protection.
""On top of the numerous clear and obvious differences in design, Peloton and Lululemon's brands and logos are also distinctive and well-recognized, making confusion between products a virtual impossibility,"" Peloton said.
Peloton wants a court declaration that it has not infringed Lululemon patents and trade dress, and that Lululemon's patent claims are invalid.
""At Lululemon we are known for our product innovation and iconic design,"" Lululemon said in a statement on Friday. ""We will defend our proprietary rights, to protect the integrity of our brand, and to safeguard our intellectual property.""

In late morning trading, Peloton shares were up $1.76, or 4%, at $45.68, as investors worried that a new coronavirus variant would spread, and keep more people at home longer.

1102,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 12:05PM ET</span>",Traders pile into defensive options plays as COVID-19 fears return,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soaring volatility on Wall Street on concerns over a new coronavirus variant identified in South Africa sent investors scrambling into defensive options plays on Friday and boosted the Wall Street's most widely followed fear gauge to a more than two-month high.
The Cboe Volatility Index rose 8.37 points to 26.95, its highest since Sept. 20, as the S&P 500 index fell 1.9% with travel, bank and commodity-linked stocks bearing the brunt of the selloff triggered by the discovery of a new and possibly vaccine-resistant coronavirus variant.
It was the biggest one-day jump the VIX had logged since Jan. 27.
Options traders loaded up on bets that offset further market declines, with puts on the S&P 500 Index and its tracking Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) logging heavy volumes. 
Puts convey the right to sell shares at a fixed price in the future and are typically used to hedge against a drop in stock prices. Calls provide the right to buy shares at the given price in the future and are usually used to put on bullish bets. 
Puts on the S&P 500 index outnumbered calls 2-to-1, the widest margin in about six weeks, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. Trading in SPY put options was similarly elevated. 
""Risk off, hedges on seems to be the sentiment,"" Seth Golden, chief market strategist at investment research firm Finom Group, said. 
The surge in volatility follows weeks of comparatively placid trading that saw the S&P 500 march to record highs, with stocks seemingly shrugging off concerns over soaring inflation potentially pushing the Federal Reserve to normalize monetary policy at a faster-than-expected pace. 
Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR), believes the severity of Friday’s sell-off may have been exacerbated by investors unwinding “one-way bets” expressing the view that there was little alternative to stocks. 
""Those types of setups have a nasty way of reversing quickly,"" he said.
Andrew Thrasher, portfolio manager for The Financial Enhancement Group, had been concerned that recent gains in a handful of technology stocks with disproportionately large weightings in the S&P 500, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), were masking weakness in the broader market. 
""This set the kindling for sellers to push markets lower and the latest COVID news appears to have stoked that bearish flame,"" he said.

The VIX index is still well below its all-time highs of 82.69, hit during the market selloff in March 2020.
A VIX at around 45-50 would ""be close to panic,"" said Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories.

1105,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 11:41AM ET</span>",Analysis-New COVID scare sparks rate rethink in markets,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Yoruk Bahceli
LONDON (Reuters) - Risks of a new COVID hit to economic activity are clobbering expectations for rate hikes next year from the world's major central banks, a potential setback for the dollar and other currencies where wagers had been most aggressive.
Money markets no longer fully price a 25-basis-point interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve by June 2022, nor are they positioned for a full 10-bps hike from the European Central Bank by the end of 2022, as they were just a few days ago. 
And the chances of the Bank of England raising rates next month are seen around 53%, from 75% on Thursday.
Those shifts come after the detection of a new coronavirus variant in South Africa triggered stricter border controls from several governments, as scientists sought to determine if the mutation was vaccine-resistant.
""While central bank commentary has been focused on upside risks to inflation, this (new COVID variant) highlights that there are significant downside risks and we are in a significant phase of uncertainty for the economy,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa. 
Rate hike bets slip as new COVID variant rattles markets: https://graphics.reuters.com/MARKETS-RATES/mopanleydva/chart.png 
In an echo of the panic that swept markets when COVID was spreading early last year, oil prices slid over 6% on Friday, travel industry shares notched up falls of 6% or more and two-year U.S. Treasury yields fell 12 bps in their biggest daily drop since March 2020.
Currency traders had been favouring the U.S. dollar and others where rate hike prospects appeared strong, driven by higher inflation and stronger economies. 
Now a shake-out appears on the cards. 
The dollar index had hit 17-month highs after President Joe Biden said on Monday he would nominate Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to a second term. Then, minutes of the Fed's Nov. 2-3 meeting showed more policymakers open to speeding up the tapering of asset purchases and raising rates.
So with three 25 basis-point Fed increases factored in for 2022, speculators accumulated a $20 billion ""long"" position in the dollar, data from the U.S. CFTC showed. 
Positioning on yen, Swiss franc and euro meanwhile has been bearish, reflecting the view policy tightening is distant for those countries. 
If the new COVID variant has indeed disrupted Fed policy, ""the dollar may be a bit more vulnerable than the euro because we are already talking of two-three rate hikes next year from the Fed,"" Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING Bank said. 
Yen positions: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgvdwndokpo/Pasted%20image%201637919367896.png 
The sharp yield drop on 2-year Treasury notes -- a bond segment particularly sensitive to interest rate changes -- pushed its yield premium over Germany 10 bps lower.
Unsurprisingly, the yen and Swiss franc gained over 1% versus the dollar while the euro shot up 0.75% in one of its biggest daily jumps of this year.
Some saw the moves as a reality check. 
UBS Investment Bank chief economist Arend Kapteyn said while confidence in improving U.S. labour markets could fade if a new variant takes hold, it was still early days in terms of gauging the impact.
But he added that ""the market had gotten too far ahead of itself in terms of pricing a shortened taper window and multiple hikes next year"". 
US rate hikes: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/movanlewdpa/USRP1.JPG 
COVID IN A TIME OF INFLATION
The new variant may also complicate the task for central banks if it worsens the supply chain delays that are partly blamed for stoking inflation. 
Britain, where inflation has hit 10-year highs, had some 70 bps of policy-tightening priced by mid-2022, despite a lacklustre economic recovery.
But on Friday, sterling fell 0.6% against the euro; alongside the Kiwi, Aussie and Canadian dollars, the pound was most vulnerable to easing rate expectations, MUFG analysts predict. 
In Europe, the new strain could strengthen the hand of doves on the ECB's Governing Council.
While the ECB is expected to wind down its 1.85 trillion euro ($2.08 trillion) pandemic emergency stimulus scheme, Mizuho strategist Peter McCallum now sees a greater chance the programme gets extended beyond the March deadline.

That view resonated across southern European bond markets, the programme's biggest beneficiaries. Italy's 10-year borrowing costs slid under 1%, with the biggest daily fall in three weeks. 
""They (ECB) were saying that the European situation doesn't change the PEPP outcome but if there is a new variant requiring new vaccines that surely does change the picture,"" said McCallum.

Investing.com — In a research note on Friday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives told investors that he has seen shortages in various Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stores and estimates the company will sell over 10 million iPhones on Black Friday weekend.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Mizuho Financial Group said on Friday its chief, chairman and three other executives will resign as financial authorities reprimanded Japan's No. 3 lender for a series of technical system failures.
The Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country's banking regulator, said in a statement the failures had ""undermined the credibility of Japan's bank settlement system"".
Group CEO Tatsufumi Sakai and Chairman Yasuhiro Sato, as well as the head of the main banking unit and executives in charge of the group's systems and compliance, will step down by April to take responsibility for the glitches, the bank said.
Muzuho has not selected the next CEO and plans to leave the chairman post vacant.
The FSA reprimanded Mizuho for eight system glitches that took place this year, despite a $3.6 billion overhaul of its systems in 2019.
The regulator referred to governance problems at Mizuho, including an underestimation of the risks related to its banking systems, insufficient attention to on-site conditions and a culture in which employees ""do not say what should be said"".
Separately, in the first such order issued to a bank since Japan overhauled its foreign exchange law in 1998, the finance ministry ordered it to take corrective measures to prevent any further breach of the law.
During one of the system failures, the bank failed to comply with anti-money laundering procedures necessary for overseas remittances, as Japan strives to tighten regulation to prevent money-laundering.

The ministry cited a lack of knowledge by Mizuho's executives of foreign exchange law, a lack of communication among sections concerned and the fragility of its system management as reasons for the censure.
Japan has redoubled efforts against money-laundering through a three-year action plan that includes tighter supervision of financial institutions following a report in August by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial crimes watchdog.

Investing.com – Uber stock (NYSE:UBER) fell 6.3% on Friday as the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus in South Africa led to fears of fresh curbs on travel in countries.
Lockdown or not, people would be reluctant to use services of ride-hailing companies if the virus spreads.
Austria and Slovakia went into lockdowns last week and Germany, Europe’s largest economy is considering one, though the Covid-19 surge in those countries isn’t linked to the new variant.
The U.K. today suspended flights to and from six countries in Africa while the Europe Commission is proposing new travel rules to contain the spread of the virus.
Feeding into the negative sentiment for Uber stock was the company’s decision to halt operations in Brussels with effect from today.
The move comes after a Brussels court ruled Wednesday that a 2015 ban on private individuals offering taxi services also applies to professional drivers.
Uber said the decision will affect around 2,000 drivers. It urged the Belgian government to quickly change taxi service laws.
Today’s fall in the price comes even before the stock could recover from the blows of the last lockdown."

(Reuters) -Companies benefiting from this year's economic reopening, including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), United Airlines and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp, were hammered on Friday by fears that a possibly vaccine-resistant coronavirus variant could mar their recovery.
The variant, detected in South Africa, prompted several countries to tighten border controls and investors around the globe to dump equities for safer assets. [MKTS/GLOB] 
Travel and leisure stocks bore the brunt of the selloff in the United States, with carriers United, Delta Air and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) losing between 8% and 10% to open at their lowest levels in several months.
Hotel chains Hyatt, Marriott and Hilton fell between 8% and 11%, while cruise operators Carnival,  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) and Norwegian slumped about 10% each. Theater chain AMC sank 6.2%.
Little is known of the variant but scientists say it has an unusual combination of mutations, may be able to evade immune responses and could be more transmissible. 
""The economic recovery has been quite impressive and the one thing that could knock it over completely would be a more dangerous variant. Time will tell how worried we should be, but investors are selling in front of potential bad news,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA).

The news, however, sparked a rally in last year's stay-at-home darlings such as fitness company Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON),  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), and videogame publisher Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO).

Qiantang Credit Rating Co Ltd will become the third personal credit scoring firm in China if officially approved by regulators.
It will be registered in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province with a capital of 1 billion yuan ($156.50 million), the central bank said. The city is where Alibaba and Ant are based. 
Ant and the state-backed Zhejiang Tourism Investment Group Co Ltd will each own 35% of the venture, according to a statement by the People's Bank of China (PBOC).

Transfar Group, a non-state-backed shareholder, will hold 7%, while the remaining 10% will be held by Hangzhou Xishu.

The set-up of the venture https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-chinese-state-firms-take-big-stake-ants-credit-scoring-jv-sources-2021-09-01 is part of Ant's sweeping business revamp ordered by regulators who put a sudden stop to its blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) last November.
The government has pushed for state-backed firms to exert more influence over fast-growing but lightly regulated new-economy businesses, Reuters has reported.
It also serves as the central bank's year-long attempt to link loan data among different online lending platforms, and tighten controls in credit information sharing to prevent over-borrowing and fraud.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese regulators have pressed top executives of ride hailing giant Didi Global Inc to devise a plan to delist from the New York Stock Exchange due to concerns about data security, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
China's powerful Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has asked the management to take the company off the U.S. bourse due to worries about leakage of sensitive data, said one of the people.
It also wants the ride-hailing giant to promise it would solve the delisting issue within a certain period of time, said the person.
The cyberspace regulator said, according to the person, the prerequisite for the relaunch of Didi's ride-hailing and other apps in China is that the company has to agree to delist from New York.
Proposals under consideration include a straight-up privatisation or a second listing in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the United States, said the person.
In July, the CAC ordered app stores to remove 25 mobile apps operated by Didi - just days after the company listed in New York. It also told Didi to stop registering new users, citing national security and the public interest.
Reuters reported earlier this month that Didi is preparing to relaunch its apps in the country by the end of the year in anticipation that Beijing's cybersecurity investigation into the company would be wrapped up by then, citing sources directly involved in the relaunch.
Neither Didi nor the CAC responded to Reuters' requests for comments.
The people declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Bloomberg first reported regulators' request for Didi to delist on Friday. Shares in Didi investors SoftBank Group Corp and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) fell more than 5% and 3.1%, respectively following the report.
SoftBank Vision Fund owns 21.5% of Didi, followed by Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc with 12.8% and Tencent's 6.8%, according to a filing in June by Didi.
If the privatization proceeds, shareholders would likely be offered at least the $14 per share IPO price, since a lower offer so soon after the June offering could prompt lawsuits or shareholder resistance, the report said, citing sources.
Shares of Didi, which have fallen 42% since it went public in June, were down 6.3% at $7.60.
The company ran afoul of Chinese authorities when it pressed ahead with its New York listing, despite the regulator urging it to put it on hold while a cybersecurity review of its data practices was conducted, sources have told Reuters.
Soon after, the CAC launched an investigation into Didi over its collection and use of personal data. It said data had been collected illegally. 

Didi responded at the time by saying it had stopped registering new users and would make changes to comply with rules on national security and personal data usage and would protect users' rights.
China's tech giants are under intense state scrutiny over anti-monopolistic behavior and handling of their vast consumer data, as the government tries to rein in their dominance after years of unfettered growth.

Investing.com — Covid-19 related vaccine stocks have made gains Friday after concerns were raised about a new coronavirus variant in South Africa that is said to have several mutations.
With concerns being raised about the variant's potential ability to evade current vaccines, stocks such as  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX),  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA),  Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc  (NASDAQ:INO),  Novavax  Inc (NASDAQ:NVAX),  Vir Biotechnology Inc  (NASDAQ:VIR), and others have surged.

In certain European countries, a reintroduction of lockdown restrictions has already started, with cases rising once again. In addition, while some commentators have described the variant as the ""most concerning"" so far, it is important to note that not much is known about it just yet, with scientists still working to understand its implications."

Also, its net loss came in at $1.66 million, indicating a 29.7% increase year-over-year. The increase in expenses can be attributed to increased employee headcount to support growth, and expenses specific to VRAR status as a publicly-traded company.

TILBURY, England (Reuters) -Climate activists targeted 15 Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) depots across Europe on ""Black Friday"" and the world's biggest e-commerce company also faced protests by workers and delivery drivers in Germany, France and Italy.
Amazon, based in Seattle, is facing criticism from climate activists who say excessive consumption harms the environment while an alliance of trade unions say the company does not pay workers enough nor enough tax to governments.
""Black Friday epitomises an obsession with overconsumption that is not consistent with a liveable planet,"" the Extinction Rebellion group said after blocking 13 Amazon depots across the United Kingdom.
""Amazon and companies like it have capitalised on our desire for convenience and stoked rampant consumerism at the expense of the natural world,"" it said.
Reuters reporters at an Amazon depot at Tilbury docks in eastern England said protesters had blocked the entrance, meaning no vehicles could enter or exit. The group also said it had blocked Amazon depots in Germany and the Netherlands. 
Banners read: ""Black Friday exploits people and planet"" and ""Infinite growth, finite planet"".
Extinction Rebellion said Amazon's ""crimes"" included activities which emitted more carbon dioxide than a medium sized country, helping fossil fuel companies.
""We have a large network of sites across the UK and are working to minimise any potential disruption to customers,"" said a spokesperson for Amazon, which brought the traditional U.S. Black Friday discount day to Britain in 2010.
Amazon also said it takes its responsibilities ""very seriously"".
""That includes our commitment to be net zero carbon by 2040 - 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement - providing excellent pay and benefits in a safe and modern work environment, and supporting the tens of thousands of British small businesses who sell on our store.""
""We know there is always more to do,"" it said.
Trade unions across Europe's biggest economies also called out warehouse workers and delivery drivers to strike against what they said were Amazon's unfairly low wages and tax payments. 
In Germany, the company's biggest market after the United States, the Verdi union said around 2,500 employees went on strike at Amazon shipping centres in Rheinberg, Koblenz and Graben.

In France, one of the country's top labour unions, CGT, called for Amazon workers in the country to go on strike.. The union coalition also reported a strike in Italy. 
""The coalition demands Amazon pays its workers fairly and respects their right to join unions, pays its fair share of taxes and commits to real environmental sustainability,"" the ""Make Amazon Pay"" coalition said in a statement.

Asian and European countries rushed to tighten restrictions on Friday after a new and possibly vaccine-resistant coronavirus variant was detected in South Africa, with Singapore and India announcing stricter border controls and more rigorous testing.
COMMENTS: 
EDWARD MOYA, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, OANDA, NEW YORK 
“After the fed minutes it seems likely everybody was expecting an accelerated Fed taper. If we continue to hear more of a greater spreading of this new variant, you might start to see that the argument will be made that no, we need to gradually exit stimulus here and we’re not completely sure how the vaccines will hold up against this and possibly more variants down the road as we’re nowhere near getting the rest of the world vaccinated.”
“What has really complicated today was that we have options expiration day and extremely thin conditions, so I think ultimately when everybody is back next week, if this variant concern continues to dominate the headlines, then you’ll start to see the dollar resume its safe-haven trade.”
GREG BASSUK, CEO, AXS INVESTMENTS PORT CHESTER, NEW YORK
“Bottom line is this is showing that Covid is still the investor narrative, a lot of today’s movement is driven by the South African variant. We have been talking about four or five factors that have been driving the last couple of month’s activity – inflation fears, some economic data, Fed policy – but what we have seen over the last year is that big developments with respect to Covid really have ended up eclipsing some of those other factors by a substantial degree and that is what is driving today’s market activity.” 
“Longer-term we are very constructive and bullish on stocks having much longer legs into 2022 with the economy reopening, supply chain issues becoming more mitigated. But one thing we have seen that has been consistent in the last year and a half has been some of these more outsized impacts or developments with respect to Covid really has been the one thing that has shaken the markets to a greater extent.” 
“We see today’s activity and what will likely spill over into next week as a buying opportunity in the sense that it is another wrinkle here with the South African variant but while the immediate term market slides could be significant and continue into early December, bigger picture this will be a buying opportunity to move in there on this dip.” 
JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CRESSET CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO 
“It is pretty amazing, we had such strong economic news come out on Wednesday. I do think there is something to this, it is obviously worth investigating. I think the latest news we heard was that they had spotted this variant in Belgium so this isn’t just isolated in South Africa. I would say initially, the vaccination rate in South Africa is very low and is probably fertile ground for these variants. It certainly begs further watching. Whatever we are going to see today is going to be exaggerated just because of a lack of liquidity.”
“It certainly begs further study and looking into but my first reaction is anything we are going to see today is overdone so if we end up down a lot, it will likely turn out to be a buying opportunity.”
BIPAN RAI, NORTH AMERICAN HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, CIBC, TORONTO
“When you say risk-off it basically means markets are closing out extended positioning and one of the more popular trades over the last several weeks has been to be long US dollars, and I think the squaring up of that is really behind the dollar’s move for today. I don’t think it’s any sort of indication that the dollar’s lost its safe-haven status. The near-term move is mostly about extended positioning and closing those out, once that becomes a little bit more finely balanced and if we are in a risk-off scenario then I would expect the dollar to continue to outperform.”
“It feels like this news about the scariant, let’s call it, because we don’t have a name for it, really is triggering a lot of risk-off tendencies across the markets. Really if we’re looking at something like this where we have new mutations on mutations of a spike protein it almost feels like the initial working assumption for most market participants is that this is a new phase of the pandemic, new lockdowns and restrictions will maybe be put in place, and it certainly feels like we’re going to need a new vaccine as well. If that is the case that introduces an additional degree of uncertainty that we didn’t take into account previously.”
BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN
“Like the virus, this might be something that never really goes away completely. We just learn to live with it and manage around it. It’s not the virus itself that market fear, but policy reactions to the virus. If there are new restrictions or enhanced restrictions on activity, then we could see some spillover into the next week and month. Some countries, like the U.S. and U.K., might not react to it as much as countries like China with their zero-COVID strategy. Just as supply chains looked like they were healing, this could cause some setbacks.”
PETER RUTTER, HEAD OF EQUITIES AT ROYAL LONDON ASSET MANAGEMENT
""This news is putting the handbrake on markets. This could be the moment that people look back on as derailing the economic recovery and rate rises. What we have is a big insertion of uncertainty rather than something material but markets don't like that. 
""The very fact we don't know, is what's concerning the market. There is a huge range of outcomes that can happen. We could have serious lockdowns or we get no lockdowns and a booming economy.""
STEEN JAKOBSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SAXO BANK: 
""A new Covid wave is leading investors to fly to safety, provoking yields to drop roughly 10 bps across the whole US yield curve. However, we expect the bond rally to be short-lived for several reasons. First, the market has learnt through earlier new strains that Covid is temporary. Secondly, a renewal of lockdown measures would make supply chain bottlenecks worse, introducing even more inflationary pressures to the economy. Therefore, it’s necessary for central banks to stop stimulating demand, keeping intact the recent Fed’s hawkish tilt. 
SCOTIABANK STRATEGISTS
""Given that COVID has hardly been contained globally at this point and that we do not yet know whether this new variant, with all its mutations, is a greater threat, the market’s reaction seems a little excessive. 
""But investors are prone to shoot first and ask question later and not stand in the way of these sorts of position unwinds. The process may have a little further to run. Recall that seasonal trends for the U.S. dollar tend to turn more negative in December; market volatility might be the sort of cover markets need to lighten up on (rates and dollar) positioning now and reassess prospects in January.""
SUSANNAH STREETER, SENIOR INVESTMENT AND MARKETS ANALYST, HARGREAVES LANSDOWN
""Fear has gripped the financial markets with the travel industry flying into another violent storm, after the discovery of a new COVID strain which could be far more contagious and may render vaccines less effective."" 
PETER CHATWELL, HEAD OF MULTI-ASSET STRATEGY AT MIZUHO INTERNATIONAL
The European lockdowns on their own would have meant soft Q4 GDP growth, but a Q1 rebound. US, UK, Asia all looked unaffected by Europe’s problem. If the new variant does deliver its potential (usurping Delta, and reducing vaccine efficacy) we need to think about a globally soft/flat Q4 and Q1 GDP growth. Vaccine efficacy will determine the severity of lockdowns, and therefore whether this becomes another recession. 
RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, EUROPE: 
It is the threat of vaccine escape that causes the market reaction in both equities (down) and bonds (up). As long as markets are faced with a familiar virus situation that can be overcome with a sufficiently crafted and executed vaccination strategy, the reactions will be muted, as we have seen with the short-lived bond market rally last week when new lockdowns were announced in Europe. This new variant, however, creates a potential threat to the known responses and thus creates a more lasting market response.
HOLGER SCHMIEDING, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT BERENBERG:
At this stage, it is too early to assess the potential economic consequences. Any new wave could cause serious economic damage. As one potentially mitigating factor, the world is now on high alert and has ramped up its capacity to develop, adjust and produce vaccines. 
TAKASHI HIROKI, CHIEF STRATEGIST, MONEX, TOKYO
""This variant is a new risk for markets. We can't tell how far it can evade vaccines.""
RAY ATTRILL, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, NAB, SYDNEY
""People are reacting with the uncertainty about what this means. You shoot first and ask questions later when this sort of news erupts.""
MOH SIONG SIM, CURRENCY ANALYST, BANK OF SINGAPORE
""We still don't know how infectious the virus is ... it's a general uncertainty. Markets are anticipating the risk here of another global wave of infections if vaccines are ineffective.
""Reopening hopes could be dashed."" 
MARK ARNOLD, CIO, HYPERION ASSET MANAGEMENT, BRISBANE
""I don't think there's any going back to the pre-COVID world. We're just going to get mutations through time and that's going to change the way people operate in the economy. That's just reality."" 
SHINICHIRO KADOTA, SENIOR FX STRATEGIST, BARCLAYS, TOKYO
""We see Germany considering a lockdown, so this new variant and flare-up in the COVID situation poses some risk to market sentiment in general.
""If the COVID situation worsens, then dollar-yen could go down further, but otherwise the monetary policy divergence is definitely going to be weighing on the yen in the medium term.""
MARTIN WHETTON, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME, CBA, SYDNEY
""Keep an eye on the new COVID-19 variant. None of us are virologists, but all of us have seen the impact this has had on the intended path of central bank policy and markets.""
JEFFREY HALLEY, ANALYST, OANDA, JAKARTA

""The UK has paused flights from South Africa and five other neighbouring countries, and we can expect more of this elsewhere. The complacency seen with the emergence of the delta variant in India being a lesson harshly learned.
""The one bull in the China shop that could truly derail the global recovery has always been a new strain of COVID-19 that swept the world and caused the reimposition of mass social retractions. All we know so far is the B.1.1.529 is heavily mutated, but markets are taking no chances.""

(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. department-store operators slid on Friday as the detection of a new coronavirus variant possibly resistant to existing vaccines compounded woes stemming from low in-store visits and thin holiday season inventories.
Retailers have turned Black Friday, which kicks off the holiday shopping season, into a month-long event this year in the face of supply chain hiccups and a labor squeeze, with customers preferring to shop online since the pandemic began last year.
Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) shed 6%, while Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) and  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) dropped about 3.5% each. 
The S&P 500 slumped 0.8% as the new COVID-19 variant prompted border tightening in the European Union, Britain and other countries, and sent investors flocking to safer assets. 
Little is known of the variant, detected in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong, but scientists say it has an unusual combination of mutations, may be able to evade immune responses and could be more transmissible. 
""A state of panic around the new COVID variant is terrible news for retailers hoping people would go into their stores to snap up Black Friday deals,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. 
U.S. apparel retailers Guess (NYSE:GES) Inc,  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) Inc, Abercrombie & Fitch Co,  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) and  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) Inc dropped between 2% and 6.6%. 
""With people getting back into physical stores and making purchases earlier in the holiday season, demand is smoothing out beyond the typical peak shopping days,"" said Rob Garf, vice president and general manager of retail at Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).
The S&P retailing index slipped 0.2%, coming off an all-time high hit just last week.

""I wouldn't be surprised that if, at least for today, and until we get more information about this new variant, the virus would be reason to sell some retail stocks,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. 
The world's biggest e-commerce company Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) edged up 0.6%.

1121,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 09:49AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Sharply Lower as Covid Concerns Flare Again; Dow Down 800 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks tumbled at the opening of a holiday-shortened session on Friday, as concerns about a new and potentially vaccine-resistant variant of Covid-19 spooked global markets, triggering a rush to reactivate pandemic trades.
By 9:40 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 791 points, or 2.2%, at 35,013 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was, outperforming, down only 1.0%. 
There were few movements across the board that weren't attributable - directly or indirectly - to the news that South African scientists had identified a new variant of the virus, known as 1.1.529, the first one to have displaced the delta variant as the most common strain in the regions where it has been identified. Travel, leisure and hospitality stocks were predictably hard hit, with cruise line stocks all falling over 10%, the Dow Jones Airlines index falling 7.2%, and the Dow Jones Hotels index falling 7.5%.
Although many new variants have been discovered over recent months, the new one differs in having a protein spike so different from the original strain (which today's vaccines were designed to combat) that health regulators fear that current vaccines may not be effective against it. So far, there is no evidence either way to suggest whether that is the case or not. 
Despite the uncertainty over the effectiveness of current vaccines, the companies behind those drugs all profited immediately from the shift in sentiment.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock, which had fallen by over 50% from its August peak at one stage earlier this month, rebounded by 22%. BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock also surged 19% and  Novavax  Inc (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock rose 9.0%. In part, the move was due to confidence that the biotech companies will be able to address even a new variant with a relatively straightforward tweak to their drugs.  The CEOs of both  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna were both reported as saying that such a fix ought to be possible within three months. 
That may come too late, however, to benefit retailers - notably fashion chains - whose holiday season was already in question after profit warnings earlier in the week. Gap stock and Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) stock both fell another 4% each, while Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) stock lost another 6.8%.
One pharma stock not to benefit from a Covid bounce was Merck (NYSE:MRK) stock, which fell 5.0% despite the possibility of an FDA panel imminently recommending its antiviral drug molnupravir for emergency use. The panel is due to meet later Friday. 
Oil and gas stocks were hit by the slide in oil prices as the market moved to price in another setback to the recovery in global oil demand. U.S. crude futures were down 8.3% at $71.91 a barrel, their worst one-day drop of the year, dragging down  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock by 5.8% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock by 3.8%.
Aside from biotechs, the only stocks posting gains were largely those which had done so early in the pandemic, and which have become increasingly heavily shorted as the emergency has receded. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock rose 8.7% while Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) rose 5.4%."
1122,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 09:46AM ET</span>","In muddle of Merkel exit, COVID's fourth wave catches Germany out","By Ludwig Burger and Joseph Nasr
FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - For once, proverbially efficient Germany has dropped the ball.
Seemingly endless queues all over the country for coronavirus booster shots and even for first vaccines are evidence that it has been caught out by a fourth wave of COVID-19, having led the world in its initial response to the pandemic early last year.
Then, swift reporting and measures to limit contagion, helped by inspired political leadership, meant Germany suffered far fewer transmissions and deaths than Italy, Spain, France or Britain.
But now it is among the worst affected nations in western Europe, hitting a record of over 76,000 infections on Friday and preparing to fly severely ill people around the country to find intensive care beds.
Many academics and clinicians blame vaccine-hesitancy. While waning vaccine protection is compounding the emergency, about 32% of Germany's population have had no COVID-19 vaccine at all - among the highest rates in western Europe.
In fact, the federal government ended funding for 430 vaccination centres at the end of September, when the flow of those seeking vaccination ebbed, passing the burden to family doctors and other medical practices.
While in Britain more than 24% have had a booster shot after their initial course, in Germany the number is below 10%.
With general practitioners now overwhelmed by demand, Thomas Mertens, chairman of the vaccination advisory panel STIKO, said last week - before the detection of a new highly contagious variant in South Africa - that most elderly people would be unlikely to get a booster before December or January.
'CONFUSION AND FRUSTRATION'
Critics also point out that Germany has been in a political vacuum since a general election in September.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, a former scientist who in early 2020 won praise for her swift decision to impose a lockdown and for a forceful televised appeal to reduce social contacts, has been leading a lame-duck administration while a new three-party coalition government https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-spd-greens-fdp-present-coalition-deal-wednesday-2021-11-24 is formed.
Frank Roselieb, director of the Crisis Research Institute in Kiel, said a ""void"" in communication from Merkel, who had already announced her retirement and travelled abroad as intensive care units filled up, had led to widespread public complacency.
""Communication about the pandemic was left to subordinates and health experts who have less reach and impact than the chancellor,"" he said.
To add to the disruption, Health Minister Jens Spahn this month told the 16 federal states to prioritise  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) boosters that were nearing their expiry date over the more commonly used BioNTech/Pfizer shot.
Spahn hailed Moderna as the ""Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY)"" of vaccines to overcome Germans' stubborn preference for the home-made BioNTech.
But family doctors had to change their procedures, and Verena Bentele, president of the VdK social care association, said hesitant recipients were unlikely to be reassured by receiving a soon-to-expire vaccine:
""The management of the pandemic has been marked by unclear communication, which has led to confusion and frustration.""
   Getting a grip on the crisis will now be the first priority for the incoming government led by the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats.

Though not sworn in yet, the parties were criticised this month for failing to use their majority in parliament to stop the expiry of emergency laws that allow the federal government to order local lockdowns. 
Chancellor-in-waiting Olaf Scholz of the SPD has promised to speed up vaccinations and has declined to rule out making them compulsory.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said on Friday it has withdrawn its application for state aid for its planned battery factory near Berlin as CEO Elon Musk declared the electric vehicle maker opposed all subsidies.
The European Union in January approved a plan that included giving state aid to Tesla, BMW and others to support production of electric vehicle batteries and help the bloc to reduce imports from industry leader China.
Tesla was expected to receive 1.14 billion euros https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-decision-tesla-subsidies-expected-by-end-year-2021-09-05 ($1.28 billion) in EU funding for its battery plant in Gruenheide, Brandenburg under the plan, with a final decision likely by the end of the year.
""Tesla has informed the Federal Ministry of Economics and the Brandenburg Ministry of Economics... it is withdrawing its IPCEI application for state funding for the battery factory in Grünheide,"" a Tesla spokesperson said, referring to European subsidies allocated to so-called 'Important Projects of Common European Interest'.
Construction plans for the plant would not be affected by the decision, the spokesperson said.
""It has always been Tesla’s view that all subsidies should be eliminated,"" Musk posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) in response to a tweet by another user after Tesla said it had withdrawn its funding application.
""But that must include the massive subsidies for oil & gas. For some reason, governments don’t want to do that...,"" Musk added, deviating from the subject of the factory grant.
Tesla itself is investing 5 billion euros in the battery plant, according to German economy ministry estimates. 
Meanwhile, construction of a car production site alongside the battery plant, which Tesla has begun building under pre-approval permits while it awaits final approval from the regional government, has made good progress in the last few weeks, a spokesperson for the federal economy ministry said.
The electric vehicle maker also applied in November 2020 for regional funding from Brandenburg, according to the regional government's website. 
A Brandenburg economy ministry spokesperson said this application had not been withdrawn. 
The amount Tesla applied for is undisclosed, but investments worth over 100 million euros are generally given 6.8% of their value, the website says. 
The latest round of online consultations for the public to express environmental and other concerns about the car factory and battery plant closed last week and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he hopes to formally begin production by the end of the year and then ramp up as quickly as possible.

Musk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country's complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change.

Investing.com –  Pinduoduo  stock (NASDAQ:PDD) plummeted by 19% in Friday’s premarket trading as user growth slowed at the e-commerce company, leading third-quarter revenue to fall short of estimates.
Average monthly active users during the quarter grew 15% to 741.5 million, a sharp slowdown from the second quarter’s 30% growth. The deceleration comes as the pandemic-fueled shopping waned and consumers returned to physical stores to shop. It was also a time when authorities in China enhanced their scrutiny of the country’s Internet giants.
Chairman and CEO of Pinduoduo Lei Chen said the company will place more focus on investments in R&D, away from the previous emphasis on sales and marketing in its first five years.
He reiterated promises made earlier to allocate all profits to the '10 billion agriculture initiative', a government-sponsored program in reducing inequality, especially in rural areas. Those comments were a reminder of the uncertainty about how much profit will ever accrue to shareholders in future.
The news was released into a market already suffering from concerns over a new strain of the coronavirus in South Africa and reports of authorities in China asking Didi to delist from the New York Stock Exchange.
Pinduoduo's third-quarter total revenue was 21.51 billion yuan (around $3.4 billion), below analysts' average estimate of 25.83 billion yuan.
Total cost of revenue more than doubled as the company paid more for processing fees, Cloud services, and delivery and storage charges.
Adjusted profit per share was 1.15 yuan and higher than estimates. The company swung to a comfortable operating profit from a loss the same time last year.

1131,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 08:27AM ET</span>",New Variant Will Test Europe’s Economic Resilience to Lockdown,"(Bloomberg) -- The new coronavirus variant is set to test the European economy’s recent ability to withstand fresh restrictions on activity.
With the new strain from South Africa looming as a threat to public health, adding to the existing headache of rising infections that have already forced Austria and Slovakia to impose lockdowns, a pandemic that countries around the region had previously learned to live with is casting a shadow over the region’s prospects. 
European central bankers were expressing quiet confidence about the economy’s ability to weather fresh restrictions before revelations of the variant emerged amid global travel curbs. Meanwhile high frequency data suggest the bruising to growth from such measures has become less painful with each successive lockdown, providing some grounds for hope.  
Take France: Economic activity in the euro zone’s second-biggest economy dropped as much as 29 percentage points during its initial March-May lockdown last year. Yet a subsequent lockdown in October 2020 only dented activity by 4 percentage points, while one starting in April had an almost negligible impact.
If that pattern were to play out across the region -- as data from Bloomberg Economics suggests -- that raises the prospect that the wider economy could just be able to weather a second winter of severe shutdowns without the need to resort to new emergency fiscal aid, or derailing ECB plans to shift away from crisis stimulus. 
“The experience of the past 20 months shows that each new wave of coronavirus has caused less economic damage than the previous one,” Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau told German newspaper Boersen-Zeitung earlier this week. “One thing must not be forgotten either: Vaccination is more advanced in Europe than on any other continent. This is a great sanitary achievement but also an economic advantage.”
Just like her French colleague, ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel was sanguine about the possibility of further restrictions, in an interview with Bloomberg this week. Her hawkish colleague, Dutch Governor Klaas Knot, meanwhile expressed confidence that any restrictions wouldn’t postpone the ECB’s plan to end emergency bond buying in March. 
New containment measures are “likely to have a moderating effect on activity in the short run, in particular in the contact-intensive services sector,” Schnabel said. “But I do not think that this will derail the overall recovery.”
Bloomberg Economics’ high-frequency dashboard does paint a similar picture of strength in Europe’s other major economies. One reason is that the prevailing policy is now that schools should remain open, allowing parents to focus less on childcare even if their country is in lockdown. 
Factories have also learned how to operate during the pandemic. Vaccines and widely available testing facilities have helped that and other sectors of the economy to stay open, though that may be not enough for some consumer-facing businesses such as restaurants. 
Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS AG, observes that the biggest economic damage comes from fear of the virus, and that Austrian data suggest that sentiment is less prevalent now that people have got used to living with it. 
The new unknown here is the variant, clouding what economists can reasonably predict. The so-called B.1.1.529 strain carries a high number of mutations in its spike protein, which plays a key role in the virus’ entry into cells in the body and is also what is targeted by vaccines. 
If the variant takes hold and if inoculations are less effective against it, that could change the calculation for economic growth. 
Even if it doesn’t the current juncture already brings challenges as infections spike. Full lockdowns may still cost 0.5% of quarterly gross domestic product per week, according to calculations by Citi economists, who note that such measures tend to be disinflationary and could incur more government borrowing and monetary support if they persist.
Economists such as Aline Schuiling at ABN Amro still point to how this time is different from the first lockdowns last year that caused global growth to instantly shrivel -- even though the legacy of that slump remains.  
“Economies are indeed more resilient,” she said. “So the impact will be less dramatic than during previous waves. But you are still in an economy that hasn’t yet fully recovered from the waves that we’ve seen so far.”

Roche held an extraordinary general meeting to settle matters related to its plan to disentangle the two pharma companies, both based in Basel, who had been linked by the investment for two decades.
Shareholders approved the audited statutory interim financial statements of the company as of 31 October 2021 with a majority of 100.00%, Roche said. 
They also backed the plan to cancel the 53.3 million shares bought, with a majority of 99.85%.
Therefore, the corporate law requirements for the repurchase have been satisfied, Roche said. The closing of the repurchase transaction is expected to take place in early December 2021.
""Today's resolutions of the Extraordinary General Meeting are in the best economic and strategic interest of Roche,"" said Roche Chairman Christoph Franz. ""As a result, we will be even better positioned to make a contribution to the health of people around the world.""
Novartis agreed earlier this month to sell 53.3 million Roche bearer shares for $388.99 (356.93 Swiss francs) per share, a price that reflected the volume-weighted average of the Roche non-voting equity certificates over the 20 trading days to Nov. 2. 
The repurchase was conditional upon the approval by shareholders of a capital reduction by cancellation of the repurchased shares and of the interim financial statements prepared for the transaction.

Novartis' involvement started in 2001, when Swiss activist investor Martin Ebner, known for orchestrating the merger that created banking giant UBS, offered his Roche stake to its cross-town rival out of frustration over rebuffed proposals.
Roche Chairman Franz said earlier this month that the deal would give his company more strategic flexibility, as Roche could now make plans without needing the approval of Novartis.

Investing.com – Merck stock (NYSE:MRK) traded 3.5% lower in Friday’s premarket while the company awaits details of FDA’s review of the Covid-19 pill it has jointly developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.
The stock traded 1.2% higher initially but was weighed down by broader market concerns over the emergence of a new variant of the coronavirus in South Africa. 
The companies claim that the antiviral pill, molnupiravir, reduces the risk of hospitalization or death in patients suffering from the currently dominant strain of Covid-19.  There is no evidence to indicate whether or not the drug, molnupravir, would be effective against the new strain.
The report from Food and Drug Administration staff, expected Friday, will cover an analysis of clinical-trial data for molnupiravir. The report may also include FDA staff’s view on whether the agency should clear the drug for use.
If approved, molnupiravir could be the world’s first oral antiviral medicine for Covid.
The company had earlier said that if the emergency use approval comes through in December, the drug offers an opportunity of up to $7 billion in sales in 2022 including $1 billion in revenue this year.
The drug is relatively cheap to make and easy to transport. Merck expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by the end of 2021, with more doses in 2022. It has agreed to supply 3.1 million courses to the U.S. government, assuming all necessary approvals are given.
Merck’s antiviral pill is one of only three oral medicines so far to prove their efficacy against Covid-19, along with treatments from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). Pfizer claims to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Malaysia said on Friday it will investigate British home appliance maker Dyson's decision to sever ties with ATA IMS over the Malaysian supplier's labour practices.
Dyson told Reuters on Thursday that it was ending its contract with ATA https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-dyson-terminates-relationship-with-malaysian-supplier-ata-over-labour-2021-11-25 after an audit of the company's labour practices and allegations by a whistleblower.
Malaysia's Human Resources Minister M. Saravanan said the government wanted to hear the reasons from both parties.
""I am informed that Dyson did not want to continue the contract due to (a) worker shortage. There are two different stories,"" Saravanan told reporters, adding that he was waiting to hear Dyson's side of the matter.
Malaysia has faced scrutiny over claims that migrant workers are subjected to abusive working and living conditions, while ATA is already being investigated by the United States over forced labour allegations.
Saravanan said he has received complaints on the use of forced labour in Malaysia, specifically forcing workers into excessive hours due to labour shortages and the collection of recruitment fees by agents.
Dyson and ATA did not immediately respond to his comments. 
ATA said on Friday https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/analysts-see-years-losses-malaysias-ata-after-major-client-dyson-cuts-ties-2021-11-26 it was taking seriously allegations of forced labour in an audit summary it received from Dyson and claims of physical abuse raised by a former worker.
The manufacturer said as soon as it was notified of Dyson's audit it had appointed an unnamed firm of consultants to review and verify the findings and to take any necessary steps.
ATA said it had hired a law firm in Malaysia to conduct an independent review of the allegations of physical abuse by the former worker, and a detailed report will be finalised soon.
""The preliminary findings of the independent law firm indicates that the allegations may be unjustified,"" it said.
Former ATA worker Dhan Kumar Limbu told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-dyson-terminates-relationship-with-malaysian-supplier-ata-over-labour-2021-11-25 that ATA officials took him to a police station in June where he was questioned about sharing information on conditions at the factory with activists and then beaten by police. 
Malaysian police did not respond to a request for comment.
Limbu told Reuters he had recounted his experience in an interview with Dyson's lawyers. 
ATA said it is subject to regular audits and inspections of the working and living conditions of its workers.
""In none of these audits and inspections were issues of forced labour found in the company,"" it said, adding that some of the inspections by government departments and the national human rights institution were on ad-hoc basis.
In interviews with Reuters, seven current and former ATA employees said they had worked overtime in excess of limits under Malaysian law and paid recruitment fees in their home countries to labour brokers, a practice activists have criticised as a form of debt bondage.
STOCK TUMBLES
Shares in ATA, which makes parts for Dyson's vacuum cleaners and air purifiers, plunged a further 36.6% on Friday and have lost more than half their value since the Reuters report.
Dyson contributes around 80% of ATA's revenue and analysts said it may face years of losses and challenges in securing new customers, as well as dealing with an ongoing labour shortage.
Many factory workers in Malaysia are migrants and as borders in Asia have not reopened during the COVID-19 pandemic, industries have not been able to hire, while some of those who returned to their home countries have been unable to return.
AmInvestment Bank said in a note that the full impact of Dyson's withdrawal is expected in the 2023 financial year, which would ""severely impact"" ATA's earnings that year and beyond.

ATA may have enough time to replace some of its lost orders with other existing customers, AmInvestment said.
""We also foresee challenges ahead ... to secure new orders given its dented reputation and ongoing labour shortage crisis, which is being viewed as an operational risk until a concrete solution emerges,"" the AmInvestment note added.

The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped as much as 9 points on Friday morning, the biggest intraday move since February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was 7.7 points higher at 26.3 as of 5:40 a.m. in New York, the highest level in more than six months on a closing basis.
Exchange-traded products tied to the index led ETF gains in early trading.
The index, often referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” measures the implied volatility of the S&P 500 over the next month. Futures for America’s equity benchmark slumped 1.8% on Friday amid a global pullback sparked by a new Covid strain emerging in southern Africa.
If that move holds, it would be the first drop of more than 1% for the S&P 500 since the start of October, and the biggest decline in almost two months. The gauge has enjoyed a relatively calm few weeks as traders focus on monetary policy and the pace of growth, rather than the virus.
The VIX move looks set to ripple through the volatility complex. In pre-market trading, the $1 billion ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (ticker UVXY), which delivers 1.5 times the performance of the VIX, surged 19%. The $1.1 billion iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX), a non-leveraged product, jumped 13%.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening aggressively lower Friday, in holiday-thinned volumes, as the discovery of a new potentially vaccine-resistant Covid variant raised fears of fresh harm to the global economy.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 855 points, or 2.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 90 points, or 1.9%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures slumped further, dropping 210 points, or 1.3%.
The selloff followed the news that the World Health Organisation was studying a new variant of the Covid-19 virus, which has been detected mainly in southern Africa. 
The United Nations agency has called an emergency meeting for Friday to discuss what this means for existing treatments, given that the new variant has a spike protein that has mutated to be very different from the one in the original coronavirus that the vaccines are based on.
The U.K. quickly responded to the news by temporarily suspending flights from six countries in southern Africa and quarantining travelers from those regions. This resulted in heavy losses for the airline and travel industry in European hours, and this negative sentiment is set to carry through to Wall Street.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock fell over 6% premarket, with Delta (NYSE:DAL) and United (NASDAQ:UAL) following suit, while Carnival (NYSE:CUK) stock dropped over 9%, as did  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) stock.
The banking sector also weakened, as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) all fell more than 3% on the reduced likelihood of early interest rate hikes if the Federal Reserve is spooked by the new variant.   
Crude prices also slumped as the announcement of the new Covid-19 strain raised concerns about demand just as a U.S.-led coalition of major consumers is adding output to the global supply.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 6.6% lower at $73.20 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 5.9% to $77.39.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 5.6% in response and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock dropped 4.7%.
On the flip side, the likes of Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), two of the biggest winners of the pandemic, were trading higher in Friday’s premarket as the emergence of the new Covid variant raised fears that countries could bring back restrictions on movement of people.
Elsewhere, Didi (NYSE:DIDI) stock will be in the spotlight after authorities in China asked the ride-hailing firm to delist from the NYSE because of security fears, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sold more shares of the electric car manufacturer.
Investors will also be looking at the retail sector, after a volatile week, with Friday marking the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season. 
A number of retailers saw their stocks plunge this week, including Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), after warning of inventory shortages and supply chain constraints in their third quarter earnings reports.
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.6% to $1,812.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.7% higher at 1.1282.

Investing.com – Shares of Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), two of the biggest winners of the pandemic, were trading higher in Friday’s premarket as emergence of a new variant of the Covid-19 virus in South Africa raised fears that countries could bring back restrictions on movement of people.
Zoom stock traded 9% higher while Peloton was up 7%, riding on fear and hope that individuals may again be hesitant to step out and prefer using home-based systems to communicate and exercise, respectively.
Companies, which were considering reopening their offices, may have a re-think, and continue to let their staff work from home for longer, using services like Zoom for communication purposes.
Zoom and Peloton were big early beneficiaries of the shift the pandemic brought, but the shares have given up most of their gains as the economy has reopened – Zoom has lost around half of its value in last five months while Peloton trades at around a third of its peak price. Fresh fears over the virus has breathed life into the two stocks, at least for now.
Markets have anyway been nervous as the virus made a comeback in Europe and some states in the U.S. also reported an uptick in cases. Last week, Austria and Slovakia went into a lockdown, while Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is mulling one. It reported some 75,000 new Covid cases on Thursday, a new daily record.

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",Carmakers get inventive as global chip crisis bites,"By Christina Amann
MUNICH (Reuters) - Whether buying computer chips directly from manufacturers, reconfiguring cars, or producing them with parts missing, automakers are having to get creative to cope with the global shortage of semiconductors.
The shortage, due to supply problems and a surge in demand for consumer electricals during the pandemic, has hit the auto industry hard, with millions of vehicles worldwide not being produced because important parts are missing. 
With the problem lasting longer than initially expected, manufacturers including Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have had to rethink production strategies.
Car manufacturers usually buy parts from major suppliers such as Bosch and Continental, which in turn buy from suppliers further down the chain. 
In some cases that has led to a lack of transparency, said Ondrej Burkacky, a senior partner at McKinsey. 
""There was the fallacy of thinking that you had a choice between two suppliers, but the truth is that they both had the chips made in the same foundry,"" he said. 
That is now changing, according to Daimler Purchasing Manager Markus Schäfer. 
The German maker of Mercedes-Benz cars has set up a direct line of communication with all chip suppliers, including wafer producers in Taiwan, he said at the IAA (NYSE:IAA) auto show in September. 
Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess speaks of ""strategic partnerships"" his company has entered into with manufacturers in Asia.
Chip suppliers need to be treated differently given their strategic importance to the industry, said Stefan Bratzel from the Center for Automotive Management. 
""You have seen the problems that arise when you treat the chip companies like other suppliers and stop the calls,"" he said.
McKinsey's Burkacky said carmakers should consider direct investments in production, or longer contracts with terms of more than 18 months. 
""Not much of that has been implemented yet,"" he added. 
'MORE RESILIENT'
In the meantime, vehicle developers are doing their part to help manufacturers manage the supply crunch. 
Annette Danielski, chief financial officer of Volkswagen's trucking unit Traton, said the company was trying to clear some space on the motherboards of control systems. 
""If we change the software, we can use fewer semiconductors and achieve the same functionality,"" she said. ""That sometimes takes a long lead time because the regulatory authorities intervene, but there are areas where you can change something quickly."" 
Daimler relies on new designs for control units. Rather than using one specific chip, these are designed to work with an alternative that can be used in the event of delivery problems, the company's head of purchasing Schäfer said.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is considered the model for this. 
The company reprogrammed software within three months so that other less scarce chips could be used, enabling the U.S. electric carmaker to weather the crisis better than many others.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) has said it will work with chip manufacturers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), STM and Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) to develop microcontrollers that combine several functions previously controlled by individual chips. 
""We are trying to create an ecosystem that is more resilient, more expandable and always available,"" a company spokesperson said.
PRIORITISING
Some carmakers are stockpiling - or what BMW calls ""hole shoring."" 
The whole car is built except for a missing part, and can then be completed relatively easily when it shows up. 
Other automakers are also using this strategy. Sometimes vehicles are delivered without certain functions controlled by chips.
Semiconductors are also conserved for high-quality vehicles, like electric cars, while customers face even longer wait times for low-priced combustion engines. 
That strategy is slowly reaching its limits. Volkswagen recently had to temporarily stop the production of electric cars in its Zwickau plant in Germany.

How well these coping strategies work is not yet clear. 
""The bill will be presented in mid or late 2022, when you can see who came out of the crisis well and who did not make it so well,"" said McKinsey's Burkacky.

""With a takeover premium of 30-40%, depending on the reference point, we have presented a very attractive offer,"" Christian Dahlheim, Volkswagen's head of group sales and one of the main architects of the deal, told Reuters.
Volkswagen, along with asset manager Attestor Limited and Dutch mobility group Pon Holdings BV, is offering 0.50 euro per share in Europcar, which could be topped up by 0.01 euro per share if 90% of shareholders take up the bid.
Shares in Europcar currently trade at 0.508 euros apiece.
Under the offer, first announced in July and launched on Friday, Europcar investors have at least until Dec. 30 to tender their shares.
Investors representing 68% of Europcar's shares have already agreed to tender their stock, which would give the consortium control over the car rental group under French takeover laws.
""We will enter the mobility sector in the short-term. The acquisition of Europcar is clearly our preferred option,"" Dahlheim said.
The consortium, Green Mobility Holding, is still targeting a squeeze-out to faster implement its strategic plans for the company, he said.
It plans to capitalise on Europcar's vast international network in more than 140 countries, including a fleet of around 350,000 vehicles, as a way to sell lucrative mobility services.
""We are buying Europcar because we believe that we can develop it towards a good basis for an expanded mobility offer,"" Dahlheim said, adding he expected European antitrust authorities to approve the transaction at the beginning of next year.

Investments for future growth will be funded from Europcar's cash flows, Dahlheim said.

1144,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 05:54AM ET</span>",New Variant Puts South Africa at Risk of Global Shut Out,"(Bloomberg) -- South Africa’s recovery from its deepest economic contraction in almost three decades risks being derailed by the identification of a new coronavirus variant that prompted several European nations to ban travel to and from the country right before its summer holiday season.   
The restrictions deal another blow to South Africa’s battered tourism industry, which buckled under the weight of border shutdowns and stop-start domestic lockdowns over the past year and a half.
“This will be a significant setback to South Africa’s already vulnerable tourism sector, which was preparing to see an influx of offshore visitors, armed with hard currency, over the festive season,” said Siobhan Redford, an economist at FirstRand Group Ltd.’s Rand Merchant bank. 
The U.K., which accounts for the largest share of overseas tourists to South Africa, has already announced a temporary ban on flights to the country and five of its neighbors over concerns about the new discovery, called B.1.1.529 until a Greek letter is assigned to it by the World Health Organization. 
The move drew ire from South African officials as scientists are still trying to determine whether the new variant is more transmissible or more lethal than previous ones. Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor said the decision was rushed, while Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said she plans to discuss the flight bans with officials attending the World Tourism Organization’s general assembly in Madrid next week. 
“We need to see this as a global issue, pretty much like climate change itself, and that these variants are going to spread,” Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday. “I’m certain in the next 10 days or so there will be more clarity after a bit more work” has been done on what impact the virus will have and how transmissible it is, he said. 
Travel and tourism contributed 7% to South Africa’s gross domestic product in pre-pandemic times, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. While that’s below the global average, it nevertheless accounted for almost 1.5 million jobs in a country with an unemployment rate of 34.4% -- the highest of 82 countries tracked by Bloomberg.
South Africa is currently on the lowest level of lockdown measures, but the new variant has prompted the so-called coronavirus command council and cabinet to call a meeting for the weekend. President Cyril Ramaphosa could impose stricter domestic curbs, including a ban on the sale of alcohol, to spare health centers from the burden of drink-related accidents and violence, in the coming days. "

South Africa’s government said Thursday it is considering new restrictions to contain the new variant, dubbed B. 1.1.529.
The signals from South Africa come at a time when many countries in Europe, the other side of the most lucrative transatlantic route, are considering reimposing lockdowns as Covid-19 cases surge again.
Austria and Slovakia are currently in lockdown while Germany is still considering one even as reports say the new incoming coalition government in the country is resisting a lockdown for now. Europe’s largest economy reported as many as 75,000 new Covid cases Thursday."

Investing.com – ADRs of Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) plunged more than 7% in Friday’s premarket trading as authorities in China asked the ride-hailing firm to delist from the NYSE because of security fears.
The Cyberspace Administration of China, the agency responsible for data security in the country, has directed Didi to work out precise details, subject to government approval, according to a Bloomberg report.
Proposals under consideration include a private buyout by core shareholders or a share float in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the U.S., the report said.
The delisting is likely to happen at Didi’s IPO issue price of $14 though there is no final word yet on the plans, according to Bloomberg's sources.
Didi debuted on the NYSE on June 30, and barring a brief period, has traded below its issue price of $14. The stock closed at $8.11 Wednesday. Markets were shut Thursday on account of Thanksgiving.
The company invited the wrath of Chinese authorities by ignoring their advice to delay its IPO, pending a full security review of its data handling practices.
Authorities in China have been concerned about its data-rich companies listed in the U.S. given the latter has strict norms on data disclosure to protect interests of investors, a policy that experts in China think runs counter to their interests since the data is extensive and belongs to their citizens.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",China Evergrande soccer stadium taken over by government -source,"HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - A government body has taken over China Evergrande Group's soccer stadium with a view to selling it, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, as the debt-laden property developer scrambles to meet liabilities.
Evergrande, which has been struggling to meet repayments on over $300 billion in debt, is also considering selling money-losing Guangzhou Football Club, the person said.
Construction on the 12 billion yuan ($1.86 billion) Guangzhou Evergrande Football Stadium began in April last year for completion by the end of 2022, when it was set to be the world's largest soccer venue by capacity.
However, Evergrande has halted construction due to lack of capital and ceded control to authorities which plan to sell the stadium, or - in the absence of buyers - acquire it via state-owned Guangzhou City Construction Investment Group, the person said, declining to be identified as the matter is not public.
Another person familiar with the matter said construction had stopped for at least three months.
Evergrande declined to comment. In September, it said work on the stadium was proceeding ""as normal"".
The Guangzhou city government did not answer Reuters' calls. Guangzhou City Construction Investment did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
TENTERHOOKS
Evergrande was once China's top-selling property developer but is now struggling to repay creditors and suppliers. Local governments across China are steering sales of some of its assets, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.
Evergrande's troubles in meeting offshore bond repayments rattled markets and upended the broader property sector with a string of developer defaults and credit-rating downgrades.
It pulled back from the brink of default in the past month, leaving investors on tenterhooks as they wait to see whether it can meet obligations to pay an overdue coupon worth $82.5 million before a 30-day grace period expires on Dec. 6. 
EXIT
Evergrande bought control of Guangzhou FC for 100 million yuan in 2010, and saw its value hover at 19 billion yuan before its delisting in March. However, the club has suffered high-profile exits against the backdrop of its owner's financial woe.
In September, the eight-times Chinese Super League champions said head coach Fabio Cannavaro https://www.reuters.com/world/china/coach-cannavaro-leaves-chinas-guangzhou-by-mutual-consent-2021-09-28 had left by mutual consent. Brazil-born forward Ricardo Goulart https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/goulart-quits-guangzhou-fc-returns-brazil-2021-11-13, who took Chinese citizenship to help China reach the World Cup, terminated his contract with the club, Reuters reported this month.
Since August, an Evergrande-owned soccer school has laid off over 100 staff due to liquidity constraints, said a person close to the school and a person with direct knowledge of the lay-off situation. Both declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the matter.
Foreign coaches and translators have been asked to leave, the second person said, adding that the school had about 2 billion yuan in liabilities at the end of December 2020.

It is unclear how many people the school employed before or after the redundancies. A person close to Evergrande said the school was operating as normal.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded nearly 4% lower in Friday’s premarket as it attempted to absorb impact of another sale of shares by the company’s Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.
The billionaire offloaded 934,091 more shares for $1.05 billion in the latest exercise, according to regulatory filings posted late Tuesday, bringing his sale of the company’s equity to 9.2 million and worth about $9.9 billion.
The sales happened after Musk exercised his option to buy 2.15 million shares of the company. Tesla’s outstanding equity base comprises 1 billion shares.
The maverick CEO has sold Tesla shares in several tranches since he conducted a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll November 7 asking whether he should sell 10% of his holding. The latest sales imply that Musk has crossed the halfway mark of his plan to sell 10% of his stake in the company.
While Musk made it look like he would be directed by popular opinion – which eventually favored him selling the stake – he needed money to pay a large tax bill on his newly acquired Tesla stock. Most likely, he will be left with a surplus after paying his taxes.
To reach the 10% threshold that he mentioned in his Tweet, Musk would need to sell some 17 million shares, or about 1.7% of the company’s outstanding stock. If his exercisable options are factored into his overall ownership, he’ll need to sell even more, according to Bloomberg.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 04:11AM ET</span>",Locked in: Hong Kong COVID rules take mental toll on Cathay pilots,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) -One of Asia's largest airlines, Cathay Pacific, is facing a revolt from pilots who say Hong Kong's tough quarantine rules under its zero-COVID policies are endangering their mental health, leading to rising stress and resignations.
Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd last week fired https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/cathay-pacific-fires-3-pilots-infected-with-covid-19-layover-scmp-2021-11-18 three pilots who breached company rules by leaving their hotel rooms during a layover in Frankfurt and later tested positive for COVID-19.
The government responded by forcing more than 270 people, including school children linked to their families, into tiny quarters at a state quarantine camp https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-hongkong-families-idUSKBN2B711T. 
Some pilots declared themselves unfit to fly https://www.instagram.com/p/CWr6BPRh8N9 for their first rostered duties upon release.
The extreme example of pandemic-related precautions under China's zero-COVID policy highlights the difficult working conditions facing Cathay pilots, all fully vaccinated, even as other Asian countries slowly reopen.
Cathay rivals including Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd have begun unwinding strict layover policies but the Hong Kong government is tightening rules further in line with the mainland, hoping to convince Beijing to allow cross-border travel.
The stricter rules come amid mounting concerns over a newly identified variant spreading in South Africa, which has been also found in Hong Kong and Botswana and prompted several countries to announce tighter broder controls and more rigorous testing.
    ""I don't think I can keep this up,"" one Cathay pilot who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters. ""Just the stress of potential quarantine of my family and friends is taking a toll.""
Several other current and recently departed Cathay pilots told Reuters morale was low and resignations were rising a year after many had their pay permanently cut https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cathay-pacific-layoffs-idUSKBN2780L0 by as much as 58%. 
Extreme stress is a significant issue in an industry where any sign of psychological problems can make it difficult to get another job.
""What's the risk if I say to them I'm a bit stressed?"" asked a pilot who has spent more than 200 nights locked in hotel rooms away from Hong Kong since the pandemic began. ""Does that affect my medical? And then you leave here and they ask have you ever been stood down for psychological reasons?""
The pilots also expressed frustration with the ambiguity of some government-imposed pandemic-related rules. Pilots, for example, are required to avoid ""unnecessary social contact"" for three weeks after returning to Hong Kong, but they are not given time off to compensate. 
Cathay acknowledged to Reuters in a statement that pilot resignations have risen beyond normal levels since the end of October.
""Regrettably, the incident in Frankfurt has affected current sentiment,"" the airline said.
TOUGH ROSTERS
Hong Kong classifies many destinations including the United States and Britain as ""high-risk,"" meaning Cathay pilots flying passengers inbound from those places are subject to two weeks of hotel quarantine.
To staff those flights, Cathay started running ""closed-loop"" rosters on a voluntary basis in February involving five consecutive weeks locked in hotel rooms with no access to fresh air or a gym and then two weeks off at home.
""I did it to earn some money, since the 50% pay cut (last year) made life much more difficult,"" said a recently departed pilot who did two closed loops. ""There are people currently in their 5th or 6th closed loop.""
Cathay said on Thursday some inbound flights during the peak demand season of December would be cancelled, indicating a lack of volunteers. 
The airline said it recognised the strain on its pilots and had bi-weekly dial-in sessions to share concerns and programmes like a peer-based pilot assistance network as well as offering extended leaves of absence. 
LEAVING HONG KONG
As conditions improve elsewhere in the world, other airlines including Emirates and U.S. cargo carrier Atlas Air (NASDAQ:AAWW) Worldwide Holdings Inc are head-hunting Cathay pilots, said those who spoke with Reuters. 
Emirates, which has launched a recruitment drive for 600 pilots, declined to comment. Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) did not respond to a request for comment. 
The pilots Reuters spoke to said they expected more resignations next year when transitional housing and schooling benefits expired.
Cathay said it would employ ""several hundred"" new pilots and restart its cadet programme in the coming year.

Hong Kong's strict rules led FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) to close its pilot base in the city last week, underscoring the dimming allure of the territory as a major logistics hub.
""I really, truly feel for people that are at Cathay,"" a FedEx pilot who recently left Hong Kong said. ""I am genuinely concerned about their mental health and how they are.""

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 03:56AM ET</span>",Hong Kong firms scoop up properties from Chinese developers in distress,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - After years of expansion in Hong Kong, cash-strapped Chinese developers are reducing their presence in one of the world's most expensive property markets, allowing firms in the financial hub to scoop up some of their assets at distressed prices.
Developers including China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd, struggling under billions of dollars in debt, have sold some assets in recent months to Hong Kong developers to help ease liquidity stress back home.
There's more to come - Aoyuan Group, which this week extended the redemption date of onshore asset-backed securities, is trying to offload more Hong Kong properties to raise capital, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Aoyuan is planning to sell a redeveloped office building in Kwai Chung in eastern Hong Kong, and the bidders will likely be local investors or family offices, said the sources, declining to be named as the information is confidential. 
The deal is expected to be sold at less than what Aoyuan paid for it, the sources added. Aoyuan bought the building for HK$950 million ($121.83 million) in 2018, and property agents estimate its current valuation at less than HK$800 million.
This will follow a deal in mid-November, when Aoyuan sold some assets in a residential development in the Mid-Levels to a Hong Kong investor at a loss of HK$177 million.
Aoyuan could not be reached for comment via its officially-listed email and calls to the company went unanswered.
The trend will help Hong Kong property tycoons to further boost their dominance in the Chinese-controlled territory.
Once deep-pocketed Chinese developers had moved aggressively into Hong Kong, outbidding their cross-border rivals for prime sites in the city as they searched for investment opportunities outside the mainland.
But now those developers are facing an unprecedented cash crunch due to regulatory curbs as Beijing tries to reduce leverage in the sector, causing some to miss bond and wealth management product payments.
Some builders have resorted to selling their assets to meet near-term repayment obligations.
TREND REVERSAL
""It's a reversal of the trend,"" said Reeves Yan, CBRE head of capital markets in Hong Kong. ""Chinese developers with liquidity crunch are now selling, and it is expected that there will be more selling in the next few months (in Hong Kong).""
Kaisa, which missed coupon payments totalling $88.4 million due earlier this month, sold a residential land parcel in Kai Tak, where Hong Kong's old airport was situated, to local peers Far East Consortium and New World Development on Wednesday for a consideration of HK$7.9 billion, a stock exchange filing said.
It recently sold another parcel in Tuen Mun in northern Hong Kong to local investor Francis Choi for HK$3.78 billion, Reuters reported this week. The sale helped Kaisa recover around HK$1.3 billion cash after repaying the loans it borrowed for the land. 
Kaisa declined to comment.
Evergrande, which is grappling with more than $300 billion in liabilities, has transferred unsold units worth HK$2 billion in a residential development to its joint-venture partner VMS Group, a Hong Kong financial company, a separate source told Reuters.
Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment.
So far this year, taking into account only government land sales and not private ones between developers, only one Chinese property firm was involved in a land purchase worth HK$7.3 billion, which it jointly invested in with four Hong Kong peers.
That compared with a total of HK$39 billion spent last year and a record of HK$58 billion in 2017, according to data compiled by CBRE.
Some financially stronger Chinese developers are, however, still active in the market, sector observers said. 

In the city's last residential land auction in October, state-owned China Overseas Land was the only Chinese company among the sixteen bidders, though it did not win. 
""The state-owned developers are still cash-rich, but the property market will be led more by Hong Kong investors going forward,"" said Tom Ko, Cushman & Wakefield (NYSE:CWK)'s Hong Kong capital markets executive director.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Tata group is in talks with three states to invest up to $300 million to set up a semiconductor assembly and test unit, two sources familiar with the matter said, as part of the conglomerate's push into high-tech manufacturing.
Tata is talking to the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana and scouting for land for the outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) plant, the sources said, declining to be identified as the matter is not public.
While Tata has previously said it would likely enter the semiconductor business, this is the first time news about the group's foray into the sector and its scale has been reported.
An OSAT plant packages, assembles and tests foundry-made silicon wafers, turning them into finished semiconductor chips.
Tata has looked at some potential locations for the factory, one of the sources said, adding a venue was likely to be finalised by next month.
""While they (Tata) are very strong on the software side of things ... hardware is something they want to add to their portfolio, which is very critical for long-term growth,"" the source said.
Tata group and the three states did not respond to requests for comment.
Tata's push will bolster Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' drive for electronics manufacturing, which has already helped turn the South Asian nation into the world's second-biggest maker of smartphones.
The Tata group, which controls India's top software services exporter Tata Consultancy Services and has interests in everything from autos to aviation, plans to invest in high-end electronics and digital businesses, its Chairman N. Chandrasekaran has previously said.
Potential clients of Tata's OSAT business include companies such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and STMicroelectronics.
The factory is expected to start operations late next year and could employ up to 4,000 workers, the source said, adding availability of skilled labour at the right cost was key to the long-term viability of the project. 

""Once Tata starts, the ecosystem will come around ... So it's very critical to find the right place from a labour standpoint,"" the source said.
Separately, Tata is already building a high-tech electronics manufacturing facility in southern Tamil Nadu state.

Investing.com - European stock markets slumped Friday, with the travel sector hit hard, on concerns a new Covid variant will prompt fresh mobility restrictions, hindering the region’s economic recovery.
At 3:20 AM ET (0820 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 3.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France also fell 4.4% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 3.4%.
Virus cases have soared in Europe in the last month, with a number of countries introducing stricter Covid measures. But a degree of urgency was added to the situation by the announcement late Thursday by the World Health Organization that it’s monitoring a new Covid-19 variant with “a large number of mutations”, detected mainly in southern Africa.
The United Nations agency is set to hold a special meeting later Friday to discuss the implications for vaccines and treatments given the degree of mutation from the original strain. Ahead of that, the U.K. has already announced a temporary flight ban from a number of southern African countries and put travelers from the region into quarantine.
This news knocked the region’s travel sector very hard, with a number of the airline stocks falling to their lows for the year. Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock fell 12%, Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock slumped 13%, easyJet (LON:EZJ) stock fell 16%, as did the stock of IAG (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways. Travel agency Tui (DE:TUIGn) also weakened dramatically, with its stock falling 10%.
""We still don't know how infectious the virus is ... it's a general uncertainty. Markets are anticipating the risk here of another global wave of infections if vaccines are ineffective,” Reuters reported Moh Siong Sim, an analyst with the Bank of Singapore, as saying. ""Reopening hopes could be dashed.""
Elsewhere,  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) stock rose 1.5%, bucking the overall negative tone, after Bloomberg reported that private equity giants KKR and CVC are considering joining together on a bid for the Italian telecommunications giant.
KKR indicated its interest last weekend, but Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), Telecom Italia’s largest shareholder, dismissed the offer as not representing value.
Wall Street was closed Thursday for Thanksgiving, and will close early on Friday in a shortened session. Ahead of that U.S. stock futures point to a sharply lower open, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average contract over 600 points lower.
Crude prices slumped Friday as the announcement of a new Covid-19 strain raised concerns about demand just as a U.S.-led coalition of major consumers is adding output to the global supply.
Worries are growing that this will result in a global supply surplus in the first quarter, and brings next week’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and allies, a group known as OPEC+, firmly into focus
The group is to decide whether it will continue raising output by 400,000 barrels per day in January, or to hold back supply.
By 3:20 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 5.7% lower at $73.95 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 4.7% to $78.35.
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.4% to $1,808.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.5% higher at 1.1267.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 03:11AM ET</span>",Japan to supplement military spending in rush to bolster air and sea defences,"By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan plans to add $6.75 billion to its already record annual military spending in a rush to bolster air and maritime defences as it becomes more concerned about threats posed by China and North Korea.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government on Friday approved the outlay as part of a supplementary budget. While such additions to defence spending are common, the 774 billion yen that lawmakers will be asked to approve is the largest amount ever, according to Japan's Ministry of Defence.
""As the security environment around Japan worsens at unprecedented speed, our urgent task is to accelerate the implementation of various projects,"" the defence ministry said in its spending proposal. 
The cash injection will let Japan, three months earlier than planned, upgrade surface to air missile launchers on islands at the edge of the East China Sea and Patriot PAC-3 missile batteries elsewhere that are the last line of defence against any incoming North Korean warheads. 
China's increasing pressure on Taiwan is causing jitters in Japan because Beijing's control of the island would bring Chinese forces within around 100 kilometres (62 miles) of its territory and would threaten key maritime trade routes that supply Japan with oil and other goods. It would also provide China with bases for unfettered access to the western Pacific.
The extra spending will also let Japan more quickly acquire anti-submarine missiles, maritime patrol planes and military cargo jets, the defence ministry said.
The additional military outlay comes after Kishida's ruling party in October included a goal of almost doubling defence spending to 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in election pledges.
For decades the pacifist nation has stuck to a policy of keeping defence spending within 1% of GDP, easing concern both at home and overseas about any revival of the militarism that led Japan into World War Two.
The additional spending plan approved by Kishida's government on Friday also includes pre-payments to defence contractors for equipment to help them deal with coronavirus pandemic disruptions that have hurt their finances.

The proposed supplemental spending combined with defence outlays approved for the year to March 31 comes to about 1.3% of Japan's GDP.

1155,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2021 02:55AM ET</span>",Marketmind: It's looking like a Black Friday,"(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead from Dhara Ranasinghe. 
COVID-19, a worry that investors had pushed down their list of top concerns in recent months, has soared back up to the number one spot as a new variant spreads across South Africa. 
Asia stocks outside Japan slid over 2%, Europe and U.S. stock futures are down sharply, oil prices drops almost 3.5%, the safe-haven yen is up around three-quarters of a percent, and U.S. Treasury yields are down almost 10 basis points. 
Thin liquidity following Thursday's U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday likely exacerbates price moves for sure, but there's little doubt overnight headlines have taken markets by surprise on Friday.
Little is known of the variant, detected in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong, but scientists reckon it has an unusual combination of mutations and may be able to evade immune responses or make it more transmissible.
The news comes as Europe already battles a resurgent COVID-19 outbreak, triggering fresh restrictions that raise uncertainty over the near-term economic outlook.
That poses a fresh challenge for central banks such as the European Central Bank, which has just started to acknowledge that a push in inflation is lasting longer than anticipated.
And on top of the latest COVID headlines, there are other reasons for unease, some warn -- the general lift up in Fed rate hike expectations, Ukraine/Russia tensions that has broader geopolitical ramifications and a property-led slowdown in China. 
In emerging markets, the spotlight passes from Turkey to South Africa for now as the rand breaches the 16.00 level to the dollar for the first time this year. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday: 
- ECB speakers: ECB President Christine Lagarde

1161,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 25, 2021 09:36PM ET</span>",China Asks Didi to Delist From U.S. On Security Fears,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese regulators have asked Didi Global Inc.’s top executives to devise a plan to delist from U.S. bourses, people familiar with the matter said, an unprecedented request that’s likely to revive fears about Beijing’s intentions for its giant tech industry.
The country’s tech watchdog wants management to take the company off the New York Stock Exchange because of concerns about leakage of sensitive data, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the agency responsible for data security in the country, has directed Didi to work out precise details, subject to government approval, they said. 
Proposals under consideration include a straight-up privatization or a share float in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the U.S., the people added. If the privatization proceeds, the proposal will likely be at least the $14 IPO price since a lower offer so soon after the June initial public offering could prompt lawsuits or shareholder resistance, the people said. If there is a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the IPO price would probably be a discount to the share price in the U.S., $8.11 as of Wednesday’s close. 
Shares in SoftBank Group Corp., Didi’s biggest minority shareholder, slid more than 5% in Tokyo.
Deliberations continue and it’s possible regulators will backtrack on their request, the people said. Either option would deal a severe blow to a ride-hailing giant that pulled off the largest U.S. IPO by a Chinese firm since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s in 2014. Representatives for Didi and the CAC didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Didi sparked the ire of Beijing when it proceeded with its New York stock offering this summer, despite regulatory requests that it ensure the security of its data before the IPO. Chinese regulators quickly launched multiple investigations into the company and have considered a range of unprecedented penalties, Bloomberg News reported in July. 
It’s possible that the delisting would be part of a package of punishments for Didi. Beijing’s municipal government has proposed an investment in the company that would give state-run firms effective control, Bloomberg News reported in September. Such an investment could help Didi finance the repurchase of its U.S.-traded shares. 
Didi is currently controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu, which received aggregate voting power of 58% after the company’s U.S. initial public offering. SoftBank and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. are Didi’s biggest minority shareholders.
Even if Didi shifts its listing to Hong Kong, it will have to address the data security concerns that have drawn regulatory scrutiny. The company may have to give up control of its data to a third-party -- again undercutting its price tag.
 
Regulators have weighed a delisting for Didi since the summer, after the world’s largest ride-hailing company infuriated officials by ploughing ahead with its U.S. IPO, Bloomberg News has reported. A withdrawal from U.S. bourses could stoke fears of an exodus of Chinese firms as Washington and Beijing quarrel about access to listed firms’ books. On Thursday, a senior Chinese regulatory official said such delistings would be a setback for relations with the U.S., while offering broad support for Hong Kong as an alternative venue.
Didi -- once feted for defeating Uber in China -- has now become a test case for a broader Chinese government effort to curb the power of internet titans. Xi Jinping’s administration, keen to promote his vision of sharing the wealth or “common prosperity,” has targeted an internet sector that’s accumulated vast wealth by operating on the periphery of the law, minted an unprecedented number of billionaires and enriched local and foreign investors in the process.
A state-directed privatization would be unprecedented for a private firm of Didi’s stature, affirming that the Chinese government remains bent on curtailing the power of the country’s internet firms and unlocking the data and wealth hoarded during a decade of heady expansion. It would send a chilling signal to American investors, long accustomed to investing freely in China’s largest corporations from Alibaba to Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. 
Beijing’s moves against Didi have been particularly harsh, even after a crackdown that has penalized giants like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. The Cyberspace Administration of China saw Didi’s IPO decision as a challenge to the central government’s authority, which led to the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and several other agencies initiating on-site inspections at Didi’s offices in July.
It’s since been ensnared by probes into data security and the way it treats its millions of drivers. Many of the options Beijing is weighing involve re-asserting state control over a company that’s traditionally operated in a legal gray zone, Bloomberg News has reported.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, ending the week on a down note over the discovery of a new coronavirus strain.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 tumbled 2.35% by 9:13 PM ET (2:13 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.79%. The Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.3% year-on-year, while the Tokyo Ex Food and Energy CPI recorded 0% growth month-on-month, in November.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 1.28%, with retail sales growing a better-than-expected 4.9% month-on-month in October.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 1.89%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.30% while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.06%.
The World Health Organization and scientists are studying the variant, which was detected in South Africa, and is described as very different from previous versions. The U.K. has temporarily banned flights from South Africa and five other African countries, while Hong Kong has already confirmed two cases of the variant.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to around 1.60%, while South Africa’s rand weakened beyond 16 per dollar for the first time in a year.
""The trigger was news of this COVID variant...and the uncertainty as to what this means. You shoot first and ask questions later when this sort of news erupts,"" National Australia Bank head of FX strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
However, other investors remained optimistic.
The variant is “a scary headline” that could have caused a knee-jerk reaction, IG Markets Ltd. analyst Kyle Rodda told Bloomberg.
“North America off the desks [for a holiday on Thursday] means there’s a wall of buyers missing” and thinner markets make for more pronounced moves, he added.
The detection of the strain, currently named B.1.1.529, comes as central banks signal tighter monetary policy to curb persistently high inflation. The Fed could tighten its policy faster than previously anticipated, including doubling the pace at which it tapers bond purchases to $30 billion a month from January 2022 and hiking interest rates from near zero in June, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc..
“The increased openness to accelerating the taper pace likely reflects both somewhat higher-than-expected inflation over the last two months and greater comfort among Fed officials that a faster pace would not shock financial markets,” Goldman analysts said in a note.
Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s aggregate index of eight early indicators showed that the Chinese economic recovery from COVID-19 continued to slow in November, with car and homes sales continuing to drop as a housing market crisis lingers."
1163,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2021 08:16PM ET</span>","Micron, UMC to withdraw IP complaints against each other","(Reuters) -U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and Taiwanese peer United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) have agreed to withdraw complaints against each other following a years-long legal dispute over intellectual property (IP).
UMC will make a onetime payment to Micron of an undisclosed amount, the pair also said in separate statements on Thursday, without elaborating on reasons for their withdrawal agreement.
Micron had accused UMC of misappropriating trade secrets and passing them to a Chinese state-backed firm. UMC had alleged patent infringement by two of Micron's China-based subsidiaries.
Their agreement to withdraw the complaints comes amid broader concerns from the U.S. government about technology theft, particularly in relation to China.
Last year, the United States fined UMC $60 million after the Taiwanese firm pled guilty to stealing Micron designs and sharing them with China's state-backed Fujian Jinhua, which is building a memory chip manufacturing plant.
UMC at the time said management was unaware of unauthorised actions of three employees who had previously worked for Micron.
As part of the guilty plea, the U.S. Department of Justice dismissed other allegations against UMC, including conspiracy to commit economic espionage.

The United States also indicted Fujian Jinhua for allegedly using the trade secrets in its chip designs. Fujian Jinhua has denied wrongdoing.
In late 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce added Fujian Jinhua to its so-called entity list, in effect barring U.S. companies doing business with it. The Chinese firm has since halted chip production plans, analysts have said.

(Reuters) - Millions of Americans got COVID-19 booster shots at a near record pace after the Biden administration expanded eligibility last week, but health officials concerned about climbing infections ahead of the winter holiday season urged more to get the additional protection.
About 37.5 million people had received a booster shot in the United States as of Tuesday, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
""I think it is a good start,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a leading infectious disease expert from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who added that he believed boosters are more important for personal protection than for curtailing spread of the virus.
""I am hoping for much better. I would like to see all of that doubled very, very quickly,"" he said of booster uptake.
U.S. regulators expanded eligibility for vaccine booster shots to all adults, allowing millions more Americans to get additional the protection amid a recent rise in infections, including among the fully vaccinated. 
Previously, people age 65 and older and those at high risk of infection due to underlying health or employment conditions were eligible for the extra shots.
Just over six million people got an additional dose of one of the three approved COVID-19 vaccines last week, CDC data shows, the highest weekly total since boosters were first authorized, and an increase of over 15% from the previous week.
Over 130 million fully vaccinated adults in the United States are now eligible for the shots, at least six months after the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines or two months after receiving Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-dose vaccine.
More than a quarter of those now eligible have received boosters. Some experts felt previous booster shot eligibility requirements were too complicated and may have discouraged people from getting them, or that previous evidence for the extra shots was lacking.
""There is much better justification for boosters now than when the White House first promoted the idea (in August). They did create some mixed messages,"" said Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""We are in a better place now.""
WANING IMMUNITY
Public officials, including CDC Director Rochelle Walensky and top infection disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, have for weeks been urging more Americans to opt for additional protection as they prepare to travel and gather with friends and family for this week's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. 
After about two months of declining infections, the United States has reported daily increases for the past two weeks, driven by the more easily transmitted Delta variant of the virus and people spending more time indoors due to colder weather.
""We'd like to get as many people who were originally vaccinated with the first regimen boosted,"" Fauci said https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/fauci-says-vast-majority-vaccinated-americans-should-get-covid-19-booster-2021-11-23 on Tuesday in an interview for the upcoming Reuters Next conference.
He said the ""overwhelming majority"" of Americans who have been fully vaccinated should now receive a COVID-19 booster shot based on data showing they provide ""substantial"" protection beyond what is seen from the original inoculation.
Regulators backed the additional doses out of concerns over data showing immunity generated by the first shots wanes over time. Studies have shown that booster doses generate higher neutralizing antibody levels on average than the initial inoculations, and data from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) suggests they can significantly reduce infections.
Some scientists believe boosters are unnecessary for many healthy adults, arguing that vaccinating the unvaccinated should be the priority.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against countries making boosters available until more people around the world have received their primary doses.
But on Tuesday, the WHO's Regional Director for Europe, Hans Kluge, urged Europeans to get booster doses if offered in the face of surging cases. The WHO said there could be a further 700,000 deaths by March if action is not taken.

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Banco Inter SA shareholders have approved the transfer of its listing from Brazilian stock exchange B3 to the U.S.-based Nasdaq, the Brazilian bank said in a securities filing on Thursday.
Banco Inter shareholders now will be able to cash out their stakes or receive Brazilian Depositary Receipts that may be converted into Class A shares traded on the Nasdaq. The deadline for choosing to convert or cash out is Dec. 2, Banco Inter Chief Financial Officer Helena Caldeira said.
In an interview with Reuters, Caldeira said the bank expects shareholders will demand to cash out less than 2 billion reais ($359.30 million) worth of Banco Inter units. If the amount is higher, the bank has the right to review the transaction and potentially lower the cash-out price. 
Banco Inter will pay 45.84 reais for each unit that its shareholders decide to cash out, a 22% premium over the closing price on Thursday. 
The bank decided to move its main listing venue to the United States to have ""more access to global capital markets and potentially a larger and more diverse investor base,"" it said in an earlier statement on Thursday.
The Nasdaq listing is expected to be effective on Dec. 28, Caldeira added.

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2021 05:57PM ET</span>",U.S. Thanksgiving air travel set to be busiest since pandemic began,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Airports and commercial airlines across the United States registered one of their busiest days since before the pandemic on Wednesday as millions of Americans traveled to visit loved ones for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Thanksgiving-eve usually tends to be the busiest day for travel. This year, however, working from home allowed many people to travel early and avoid the last day rush.
""So far, so good,"" said Lani Emanuel, who was traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle to see her daughter. ""It was a little tricky finding parking, but it doesn't seem too crazy busy just yet.""
At Newark Airport, too, passengers did not have to wait long to pass through the security checkpoints. Some of the restaurants at the airport were not packed, either.
Yet, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) advised passengers to arrive early to allow extra time for security. U.S. carriers also ramped up capacity, anticipating higher demand on Thanksgiving-eve, data from Cirium showed.
Thanksgiving marks the beginning of what was shaping up as the busiest holiday season in two years. Rising COVID-19 vaccination rates have made people more confident about travel, leading to a surge in bookings.
U.S. consumers also enter the holiday season flush with spending power, thanks to a still-hefty pile of leftover savings from multiple rounds of government pandemic relief and now double-digit year-over-year wage increases as businesses compete for scarce workers. (For graphic on spending on food services and accommodations, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/3CLC7m9)
Data out Wednesday showed consumer spending overall grew by a greater-than-expected 1.3% in October. Spending on big-ticket items like automobiles lifted the headline figure, but the data also showed broad-based increases in spending on services like travel and eating out that had been sharply curtailed during much of the COVID-19 pandemic. (For graphic on recreation expenditures, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/3DPgHWx)
Americans shelled out record amounts on recreation, eating out, staying away from home and foreign travel last month. (For graphic on spending on foreign travel, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ZiM7pi)
RAMPING UP STAFFING
The TSA expects to screen about 20 million air passengers during the Thanksgiving travel period, the most since 2019 when nearly 26 million Americans were on the move at that time. On Tuesday, the agency screened about 2.21 million U.S. air passengers, the sixth consecutive day with checkpoint volume topping 2 million.
Lorie Dankers, a TSA spokeswoman, said the agency has hired 6,000 new officers this year and has enough staff to deal with the increase in passenger volumes.
""So staffing, while we are hiring, will not slow people down this holiday season,"" Dankers said. 
The holiday weekend is also a test for carriers after a spate of flight cancellations marred travel over the summer. One in five Americans are concerned about delays and cancellations, an American Pecans/YouGov survey found.
Carriers have ramped up staffing and offered bonuses and other incentives to employees to ensure they have enough resources. 
""We're staffed and ready to get our customers to where they need to go safely, reliably and enjoyably,"" a Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) spokesperson said.
Calm weather expected for Thanksgiving should also help to prevent disruption. 

U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak is also expecting a jump in passenger volumes. A company spokesperson said some trains are already close to full capacity. 
Travel group AAA estimates, in all, 53.4 million people will travel for the Thanksgiving holiday, up 13% from 2020, with air travel recovering to about 91% of pre-pandemic levels.

""Without doubt, today we mark a milestone in our history and this is a golden opportunity to start from scratch, to strengthen teamwork and build the Avianca we all need,"" said the company's chief executive and president, Adrian Neuhauser. 
The airline struggled with a 51-day pilots' strike between September and November 2017, grounding half its fleet and resulting in dozens of pilots being fired, while others resigned or were pensioned off. 
The plan will permit the airline to operate more than 200 direct routes with its fleet of more than 130 aircraft by 2025, it said. 

The pilots who return to Avianca will do so under the same conditions that were agreed with pilots in 2020, while the company plans to start a training program that exceeds the requirements of aeronautical regulations.
Avianca filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after being battered by the coronavirus pandemic. A court in the United States approved the company's restructuring plan in November.

The regulator added https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2021-releases/21-318mr-asic-sues-anz-over-introducer-program-home-loan-referrals that between June 2016 and March 2018, ANZ breached consumer protection credit laws by accepting customer information and documents from introducers and other unlicensed individuals, when this was not allowed.
The Introducer Program is a reward-based program through which businesses and community organisations refer customers and members with home loan needs to ANZ. 
ASIC was concerned that some loans may have been granted by ANZ based on false information, said Deputy Chair Sarah Court, adding that some consumers may have entered into home loans that were beyond their ability to pay.
From 2015 to June 2020, more than 50,000 loans were referred to ANZ through the introducer program, resulting in lending of more than A$18.5 billion, the statement added.
ANZ said in a separate statement that it has co-operated with ASIC during its investigation and has also established a customer remediation program, while ""continuously improving"" its home loan processes and controls.

Scrutiny of Australian lenders and financial institutions has ramped up significantly since a Royal Commission inquiry in 2018 found widespread shortcomings in the sector, forcing companies and regulators to take swift action.
Last month, the country's largest lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) had pleaded guilty to 30 criminal charges for mis-selling consumer credit insurance between 2011 and 2015.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -In a surprise move, Canada has told Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co that its contender for a multi-billion dollar fighter jet contract does not meet the required standard, a defense source said on Thursday.
This means only  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Sweden's Saab AB are left in the race to supply 88 jets. Ottawa says it intends to make a decision next year on a contract that could be worth up to C$19 billion ($15 billion).
Boeing had entered its F-18 Super Hornet. The Canadian Press was the first the report the news.
Defense analysts had been certain Ottawa would exclude Saab's Gripen plane. Unlike Canada, Sweden is neither a member of NATO or NORAD, the North American defense organization.
Canada belongs to the consortium that developed Lockheed Martin's F-35 jet, which defense sources say is the preferred choice of the air force.
The competition is being overseen by the office of Procurement Minister Filomena Tassi, which did not respond to a request for comment.
Lockheed Martin declined to comment. No one at Saab was available for comment. Boeing spokesman Paul Lewis said by email that the company would reserve comment pending official notification from Ottawa.
Boeing clashed with Canada in 2017 after it complained Ottawa was unfairly subsidizing a passenger jet made by Montreal-based rival Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF).
Canada responded by saying it would look less favorably on a fighter jet bid from a company that had harmed national interests, but nonetheless allowed Boeing to take part.
The Liberals took power in 2015 vowing not to buy the F-35 on the grounds that it was too costly, but have since softened their line.

Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for more than a decade to replace its aging F-18 fighters. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 that it would buy 65 F-35 jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews.

The Europe-wide STOXX 600 index rose 0.4%, bouncing off three-week lows hit on Wednesday. Utilities and healthcare stocks, sectors considered as safer bets during times of economic uncertainty, were among top gainers.
Utilities, which led the way, also received a boost from Germany's push to step up climate protection, including a faster expansion of renewables and an accelerated coal exit.
Technology stocks rose 0.6%, their first session of gains in six days, after rising bond yields hit the high-growth sector earlier this week. 
After concerns about faster U.S. rate hikes dented global sentiment, strong economic data helped Wall Street close higher on Wednesday and supported markets across the globe.
The Thanksgiving holiday in the United States kept a lid on activity elsewhere on Thursday.
""European markets have enjoyed a relatively upbeat day today, with the lack of US involvement reducing volatility into the close,"" Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG, wrote in a client note.
Coronavirus infections are breaking records in parts of Europe, prompting new curbs as the continent finds itself at the epicentre of the pandemic once again.
Italy tightened the screws on people unwilling to take an COVID-19 vaccine, while France said that face masks will become compulsory again in many places and notably indoors to help contain a new wave of infections.
""While rising COVID cases remain a key concern for mainland European economies, we have seen the likes of the DAX and CAC both gain ground,"" Mahony added. 
Data earlier showed a weaker-than-expected German economic expansion in the third quarter and tepid consumer sentiment ahead of Christmas shopping season.
Remy Cointreau jumped 13.4% to a record high after it raised its full-year profit outlook as strong demand for its premium cognac drove a stronger-than-expected operating profit in the first half.
Rival  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) gained 2.5%, while London-listed  Diageo  (LON:DGE) climbed 1.0%.
Radiation therapy equipment maker Elekta gained 5.7% after it reported a smaller-than-expected fall in August-October earnings amid a growing need for cancer care and radiotherapy.

Swiss Life gained 3.6% after it said it would launch a new 1 billion Swiss franc ($1.07 billion) buyback and raise its dividend payout ratio.

Following are reactions from companies and business leaders:
CHRISTIAN KLEIN, SAP CEO
""Our country is facing enormous challenges. The pandemic has ruthlessly exposed deficits in many areas and shown that a unified approach is lacking. For Germany to remain economically successful in the long term, rapid and comprehensive digitisation is crucial.""
LUFTHANSA 
""The new German government is focusing on sustainability and climate protection in air transport, but is clearly committed to competition-neutral concepts and is striving for international regulation. That is correct. Because in the globally active air transport sector, regulations that unilaterally burden domestic companies are of no use to the environment.
The coalition agreement sets an important course for future technologies in air transport. It is positive that the funds from the air traffic tax will in future be used to promote sustainable aviation fuels. This is a real contribution to climate protection. In this way, taxes that passengers and companies pay for air transport will be used in a targeted manner for the transformation of the industry.""
BMW
""We welcome the new federal government's clear commitment to accelerate the expansion of charging infrastructure - especially with a focus on the fast charging network. The non-discriminatory access to public charging points and the expansion in advance of demand are the decisive factors for the successful ramp-up of e-mobility and increasing customer acceptance. The commitment to ambitious expansion goals at European level is also an important and correct signal.""
OLA KAELLENIUS, CEO OF DAIMLER:
""When I first glanced through the coalition agreement, I liked the sound of three numbers: 15 million electric cars, 1 million charging points and 80% renewable energy.
These are three specific goals for 2030 that will support the transformation of the automotive industry in this decade. And they correspond to our strategy at Mercedes-Benz. This way even more cars can become electric and electric cars really green. Higher investments, faster approval procedures and a digital awakening in the state, economy and society will also do us good. Ambitious climate protection and improving competitiveness - this combination moves us forward.""

""The stronger climate policy focus of the coalition agreement is important. We welcome that the coalition recognises the great importance of network infrastructure as the backbone of the energy transition - especially with regard to financing and investment conditions.""

Its car sales in China jumped 12% last year to a record 774,000 despite the pandemic, and over 8% growth has been registered this year so far, Hubertus Troska told journalists.
""Everything speaks for the fact that China will be a super market next year as well,"" Troska said.
Daimler's market share of electric vehicle sales is still small in China, Troska said, where it competes with numerous Chinese electric vehicle makers from Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) to Li Auto and Nio (NYSE:NIO) as well as U.S. EV giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
However, most Chinese companies sell in the price range of 35,000 euros ($39,270) or less, Troska said, below Daimler's range.
With the number of Daimler EV models for sale in the country set to grow from one to five next year, Daimler will be able to better establish itself in the higher-priced premium car segment, he said.
Still, demand for fossil-fuel burning cars is likely to last for some time in China, Troska said, pointing to the large swathes of the country outside urban centres where charging infrastructure could be harder to come by.
""It's a huge country, so in my view there will still be internal combustion engine cars in China for some time,"" Troska said.

Daimler has said that all new vehicle platforms from 2025 will be electric, with a view to producing all-electric only by 2030 where market conditions allow.
China, which is the world's largest car market and is responsible for a third of Daimler's revenues, has so far refrained from following Europe in setting dates for bans on production of fossil-fuel emitting cars.

KKR has made a 10.8 billion euro ($12 billion) offer in the midst of a boardroom row between Gubitosi and the former Italian telecoms monopoly's top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY).
Gubitosi said in a letter sent to the board on Thursday that it was time to take action, appoint advisers and make a decision on KKR's offer, the sources told Reuters, confirming an earlier report by Italian news agency Ansa.
""Time-wasting attitudes by the board that could be interpreted as aimed at defending the interests of certain shareholders are to be avoided,"" Gubitosi said in the letter.
""Technically we could be ready for a data room in 48-72 hours,"" he said in the letter, referring to the practice of giving a suitor and its advisers access to a company's books to conduct due diligence during a potential bid.
French media group Vivendi has been pushing for a change at the helm of Italy's biggest telecoms company.
Gubitosi's comments came as auditors and the risk committee at TIM examined the group's financial health after two profit warnings since July which have strengthened Vivendi's hand in demanding a change at the helm.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -A former Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) employee who had filed a whistleblower complaint related to Apple's use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) has inspired draft legislation in Washington state that seeks to restrict companies' use of NDAs in settlements of workplace harassment and discrimination claims.
The measure comes on the heels of similar legislation in California.
Washington state Senator Karen Keiser and Representative Liz Berry, both Democrats, are working on bills in their respective houses, which they plan to introduce in the next legislative session, their offices confirmed this week.
Cher Scarlett, a former Apple employee and Washington resident who has played a leading role in worker activism, said she reached out to Keiser in October to raise awareness about the issue. Chelsey Glasson, a former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) employee who sued for pregnancy discrimination, also wrote the lawmaker. The outreach from both women helped inspire Keiser to pursue the bill, an aide to Keiser said.
""No worker should be silenced from sharing their deeply personal story of harassment or discrimination in the workplace just because they signed an NDA,"" Berry said in a statement.
NDAs are commonplace in the technology industry. Some employees have alleged that tech giants use them to discourage legally protected activities such as discussions of working conditions.
In September, investor Nia Impact Capital filed a shareholder proposal calling for Apple's board to prepare a ""public report assessing the potential risks to the company associated with its use of concealment clauses in the context of harassment, discrimination and other unlawful acts.""
Apple in October filed a response with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission saying it wanted to exclude the proposal because ""the company’s policy is to not use such clauses."" 
After viewing Apple's response, Scarlett said she filed an SEC whistleblower complaint in October alleging that Apple had made false and misleading statements to the regulator. She also shared documents with Nia Impact Capital. 
Scarlett, who left Apple last week, said she decided to go public with that information this week, in violation of the terms of her settlement with Apple. Business Insider first reported details of her story.

Apple declined to comment. The company has previously said it is ""deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace.""
The draft legislation in Washington echoes the Silenced No More Act, signed into law this year in California and co-sponsored by tech whistleblower Ifeoma Ozoma.

LONDON (Reuters) - A tech shares bounce carried European equities higher on Thursday, following similar gains on Wall Street and Asia and helped also by a small pullback in the dollar from a 17-month high.
With U.S. markets closed for Thanksgiving, focus was trained on Europe where a surge in COVID-19 cases is raising the prospect of lockdowns going into the Christmas shopping season. 
Those concerns had knocked the pan-European STOXX 600 index to a three-week low on Wednesday, but it was up almost half a percent as a 1% tech sector gain offset the eighth straight fall in travel and leisure stocks.
""We continue to treat every sell-off as the buy-the-dip opportunity,"" said Marija Veitmane, global markets strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets, adding that firms' earnings were still robust and that borrowing costs were still very low.
An indicator of the bullishness underpinning equity markets can be seen in data. Year-to-date inflows into equity funds have barreled past the $1 trillion mark, more than the combined previous 19 years of flows, according to BofA strategists. 
In the government bond markets, which drive those borrowing costs, there was a small dip in German yields after Social Democrat and former finance minister Olaf Scholz struck a three-way coalition deal on Wednesday that sees him replace Angela Merkel at the helm of Europe's largest economy.
It was the first fall in yields in three days. They have risen sharply again this week as traders have ramped up bets that rising inflation will see the European Central Bank join the U.S. Federal Reserve in hiking interest rates next year. [GVD/EUR] 
""The inflation debate, whether is it temporary or not, is still there,"" said Dirk Schmacher, Head of European Macro Research at Natixis. 
He also flagged the renewed lockdown in Austria and the fast rising COVID-19 case numbers in parts of Germany and elsewhere in Europe.

Emerging markets saw some relative calm after a turbulent few days that has seen Turkey's lira battered again, Russia and Ukraine tensions rise, and Mexico's president stoke worries about central bank independence by installing a virtual unknown at the helm. [EMRG/FRX]
The lira shrugged off early losses to rise 0.5%, extending Wednesday's gains which came after a brutal 11-day, 24% losing streak after President Tayyip Erdogan had backed more interest rates cuts.
Russia's rouble moved away from recent four-month lows as Moscow said it hadn't turned its back on Eastern Ukraine peace talks, while South Africa's rand recovered from a one-year trough.
In Asia overnight, the tech recovery that had been kicked off by the Nasdaq [.N] helped Japan's Nikkei finish 0.7% higher and meant Hong Kong's tech index was able to snap six sessions of losses. 
Other share moves were more muted however. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan finished flat after little movement all day. [.T][.SS]
In broad terms, ""when it comes to regional equities allocation, we're watching the U.S. dollar which is making new highs and that is a headwind for emerging market equities,"" said Fook-Hien Yap, senior investment strategist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank wealth management. 
The dollar is trading near its highest in almost five years versus the Japanese currency at 115.3 yen, and consolidating a near 18-month high against the euro which was a fraction higher at $1.1222. (FRX) 
Several U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers have said in recent days that they would be open to speeding up the tapering of the central bank's bond-buying programme if the high rate of inflation held, and move more quickly to raise interest rates, minutes of the Fed's Nov. 2-3 policy meeting showed. 
""The market is now pricing in more than two hikes next year, but we think that is overly aggressive. We are only looking for about one hike next year,"" said Yap. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects three rate hikes next year.
These expectations have pushed U.S. treasury yields higher, albeit inconsistently, with benchmark 10-year notes closing for the Thanksgiving break at 1.6427% having risen as high as 1.6930% on Wednesday. 
U.S. Treasuries and U.S. stock markets will resume on Friday albeit for shortened session meaning trading is almost certain to be thin. 
Oil prices see-sawed meanwhile after a turbulent few days in which the United States said it would release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain to try to cool oil prices after calls to OPEC+ to pump more went unheeded. 

Investors had already largely priced the move though, after more than a week of signals from the major players, meaning Brent actually jumped on Wednesday. It was last trading at $82 a barrel in London, which was up 6% from the week's lows but down fractionally lower on the day. [O/R]

1179,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2021 12:15PM ET</span>",EU sees 'decisive moment' for building single capital market,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) -The European Union set out its third wave of reforms in six years on Thursday to try to build a seamless securities market that can compete better with London and New York, a step that will pit stock exchanges against rival platforms.
The EU project to create a capital markets union (CMU) suffered a blow when Britain and its large financial sector left the bloc.
To keep the project on track, the EU's executive European Commission proposed establishing a ""tape"" or record of stock and bond prices, and giving investors free information on companies. It also proposed tweaks to long-term investment funds, and plans to better coordinate how they are regulated.
The Commission wants to make it easier to raise money for companies to meet climate goals and recover from the financial blow of the COVID-19 pandemic. Brexit also leaves Brussels with a financial competitor on its doorstep. 
""It's important that we develop our own capital markets,"" EU financial services chief Mairead McGuinness said.
The tape of securities prices and single point of information will create a ""decisive moment"" for CMU when implemented, she said.
""There are a lot of good factors pulling together to make the development of capital market union more likely than if we didn't have those forces pushing us to sustainability,"" she said.
The proposals will need approval from the European Parliament and EU states to become law, with compromises expected.
Markus Ferber, a German centre-right member of the European Parliament, said the proposals make modest progress but fail to match the ambition of the CMU project by leaving out big items like changing taxation rules.
German investment funds association BVI said the proposed European Single Access Point for company information would help asset managers meet increasing reporting obligations in a more cost-effective way.
'ELABORATE EXPERIMENT'
Lawmakers and EU states will face industry lobbying over the proposed consolidated tape to provide stock transaction prices as ""close to real time as technically possible"" - and at a low cost or free to retail investors.
Exchanges want a 15-minute delay before the mandatory handing over of their data. Banks and investment funds say a tape will be of no use if not in real time.
The Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) said the CMU package is ""one step forward, one step back"" as it fails to increase the competitiveness of EU markets.
""Exchanges remain deeply concerned by the risks of such an elaborate and complex experiment,"" FESE director general Rainer Riess said of the proposals for a tape.
The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), which represents investment banks and funds, said a real-time tape was essential for delivering CMU.
Cboe, which owns pan-European exchange Cboe Europe, said the tape proposal discriminated against across-Europe platforms like itself, and lacked ambition by not including pre-trade prices.
Thursday's proposals make some types of off-exchange or ""dark"" trading harder, with the aim of funnelling more transactions onto bourses. Industry officials say this could divert business to London, where regulators are taking a more liberal approach since Brexit.

The EU is using its CMU package to make other changes, such as banning payment for order flow or where retail brokers forward clients' orders to other traders for a fee.

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2021 08:30AM ET</span>",Factbox-Building the single EU securities market,"(Reuters) - The European Union's executive body published draft laws on Thursday to build a deeper single market in securities for aiding recovery from COVID-19, raising funds for 'green' projects and building 'autonomy' in financial services after Brexit.
The main proposals are:
EUROPEAN SINGLE ACCESS POINT
The EU's answer to EDGAR used by companies in the United States for mandatory filings, ESAP is due to go live in 2024, and operated by the EU's securities watchdog ESMA. It will collect filings from national bodies in the bloc to give investors a free, single point of information on listed companies and EU financial products.
EUROPEAN LONG TERM INVESTMENT FUNDS
Given so few have been set up, the rules for ELTIFs, which channel funds to smaller companies, will be made more flexible to give access to retail investors and ease marketing requirements on professional investors.
MANAGING INVESTMENT FUNDS
Clarifying when a fund listed in the EU can delegate stock and bond picking to asset managers based outside the bloc in countries like Britain and the United States, a longstanding practice known as ""delegation"". The clarified rules will apply to alternative funds such as hedge funds and extended to EU mutual funds known as UCITs. Funds would need at least two full-time staff in the bloc to avoid becoming a ""letter box"" company. A majority of a fund's assets should be in the EU.
TAPE OF SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS
Setting out ground rules for creating a 'consolidated tape' or record of ""near real time"" stock prices and separate tape for bonds and derivatives to identify venues that offer the best prices. There will also be stricter rules for trading shares off an exchange and 'mid-point' trading, which is popular with big investors.
OTHER MEASURES
* A ban on trading operators offering incentives to brokers for directing retail client stock orders to them, know as payment-for-order flow.
* Ending a requirement on clearing houses to clear exchange traded derivatives from another exchange, if requested.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
The proposals need approval from the European Parliament and EU member states to become law, a process that typically involves compromises and changes.

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2021 07:55AM ET</span>","China's Kaisa seeks to extend maturity on $400 million offshore bond, shares surge","By Clare Jim and Sameer Manekar
HONG KONG (Reuters) -China's Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd said on Thursday it wants to extend the maturity of a $400 million bond by a year and a half - part of the property developer's efforts to avoid a messy default and resolve a liquidity crisis.
In a filing, Kaisa said it would exchange its 6.5% offshore bonds due Dec. 7 for new notes due June 6, 2023, at the same interest rate if at least 95% of holders accept.
Kaisa, which has the most offshore debt among Chinese developers after China Evergrande Group, missed coupon payments totalling $88.4 million due on Nov. 11 and 12. The payments have a 30-day grace period.
Shares in Kaisa, which resumed trading after suspension on Nov. 5, were up 18% in afternoon trade with investors cheered by the firm's attempt to solve payment problems.
Kaisa said a sharp downturn in the financing environment has limited its funding sources to meet upcoming maturities.
""If the exchange offer and consent solicitation are not successfully consummated, we may not be able to repay the existing notes upon maturity on Dec. 7, and we may consider alternative debt restructuring exercise,"" it said in the filing.
Chinese developers are facing an unprecedented liquidity squeeze due to regulatory curbs on borrowing, causing a string of offshore debt default, credit-rating downgrades and sell-offs in developers' shares and bonds.
Kaisa has been scrambling to raise capital by divesting assets including Hong Kong-listed property management unit, Kaisa Prosperity Holdings Ltd. 
It recently sold a land parcel in Hong Kong to a local investor for HK$3.78 billion ($484.82 million), recovering around HK$1.3 billion cash after repaying the loans it borrowed for the land, Reuters reported this week. Kaisa is also selling another land plot in the city. 
""Providing solutions and more clarity to the market is positive; afterall Kaisa's fundamentals are good, if it manages to strike a deal with creditors it can repay bit by bit to get past this crisis,"" said Kington Lin, managing director of Asset Management Department at Canfield Securities Limited.
The developer, in a separate filing late on Wednesday, said it aims to accelerate the disposal of real estate projects and other high-quality assets to improve liquidity.
Having missed payments on onshore wealth management products totalling 1.5 billion yuan ($234.80 million) due in October and November, Kaisa said it implemented repayment measures for 1.1 billion yuan and is negotiating the remainder with investors.
The developer also said ""certain members of the group"" did not meet repayment obligations under finance agreements involving bank loans and other borrowing, and that it is formulating an overall repayment plan.
Other cash-strapped developers including Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer which has been stumbling from deadline to deadline in recent weeks as it grapples with more than $300 billion in liabilities, are also negotiating with their creditors and scrambling to raise funds. 
""Companies want to buy time, while creditors want to recover their money. Accepting an extension is better than calling the companies bankruptcy and get nothing back,"" said Lin. 
Evergrande electric vehicle (EV) subsidiary's onshore unit raised its registered capital by 39% to $3.5 billion, local media reported on Thursday. The Hong Kong-listed Evergrande New Energy Vehicle said last week that it planned to raise around $347 million through a share placement.
Smaller rival Fantasia Holdings said on Wednesday it has reached an agreement with holders of a 1.5 billion yuan onshore bond maturing in 2023 to pay 20% of a coupon due on Thursday and the rest a year later.
But, media reported, that an extension resolution for another onshore bond due 2023 worth 2.5 billion yuan failed to pass on Wednesday. 
Fantasia has missed payment of $205.7 million offshore notes that were due Oct. 4.
Separately, Rating agency Fitch downgraded on Wednesday China Aoyuan's credit rating to ""CCC-"" from ""B-"", reflecting the reduced chances that the firm will be able to refinance its $688 million offshore bond due January 2022.
Aoyuan said on Monday it has extended the redemption date of onshore asset-backed securities worth 816 million yuan and engaged Admiralty Harbour Capital Limited and Linklaters as advisers to assess the company's capital structure and talk to creditors. 
Shares of Fantasia were flat, while Aoyuan and Evergrande edged up 2.3% and 0.7%, respectively. Hang Seng Index was flat.

1187,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>",Company valuations and climate strategies are poles apart,"(In Nov. 24 story, corrects methodology in paragraph 12)
By Elizabeth Howcroft and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) -Companies in the most polluting sectors that have invested in climate action often find themselves valued below peers that have been slower to do so, highlighting the difficulty of getting shareholders to back sustainability.
Investors have poured more than $30 trillion https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/sustainable-investments-account-more-than-third-global-assets-2021-07-18 into environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) strategies, data from the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance showed.
But the demand for sustainable investment has yet to remove the pressure to put profits first and pro-climate analysts are concerned the outcome of U.N. climate talks https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-un-idCNL1N2S405F earlier this month did too little to help. 
Analyses of companies globally by management consultancy Kearney in November seen exclusively by Reuters, as well as data by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG published in April, found that companies that lowered their emissions in sectors where doing so was expensive and government regulation was limited were valued less, on average, than more emitting peers. 
Investors were only found to reward the most emitting companies, such as energy, mining and heavy industry, for taking action on climate change when the cost of doing so was relatively small and government support and regulations were relatively strong. 
""Investors want climate leadership, they want tangible transition plans, but at the same time they are only willing to reward companies that can do so without sacrificing returns,"" Betty Jiang, Credit Suisse's head of U.S. ESG research, said.
Given changing attitudes as climate change becomes more extreme, some see an opportunity to invest in companies cheaply before the market values their climate action more highly. 
Others worry the risk of losing value is making corporate boards reluctant to act to avoid catastrophic climate change, especially after governments at the United Nations talks in Glasgow this month failed to send a strong message that global warming can be capped at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). 
""There is currently no clear line of sight between climate investing and its impacts. Green (investment) portfolios have not yet equated to a green planet,"" said Anthony Cowell, head of asset management at KPMG Islands Group.
EUROPEAN INVESTORS VALUE SUSTAINABILITY MORE
Kearney calculated the valuation of 481 companies globally as a function of their cash flows. 
It then assessed their climate action using the Transition Pathways Initiative benchmark (TPI), an investor initiative launched in 2017 to assess companies' response to climate change. 
Where TPI scores were not available, Kearney looked at a ratio of companies' greenhouse gas emissions to their revenue to assign ESG leadership or laggard status. 
Steel, chemicals, cement and power companies in Europe with top-rated carbon reduction plans have an average valuation premium of 62% to peers who are climate action laggards, the Kearney analysis found. 
In the rest of the world, that premium is 25%, demonstrating that European investors value sustainability more than others globally.
Companies with higher climate scores in the aluminium, airlines, autos, diversified mining, infrastructure, maritime transport and oil and gas sectors show the opposite trend. 
In Europe they trade at a 27% discount on average to environmental laggards, the analysis found. In the rest of the world, that discount is even wider - 41%.
Although many factors can skew a company's valuation, Alexis Deladerriere, head of international developed markets equity at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), said that in heavy-emitting sectors ESG scores were not reflected in a company's valuation premium. 
""There is basically no correlation - no valuation premium - for having a high ESG score in general or having a high 'E' score specifically,"" Deladerriere said.
""If you are behaving badly, if you are polluting and you're not doing anything about it, do you get penalised for doing that? Unfortunately, not really in the short term.""
ENERGY, MINING
The energy and mining sectors are dominated by risks that can impact valuation, but still the evidence is that the very sectors with leading roles in decarbonising are not being rewarded for moving away from fossil fuels.
BP (NYSE:BP) Plc, for example, is viewed as a climate leader with a top ""4STAR"" TPI level. Yet it has a lower valuation, as measured by its enterprise value to cash flow ratio, than many ESG laggards with lower TPI scores, such as U.S. peer  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO).
In the mining sector, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Plc is considered a climate leader, with a TPI score of 4, but its valuation premium is less than a third of that of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), which is a climate-laggard by the TPI measure, Kearney's data showed.
BP, Valero and Rio Tinto did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Freeport-McMoRan said the company had made ""significant progress"" on climate in the last two years and is committed to ""integrating our climate initiatives into our long-term business plans"".
As climate change becomes an even bigger focus for markets and regulators, some corporate directors say boards will start to take stronger action on climate change as more investors begin to give them credit for it. 

""Every company wants to figure out how to do (sustainability) quickly and easily because it's a shorter return on investment,"" said Orlando Ashford (NYSE:AINC), a director on the boards of companies including drug maker Perrigo and solar energy equipment manufacturer Array Technologies.
""If you fold it into the construct of how you are running your business it will take longer, but it’s not a fad,"" Ashford said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -High-tech home appliance maker Dyson Ltd told Reuters it had cut ties with supplier ATA IMS Bhd following an audit of the Malaysian company's labour practices and allegations by a whistleblower, sending ATA shares plunging.
ATA, which is already being investigated by the United States over forced labour allegations, confirmed Dyson has terminated its contracts and that it has been in talks with its customer over the audit findings. It had previously denied allegations of labour abuse. 
Shares in ATA, which makes parts for Dyson's vacuum cleaners and air purifiers, tumbled 30% to their lowest since April 2020 after the Reuters report. According to ATA, Dyson accounts for almost 80% of its revenue.
The termination is also a significant blow for Malaysia, a major electronics manufacturing hub that has faced scrutiny this year over claims migrant workers are being subjected to abusive working and living conditions. 
Dyson, privately owned by British billionaire James Dyson, said it received the results of an audit of working conditions at ATA in early October. It said it had also learned in September about allegations from a whistleblower about ""unacceptable actions"" by ATA staff and had commissioned a law firm to investigate those claims. 
""Despite intense engagement over the past six weeks, we have not seen sufficient progress and have already removed some production lines,"" Singapore-headquartered Dyson said in response to questions from Reuters.
""We have now terminated our relationship with six months' of contractual notice. We hope this gives ATA the impetus to improve, and enables an orderly withdrawal in the interests of the workers that they employ.""
Dyson's comments came after being contacted by Reuters about claims by workers, including a whistleblower, about working conditions at ATA.
In interviews with Reuters, seven current and former ATA employees said they had worked overtime hours in excess of limits under Malaysian law and paid recruitment fees in their home countries to labour brokers, a practice activists have criticised as a form of debt bondage.
Employees also worked public holidays at the ATA plant and on what were supposed to be rest days, according to the workers and payslips reviewed by Reuters.
Malaysian law allows for up to 104 hours of overtime in a month. A payslip reviewed by Reuters showed one worker had worked 126 hours in May.
Dhan Kumar Limbu, a former ATA worker, told Reuters that ATA officials took him to a police station in June where he was questioned about sharing information about conditions at the factory with activists and then beaten by police.
Limbu, a Nepali citizen, fled Malaysia after the incident, fearing further reprisals, he said. He told Reuters he had recounted his experience about being taken to the police station in an interview with Dyson's lawyers.
ATA denied all allegations by the workers and declined to comment. Malaysian police did not respond to questions from Reuters.
LOOK INTO FINDINGS
ATA, in a statement to the national stock exchange on Thursday, said it had taken steps to engage Dyson and advisers after it was notified of the summary of the labour audit. It said it would look into the findings. 
The company also said it will continue to manufacture and supply for Dyson until June 1, 2022, and that its board was looking into the validity of Dyson's termination notice.
ATA makes bin bases, battery covers, brush bars, impellers, harness covers and other parts for Dyson's vacuum cleaners, and parts for Dyson's hot and cold air purifiers, according to a May-June production schedule seen by Reuters and photos from inside the factory.
ATA had in May denied allegations of forced labour at its factories after a prominent rights activist said U.S. authorities were going to scrutinise the company's work practices. 
The activist, Andy Hall, shared a letter the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had sent him informing him it had agreed to investigate an ATA unit after he flagged complaints received from workers. 
The CBP has banned six Malaysian firms in the last two years from selling their products to the United States after finding evidence of forced labour. 
In July, the U.S. State Department put Malaysia on a list with more than a dozen countries including China and North Korea, saying it had not made progress in eliminating trafficking of workers. 
Foreigners form a significant part of Malaysia's workforce. Most migrant workers in Malaysia come from Bangladesh and Nepal, and are employed in factories, plantations and construction sites. 
Over half of ATA's 8,032 employees are foreigners, according to the firm's latest annual report. 
ATA posted record revenue and profit for fiscal year ended March 2021 as COVID-19 induced lockdowns boosted demand for home appliances such as Dyson's stick vacuum cleaner. 
Dyson had rejected allegations earlier this year regarding excessive hours and cramped living conditions for ATA workers, citing multiple prior audits it said had not found any issues involved in its supply chain.
Activist Hall said Dyson's decision to terminate the relationship would have huge implications for the thousands of workers employed at ATA and Dyson should remediate ATA workers. 
The Malaysian government must also bear some responsibility, Hall added, saying he had made multiple complaints in the past year to the government about ATA.
Malaysia's labour department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Social audits – the main form of due diligence conducted by the world's biggest brands - are meant to monitor labour and other ethical standards in the supply chain. But they are not always effective https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/an-audit-gave-all-clear-others-alleged-slavery-2021-05-19 in identifying labour risks, and can even obscure them, more than two dozen auditors, oversight bodies, factory workers and labour rights groups have told Reuters.

Dyson said the recent audit findings it received in October were from a ""comprehensive"" audit that interviewed over 2,000 members of ATA staff. 
It did not disclose the findings of the audit.

PARIS (Reuters) -Remy Cointreau raised its full-year profit forecast after a better-than-expected first half, driven by strong demand for its premium cognac in China, the United States and Europe, lifting its stock to a record high on Thursday.
Chief Executive Eric Vallat told journalists the spirits group had made an ""encouraging"" start to the third quarter in China, thanks to strong sales during the Singles' Day online shopping bonanza and the mid-autumn festival.
Singles' Day business alone makes up 10% of Remy Cointreau's annual sales in China.
The maker of Remy Martin cognac and Cointreau liqueur said it now expected ""very strong"" organic growth in current operating profit in the 2021/22 financial year. It had previously targetted ""strong"" growth.
Remy shares jumped as much as 12% to a record high of 209.80 euros. 
The company also remained confident of outperforming the premium spirits market and reiterated a forecast for strong organic growth in full-year sales.
The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted Remy's drive towards higher-priced spirits to boost profit margins long term, accelerating a shift among consumers towards premium drinks, at-home consumption, cocktails and e-commerce, Vallat said.
Asked to comment on the market consensus for 24.7% organic growth in 2021/22 operating profit and 24.5% growth in sales, Vallat said: ""I am rather comfortable"" with the sales estimate, while that for profit is ""a bit cautious.""
Due to higher marketing and communication spending and a tougher comparison base in the second half, full-year profits will be driven solely by first-half growth, the group said.
Group current operating profit for the six months ended Sept. 30 leapt 104.5% on an organic basis to 212.9 million euros ($238.8 million). That beat a company-compiled consensus from 22 analysts of 168.1 million euros.

Operating profit at the Remy Martin cognac division, which makes nearly 90% of group profit, totalled 188.1 million euros, up 101.9% on the same basis.
Remy had already reported a 52% organic jump in first-half sales. This reflected a strong rebound in bars and restaurants as COVID-19 restrictions eased around the world, while home consumption remained resilient. ($1 = 0.8917 euros)

On Wednesday, Dimon said he regretted his remark at an event a day earlier that the Wall Street bank would last longer than China's Communist Party (CPC), moving quickly to try to prevent any longer-term fallout.
""I noted the reports about how the individual involved has sincerely reflected. I think this is the right attitude. I hope the media involved will stop hyping this issue,"" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular daily briefing in response to a question. 
The Dimon remark has been a hot topic in Hong Kong's financial circles with bankers surprised the JPMorgan boss would make the comments given the sensitivities of dealing with China.
China experts in the United States, however, said that Dimon's quick apology should ensure no serious damage was done to the bank's long-term ambitions.
At a Boston College series of chief executive interviews on Tuesday, Dimon said: ""I made a joke the other day that the Communist Party is celebrating its 100th year - so is JPMorgan. I'd make a bet that we last longer.""
""I can't say that in China. They are probably listening anyway,"" he said.
On Wednesday, Dimon and JPMorgan issued two statements to play down the potential fallout.
""I regret and should not have made that comment. I was trying to emphasize the strength and longevity of our company,"" Dimon said in a statement issued by the bank.

In a second statement issued by the bank later, Dimon said: ""It's never right to joke about or denigrate any group of people, whether it's a country, its leadership, or any part of a society and culture.""
JPMorgan has strong growth ambitions in China where it won regulatory approval in August to become the first full foreign owner of a securities brokerage. It won approval ahead of U.S. rival Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which had been expected to be the first to take full ownership of a mainland securities business.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China on Thursday criticized the United States for putting a dozen Chinese companies on its trade blacklist over national security and foreign policy concerns, citing in some cases their help developing the Chinese military's quantum computing efforts.
The Chinese additions to the blacklist maintained by the U.S. commerce department comes amid growing tensions https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/biden-administration-invites-taiwan-its-summit-democracy-2021-11-24 between Beijing and Washington over the status of Taiwan and trade issues. 
The department also said several entities and individuals from China and Pakistan were added to the Commerce Department's Entity List for contributing to Pakistan's nuclear activities or ballistic missile program.
In total, 27 new entities were added to the list from China, Japan, Pakistan, and Singapore.
China strongly opposes the sanctions on the Chinese companies, and will lodge solemn representations with the United States, Shu Jueting, a spokesperson for the Chinese commerce ministry, said at a news conference on Thursday. 
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement on Wednesday that the new listings will help prevent U.S. technology from supporting the development of Chinese and Russian ""military advancement and activities of non-proliferation concern like Pakistan's unsafeguarded nuclear activities or ballistic missile program.""
China's embassy in Washington charged that the United States ""uses the catch-all concept of national security and abuses state power to suppress and restrict Chinese enterprises in all possible means.
""China is firmly opposed to that,"" embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said. 
He said the United States should ""follow the spirit"" of a virtual meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-raised-concerns-over-xinjiang-tibet-hong-kong-xi-warns-taiwan-red-line-2021-11-16 last week and ""meet China halfway instead of going further down the wrong path.""
China will take all the necessary steps to defend its companies, and reserves the right to take countermeasures against the sanctions, warned Zhao Lijian, spokesman at the Chinese foreign ministry, at a briefing on Thursday. 
The U.S. Commerce Department said Hangzhou Zhongke Microelectronics Co Ltd, Hunan Goke Microelectronics, New H3C Semiconductor Technologies Co Ltd, Xi'an Aerospace Huaxun Technology and Yunchip Microelectronics were placed on the Commerce Department's entity list for their ""support of the military modernization of the People's Liberation Army.""
It also added Hefei National Laboratory (NYSE:LH) for Physical Sciences at Microscale, QuantumCTek and Shanghai QuantumCTeck Co Ltd to the list for ""acquiring and attempting to acquire U.S.-origin items in support of military applications"".
The eight Chinese firms were listed to prevent U.S. technology being used to help China develop quantum computing applications for its military. 
The Commerce Department wants to stop the Chinese military from developing its counter-stealth technology, which could include equipment like advanced radars, and counter-submarine applications such as undersea sensors. The action also blocks U.S. material from being used to help China break encryption or develop unbreakable encryption, the Commerce Department said.
Suppliers to companies on the entity list will need to apply for a license before they can sell to them, which is likely to be denied.

Separately, the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology was added to the Commerce Department's military end user list, but the listing did not provide additional information other than it had produced military products.
The entity list has increasingly been used for national security and foreign policy aims since the Trump administration. Chinese telecom company Huawei was added in 2019, cutting it off from some key suppliers and making it difficult for them to produce mobile handsets.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Thursday with  Remy Cointreau  starring, while investors digested the formation of a new governing coalition in Germany as well as the region’s ongoing Covid-19 crisis.  
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France also rose 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.1%.
After two months of negotiations, the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Free Democrats agreed a coalition deal on Wednesday that will result in Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats replacing Angela Merkel as German chancellor after 16 years.
The coalition is seen promoting more public investment to speed up the shift towards a green economy, but its first priority is likely to be attempting to control the coronavirus pandemic which has returned to the continent in force.
Scholz said Wednesday that vaccinations are to be made compulsory for targeted groups, but further measures may be needed to tackle the surge in cases.
Italy announced new restrictions late Wednesday, and both the Netherlands and France are expected to reveal new measures on Friday. Austria implemented a national lockdown at the start of this week.
Gross domestic product in Germany, Europe's largest economy, grew by 1.7% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, a downgrade from the flash estimate of 1.8% published last month, and marked a slowdown from the upwardly revised expansion of 2% in the second quarter.
Additionally, the country’s GfK consumer sentiment fell to -1.6 in December, from the previous month’s revised 1.0, as the rising number of Covid cases weighed on confidence.
In the corporate sector, Remy Cointreau (PA:RCOP) stock soared over 9% after the drinks group raised its full year profit outlook after reporting a hefty jump in first-half operating profit, driven by strong demand for its premium cognac.
Crude prices stagnated Thursday with investors looking towards next week’s OPEC+ meeting for a reaction to the coordinated release of oil from government reserves by a number of major consumers, led by the United States.

1198,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2021 02:25AM ET</span>",Prada's heir designate vows to keep group in family hands,"By Lisa Jucca
VALVIGNA, Italy (Reuters) - Lorenzo Bertelli, the eldest son and heir designate to Prada (OTC:PRDSY)'s Chief Executive Patrizio Bertelli, vowed to keep the family-controlled luxury fashion group independent when he takes the reins https://www.reuters.com/business/pradas-ceo-says-could-hand-over-reins-son-3-yrs-time-2021-11-18 in a few years, he told Reuters.
Lorenzo Bertelli, a 33-year old former rally driver, is currently Prada's marketing chief and has helped bolster the group's digital business, which aims to account 15% of retail sales in the medium term from just 2% before the pandemic.
At an investor presentation https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/prada-sets-45-bln-euros-revenue-goal-boost-e-commerce-2021-11-18 last week, his father officially crowned him as his successor, saying he could hand over to him in three to four years.
Earlier this year, Patrizio Bertelli described Lorenzo as a ""key element in the turnaround of the group"" that he and his wife, top fashion designer Miuccia Prada, put in place to revive sales.
The revamp strategy, which has focused on moving Prada upmarket by eliminating mark-downs and cutting wholesale distribution, has paid off and Prada is often cited by rival groups as an attractive potential prey.
However, like his father, Lorenzo Bertelli said the Hong Kong-listed group - in which the family has an 80% stake - was not up for sale.
""This is a question for my parents but for me, absolutely yes,"" he said in an interview that will air in full at the upcoming Reuters Next conference on Dec.1, when asked whether he wanted to keep the group in the hands of the family. 
""I do not see other directions, also because I hope to have still a long path ahead and so I have to do something with my life. So I would like to stay independent,"" he added, speaking at the group's industrial headquarters and prototyping centre in Valvigna, in Tuscany.
He did not rule out acquiring other brands, saying there were no opportunities for the time being, but ""tomorrow we do not know.""
And he dismissed, at least for the time being, the possibility of the group's main labels - Prada and the younger line Miu Miu - selling on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is seeking to lure prestigious luxury names to its platform. 
""We tried with one of our smallest brands (Car Shoe) just to have a try,"" he said. ""We don't think at the moment Amazon is ready for the bigger brands ... We don't see either Prada or Miu Miu on the Amazon platform at the moment.""
Instead, he reiterated that Prada could be interested in taking a stake in a joint e-commerce venture that Cartier-owner Richemont and U.S.-listed online retailer Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) are discussing.
Richemont said earlier this month it was in advanced talks with Farfetch about selling it a minority stake in its online business Yoox Net-a-Porter (MI:YNAP). It added it would also invite other firms to participate in turning YNAP into an industry-wide platform with no overall controlling shareholder. 
A direct investment in the platform ""could be an opportunity,"" Bertelli said.
The group last week unveiled a medium-term goal of raising its operating profit margin to 20% of sales, below that of bigger competitors like Louis Vuitton or Gucci and Prada's own profitability margin of 27% in its heyday.

Bertelli said that in the long term the group could go back to that kind of profitability level. But he said Prada preferred to give itself reasonable goals and when possible do even better, rather than aim too high and risk disappointing.

MILAN (Reuters) -Deutsche Boerse will allow stock investors to trade on the Frankfurt exchange until the close of U.S equity markets starting from Monday, a move that highlights heightened competition to win over clients.
The two-hour extension to 10 p.m. local time (2100 GMT) could bring higher volumes for Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) but also raise costs, while putting pressure on foreign rivals to possibly consider a similar move, traders said.
In Germany investors can already trade until that time or even later through platforms run by local brokerages Tradegate and Lang & Schwarz, which are used by retail and professional investors.
""Deutsche Boerse offers a lot of foreign shares on their trading platform and this move could be aimed at attracting more retail trading interest,"" said Anish Puaar, European market structure analyst at Rosenblatt Securities.
Even though retail equity ownership is much smaller in Europe than in the U.S., where households own more than one third of the market, the region witnessed a trading boom last year among retail investors who had more time to trade during lockdowns.
The extension would affect shares, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, and has been made possible by the new securities clearing platform introduced by German clearing house Eurex in September this year, the German bourse operator said.
""By extending trading hours, investors can react to events on the U.S. markets late in the evening, among other things, and take advantage of on-exchange trading,"" it added.
The move is the latest development by exchanges to increase revenues by allowing punters to trade markets in different time zones. While some exchanges like Moscow have already increased their trading hours to attract Asian clients, other exchanges like Tokyo are taking tentative steps in that direction.
Pan-European exchange operator Euronext said on Wednesday it had no plans to expand the trading day. Last year it rejected a proposal to shorten trading hours which was aimed at improving liquidity, and the well-being of traders.

Shares in Deutsche Boerse have underperformed the broader German market with shares up only 2% so far this year compared to a 15% rise in the index. 
They have also lagged shares in Euronext although they have done better than the London Stock Exchange.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Thursday, as investors digest the formation of a new governing coalition in Germany as well as the region’s ongoing Covid-19 crisis.  
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
After two months of negotiations, the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Free Democrats agreed a coalition deal on Wednesday that will result in Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats replacing Angela Merkel as German chancellor after 16 years.
The coalition is seen promoting more public investment to speed up the shift towards a green economy, but its first priority is likely to be attempting to control the coronavirus pandemic which has returned to the continent in force.
Scholz said Wednesday that vaccinations are to be made compulsory for targeted groups, but further measures may be needed to tackle the surge in cases.
Italy announced new restrictions late Wednesday, and both the Netherlands and France are expected to reveal new measures on Friday. Austria implemented a national lockdown at the start of this week.
Turning to the economic calendar, Germany’s third-quarter gross domestic product rose 1.7% on the month, a slight disappointment from the expected 1.8% growth, while the December reading of the country’s GfK consumer sentiment showed a drop in confidence, coming in at -1.6, a drop from the previous month’s revised 1.0.
In the corporate sector,  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) raised its full year profit outlook after reporting a hefty jump in first-half operating profit, driven by strong demand for the drink group’s premium cognac in China, the United States and Europe.
Crude prices edged lower Thursday with investors looking towards next week’s OPEC+ meeting for a reaction to the coordinated release of oil from government reserves by a number of major consumers, led by the United States.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and allies, a group known as OPEC+, has been adding 400,000 barrels per day of supply to the global market since August, and meets on Dec. 2 to decide whether or not to continue in this vein.
Elsewhere, Wednesday's U.S. crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a build of just over 1 million barrels last week.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $78.18 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $82.16.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,794.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1218.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese authorities are working with U.S. counterparts to prevent Chinese companies being delisted from U.S. stock exchanges, a Chinese regulatory official said on Thursday, as a lengthy dispute about auditing standards rumbles on. 
U.S. authorities are moving towards kicking foreign companies off https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-foreigncompanies-idUSKBN2BG2AI American stock exchanges if their audits fail to meet U.S. standards.
The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and U.S. policy makers have long complained of a lack of access to audit working papers for U.S.-listed Chinese companies. Citing national security concerns, Chinese authorities have been reluctant to allow overseas regulators to inspect working papers from local accounting firms.
""We don’t think that delisting of Chinese firms from the US market is a good thing either for the companies, for global investors or Chinese-US relations,"" Shen Bing, director general of the China Securities Regulatory Commission's department of international affairs, told a conference in Hong Kong. 
""We are working very hard to resolve the auditing issue with U.S. counterparts, the communication is currently smooth and open. There is a risk of delisting of these companies but we are working very hard to prevent it from happening,"" he added.
In December 2020, during the last weeks of his administration, President Donald Trump signed a law aimed at removing foreign companies from U.S. exchanges if they failed to comply with American auditing standards for three years in a row.
A map on the organisation's website https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international showed China as the only jurisdiction that denied the PCAOB ""necessary access to conduct oversight"". 
Speaking at the same conference, Ashley Alder, CEO of Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission said he feared Sino-U.S. tensions could prevent a solution. 
""Sometimes politics can interrupt technical solutions that are sensible and achievable, and I pick up a degree of political attitude within the U.S. establishment that is not necessarily conducive to a better outcome."" 
Hong Kong previously faced similar problems with access to mainland China audit working papers, but Alder said the SFC's relationship with the CSRC and a 2019 agreement https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-audit-hongkong-idUSKCN1TY1FZ had helped resolve these. 

Hong Kong has benefitted from the Sino-U.S. spat, as a string of U.S.-listed Chinese companies have carried out secondary listings in the city in recent years, partly as a back up in case the companies are deslisted from the Nasdaq or NYSE, say market participants. 
The Hong Kong stock exchange, last week, confirmed it would proceed with rule changes to make it easier for overseas-listed Chinese companies to carry out secondary listings, and for companies to change a Hong Kong secondary listing to a primary one.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) issued alert messages on Wednesday to at least six activists and researchers who have been critical of Thailand's government, warning it believed their iPhones had been targeted by ""state-sponsored attackers"", according to activists and the alerts reviewed by Reuters.
Apple and Thailand's Digital Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Prajak Kongkirati, a political scientist at Bangkok's Thammasat University, said he had received two emails from Apple warning it believed his iPhone and iCloud accounts had been targeted, along with a ""threat notification"" on his Apple account.
Researcher Sarinee Achananuntakul and Thai activist Yingcheep Atchanont of Legal Monitoring group iLaw said they had received similar emails, while a rapper, a political activist, and a politician opposed to the government separately posted screenshots of the same email on their social media accounts.
All are perceived as being critical of the Thai government.
The messages warned ""if your device is compromised by a state-sponsored attacker, they may be able to remotely access your sensitive data, communications, or even the camera and microphone.""
Two political activists in Ghana, an opposition politician in Uganda, as well as a dozen journalists from Salvadoran media reported later on Wednesday having received similar warning messages from Apple, according to social media posts reviewed by Reuters. 
Apple on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against Israeli cyber firm NSO Group and its parent company OSY Technologies for alleged surveillance and targeting of U.S. Apple users with its Pegasus spyware. [L4N2SE31T]
In a statement on Tuesday, Apple said that the NSO group had created ""state-sponsored surveillance technology"" that had been aimed at ""very small number of users"". 
It was not immediately clear in Apple's alerts on Wednesday whether the company believed Thais were being targeted by Pegasus.
Internet security watchdog group Citizen Lab identified in 2018 a Pegasus spyware operator active within Thailand.
Thailand's government is still led by the architects of a 2014 coup, who remain in power after a 2019 election that its rivals say was stacked in the military's favour.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the coup leader, has denied allegations the military changed rules to ensure it remained in control. He has faced months of anti-government protests.
As well as calls for greater democracy, the government has also been criticised over its management of the coronavirus pandemic and the economy.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 11:55PM ET</span>",Dimon says he regrets comment on JPMorgan outlasting China Communist Party,"By Scott Murdoch and Matt Scuffham
HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Wednesday he regretted his remarks that the Wall Street bank would last longer than China's Communist Party (CPC), moving quickly to avoid any longer-term fallout.
Dimon's comments had risked jeopardizing JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s growth ambitions in China where it won regulatory approval in August to become the first full foreign owner of a securities brokerage in the country. 
China experts in the United States said his quick apology should ensure no serious damage was done.
""I regret and should not have made that comment. I was trying to emphasize the strength and longevity of our company,"" Dimon said in a statement issued by the bank.
Dimon realized immediately after he made the comment that it was a mistake, according to a source familiar with his thinking. After seeing the reaction, he decided to express regret, the source said.
In a later statement, Dimon said: ""It's never right to joke about or denigrate any group of people, whether it's a country, its leadership, or any part of a society and culture. Speaking in that way can take away from constructive and thoughtful dialogue in society, which is needed now more than ever.""
Referring to the matter in a comment posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Thursday, the outspoken editor of nationalistic tabloid Global Times, Hu Xijin, said: ""You don't have to regret actually.
""The CPC has succeeded in its sphere far more than JP Morgan's. As a member of the CPC, I don't mind your company riding the wave of CPC's popularity.""
A day earlier, Hu said: ""Think long-term! And I bet the CPC will outlast the USA.""
Speaking at a Boston College series of CEO interviews on Tuesday, Dimon said: ""I made a joke the other day that the Communist Party is celebrating its 100th year - so is JPMorgan. I'd make a bet that we last longer.""
""I can't say that in China. They are probably listening anyway,"" he added.
Beijing's approval for JPMorgan to take full ownership of its securities business was a milestone in the opening of China's capital markets after years of gradual moves and pressure from Washington.
Beijing sees the involvement of foreign banks as important for China's domestic financial development, academics say. However, they add, Western companies doing business in China still need to tread carefully.
""Dimon's apology shows the degree of deference foreign businesses have to show to the Chinese government in order to remain in its good graces and maintain access to the country’s markets,"" said Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University.
""I don't think this will have any longer term consequences,"" said Leland Miller, chief executive at data firm China Beige Book and an expert on China's financial system. 
Asked by Bloomberg about Dimon's comments at a news conference on Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian replied: ""Why the publicity stunt with some grandstanding remarks?,"" according to an English language transcript of the remarks https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/t1919627.shtml.
BACKLASH 
Global executives typically choose their words carefully when discussing China, where foreign companies have occasionally been subject to backlash for perceived offenses.
Swiss bank UBS ran into trouble in 2019, after a remark by one of its senior economists about food inflation and swine fever was interpreted as a racist slur. He was suspended for three months and UBS lost a plum role on a bond deal for a state-backed client.
Earlier this year, Swedish fashion giant H&M's and U.S.-based  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) faced a backlash from Chinese state media and ecommerce platforms after expressing concern about allegations forced labour had been used to produce cotton in Xinjiang.
""The Chinese government has amply demonstrated its willingness to curb or in some cases shut down foreign businesses' operations in the country if they challenge the government openly or even engage in perceived or indirect slights,"" said Cornell's Prasad.
A week ago Dimon was granted an exemption by the Hong Kong government to visit the Chinese-controlled financial hub without needing to quarantine. 
Visitors to the city from most countries must stay in hotel quarantine for two to three weeks at their own cost.
Dimon was in Hong Kong for 32 hours after arriving by private jet.

""Jamie Dimon's best and worst trait is that he speaks his mind,"" said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo. 
""It typically works well for him and makes him more authentic and appreciated by investors. But sometimes it gets him into trouble.""

Investing.com –Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd.'s (HK:1638) shares sparked as they resumed trading in Hong Kong, with investors cheering efforts to solve a liquidity crisis.
Shares jumped 18.81% to HK$1.20 ($0.15) by 10:32 PM ET (3:32 AM GMT), after climbing up to $1.25 earlier in the session.
The Chinese property developer is working to extend the maturity of a $400 million bond by a year and a half, in a bid to avoid a default and resolve a liquidity crisis. If at least 95% of the holders of the offshore bond accept its offer, it will exchange the 6.5% notes due Dec. 7 for new notes due June 6, 2023, at the same interest rate, Kaisa said in a company filing. Should the offer fail, the developer may not be able to repay bonds and could consider a debt restructuring.
Regulatory curbs on borrowings have caused a liquidity crunch for Chinese developers, which has recently led to a string of offshore debt defaults, credit rating downgrades, and sell-offs in some developers' shares and bonds.
Kaisa currently has the most offshore debt of any Chinese developer after China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333). It missed coupon payments totaling over $59 million due on Nov. 11 and 12, which have a 30-day grace period.
The company has been scrambling to raise capital to pay off some of this debt. It has divested some of its assets, including Hong Kong-listed property management unit Kaisa Prosperity Holdings Ltd. In a separate filing on Wednesday, Kaisa added that it is considering speeding up the disposal of real estate projects and other high-quality assets to improve its liquidity."
1206,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 09:36PM ET</span>","Kaisa Offers Bond Exchange on Cash Woes, Stock to Resume Trading","(Bloomberg) -- Chinese developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. began an exchange offer for at least $380 million of bonds to avert a default during the nation’s real estate cash crunch. 
The builder has offered to exchange at least 95% of its $400 million 6.5% note maturing Dec. 7 for new notes with the same coupon maturing June 2023. If the offer to bondholders fails, the developer may not be able to repay bonds and could consider a debt restructuring, it said in a stock exchange filing on Thursday. 
Kaisa is the latest real estate firm trying to shore up its finances as a debt crisis originally centered on China Evergrande Group engulfs the industry. The liquidity crunch follows a government campaign to reduce leverage in the sector, and has been made worse by a slump in home sales and prices. 
See details on the bond exchange offer here 
“Despite our efforts to reduce our interest-bearing debt in response to government regulations, the current sharp downturn in the financing environment has limited our funding sources to address the upcoming maturities,” Kaisa said in the statement. 
Kaisa is one of China’s largest issuers of high-yield dollar bonds, with more than $11 billion of notes outstanding. Its 2021 bond is indicated at 50.6 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg-compiled prices show. Kaisa has another $2.8 billion in dollar bonds coming due next year, including a $550 million note in April.
The statement came hours after Kaisa announced plans to resume trading of its stock on Thursday, repay overdue wealth management products and speed up the disposal of real estate projects and “high-quality assets.” 
Kaisa’s Hong Kong-listed shares were halted on Nov. 5 pending an announcement containing inside information. The company has put 18 projects in Shenzhen up for sale, with a total value estimated at 81.8 billion yuan ($12.8 billion), Bloomberg reported at the time. 
A set of Kaisa Group Holdings offshore bondholders has hired advisers, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Like Evergrande, Kaisa is contending with individuals demanding repayments of overdue wealth management products. The company has guaranteed such products, which have 12.8 billion yuan outstanding in principal and interest, local media reported earlier this month. 
About 1.5 billion yuan in wealth products tied to the Kaisa group and its associates became due in October and November, the company said in the statement Wednesday. Kaisa is implementing measures to pay back about 1.1 billion yuan of the wealth products, it said. These include paying 10% of the principal on the month that they come due, and a further 10% every three months thereafter.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Thursday morning, as investors continued to digest the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest meeting that indicated the possibility of faster asset tapering.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.83% by 9:03 PM ET (2:03 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.55%, with the Bank of Korea hiking its interest rate to 1% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.16%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.52%
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.16% and the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.03%.
U.S. markets are closed for a holiday on Thursday.
The Fed’s minutes from its latest meeting, released on Wednesday, indicated that the central bank was open to speeding up the pace of asset tapering.
“Various participants noted that the Federal Open Market Committee should be prepared to adjust the pace of asset purchases and raise the target range for the federal funds rate sooner than participants currently anticipated if inflation continued to run higher,” according to the minutes.
“These minutes were hawkish,” TD Securities global head of rates strategy Priya Misra told Bloomberg.
“The market has moved the timing of the first-rate hike now to June of 2022 which implies this earlier end to QE is already priced in. The market is going to struggle until we get more data.”
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also said it would be hard to argue against faster asset tapering if labor market and consumer prices data due in early December continue to be better than expected.
Alongside the Fed minutes, U.S. data released on Wednesday ahead of Thursday's holiday showed that the GDP grew 2.1% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. The data also showed that 199,000 initial jobless claims were filed throughout the week, the lowest level since 1969.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Global major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) may build a biofuels plant in Singapore to meet the region's rising demand for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), the head of its downstream business said on Wednesday.
The proposed 550,000 tonnes per year (tpy) project at Singapore's Bukom Island could produce SAF to supply major Asian hubs such as Hong Kong International Airport and Singapore's Changi, Shell Downstream Director Huibert Vigeveno told reporters.
""Many of the airlines are keen to talk to us,"" he said. ""I see a lot of growth in sustainable aviation fuel.""
Citing discussions with Asian airlines, including Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY), Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines and Nippon Airlines, he said the appetite for SAF was not just in Europe or the United States.
As Shell seeks to move away from fossil fuels, in response to pressure for climate action from governments and some shareholders, it is already building a 820,000 tpy biofuels plant in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
Shell is also working with European airline KLM to test the blending of synthetic fuels.
Globally, Shell aims to make about 2 million tpy of SAF by 2025, although the renewable fuel accounts for less than 0.1% of today's global jet fuel demand.
To transit to low-carbon fuel production, Shell has shut a crude distillation unit at Bukom, which reduced its refining capacity by half, Vigeveno said, despite a recovery in global refining margins.
The proposed Singapore biofuels plant will also have flexibility to produce renewable diesel and bionaphtha feedstock for petrochemicals, he said.
""The alternative is much more valuable,"" he said, adding that Shell is focusing on higher-value products such as performance chemicals, bitumen and also lubricants, which provide a return on capital employed of more than 20%.
""Refinery margins have improved a bit, but they're far from the levels they used to be,"" Vigeveno said, adding the sector still had overcapacity.
Aviation is one of the most difficult forms of transportation to decarbonise.

Shipping, by contrast, he said had many fuel options, such as switching to liquefied natural gas (LNG), electricity, renewable diesel and in the longer term hydrogen provided the infrastructure is put in place.
Vigeveno said hydrogen could be viable for shipping this decade.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has asked India's Supreme Court to pause an expedited review of allegations that the U.S. firm concealed information while seeking antitrust clearance for a 2019 deal with India's Future Group, legal papers seen by Reuters showed.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in June accused Amazon of concealing facts and making false submissions when it sought approval for the $200 million investment into a Future unit in 2019, a deal that is now at the heart of protracted legal disputes between the two sides.
Amazon told Reuters at the time that it was confident of addressing the watchdog's concerns.
The Supreme Court approach by Amazon comes as the CCI on Wednesday held a closed-door hearing where the U.S. firm's lawyers declined to argue and explain their position on the matter, saying they had asked the top court to pause the process.
The watchdog noted in an internal document - seen by Reuters - that it had decided to give no extensions to the company to explain its position and will now issue an order in due course.
Amazon and the CCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The CCI decision is critical to Amazon's legal challenges. If the CCI rules against Amazon and revokes the 2019 approval, it could have wide-ranging ramifications on the U.S. firm's ongoing legal battle with Future, people familiar with the case say.

That's because Amazon has so far successfully used the 2019 Future unit deal to argue breach of certain contracts when the Indian company announced plans to sell its retail assets to rival Reliance Industries for $3.4 billion last year.
Future, which denies any wrongdoing, accuses Amazon of illegally interfering in its business decisions and derailing a potential deal without which it says it will face liquidation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are zeroing in on a number of hot retailers' shares as the U.S. holiday shopping season kicks into high gear this week, weighing the potential for supply chain problems against expected strong consumer demand.
The day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, Black Friday, has for years unofficially marked the start of the holiday shopping period and one of the busiest shopping days of the year.
But the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and its effect on supplies have likely driven shoppers out early, as evidenced by a recent Commerce Department report showing U.S. retail sales surged in October.
""We're in a very different place now and for the last two years. Christmas is a four-month season, starting in October,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist and head of the client portfolio management team at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) in New York.
Among other trends, the Black Friday average promotional discount is lower than in previous years, according to data compiled by Refinitiv and StyleSage Co, a data analytics platform, suggesting consumers may not see the bargains they've seen before.
But analysts have become more bullish on the holiday shopping season, according to data polled by Refinitiv, which noted that discounters, home furnishing and home improvement companies are expected to see among the strongest same-store sales growth.
Many retailers have outperformed the broader market this year. An S&P retail exchange-traded fund is up 54% since Dec. 31, compared with about a 25% gain in the S&P 500 year-to-date.
Refinitiv pointed to a number of companies facing ""difficult comparisons"" in the fourth quarter versus a year ago, when sales were strong, but that still have upbeat forecasts for this quarter, including  Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX) Inc, Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) Cos,  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD),  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU), and  Target  (NYSE:TGT).
""Last year they knocked it out of the park, and you're still seeing strong numbers, which suggests that strength and demand for the products are holding up very well,"" said Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research at Refinitiv.
Among the retailers with the best year-to-day gains are Bath & Body Works, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) Autozone and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY). 
Graphic: Retail performance YTD - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-HOLIDAYSHOPPING/SHARES/dwvkrewkqpm/chart.png 
Recent earnings reports from retailers have cited problems with supply disruptions and strategists say inventory levels could be a problem for some retailers this shopping season.
This week, Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). lowered its full-year forecast amid supply chain disruptions including factory closures, and its stock plunged about 23% on Wednesday.
Last week, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc raised its annual sales and profit forecast but global supply-chain disruptions hit its margins in the third quarter.
Online spending will be strong again this holiday season, the Refinitiv analysis also showed, so all eyes will be on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""Online is going to rule the day,"" Orlando said, and he said overall the companies that are likely to do better this season are the ones that have been able to find a way around supply logjams, such as Amazon, and possibly Target, Walmart and Costco (NASDAQ:COST). 

Shares of big department stores that typically draw heavier traffic during the holidays also will be closely watched, including Macy's (NYSE:M), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), as well as companies with consumer brand favorites, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Macy's signaled last week that it was well stocked for the holiday season.

Other data showed weekly jobless claims fell and third-quarter GDP was revised higher, while a University of Michigan survey showed consumer sentiment improved in November. 
Coronavirus infections broke records in parts of Europe on Wednesday, with investors worried the continent was again the epicenter of a pandemic that has prompted new curbs on movement.
So far this week, the Nasdaq is down about 1.3%, with investors worried that higher interest rates could hurt the valuations of tech and other growth stocks.
""Equities are under pressure from a combination of rising interest rates, more cautionary news on the earnings front, and also from COVID developments in Europe,"" said Greg Bassuk, chief executive at AXS Investments in Port Chester, New York.
The U.S. stock market will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday, and it will have a shortened session on Friday. 
Real estate led among 11 S&P 500 sector indexes with a gain of 1.3% for most of the session.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.03% to end at 35,804.38 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.23% to 4,701.46.

The watchdog's review, which focused mostly on NAB's credit card business, found that the deal would not limit competition in the sector, ACCC said in a statement. 
""NAB today is smaller in credit cards than its major bank rivals, and we don't consider adding Citi's card operations to NAB will materially change the level of competition,"" ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.

NAB, Australia's second-biggest bank, said in August it would buy Citigroup Australia Pty Ltd for about $882.24 million, as the American bank prepares to exit the region in the face of strong challenges to the old credit card business model from buy-now, pay-later companies.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Williamson County Judge Bill Gravell is the first to admit few people had heard of his small town of Taylor in Central Texas before South Korean conglomerate Samsung (KS:005930) announced it was building its new $17 billion chip factory there.
The Electronics Co Ltd plant, which is expected to produce advanced high-performance chips, is hailed by local, state and U.S. officials as an important step in shoring up domestic chip supply and reducing dependence on Chinese production.
""Today, Taylor, Texas might be better known around the world than any other city in central Texas,"" Gravell, the county's top elected official, said during a Wednesday interview.
Gravell attributed the success of Tuesday's announcement to direct collaboration with Texas Governor Greg Abbott's office, who he said got personally involved to secure the plant's electricity supply with  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE)'s Oncor Electric Delivery Co.
Gravell said Oncor's Chief Executive Allen Nye met with Samsung President Jung-bae Lee in Austin earlier this year to assure the company that industrial users on Oncor's network did not suffer outages during last winter's massive Texas snow storm.
Samsung has also struck an agreement with Canadian EPCOR Utilities Inc to build a water pipeline to the plant from  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA), 25 miles (40 km) east of Taylor, Gravell said.
""This plant will not affect any existing water sources, it's a brand new water source brought in by Samsung,"" he said.
The county judge said state officials from the economic development department also helped him navigate international business talks, recommending to him a book on Asian culture.
""I wasn't necessarily sure how to negotiate with Koreans, I've never had that experience before,"" Gravell said. ""I studied up and learned the chapters by heart.""
Samsung has not specified what the new plant will make beyond advanced logic chips which can be used to power mobile devices and autonomous vehicles.

Gravell said company executives told him they did not know the technical specifics of the chips to be manufactured at the new factory yet because today's technology might be outdated in a few years.
Samsung said the plant, which is projected to create 2,000 high-tech jobs, would start production in the second half of 2024.

Over the past week the S&P is relatively breakeven. But if you ask the average investor how they are doing they will tell you unequivocally that this weak has been downright brutal.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 04:56PM ET</span>","AT&T, Verizon agree to new precautions to address 5G air safety concerns","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -AT&T and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) on Wednesday agreed to adopt new precautionary measures to address air safety concerns raised from the planned use of C-Band spectrum for 5G wireless.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the aviation industry have raised concerns about potential interference caused by the 5G deployment with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters.
AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon said they had committed for six months to take ""additional steps to minimize energy coming from 5G base stations – both nationwide and to an even greater degree around public airports and heliports,"" and said that should address altimeter concerns.
Earlier this month, AT&T and Verizon agreed to delay commercial launch of C-band wireless service until Jan. 5 after the FAA issued a Nov. 2 bulletin warning that action may be needed to address the potential interference caused by the 5G deployment.
The FAA said Wednesday it would review the telecoms proposal, calling it ""an important and encouraging step... The FAA believes that aviation and 5G C-band wireless service can safely co-exist.""
The FCC said ""these technical mitigations represent one of the most comprehensive efforts in the world to safeguard aviation technologies.""
The FAA may issue an emergency directive to airlines by early December, and two House Democrats warned it could include ""draconian but necessary restrictions on many types of critical flight operations.""
AT&T said it was adopting the measures ""while additional evidence from radio altimeter manufacturers is evaluated. Though there is no credible evidence that a legitimate interference problem exists, we agreed to take these additional steps to alleviate any safety concerns from the FAA.""

Wireless groups argue that there have been no C-Band aviation safety issues in other countries using the spectrum.
AT&T and Verizon said the commitments will expire on July 6 ""unless credible evidence exists that real world interference would occur if the mitigations were relaxed.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland directed federal prosecutors on Wednesday to prioritize prosecution of airline passengers committing assaults and other crimes aboard aircraft. 
The Federal Aviation Administration said on Nov. 4 it had referred more than three dozen unruly passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution amid a sharp rise in onboard incidents this year.
""The Department of Justice is committed to using its resources to do its part to prevent violence, intimidation, threats of violence and other criminal behavior that endangers the safety of passengers, flight crews and flight attendants on commercial aircraft,” Garland said.
U.S. airlines have reported a record number of disruptive and sometimes violent incidents this year, and the FAA has pledged a ""zero-tolerance"" approach.
Through Nov. 23, there have been 5,338 reports of unruly passenger incidents, including 3,856 related to pandemic face-covering regulations. On Monday, the FAA proposed $161,823 in fines against eight airline passengers for alleged unruly behavior involving alcohol.
An FAA spokesman said the agency had initiated 227 enforcement cases and referred 37 to the FBI for review.
The FAA and Justice Department said they had established an information-sharing protocol for the FAA to refer unruly passenger cases to the FBI for review.
On Oct. 8, President Joe Biden said he instructed the Justice Department to ""deal"" with the rising number of violent incidents onboard planes.
A group representing major U.S. airlines, such as American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines , as well as aviation unions, asked the Justice Department in June to prosecute violent air passengers, as have some Democrats in Congress.

U.S. prosecutors in Colorado charged a 20-year-old California man with assaulting a flight attendant on an Oct. 27 American Airlines flight bound for Santa Ana, California, that forced the plane to land.
Earlier this month, a 32-year-old passenger was arrested and charged with assaulting a Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co operations agent after boarding a flight in Dallas.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) has sued a longtime employee for allegedly stealing ""scores"" of confidential documents, including some related to its COVID-19 vaccine, as she prepared to jump to a competitor.
In a complaint filed on Tuesday in San Diego federal court, Pfizer said Chun Xiao Li breached her confidentiality agreement by uploading more than 12,000 files without permission to her personal accounts and devices from her company-issued laptop.
The alleged materials include a Sept. 24 ""playbook"" containing internal assessments and recommendations about the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer's relationship with its German vaccine partner, and presentations related to cancer antibodies.
Pfizer said Li, an associate director of statistics, tried repeatedly to cover her tracks, even providing a ""decoy"" laptop to fool it into thinking what she did with the files.
Li ""has misled Pfizer about what she took, how she took it, when and why she did it, and where those files (and possibly others) can be found,"" the New York-based drugmaker said.
Pfizer said Li is resigning after 15 years at the company, and appears to have an offer to join Xencor (NASDAQ:XNCR) Inc, a California clinical-stage company focusing on treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases, on Nov. 29.
Li could not immediately be reached for comment through her LinkedIn account. Xencor is not a defendant in the lawsuit, and declined to comment.
Pfizer said competitors have been trying to recruit its employees ""relentlessly, especially during 2021.""

In an order late on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo temporarily blocked Li from using Pfizer's trade secrets, and said the company's lawyers can review accounts and devices where she might have stored them.
The judge scheduled a Dec. 9 hearing to consider a longer injunction.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed higher Wednesday, as investors swopped in to buy the dip in tech following weakness earlier in the session amid concerns about rising U.S. Treasury yields.
The S&P 500 rose 0.23%, but had been down nearly 1% intraday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.03, or 9 points, and the Nasdaq gained 0.44%.
Tech turned positive to help the broader market cut losses after starting the session on the backfoot as a slew of positive economic data and signs of persistently elevated inflation stoked concerns about sooner monetary policy action from the Federal Reserve.
The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, was up 0.6% on October, below the 0.7% rate expected, but ahead of prior’s month 0.4%. That took the annualized rate for October to 5%, well above the Fed’s 2% target.
The labor market continues to show progress toward the Fed’s maximum employment goal as jobless claims fell to lowest level since 1969.
The Department of Labor reported Wednesday that 199,000 people filed for unemployment insurance, down 71,000 from the prior week's upwardly revised 271,000. That was well below consensus for claims to fall to 260,000.
Economists, however, shrugged off the huge drop in claims as a one-off, which “were pushed down by a seasonal adjustment quirk,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said.  “It will substantially reverse next week, with claims rebounding to about 250K.”
Energy stocks added to recent gains even as oil prices eased following data showing an unexpected build in crude stockpiles.   
 Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG),  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) were among the biggest gainers.
Oil prices will remain in focus next week ahead of the OPEC+ meeting following threats by some members to delay plans to boost production after the U.S. and other major oil producing nations said they would tap emergency oil reserves to curb prices.   
""OPEC+ could even suspend its planned production hikes for two and a half months now without causing any shortage on the oil market."" Commerzbank said in a note. ""Next week’s meeting will reveal whether OPEC+ will now actually increase its production to a lesser extent, as delegates have threatened.""
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, moved off session lows to helped consumer discretionary stocks pare losses following a retail-led slide.
Gap (NYSE:GPS) plunged 24% after the retailer slashed its full-year outlook following third-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street estimates as rising costs and supplier chain woes weighed.
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) also reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results as rising labor costs dented profit, sending its share price 29% lower.
On the monetary policy front, the minutes of the Fed's November meeting showed that some Federal Reserve policymakers were in favor of a faster pace of bond tapering to provide the central bank with plenty of room to hike rates amid concerns about inflation pressures. 
In another sign that Fed members are growing concerned about inflation, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said Wednesday that she would be open to speeding up the pace of the Fed's bond tapering if inflation remained elevated and jobs growth remained strong."
1222,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 03:46PM ET</span>",Orange says to replace Richard as CEO by Jan. 31,"By Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS (Reuters) -Orange, France's biggest telecoms operator, said on Wednesday it would find a successor to its chairman and CEO Stephane Richard by Jan. 31 after a Paris appeal court convicted him of complicity of misuse of public funds.
Richard's conviction is a big blow for the former high-ranking civil servant, who has always denied any wrongdoing. The court's verdict, which handed him a one-year suspended prison sentence, is precipitating his departure from the group, which he has led for the past 11 years. 
The board of directors accepted Richard's resignation in a meeting that ended at around 1900 GMT.
He will remain in office on an interim basis while the company looks for a replacement, the company said. It was not clear whether the group intended to separate the roles of chairman and CEO. 
Richard had earlier said it was up to the board to decide whether he should keep his job. He called the court's ruling ""deeply unfair"" and said he would appeal. 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has repeatedly said that the government position is that bosses of state-owned companies should quit if convicted of a crime. 
The French state owns a combined 23% stake in the former monopoly and the government's intention up to now has been to separate the roles of CEO and chairman.
Richard's current term formally expires in May 2022. He had already said that he would not seek to stay on as CEO but that he was willing to remain as chairman. 
Earlier on Wednesday, Richard, who also received a 50,000 euro fine but was cleared of the charge of complicity of fraud, hastily left court, accompanied by Orange's communications head Béatrice Mandine. 
The case concerned a 400 million-euro ($450 million) French state payout to the late tycoon Bernard Tapie in 2008. Tapie had accused the government of defrauding him when he sold a stake in sportswear group Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) to a state-backed bank in 1992. 
At the time of the 2008 settlement, Richard was chief of staff to then French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, who is now President of the European Central Bank. Lagarde, who had also denied wrongdoing, was convicted of negligence over the affair in December 2016.
Judge Sophie Clément said Richard had ""committed grave acts by favouring the interests of Bernard Tapie at the expense of those of the state.""
Richard is credited with having improved relations between employees and executives at Orange in the early part of his tenure, when the company was reeling from a wave of staff suicides. 

He also helped bolster its financial results after the arrival in 2012 of rival Iliad's low-cost brand Free, which triggered a protracted war in the mobile business, and launched a new online banking service. 
However, Orange's stock price has not improved during Richard's tenure. Its shares, which traded at around 11 euros when he first became CEO, were little moved after the court verdict and stood at just under 10 euros.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, was up 0.6% on October, below the 0.7% rate expected, but ahead of prior’s month 0.4%. That took the annualized rate for October to 5%, well above the Fed’s 2% target.
The labor market continues to show progress toward the Fed’s maximum employment goal as jobless claims fell to lowest level since 1969.
The Department of Labor reported Wednesday that 199,000 people filed for unemployment insurance, down 71,000 from the prior week's upwardly revised 271,000. That was well below consensus for claims to fall to 260,000.
Economists, however, shrugged off the huge drop in claims as a one-off, which “were pushed down by a seasonal adjustment quirk,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said.  “It will substantially reverse next week, with claims rebounding to about 250K.”
Energy stocks added to recent gains even as oil prices gave up gains.
 Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG),  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) were among the biggest gainers.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, moved off session lows to helped consumer discretionary stocks pare losses following a retail-led slide.
Gap (NYSE:GPS) plunged 25% after the retailer slashed its full-year outlook following third-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street estimates as rising costs and supplier chain woes weighed.
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) also reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results as rising labor costs dented profit, sending its share price 29% lower.
On the monetary policy front, the minutes of the Fed's November meeting showed that some Federal Reserve policymakers were in favor of a faster pace of bond tapering to provide the central bank with plenty of room to hike rates amid concerns about inflation pressures. 
In another sign that Fed members are growing concerned about inflation, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said Wednesday that she would be open to speeding up the pace of the Fed's bond tapering if inflation remained elevated and jobs growth remained strong."

Investing.com —  Anaplan  Inc (NYSE:PLAN) shares plunged 15% on Wednesday after its third-quarter earnings prompted a downgrade from Piper Sandler and several other firms to lower price targets.
Despite the company reporting a better than expected EPS and revenue, Anaplan revealed a widening GAAP operating loss compared to the previous year. 
Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight, saying that the results were mixed, with Anaplan's revenue beat being overshadowed by decelerating billings and performance obligation growth metrics. In addition, Bracelin described PLAN's Q4 guidance as ""tepid."" As a result, he lowered the firm's price target on Anaplan to $48 from $77.
However, Piper Sandler wasn't the only one to lower the stock's price target, with KeyBanc, Barclays, UBS, Truist, Mizuho Securities, Goldman Sachs, Loop Capital, Wells Fargo, Cannacord, Morgan Stanley, and Jefferies all adding to the pressure on Anaplan shares.
Despite the multiple price target reductions, the comments on Anaplan weren't all negative. For example, despite dropping its target price to $70 from $80, Truist kept its buy rating, with analyst Terry Tillman telling investors they would ""look past this glass half empty rhetoric and point to a variety of constructive/improving metrics,"" including new customer activity improving, relatively strong retention rates, and improved sales linearity."
1227,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 02:37PM ET</span>","Nordstrom, Gap plunge with Street worried about rivals chipping away share","(Reuters) - Shares of  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) slumped more than 20% on Wednesday as warnings of product shortages during the crucial holiday season raised fears that the retailers were losing out to better-prepared competitors.
A bunch of Wall Street analysts lowered their price targets, with  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) nearly halving its target on Gap and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) making the most aggressive cut on Nordstrom. 
On Tuesday, Nordstrom said its off-price business - Nordstrom Rack - has suffered severe shortages of women's apparel and shoes, while Gap flagged up to $650 million in lost sales and cut its annual forecast.
Nordstrom was downgraded to ""hold"" from ""buy"" at Jefferies, and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said Nordstrom Rack is not positioned well competitively compared to rivals such as TJX (NYSE:TJX) Cos and Burlington Stores (NYSE:BURL).
""Nordstrom will need to re-evaluate its strategy of primarily using Rack to clear end of season goods from the brands that it sells at full-price stores,"" the brokerage said.
Nordstrom executives on a post-earnings call said they had not responded ""as quickly and as aggressively"" enough to have sufficient inventory.
In contrast, other retailers, including  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO), Macy's (NYSE:M) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT), have chartered container ships, used air freight or ordered in advance to overcome supply-chain bottlenecks to stock their shelves for the holidays.
""In this market, retailers have been rewarded more than usual when they exceed expectations and continue to raise guidance. Gap did the exact opposite and this market has been brutal to retailers who have struggled,"" CFRA Research analyst Zachary Warring said.

Shares of Gap and Nordstrom were on pace to open at their lowest in about a year.

This is due to rising investor concerns regarding supply chain bottlenecks amid strong market demand. However, with substantial inventory in place, analysts expect the company’s sales and earnings to increase over the holiday season, indicating higher returns on investment in the company. Let’s discuss.Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM), which is based in San Francisco, is the world’s largest digital-first, design-led and sustainable home retailer. Its famous brands include Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma, and Rejuvenation. For its fiscal third quarter, ended October 31, 2021, WSM’s revenues increased 16% year-over-year to $2.05 billion. This can be attributed to a 67% rise in e-commerce sales. Its gross profit came in at $895.49 million, up 26.9% from its year-ago value. Its net earnings improved 23.7% from the prior-year quarter to $249.52 million, while its EPS increased 29.5% from the same period last year to $3.29, surpassing analyst estimates by 4.8%.
However, WSM shares have retreated 2% in price since the company’s quarterly earnings release on November 18, despite its reporting impressive financials. Rising investor concerns regarding supply chain bottlenecks as seasonal demand increases have caused the shares to slump.
Nevertheless, WSM is expected to maintain its growth streak regardless of the temporary headwinds, thanks to its substantial inventory levels and leading market share. The company’s merchandise inventory increased 13% year-over-year to $2.18 billion as of October 31. Furthermore, WSM’s merchandise inventory improved 24.6% from January 31, 2021, to October 31, 2021.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Indonesian courier startup J&T Express has raised $2.5 billion in a funding round at a valuation of $20 billion, ahead of its plan to list in Hong Kong as soon as the first quarter of next year, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
J&T's main backers -- Boyu Capital, Hillhouse Capital Group and Sequoia Capital China -- and Chinese gaming and internet giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) were among investors in the latest fundraising, said two of the people.
The funding round also attracted new investors including SIG China, the Chinese investment arm of proprietary trading and broker-dealer firm Susquehanna International Group, said one of them.
The fundraising by J&T comes as it seeks to expand in China and Latin America, besides listing in Hong Kong.
J&T, Boyu, Hillhouse and SIG China did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Sequoia China and Tencent declined to comment.
The people declined to be named as the information is confidential.
J&T is aiming to raise $1 billion via the Hong Kong float, one of the people said. It has mandated Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), China International Capital Corp and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) for the planned IPO, the people said. 
The banks declined to comment. 
J&T was launched in 2015 by two senior executives of Chinese smartphone maker Oppo. The funders used their experience in distribution to build up a massive logistics network across Southeast Asia targeting the booming e-commerce business.
The company entered China in 2020, and it competes with firms including S.F. Holding, ZTO Express (NYSE:ZTO) and the in-house logistics networks of e-commerce giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com in that market.
It will be able to reinforce its presence in the world's second largest economy once it completes a $1.1 billion acquisition of the express delivery business of local firm  BEST  (NYSE:BEST) Inc, which was announced in late October. 
The firm is also eyeing expansion in Latin America and is in talks to work with Southeast Asian e-commerce firm Shopee, a top client, said two additional sources.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Wednesday it is moving to terminate its trade retaliation case against India after Washington and New Delhi agreed on a global tax deal transition arrangement that will withdraw India's digital services tax.
USTR said the agreement between the U.S. Treasury and India's Finance Ministry applies the same terms agreed to with Austria, Britain, France, Italy, Spain and Turkey, but with a slightly later implementation date.
The pact follows an October agreement by 136 countries in principle to withdraw their digital services taxes as part of a sweeping global tax deal agreed on Oct. 8 to adopt a 15% global minimum corporate tax and grant some taxing rights on large profitable companies to market countries.
The countries agreed not to impose new digital services taxes before the OECD tax deal is implemented by the end of 2023, but arrangements needed to be made with seven countries that had existing digital taxes largely targeting U.S. technology giants including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The deal between Washington and New Delhi brings all seven countries into a transition arrangement and came after U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai concluded a trip to India to discuss increasing trade cooperation on agricultural and other goods.

Under the agreed withdrawal terms, the countries can continue to collect digital services taxes until the new regime is put in place. But for Turkey and the European countries, any taxes collected after January 2022 that exceed what companies would have to pay under the new rules would be credited against the firms' future tax liabilities in those countries.
USTR said for India, the starting date for those credits was pushed back to April 1, 2022, with a three-month extension beyond the end of 2023 if the OECD tax deal is not implemented by that time.

(Reuters) -Deere & Co on Wednesday shrugged off the hit from a month-long worker strike to forecast record earnings for next year, banking on demand from farmers flush with cash after a run-up in grain prices.
The world's largest farm equipment maker also capped a year riddled with supply chain problems with its highest-ever profit of $5.96 billion, sending its shares up the most in nine months. 
Higher corn and soybean prices this year have brightened the financial outlook for farmers, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture projecting net farm income to rise to an eight-year high in 2021.
That boom has driven up sales of farm equipment despite price hikes by manufacturers. Deere (NYSE:DE) said its North American order books were full or nearly full for most of its large farm equipment heading into fiscal 2022.
""We expect demand to exceed the industry's ability to produce for a second consecutive year as supply-based delays continue to constrain shipments,"" Deere's Ag & Turf business President Cory Reed said.
The supply constraints are also expected to prevent any immediate benefit from U.S. President Joe Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure plan, Deere said.
The Illinois-based company expects annual earnings between $6.5 billion and $7 billion, the midpoint which was higher than analysts' estimates of $6.72 billion, as per Refinitiv. 
""Unlike previous boom/bust replacement cycles, the agriculture equipment industry is in the midst of a much smoother demand environment,"" Third Bridge senior analyst Patrick Donnelly said.

Deere's sales of its large and some medium equipment jumped 23% in the fourth quarter, while sales of smaller farm and turf equipment rose 17%..
The company said it expected the worker strike, which straddled the fourth and current quarter and ended last week, to have little impact on 2022 margins.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 cut losses Tuesday, as cyclical sectors rallied and tech eased off session lows on dip-buying activity, though rising U.S. Treasury yields weighed on sentiment on the sector.   
The S&P 500 fell 0.36%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.20%, or 70 points, the Nasdaq, which fell more than 1%, was down about 0.6%.
Tech and communications services – growth sectors of the market that tend to include stocks with higher valuation – fell out of favor as rising U.S. Treasury yields weighed on sentiment.
The selloff in tech has been driven by the “re-steepening in the yield curve as the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year Treasury yields moved back to 105 basis points in a relatively short order,” Mark Luschini, chief investment officer at Janney Montgomery Scott, told Investing.com in an interview on Tuesday.
Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON),  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), were some of the hardest hit growth names, with the latter also pressured by concerns about future growth.
Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) fell more than 15% after warning of a slowdown in revenue growth as the pandemic-fueled boost to user growth is expected to slow as employees return to the office.
“While we're positive on Zoom's strategic initiatives and investments in key growth areas, we find it tougher to like a stock with more sharply decelerating growth and incremental pressure on profitability,” Deutsche Bank said in a note as it slashed its price target on the Zoom to $280 from $350.
Big tech including – Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) – was also caught up in the rising rate storm,  but are expected to be bought on the dip.
“[W]hen somewhat frothy expectations build valuations up to the point where names that are among the leadership in tech are increasingly vulnerable to a pullback in their share price, [investors] should use those opportunities to add to positions if they're underweight or have established positions,” Luschini added.
Consumer discretionary also weighed on the broader market, paced by a 12% slump in  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) after the electronics retailer’s weaker-than-expected holiday comparable sales offset third-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Cyclical corners of the market including financials, energy and industrials racked gains amid a rotation from value to growth.
Energy jumped more than 3% as oil prices rallied despite President Joe Biden saying Tuesday the U.S. will release 50 million barrels of oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in tandem with other major oil consuming countries to curb rising energy prices.
“It will take time, but before long, you should see the price of gas fall where you fill up your tank,” Biden said on Tuesday. "

LONDON (Reuters) - A patch of virtual real estate in the online world Decentraland sold for a record $2.4 million worth of cryptocurrency, the buyer crypto investor Tokens.com and Decentraland said on Tuesday.
Decentraland is an online environment - also called a ""metaverse"" - where users can buy land, visit buildings, walk around and meet people as avatars.
Such environments have grown in popularity https://www.reuters.com/business/metaverse-bet-crypto-rich-investors-snap-up-virtual-real-estate-2021-04-19 this year, as the pandemic caused people to spend more time online.
Interest surged last month when Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) changed its name to Meta to reflect its focus on developing virtual reality products for the metaverse.
Decentraland is a specific type of metaverse that uses blockchain. Land and other items in Decentraland are sold in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a kind of crypto asset. 
Crypto enthusiasts buy land there as a speculative investment, using Decentraland's cryptocurrency, MANA.
A subsidiary of Tokens.com, called the Metaverse Group, bought a patch of real estate for 618,000 MANA on Monday, which was around $2,428,740 at the time, a Decentraland spokesman and a statement by Tokens.com said.
Reuters also saw the land's purchase recorded on the NFT marketplace OpenSea.
Decentraland said it was the most expensive purchase of a plot of virtual real estate on the platform.
The land is in the ""Fashion Street"" area of Decentraland's map and Tokens.com said it would be used to host digital fashion events and sell virtual clothing for avatars.
It is made of 116 smaller parcels, measuring 52.5 square feet each, making the land 6,090 virtual square feet in size.
Andrew Kiguel, CEO of Tokens.com, said the assets would complement the real estate already held by Metaverse Group.

In June, a plot of virtual land in Decentraland sold for 1,295,000 MANA, worth $913,228 at the time. The buyers built a virtual shopping centre to sell digital clothing, but Reuters has visited this site multiple times since and not seen any shoppers.
MANA is highly volatile. It has gained around 400% this month according to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), spiking after Facebook's name change.

Therefore, drug development companies are showing an increasing interest in the field. Given the industry’s growth potential, Wall Street analysts expect stocks in this space—MindMed (MNMD), Cybin (CYBN), and Field Trip Health (FTRP)—to soar in price. So, let’s take a closer look at these names.Psychedelics are drugs that have a psychotropic effect on the senses. The substances, which can be natural or made in laboratories, have recently been lauded as treatments for mental illnesses. Psychedelics, such as “magic mushrooms” and MDMA are being used to treat patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance addiction. Last month, federal funding was granted for a psilocybin study for treating tobacco addiction, indicating the acceptance of the drug as a potential medication.
Over the past couple of years, drug development companies have rushed to seek authoritative approval for MDMA and psilocybin, adding to their role as disruptors in the nervous system disorder treatment field. In addition, the sector is also geared at creating more jobs.
Indeed, as per a Data Bridge market research report, the psychedelic drugs market is expected to grow at a 13.3% CAGR to $7.57 billion in 2028. Considering the industry’s growth potential, Wall Street analysts expect psychedelic stocks Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. (MNMD), Cybin Inc. (CYBN), and Field Trip Health Ltd.

Read more to find out.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) are two prominent companies in the consumer goods industry. Cincinnati, Ohio-based PG sells packaged goods through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, and department stores. The company operates in five business segments—beauty; grooming; health care; fabric & home care; and baby, feminine & family care. In comparison, New York City-based CL sells consumer products that are manufactured under its oral, personal, homecare, and pet nutrition segments. It markets and sells its products to various retailers, wholesalers, e-commerce, and distributors.
Amid the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, rising inflation, and supply chain logjams, U.S. retail sales have been rising since August, with a 1.7% month-over-month increase in October, owing to declining jobless claims and rising consumer spending ahead of the holiday season.
Further, the inelastic demand for consumer goods across business cycles has been helping the industry offset the consequences of high inflation. Investor optimism in this space is evident in the First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX ETF’s (FXG) 3.7% gains versus SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 3.3% returns over the past month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's highest court ruled on Tuesday that JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) is entitled to insurance coverage for $140 million of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settlement with the former Bear Stearns Cos over improper mutual fund trading.
Reversing a lower court ruling, the Court of Appeals ruled 6-1 that the $140 million derived from estimates of wrongful customer profits and investor harm, and was not a ""penalty"" that would excuse JPMorgan's insurers from providing coverage.
Bear Stearns had agreed in 2006 to pay a $90 million civil fine and give up $160 million of ill-gotten gains to resolve SEC charges it let favored hedge fund customers conduct market timing and late trading from 1999 to 2003.
Market timing involved rapid trading in violation of funds' rules and at the expense of ordinary investors, while late trading involved illegal after-hours trading at stale prices.
Banks, mutual fund firms and individuals paid billions of dollars to settle regulatory probes of the practices, which were first highlighted in 2003 by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan bought in 2008, had sought insurance coverage for $140 million of the disgorgement, excluding $20 million of revenue it had generated from the improper trading.
Insurers, including Lloyd's of London, Travelers (NYSE:TRV) and Vigilant, said the $140 million did not represent client gains under the policies, and that public policy made the amount uninsurable.
Chief Judge Janet DiFiore, however, wrote for Tuesday's majority that the insurers failed to show that Bear Stearns could have reasonably believed its policies precluded coverage. 
She also said that unlike the fine, which Bear Stearns was required to treat as a penalty for tax purposes, the $140 million served a ""compensatory"" rather than a punitive goal.

JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said the largest U.S. bank was pleased with the decision. Lawyers for the insurers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The case is JP Morgan Securities Inc et al v Vigilant Insurance Co et al, New York Court of Appeals, No. 61.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Columbia University agreed to pay $12.5 million to settle a lawsuit by students who claimed it failed to refund fees when it moved classes online in the spring 2020 semester because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A preliminary settlement of the proposed class action was filed on Tuesday night, and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan.
Columbia will refund $8.56 million in fees for student activities, health services and the use of its gyms, libraries and other facilities, and pay nearly $4 million to avoid the risks of further litigation.
The Ivy League school had previously given a partial fee refund. Roy Willey, a lawyer for the students, said the $8.56 million was 100% of what the university still owed. Columbia denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.
At least 261 lawsuits have been filed against U.S. colleges and universities over their alleged failure to refund tuition and fees when the pandemic forced them into remote learning, according to the law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.
Many of these lawsuits have been dismissed, including a case against Harvard University in June, because the schools had not contractually promised in-person instruction and access to on-campus facilities.
In February, Furman dismissed the Columbia students' tuition refund claims, deferring to the school's decisionmaking about maintaining its academic standards while promoting the public health, but let them seek fee refunds.
""The pandemic has imposed serious challenges on sustaining the teaching, research, patient care and public service at the core of Columbia's mission,"" Columbia said in a statement on Wednesday about the settlement. ""Throughout this period, we have been committed to meeting the needs of our students.""

Lawyers for the students may seek up to one-third of the settlement fund for legal fees.
The case is In re Columbia University Tuition Refund Action, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-03208.

HAMBURG (Reuters) -Volkswagen's top committee did not make a decision on the future of Chief Executive Herbert Diess at a meeting on Tuesday, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday, with one describing talks as ""on a knife-edge."" 
Diess and the German automaker's powerful union representatives have clashed in recent weeks over his management style and electrification strategy, after he warned jobs could be lost if the process was not managed well.
""This topic is so hot, it is on a knife-edge. I can't say anything further,"" said one source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
""As expected, there is nothing new,"" a second source said.
Sources told Reuters on Tuesday the supervisory board's eight-person executive committee would likely need more time to find a compromise that would satisfy all parties.
The ongoing uncertainty over leadership and strategy at Europe's largest carmaker has left its stock performance trailing behind competitors in the past six months.
Its shares are down 18% since May, compared with an 11% rise at BMW and Stellantis, a 55% increase at Ford, and an 83% jump at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), whose success Diess has frequently raised as a sign of why Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) must transform more quickly towards electrification.

An agreement on the committee - which includes works council head Daniela Cavallo and representatives for the majority shareholder Porsche and Piech families - could depend on whether Diess agrees to change his management style, the sources said.
Sources close to negotiations said a resolution would likely come as part of a package including the announcement of new board members, details on job prospects for employees, and investment plans for the group, Reuters reported on Monday.

Investing.com — Ocuphire Pharma Inc (NASDAQ:OCUP) shares are soaring Wednesday after H.C. Wainwright initiated coverage of it with a buy rating.
Analyst Matthew Caufield set a price target of $26 on the stock, outlining four reasons for doing so. 
The company's shares are currently 38% above Tuesday's close at $4.81 but initially rose to a high of $5.50.
The first of the four reasons for the rating is Ocuphire's phase 3 MIRA-2 trial's positive topline results for Nyxol. The analyst said that it presents an ""opportune timing to get into the name prior to further program validation,"" which it expects in the near term.
He also said a key differentiation of using Nyxol was another positive for the stock, adding that Ocuphire's APX3330 treatment for diabetic retinopathy is undervalued.
""With Ocuphire completing a reverse merger with legacy oncology platform Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, and listing on NASDAQ in November 2020, we maintain investors have yet to fully engage with Ocuphire’s Nyxol story and upcoming catalysts,"" Caufield said.

The decision, Health Canada said, came after it had completed an inspection of the facility in Baltimore, Maryland, along with the European Medicines Agency and South African Health Products Regulatory Authority. 
The beleaguered facility has been under regulatory scrutiny since a manufacturing error earlier this year ruined millions of doses of J&J's COVID-19 vaccine. 
Canada in June said it would not accept any doses made at the plant until it completed its own on-site inspection. 
The three regulators found the facility to be compliant with good manufacturing practices, Health Canada said on Wednesday.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April halted operations at the facility after J&J's vaccine was found to be contaminated with material from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 shots, which were also being manufactured there at the time. 
The FDA's inspection had turned up a long list of problems, including peeling paint, shoddy cleanups, and poorly-trained staff.
Use of many doses of the J&J vaccine made at the Emergent facility is still not cleared by the FDA, although the agency has since cleared uses of batches manufactured prior to the production halt. 

The FDA, Emergent, and J&J did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. 
Earlier on Wednesday, Canada said it had granted full approval to the J&J vaccine.

Shipments at the company jumped nearly 27%, allowing it to grab a global PC market share of 17.4%, up 3%, according to IDC’s quarterly personal computing device tracker.
Sales in the period ended October 29 rose 21% to top $28 billion, driven by growth in all business units, customer segments and geographies, as well as broad strength across commercial PCs, servers and storage, the company said.
Sales, and adjusted profit per share of $2.37, easily beat estimates, a feat also helped by the release of Windows 11, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) new OS.
Times have never been better for PC-makers like Dell and HP (NYSE:HPQ) as the pandemic made some of their devices a must-have in a world that has pivoted to a hybrid model of work-from-home and work-from-office. In September, Dell said annual revenue would increase 3% to 4% through 2026.
Fourth-quarter net revenue at rival HP grew over 9%, to around $17 billion.
As in HP’s case, companies looking to upgrade their systems drove Dell revenue. The client solutions business, home to its hardware devices, rose 35%, to $16.5 billion.
Sales to consumers were up 21%, while PC sales to business and government agencies jumped 40%, to over $12 billion, the highest in company’s history, Dell said.
Revenue from the Infrastructure Solutions Group, which includes most of the company’s technology services, rose 5%, to $8.4 billion.

Therefore, we think the recent price dips in fundamentally sound healthcare stocks  Pfizer  (PFE),  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT), and Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) provide a perfect buying opportunity. So, read on.An aging population, improvements in drugs and therapeutics to treat chronic diseases, the integration of advanced technologies, and rising healthcare spending should propel the healthcare sector’s growth. Furthermore, the growing trend of preventive healthcare, which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, bodes well for healthcare providers.
According to a Monthly National Health Spending report, expenditure increased 6.3% year-over-year to $4.09 trillion in September 2021. Also, with high GDP growth, health spending now accounts for nearly 17.5% of GDP. The global healthcare and pharma market is expected to reach $1.58 trillion by 2027, registering a 4% CAGR. And investors’ interest in the healthcare sector is evident in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLV) 16.8% gains year-to-date.
Therefore, fundamentally strong healthcare stocks Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A), which have suffered price declines lately, could be ideal picks now.

But we think Essent Group (NYSE:ESNT) is well-positioned to reap the benefits of the economic recovery and the strong housing market. Read on.COVID-19 posed a series of problems for mortgage lenders as mortgage rates fell to historic lows, and lenders were flooded with refinancing requests. Many lenders had no choice but to raise rates. And it soon became clear that without a steady flow of income, many homeowners who had lost their jobs would struggle to stay current on their mortgage payments.
Nevertheless, the housing markets had a great year despite the uncertainty as people spent heavily on new homes seeking to improve their remote lifestyles. The 30-year, 15-year, and 10-year mortgage rates have held steady for six straight days now. Furthermore, according to a CNBC report, mortgage originations to buy a home are expected to rise 9% to a record of $1.73 trillion in 2022.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally strong mortgage finance company  Essent Group Ltd . (ESNT). Conversely, we think Rocket Companies, Inc.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened with fresh losses on Wednesday, after the strongest weekly jobless claims numbers in over 50 years stoked fears of an accelerated tightening of monetary policy and prompted investors to take money off the table ahead of the long holiday weekend.
Initial jobless claims plummeted to 199,000 last week, their lowest since 1969, in what was interpreted as a sign of an increasingly strong labor market where companies are having to work hard to keep staff. Continuing jobless claims rose, however.  Core durable goods orders also held up well in October, and September's numbers were revised moderately higher, although declines in the more volatile aerospace and defense segments meant that overall durable goods orders registered back-to-back monthly declines for the first time this year.
Meanwhile, core personal consumer expenditures - the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation - rose 4.1% on the year in October, up from 3.7% in September and a fresh reminder of the increasing pressure on the Fed to reverse this year's spike in prices.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 143 points, or 0.4%, at 35,670 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite, which had been hit harder than the other two indices on Tuesday by rising capital market rates, underperformed again with a drop of 1.0%.
On a heavy morning for data, gross domestic product growth in the third quarter was also revised down marginally to an annualized rate of 2.1% from an initial estimate of 2.2%, with an eye-catching rise in wholesale inventories that testified to the mad scramble for goods ahead of the holiday season. 
Even that scramble hasn't been enough to save some retailers, however. Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) joined Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN),  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) in falling heavily after reporting a quarter characterized by higher costs, thinner margins and risks of product shortages in the next few weeks. Gap stock fell 20% and Nordstrom stock fell 23%. Software company Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) got similarly harsh treatment, the stock falling 15% after it lowered its billings guidance.
There was better news manufacturers, such as  Deere & Co  (NYSE:DE), whose upbeat profit forecast for the financial year just started dispelled concerns about the impact of a lengthy strike that resulted in a substantial wage hike for its UAW workforce. Deere stock rose 5.2%.
And the gains were even sharper among PC makers, whose quarterly numbers showed them continuing to cash in on pandemic-driven demand trends. HP (NYSE:HPQ) stock rose 10.6% to a six-month high, while Dell  (NYSE:DELL) stock rose 4.5%. Both companies issued guidance above Wall Street consensus.

So, the question is, is it wise to bet on the stock now on the back of the company’s consistent product and services innovations? Let’s find out.Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in San Jose, Calif., is a well-known technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells internet protocol-based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology industry. The company’s total revenue increased 8.1% year-over-year to $12.90 billion for its fiscal first quarter, ended October 30, 2021. However, its revenue missed the consensus estimate marginally. While its net income increased 37.1% year-over-year to $2.98 billion, its EPS came in at $0.70, up 37.3% year-over-year.
CSCO’s shares have declined 3.8% since the results were reported on November 17, to close yesterday’s trading session at $55.30. This is primarily because due to the company's tepid guidance provided by the company. CSCO expects $0.64 - $0.68 per share in profit, or $0.80 - $0.82 on an adjusted basis, for its fiscal second quarter.

Thus, we think popular shipping stocks ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM),  Matson  (NYSE:MATX), Costamare (NYSE:CMRE), and Danaos Corporation (NYSE:DAC), which have outperformed the broader market so far this year, could rally further. So, let’s examine these names.Shipping container rates have been surging since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, exacerbated by supply bottlenecks and increased waiting times. While retail and manufacturing companies have witnessed increased production and supply costs amid surging shipping rates over the past 18 months, shipping and logistics companies have reported a sharp uptick in their profits.
Since the impending holiday season is spurring consumer spending, shipping rates are expected to increase further in the coming months. Given the steady economic recovery, rising household income, and falling unemployment rate, the National Retail Federation expects holiday spending in the United States to increase between 8.5% -10.5% year-over-year in 2021.
Renowned shipping companies ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (ZIM), Matson, Inc. (MATX),  Costamare Inc .

Investing.com – Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) stock slumped 25% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as higher labor costs and expenses incurred to meet the surprise comeback in demand kept the retailer’s third-quarter profit short of the estimates.
Inventory, particularly of women’s apparel and shoes, came up short of the consumer demand, and the company lost sales in the third quarter.
President and Chief Brand Officer Pete Nordstrom said the company is working to better align inventory levels with customer needs to meet holiday demand. One of the ways the company is doing this is by placing orders to its own vendors earlier so products are delivered earlier, Nordstrom said.  
Total selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, rose some 230 basis points compared to the same period last year as the company rushed to meet demand amid labor cost pressures. Earnings per share were thus only 39 cents, falling well short of the 56 cents analysts expected.
Net sales rose 18%, to $3.53 billion in the third quarter, beating estimates.
The company reaffirmed its annual outlook, saying revenue should grow 35% year-on-year on top of 2020’s over $10 billion.

GENEVA (Reuters) - As children and adolescents are at lower risk of severe COVID-19 disease, countries should prioritise adults and sharing vaccine doses with the COVAX programme to bring supplies to poorer countries, the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday.
Some rare cases of heart inflammation called myocarditis have been reported in younger men who received vaccines based on mRNA technoloy -  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) BioNtech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) - but these were generally mild and responded to treatment, it said.
Although that risk had not been fully determined, it was less than the risk of myocarditis linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, it said.
The WHO's interim guidance was issued as more regulatory agencies authorise certain vaccines for use in children, including the United States, China, European Union, India and Israel, and most recently Canada last week. 
""As children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults, unless they are in a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19, it is less urgent to vaccinate them than older people, those with chronic health conditions and health workers,"" the WHO said.
Children can experience ""long COVID-19"" with prolonged symptoms but this was still under investigation, it said.
Several risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children have been reported including older age, obesity and pre-existing conditions including type 2 diabetes, asthma and heart disease, it added.
Maintaining education for all school-aged children should be an important priority during the pandemic, although transmission mitigation measures might be needed in schools, the WHO said.

Given vaccine supply constraints, immunisation programmes should focus on protecting groups at high risk of hospitalisation and death, the WHO said. 
""As many parts of the world face extreme vaccine shortages, countries with high coverage in at-risk populations should prioritize global sharing of COVID-19 vaccines before vaccinating children, adolescents,"" it said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turks attempting to buy iPhones and other electronics received online error messages on Wednesday, including from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s local website, after a historic 15% plunge in the lira the day before caused havoc for prices. 
The currency slipped back towards its record low on Wednesday, driven by worries over broader fallout for the economy after President Tayyip Erdogan defended recent sharp rate cuts despite widespread criticism and calls for a reversal.
The lira has lost 43% of its value this year and more than 22% since the beginning of last week alone. 
In turn, goods priced in the local currency have seen an effective sharp discount compared to prices elsewhere, with retailers struggling to keep up with price adjustments amid the market turmoil. 
A Turkish spokesperson for Apple was not immediately available to comment. 
Apple's Turkish website stopped sales of most products, displaying a ""Not currently available"" message, a Reuters query showed. The local prices of phones and computers were some 10% below U.S. prices following the sudden depreciation in the lira.
A sales representative at an Istanbul Apple store said people were thinking of electronics as an investment as much as items to use.
""It is pretty surreal with the economy and all, but people see it as a store of value and flock to stores. They know they'll be able to sell it a year later for more than what they paid,"" the person said, requesting anonymity. 
THE WORST AND  BEST  (NYSE:BEST) TIME TO BUY
Customers were flocking to upmarket import brands, primarily electronics and cosmetics, a Turkish e-commerce company official said. 
The lira's meltdown coincides with Black Friday sales and the start of new-year discounting, stoking fears that some consumer goods would not be available or face big price hikes.
""Most marketplaces are asking their big sellers to keep the prices steady and refrain from increases, at least during the discount week. As both the sellers and the marketplace need each other, sellers oblige,"" an e-commerce official based in Istanbul told Reuters. 
Caner, a graphic designer in Istanbul in the market for an electric scooter, said: ""It is the worst time to spend money, but there won't be a better time. Prices may look expensive now, but they are cheaper than what they're going to be next week."" 
Overall, shopkeepers in Istanbul were gloomy.
""We are waiting for surprises. What are we going to do?"" said Sami, a fishmonger. ""We live in a rented house, there is also gas, electricity, water. I don't know how to deal with it.""

Ercument Tepe, a hairdresser, said he kept his shop lights off but still had an 800-lira ($63) electricity bill.
""I even close the shop at night without having had a single customer in the day, but the bill is 800 lira. It is impossible not to go crazy,"" he said.

Deere expects record net income for fiscal 2022 of between $6.5 billion and $7 billion, compared to the average estimate of $6.66 billion by 17 analysts, the Moline, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The tractor maker posted fourth-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates, though revenue for the period fell short of expectations for the first time in more than two years.
“Looking ahead, we expect demand for farm and construction equipment to continue benefiting from positive fundamentals, including favorable crop prices, economic growth, and increased investment in infrastructure,” Chief Executive Officer John May said in the statement. “At the same time, we anticipate supply-chain pressures will continue to pose challenges in our industries.”
Shares of Deere rose 2.9% at 7:09 a.m. in premarket trading in New York.
Net income for fiscal 2021 reached $5.96 billion, its highest ever. Record earnings were part of the reason employees went on strike, arguing that they risked their lives as “essential” workers during the pandemic, and that they had worked with the company to take pay cuts in prior contracts when times were leaner for John Deere’s profits.
Deere’s upbeat outlook comes despite the work stoppage that slowed Deere’s factory output of equipment ranging from tractors and combines to sprayers and more in the U.S. during the busiest farming season of the year. Workers initially rejected two labor contracts that left customers waiting weeks for parts and components that normally take a couple days to deliver, before finally approving a third deal a week ago.
Ongoing supply chain disruptions, rising raw material costs, about a $3.5 billion rise in labor costs on the new deal and a slowdown at factories due to the strike remain some hurdles Deere must navigate in the months ahead. The company likely will have to raise prices on its equipment by about 1.5% to fully offset the increase in labor costs, according to analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Still, strong demand for crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat is driving agriculture prices to the highest in years, padding the pockets of farmers who are eager to buy new equipment to keep pace with growing consumer needs.

Investing.com – Deere stock (NYSE:DE) rose 3% in premarket trading Wednesday as the company rode price hikes and strong demand for its farm equipment to leave behind estimates for its fourth-quarter net profit.
Rising prices of crops, namely corn and soybeans, led farmers to invest in more heavy equipment from the company, boosting sales by 19% to $10.3 billion.
According to Reuters, the company increased prices by 8% for its large and medium equipment orders to offset rising inflation, expanding its margin across its divisions, namely production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf and construction and forestry.
The manufacturer of tractors and mowers said sales of its large and some medium equipment jumped 23% in the quarter, while sales of smaller farm and turf equipment rose 17%. Net income rose about 70% to $1.28 billion.
The company earlier this month agreed to a new compensation deal with its workers belonging to the United Auto Workers union, ending a nearly six-week-long strike. While that may pump up costs in the coming year, it hasn't stopped the company forecasting another significant increase in revenue and profit.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Hollywood flocked to central Europe during the pandemic when film producers there were allowed to keep the cameras rolling, making the region an irresistible draw for streaming giants captivated by castles and tax breaks. 
Now, though, some production companies may have bitten off more than they can chew as the region, one of the world's biggest hubs, has enjoyed a record leap in new U.S. movie and television business to about $1 billion this year.
They, like many peers globally, are struggling to find enough qualified staff to keep pace with the huge appetite of clients like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) vying with each other to deliver new content and feed consumer demand turbo-charged by lockdowns around the world.
Even Hungary's state-of-the-art Korda Studios, a giant of the sector with one of the world's biggest sound stage, told Reuters is was focusing on fewer shows and movies to maintain quality. And it has had to come up with imaginative ways to do more with less.
""Set directors and designers have to be smarter about shooting angles,"" said Chief Executive Gyorgy Rajnai. ""Now we build a house with three sides instead of four. We save on resources, time and people.""
Korda is also importing camera and set-construction crews from countries like Slovakia, Romania, Croatia, he said. 
Other production companies are hiring less experienced staff and in some cases turning down new work altogether, according to interviews with several industry executives and workers. 
""Either we can pick up the crew or we say no to the project. It is green light or red light,"" Rajnai added. ""It is the bottleneck in the industry.""
The challenges in the region, which has recently hosted the likes of sci-fi movie epic Dune and Amazon fantasy series The Wheel of Time, reflect a shortage of skilled production workers across the world, from Hollywood to Queensland.
Jonathan Olsberg, executive chairman of London-based film industry consultancy Olsberg SPI, expects global production spend on feature films, television series and documentaries to race back to the pre-pandemic level of $177 billion in 2022. 
""This is a fundamental global problem and we will be experiencing these shortages for years to come,"" he said. 
Central Europe has also long had skills shortages across many industries. A tight labour market - the Czech rate of 2.8% ranks as the lowest in Europe, for example - makes it difficult for some companies to find workers and specialisms.
Pavlina Zipkova, head of the Czech Film Commission said the skills shortage in the country's film production industry was acute, though there are no specific estimates.
""There is pressure on national film commissions and film institutions as well as on local studios and film production companies,"" Zipkova told Reuters.
Netflix, Amazon and Apple declined to comment on production staff shortages in the region and the possible consequences.
WANT TO WORK IN FILMS?
Experienced crews, lower labour costs and generous tax incentives have attracted film makers to the Czech Republic and Hungary over the past decade. The region now ranks as the biggest international film production hub in Europe after Britain, with its landscape of rolling countryside and castles ideal for historical and fantasy shows.
This year, investments in filming projects in Hungary and the Czech Republic are on course to surpass the record 2019 figures of about $405 million and $512 million) respectively, according to national industry officials.
One problem facing smaller production companies is that giant projects, like the $200 million Netflix action thriller film Gray Man that recently wrapped up in Prague, suck up a lot of the local talent, according to the people inside the industry.
As a result, they are vying for a limited pool of expertise. 
At Prague-based Dazzle Pictures, whose credits include work for international films and content for the likes of Netflix and Amazon, managing director Geoffrey Case said the post-production studio receives offers daily from potential clients around the world seeking help in finishing films and TV shows.
This has created a situation where the amount of work on offer far outstrips what some companies can handle, especially as they fend off rivals looking to add employees, he added.
""Most of the artists at our company have been approached by competing companies,"" said Case, whose team focuses on high-end visual effects.
""They are getting offers all the time. In the old days there was respect from competitors. You didn't just try to poach people. But it is constant now because people are desperate.""
Vojta Ruzicka, who has worked for nearly 20 years as a logistics specialist on productions in Prague including Mission Impossible 4 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, said this has also created opportunity for people looking to break into the industry or take a faster step up the ladder.

""If people keep their eyes open and want to work in the film industry, now is a pretty good time,"" he said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A works council being set up by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) staff at the company's new Gruenheide plant near Berlin risks being unrepresentative as most of the employees hired so far are middle or senior managers, Germany's largest union warned on Tuesday.
IG Metall said seven Tesla employees, none of whom were its members, had called a meeting for Monday to choose a committee to run elections https://reut.rs/3oVsGf8 for a council that would remain in position for at least two years. 
""We're happy there's been a starting shot,"" Birgit Dietze, head of IG Metall's regional office for Berlin-Brandenburg-Saxony where Tesla's factory https://reut.rs/30XbqxO is located, told Reuters. 
""What's important is that the workers' council is really there for all employees ... for us it's a little too soon.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Under German labour law, employees must be at a company for six months before they can run in a works council election - meaning any body formed in the near future is likely to be dominated by management figures, the union said.
Dietze said a new election can only be called after two years, and only then if the workforce has more than doubled. IG Metall says Tesla has hired about one in six of the 12,000 workers due to be recruited for the site so far.
The U.S electric vehicle maker is operating at Gruenheide under pre-approval permits as it awaits the green light from local authorities to start production. Tesla hopes to receive final approval by the end of 2021. 

Chief Executive Elon Musk has sparred with organised labour in the past and was ordered https://reut.rs/3xhTFFk in March to delete a tweet from 2018 threatening to strip U.S. employees of their stock options if they formed a union.
IG Metall set up an office near the Gruenheide plant earlier this year to provide support. Dietze said the union would not have advocated setting up a works council until a wider pool of workers had been hired.

Investing.com – Gap stock (NYSE:GPS) plummeted 21% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as supply chain issues meant that sales at the retailer fell in the third quarter while costs rose, ensuring the company fell short of estimates.
The owner of Banana Republic and Old Navy cut its sales forecast for the year in response to extended and ongoing supply chain issues.
Net sales fell 1% year-on-year to $3.94 billion as the company’s stores ran out of inventory owing to factories being shut in Vietnam, its key base for supplies. The pandemic swept the Asian country earlier in the year, causing the government to order lengthy factory closures to contain the Covid-19 virus.
According to the company’s estimates, it may have lost $300 million in sales during the quarter due to inventory constraints. For the full year, the damage could be as much as $650 million, it said.
To overcome lack of inventory and to bypass congestion at ports, the company is resorting to air freight to carry clothes and accessories faster, just in time for the holiday season. This has raised its transportation costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were thus higher by 140 basis points at around 38%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
“We believe the right thing to do is compete in the holiday season to have the right stock across all four of our brands, and that’s what we’re doing,” Gap CEO Sonia Syngal told CNBC. Athleta is the fourth brand in the portfolio.
Online sales grew and comprised 38% of total revenue, the company said.
The company now expects annual sales to grow 20% compared to the 30% it estimated earlier. Adjusted operating margin is also seen taking a hit of 250 basis points from the previous forecast and end at about 5% for the year."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore's central bank said on Wednesday that it will consider taking ""supervisory action"" on DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Holdings Ltd after the Singapore bank's online banking services faced disruption for the second consecutive day.
""This is a serious disruption and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expects DBS to conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root causes and implement the necessary remedial measures,"" Marcus Lim, an assistant managing director from the banking and insurance team at MAS, said in a statemtent.
""MAS will consider appropriate supervisory actions following the investigation,"" Lim said.
Earlier in the day, DBS assured customers on Wednesday that their deposits and monies were safe despite the technical issues.
The disruption, including to its payments app, is the biggest suffered by Southeast Asia's largest bank since a major glitch in 2010 left customers unable to withdraw cash from ATMs for hours. That resulted in the MAS taking supervisory action on it.
The latest disruption drew the ire of customers just hours after DBS announced a fix after the first day of outage.
""Yesterday, we identified a problem with our access control servers and this is why many of you have been unable to log in,"" Shee Tse Koon, Singapore country head of DBS, said in a video message on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
He said DBS and its third-party engineering providers had fixed the issue and services were restored just after midnight but the problem recurred on Wednesday morning.
""I want to assure you that your deposits and monies are safe,"" said Shee, adding customers could use the bank's branches and phone banking services.
DBS operates in places including Indonesia, India and Hong Kong, but its biggest retail and wealth management market is at home in Singapore, where it is the market leader in retail banking.
Over the past decade, Group CEO Piyush Gupta has steered the bank into investing billions of dollars to upgrade its technology infrastructure as it embraced cloud computing and digitised its services.
The bank's Facebook post attracted more than 2,500 comments, with users saying they were unable to log onto their digital bank accounts, while some asked for compensation.
""A component of the banking infrastructure can bring the entire service down for more than 24 hrs and counting,"" user Tan Kim Lam said. ""A bit unacceptable in current day expectations and standards.""
The outage comes ahead of online-only banks launching in Singapore next year.

""The downtime is too long. Disappointed. Time to switch Bank. Am expecting DBS to do better than this,"" user Samson Joseph said on Wednesday.
Last December, Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab's venture with Singtel and internet platform company Sea Ltd were each awarded licences to run Singapore's first digital banks, in the city-state's biggest banking shakeup in two decades.

1279,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 06:58AM ET</span>",Dow Jones Futures Fall 115 Pts; Retail Stocks Head Lower,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Wednesday, weighed on by disappointing earnings from a couple of significant retailers, ahead of key economic data releases and the minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7:20 AM ET (1220 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 124 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.3%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures slumped further, dropping 63 points, or 0.4%.
The retail sector is likely to trade significantly lower Wednesday following the release of weak quarterly earnings from the likes of Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), illustrating the difficulties these stores are having due to the disruptions of their supply chains.
Gap stock is over 18% lower in premarket trading after the clothing chain cut its full-year forecast, expecting a hit to revenue of up to $650 million following factory closures in Vietnam, a region that accounts for 30% of the company’s production.
Similarly, Nordstrom stock fell 26% premarket after warning of product shortages at its stores heading into the holiday season, adding that rising labor costs had cut into its quarterly profit.
On the flip side, HP (NYSE:HPQ) stock was seen trading significantly higher after the computer hardware company’s quarterly sales and earnings easily exceeded market expectations.
Elsewhere, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) will be in the spotlight Wednesday after a federal jury in Cleveland, Ohio, ruled that their pharmacies were complicit in the opioid epidemic.
The main indices differed in performance on Tuesday, with the rising Treasury yields lifting bank stocks but hurting tech and other high-growth companies. 
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed almost 200 points, or 0.6%, higher, and the broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, however, lost 0.5%.
There is a flood of economic data releases to wade through later Wednesday, ahead of Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday, including the Fed’s favorite gauge of inflation, the core PCE index for October, another reading of the third-quarter GDP and the latest durable goods number.
Of particular interest will be the minutes of the November Fed meeting, with investors searching for clues of the future pace of tapering, and consequently the timetable for interest rate increases. 
Crude prices edged higher Wednesday, continuing the previous session’s hefty gains after the announcement of a coordinated release of oil from government reserves underwhelmed.
The U.S. said it will release 50 million barrels, in concert with China, Japan, India, South Korea and the U.K. in an effort to tame prices, but influential investment bank Goldman Sachs estimated that the market had already priced in more than 100 million barrels.
The Energy Information Administration will release the latest official reading of U.S. crude stocks later in the session, after the American Petroleum Institute, an industry body, said Tuesday that inventories climbed 2.3 million barrels last week.
By 7:20 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $78.56 a barrel, after climbing 2.3% on Tuesday, their biggest gain in two weeks, while the Brent contract inched 0.2% lower to $82.19, having gained 3.3% on Tuesday. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,787.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1216.

Investing.com – HP stock (NYSE:HPQ) rose 7.2% in premarket trading Wednesday after the company followed up its strong fourth-quarter results with a robust outlook for the year.
Most business segments came off their pandemic-driven highs but growing demand in the commercial vertical and a shift to higher-value products led the company to raise its share of the Windows market sequentially, according to a statement. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rolled out its latest OS Windows 11 during the quarter.
Commercial PC net revenue increased 25%, more than offsetting the 3% erosion in consumer PC revenue and a mere 1% rise in sales of printing systems. That allowed its fourth-quarter net revenue to grow over 9% to $16.7 billion. Adjusted EPS of 94 cents was ahead of the company’s own forecast as well as analysts’.
The company focused more on business clients during the quarter, as supply constraints forced it to narrow its sales focus, CEO Enrique Lores told CNBC.
The company sold 12% fewer Notebooks while selling 2% more desktop units in the three months ended October 31. That represents a slight cooling off after more than a year of record sales of laptops, PCs and printers to service the working-from-home boom.
In the ongoing quarter, the first of its new fiscal year, the company expects its adjusted EPS to touch $1.02 at the midpoint of its guidance range. For the full-year, HP expects to generate free cash flow of at least $4.5 billion, higher than 2021’s $4.2 billion.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>",Texas wins contest to host Samsung's new $17 billion chip plant,"By Joyce Lee and Tina Bellon
SEOUL/AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd said on Wednesday it had picked Taylor, Texas as the location for a new $17 billion plant to make advanced chips for functions such as mobile, 5G, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. 
The plant would create 2,000 high-tech jobs with construction to begin in the first half of next year, and production due to start in the second half of 2024, the South Korean tech giant said. It would also create at least 6,500 construction jobs, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said.
The world's biggest memory chipmaker and second-largest contract chip manufacturer had also considered sites in Arizona and New York for the plant, which will be much bigger than its only other U.S. chip plant in Austin, Texas.
The company said it chose Texas based on factors such as infrastructure stability, government support and proximity to its existing plant.
Samsung (KS:005930) is joining rivals TSMC and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the race to expand chip contract manufacturing in the United States, where the sector is seen as an area of strategic competition with China. 
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has promised billions of dollars https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-jobs-plan-includes-50-bln-chips-research-manufacturing-2021-04-12 in federal funding to boost chip manufacturing and research to ensure it has an edge over China in advanced technologies and to address shortages for critical industries like autos.
""Securing America's supply chains is a top priority for President Biden and his Administration,"" U.S. National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement welcoming Samsung's investment. 
""We will continue to use every tool and pursue every avenue to invest in our sources of strength like manufacturing and technology."" 
Abbott, flanked at a press conference by Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Kinam Kim and U.S. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, said the company's decision was a testament to Texas's economic environment built on low taxes, reasonable regulations and robust infrastructure. 
Texas last winter suffered a multi-day, widespread power outage, causing some 300-400 billion won ($254-$339 million) in damages to Samsung's existing chip plant in Austin, Texas. 
""I'm extremely confident that the power grid is stable, resilient and reliable,"" Abbott said on Tuesday when asked about electricity supply for the plant.
The new site in Texas's Williamson County, which comprises the city of Taylor, offered the best incentives package https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-decision-new-us-chip-plant-location-imminent-texas-county-judge-2021-09-10 of the sites Samsung was considering, sources previously told Reuters. 
NATIONAL SECURITY
Senator Cornyn on Tuesday called on the Biden administration to invest more money to attract chip manufacturers to the United States, calling it a ""national security imperative.""
""If China continues to saber-rattle, the majority of the world could be at their mercy when it comes to the supply of critical semiconductors,"" Cornyn said.
Samsung's Kim thanked the Biden administration for ""creating an environment that supports companies like Samsung as we work to expand leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.""
""We also thank the administration and Congress for their bipartisan support to swiftly enact federal incentives for domestic chip production and innovation.""
Samsung has not specified what the new plant will make beyond advanced logic chips which can be used to power mobile devices and autonomous vehicles.
Analysts said it would likely make cutting-edge chips of 5-nanometres or less, using machines made by the Netherland's ASML, for large clients like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Such chips can handle more data per area than the 14- and 28-nanometre chips Samsung's existing U.S. plant in Austin mainly makes. 

The Taylor site, about 25 miles (40 kms) from Austin, spans more than 5 million square metres, Samsung said. 
Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee https://www.reuters.com/business/samsungs-lee-visits-us-ahead-likely-17-bln-chip-plant-decision-media-2021-11-15 met White House officials as well as leaders of companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) during a trip to the United States last week.

More importantly, our tactical preferences for the next 6 to 18 months are nearly all unchanged."" 
Goldman Sachs: ""Decelerating economic growth, a tightening Fed, and rising real yields suggest investors should expect modestly below-average returns next year.""

""In contrast with our expectation during the past year, corporate tax rates will likely remain unchanged in 2022 and rise in 2023. Corporate earnings will grow and lift share prices. The equity bull market will continue."" RBC: ""We continue to see 2022 as a solid year for the U.S. equity market, but with more moderate gains than we've experienced in 2021.""

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>",Germany's Lidl looks long-term in Britain as raises store target,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Lidl GB's boss said its German owner is not concerned about low profitability in the British business because it is investing for the long term, after on Wednesday setting a new target of reaching 1,100 stores by 2025.
Britain's food retail sector has been transformed in the past decade by the rise of Lidl and fellow German-owned discounter Aldi, which have driven down returns at the Big Four of Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda.
Lidl GB said its turnover rose 12% to 7.7 billion pounds ($1.34 billion) in the year to the end of February 2021 and it made a pretax profit of 9.8 million pounds, versus a loss of 25.2 million pounds in 2019-20, during the period.
CEO Christian Härtnagel said the results were ""only a snapshot"" and Germany's Schwarz group was more interested in the long-term opportunity, which was why Lidl GB had invested 498 million pounds in 2020-21.
""Of course we have the full support of the parent group,"" he said, adding Schwarz had made a ""very strong statement"" in favour of Lidl GB's strategy by injecting another 268 million pounds of equity into the British business in 2020-21.
Unlike its bigger rivals, but in common with Aldi, Lidl is opening lots of new stores but does not sell online.
Lidl, which came to Britain in 1994, had a previous target of 1,000 stores by the end of 2023, which it said it was on track to reach. The new target would create 4,000 jobs, in addition to the 26,000 people it already employs.
""We continue to see tremendous opportunity in the market,"" said Härtnagel.
'DISCOUNTER TIME'
Lidl GB has more than 880 stores, after opening 55 in 2020-21, and a 6.2% share of Britain's grocery market, where retailers have been grappling with delays in international supply chains, compounded by labour shortages in the UK transport and warehousing networks.
That has hit product availability and stoked inflation.
Härtnagel said Lidl's availability currently was ""much better"" than eight to ten weeks ago.
""At the moment we are OK, but we are OK because we are working around the clock. There are no obvious categories where we are struggling at the moment,"" he said.
He said Lidl was not immune to inflationary pressures but would maintain its pledge to be the lowest priced grocer.

""Inflation time is discounter time,"" he added.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 06:07AM ET</span>","In Mexico's auto heartland, workers struggle as chip shortage bites","By Anthony Esposito and Sharay Angulo
AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (Reuters) - A global semiconductor shortage is hitting Mexico's auto workers hard as employers slash output, reduce shift work and cut jobs due to supply-chain breakdowns.
The pain is acute in the central Mexican state of Aguascalientes and its namesake capital, one of the country's top automotive centers, where the chip crunch has forced rolling shutdowns at employers large and small.
The temporary closures have translated into lost wages for tens of thousands of workers here and across Mexico due to furloughs and layoffs, according to interviews with laborers, union leaders and industry executives.
Cuitlahuac Perez is general director of Aguascalientes-based auto parts firm Maindsteel, and head of one of the state's automotive clusters, which promotes the industry. He said his firm and other Aguascalientes suppliers have been suspending operations an average of seven to eight days per month as carmakers and other parts companies further up the supply chain halt production.
Perez estimates that about one in five local automotive workers have lost their jobs, with the rest seeing big pay cuts since the chip shortages began about seven or eight months ago. By contract, many idled workers here receive half their salaries.
""We are talking about a direct impact on their families,"" Perez said.
Semiconductors are an indispensable component for the world's automakers, who need them for a wide variety of systems such as safety, navigation and entertainment. COVID-19 outbreaks in Asian semiconductor manufacturing hubs have slowed chip production. The fallout has rippled across the globe, with automakers unable to keep production on pace with vehicle demand.
In Mexico, multinationals affected include Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co. Ltd, the country's second-largest vehicle producer. The Japanese firm operates a powertrain facility and an assembly plant in Aguascalientes producing its March, Versa, Kicks and Sentra vehicles. The company has seen at least five shutdowns at its Mexican facilities this year due to chip issues, Reuters has reported.
The latest came earlier this month, the company said, with stoppages ranging from five to seven days at its Aguascalientes plants, and an eight-day closure at its CIVAC factory in Morelos state, which manufactures the Versa V-Drive sedan and two pickups: the NP300 and Frontier.
The dearth of chips has also affected an Aguascalientes assembly plant that's jointly operated between  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Renault-Nissan. The so-called COMPAS plant, which produces the Mercedes-Benz GLB SUV, has experienced ""shift reductions or production breaks,"" a Mercedes-Benz spokesperson said in emailed comments.
The turmoil is weighing on Mexico's economy. Car production fell by 20% to 3.04 million vehicles last year, and is forecast to drop by as much as another 5% https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/auto-output-dives-brazil-mexico-chip-shortages-bite-2021-10-06 in 2021, according to the Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA). The auto industry, which employs 946,000 workers currently, has lost 16,000 auto jobs since the end of 2019, AMIA figures show. 
In August, the Bank of Mexico https://www.banxico.org.mx/publicaciones-y-prensa/informes-trimestrales/recuadros/%7B11972B0F-38F8-F301-76C5-1AC6C404C0C0%7D.pdf projected that automotive work stoppages resulting from chip shortages could cost Mexico up to 1 percentage point of GDP growth in 2021. Preliminary third-quarter GDP data https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-economy-shrinks-first-time-since-pandemic-rebound-2021-10-29 showed that the economy shrank between July and September, the first quarterly fall since recovery from the pandemic began, partly due to problems in the auto sector. 
The Mexican unit of China-based Minth Group, whose Aguascalientes plant supplies parts to automakers throughout North America, is among the firms trimming workers' hours and cutting jobs. The company has laid off about 20% of its workforce this year, according to Manuel Ando, director of administration and infrastructure for Minth Mexico. That comes on top of previous cuts, with staffing now standing at 1,300, down from around 2,700 prior to the pandemic, he said.
Ando said the situation was caused by a myriad of factors, including tight chip supplies, hiccups in the global logistics chain and a slowdown of production by its U.S. customers, many of whom are grappling with worker shortages.
""Since they are halted, well, we have to stop too,"" Ando said.
Dalila Gomez, who inspects parts for Minth in Aguascalientes, counts herself lucky still to have a job. But reduced hours have her tightening her belt. Gomez said when production is halted she receives just 50% of her average weekly paycheck of around $60. The mother of three said she has trimmed a host of household expenses, including soft drinks at lunch and home internet service.
""It's sad because there are many people, including myself, with families - some of them single moms – who have to support their families, pay rent,"" Gomez said. ""This has affected everyone, everyone.""
'THE WORST IS YET TO COME'
Mexico's automotive sector isn't suffering in isolation.
Automotive powerhouse Germany https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-next-government-faces-three-big-economic-challenges-2021-10-05 is struggling to ramp up output and the situation is hampering its economic recovery. Carmakers in Japan https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/honda-posts-fall-q2-operating-profit-2021-11-05 have been forced to cut production.
A bipartisan group of U.S. governors recently warned that https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nine-governors-press-us-lawmakers-pass-semiconductor-funding-bill-2021-11-10, due to the chip shortage, automakers in North America lost an estimated 2.2 million vehicles in 2021 and 575,000 industry jobs have been impacted.
The semiconductor squeeze is likely to continue at least through the first half of 2022, according to a recent forecast by Ratings agency Fitch https://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-fitch-idUSL1N2S821Z.
Some industry players see tentative signs that the situation is stabilizing.
Detroit-based General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), the largest automaker in Mexico, told Reuters this month it's seeing a better flow of semiconductors https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-says-seeing-better-flow-semiconductors-2021-11-10. It said the first week of November was the first time since February that none of its North American assembly plants had been idled for want of chips.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co https://www.reuters.com/technology/sony-invest-500-mln-tsmcs-new-chip-unit-japan-2021-11-09 , the world's largest contract chipmaker, said this month it would build a $7-billion semiconductor plant in Japan with  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group to help ease the shortage, which has also hit manufacturers of smartphones, laptops and consumer appliances.
In September, the United States and Mexico agreed at economic talks in Washington to make their shared supply chains more competitive, especially for semiconductors. U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, are mulling subsidies https://www.reuters.com/world/us/dispute-over-china-tech-measure-delays-vote-massive-us-defense-bill-2021-11-17 to bolster U.S. chip production. 
But that has done little to ease concerns in Aguascalientes, where autos are a pillar of the economy, employing about 46,000 workers directly and 120,000 indirectly. Almost a third of the state's GDP comes from the auto sector, according to Manuel Alejandro Gonzalez, the economic development secretary for Aguascalientes.
Anibal Llamas, quality manager at parts supplier Minth, fears that ""the worst is yet to come.""
Some auto workers are stunned by their turn of fortune. A Nissan employee who spoke to Reuters but didn't want to give her name, said she and her husband both work in the industry. She said the short hours have ravaged their monthly income.

She said the couple has fallen behind on mortgage payments and other bills. Worry and want have replaced the security they once felt.
""Financially you feel like you're coming out of this and then they send me home again, or they send him home,"" she said. ""The end of the week comes and we don't even have two pesos.""

In its complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Apple said NSO's tools were used in ""concerted efforts in 2021 to target and attack Apple customers"" and that ""U.S. citizens have been surveilled by NSO’s spyware on mobile devices that can and do cross international borders.""
Apple alleged that NSO Group created more than 100 fake Apple ID user credentials to carry out its attacks. Apple said that its servers were not hacked, but that NSO misused and manipulated the servers to deliver the attacks on Apple users.
Apple also alleged that NSO Group was directly involved in providing consulting services for the attacks, which is noteworthy because NSO has maintained that it sells its tools to clients.
""Defendants force Apple to engage in a continual arms race: Even as Apple develops solutions and enhances the security of its devices, Defendants are constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple’s own security upgrades,"" Apple said.

Apple said it has so far seen no evidence of NSO's tools being used against Apple devices using iOS 15, the latest version of its mobile operating system. 
The iPhone maker said that it will donate $10 million, as well as any damages recovered in the lawsuit, to cybersurveillance research groups including Citizen Lab, the University of Toronto group that first discovered NSO's attacks.

1288,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>","CVS, Walmart Fall as Ohio Jury Rules Them Guilty in Opioid Crisis","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Shares of CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) fell 0.6% and 0.4% respectively in Wednesday’s premarket trading a day after a federal jury in Cleveland, Ohio, ruled that their pharmacies were complicit in the opioid epidemic.
Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) was also found guilty in the case. The stock closed 0.3% lower in after-hours trading.
Attorneys for Lake and Trumbull counties argued the chains didn’t do enough to stop pain pills from flooding the local markets or to stop false prescriptions from being filled. The counties argued the pharmacy companies’ lack of effort in containing the crisis created public nuisance that cost each about $1 billion in law-enforcement, social-services and court expenses. Public-nuisance laws vary by state, which makes it harder to view the verdict as any kind of precedent for other, similar cases in process elsewhere..
The companies pleaded innocence saying they tried to stop the illegal diversion of pills and that they complied with all procedures mandated by the regulators.
Opioids have taken an increasing toll on U.S. lives in an epidemic that spans over 20 years.
Treatments initially intended for alleviating the suffering of cancer patients were gradually dispensed to patients with a much broader range of ailments. The prescriptions became more frequent, the dosage higher and illegal usage and supply blossomed. 
According to federal figures, the country lost nearly half a million people to overdoses of prescription and illegal opioids between 1999 and 2019. The incidence of overdoses has risen during the pandemic, with fentanyl and other opioids accounting for more than 70% of the 100,000 deaths in the 12 months through April.
Cases against pharmacies, distributors of medicines and drugs and pharmaceutical companies are ongoing in various courts in the country.
Four months ago, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and distributors including McKesson (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) agreed to pay $26 billion over 18 years in a settlement with around 40 states in cases that accused them of fuelling the opioid crisis.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",More investors turning sour on emerging markets - HSBC survey,"LONDON (Reuters) - More than one in four investors feel 'bearish' about emerging markets, an HSBC survey showed on Wednesday, as slowing economic growth and the spectre of tighter monetary policy in the United States clouds the outlook.
In July fewer than one in 10 investors surveyed were bearish, while the proportion of investors feeling bullish has dropped to 27% from 40%, HSBC said.
Markets have ramped up their expectations for interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and other central banks next year to keep a lid on inflation. The investors surveyed said tighter policy in developed economies was the single biggest risk to the outlook for emerging markets.
""The global economy has faced a series of negative supply-side shocks that are causing downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation,"" said Murat Ulgen, Global Head of EM Research at HSBC. 
""Emerging markets are a lot more susceptible to these shocks, hence their financial markets have markedly underperformed those of developed markets, and it seems like this 'stagflationary' backdrop is still keeping EM investors at bay."" 
Emerging market assets have fared badly in 2021, with equities underperforming and many currencies suffering big falls. Foreign investors have been dumping local currency bonds. 
Emerging market equities are now trading at their deepest discount to developed markets since 2004, and the low valuation of some assets could tempt investors to dive back in, HSBC's Ulgen noted. 
Still, the latest survey showed 37% of investors expect emerging market growth to accelerate over the next 12 months, down from 60% in July. 

Investors are downbeat on emerging currencies, on Asian hard and local currency debt and emerging equities, while they like central and eastern european assets, the survey report showed.
The survey canvassed 120 investors from 115 institutions representing $572 billion in assets under management between Sept. 28 and Nov. 17.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Warburg Pincus, a major global investor in Ant Group, has cut its valuation of the Chinese fintech company by 15% to below $200 billion due to risks from a restructuring at the Hangzhou-based firm, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
There are also no signs that Ant's botched mega IPO will be revived anytime soon, sources familiar with the matter said.
U.S. private equity firm Warburg, which was a big investor in Ant's 2018 private fundraising, lowered the company's valuation to $191 billion at end-September from the $224 billion at end-June, the first source told Reuters.
Warburg's cutting of Ant's worth comes after some other global investors have already slashed their valuations and shows skepticism about its prospects is rising as the payments-to-loans behemoth remodels itself under regulatory pressure.
The valuation markdowns will weigh on the returns of the global investors who were betting on Ant's once turbo-charged growth.
Warburg's latest valuation of Ant, an affiliate of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, is far short of $315 billion that was touted one year ago at its planned IPO, which would have been the world's largest if it were not derailed at the last minute. 
The private equity heavyweight changed its valuation methodology for the company, citing ""regulatory developments and the impact of ongoing restructuring"", said the source, without elaborating.
Ant and Warburg declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media.
Ant's $37 billion IPO was called off by regulators two days before its scheduled dual-listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai, leaving investors guessing about their return prospects.
Since the IPO's cancellation, Ant, controlled by Alibaba's billionaire founder Jack Ma, has embarked on a restructuring plan that would see itself become a financial holding company. It is also shrinking its once-booming consumer credit business, opening its data trove to other firms, and faces new regulations in its payments and insurance businesses.
IPO PROSPECTS 
In the first half of the year, Ant generated revenue of about $16.9 billion, up 52% year-on-year and $4.9 billion in adjusted net profit, up 29% year-on-year, according to a latest financial document prepared by an investor and seen by Reuters.
According to Alibaba's September quarterly financial earnings report, Ant's profit was $5.2 billion in the first half, up 43% year-on-year. Alibaba said the increase was mainly due to net gains from fair value changes in Ant's investments.
Similar to Warburg, a string of other Ant investors have cut their valuations of the company since the start of the year.
Fidelity, an Ant investor that joined in the same round as Warburg, valued it at $68 billion at end-July, Reuters calculations based on its public disclosures showed. In January, it valued Ant at $233 billion.
In June, Bernstein analysts cut Ant's valuation to $120 billion from the time of its IPO, due to slower growth expectations and lowered price-to-earnings multiples as a result of the regulatory changes.
The company was valued at $150 billion in its 2018 fundraising that attracted a slew of prominent global investors.
Ant investors don't have high hopes that the company's IPO will revive any time soon, as it is still in the middle of a complicated restructuring process that requires regulatory approvals on many fronts, said four other people.
""I would be surprised if Ant could finish its restructuring and revive its IPO by end of 2022,"" said one investor source.

Ant declined to comment on the restructuring process and the IPO revival plans.

The company, which was forced to cut 25% of its staff in 2020 due to weak demand, said sales trends have improved in October and November, but warned that any restrictions during the festive period could affect its upbeat outlook.
Best known for its leather bags, Mulberry has benefited from store reopenings in the UK, with strong growth in Asia helping it offset weakness arising from the absence of tourists in the domestic market and the closure of some stores in Europe.
Earlier this month, consultancy Bain had predicted that the luxury goods sector would rebound this year from the health crisis due to higher spending in the United States and China, particularly on high-end shoes, leather goods and jewellery.
Mulberry said over the next six months it will spend more from its ""substantial cash reserves"" on marketing to build brand awareness worldwide.

The company said its UK factories and careful planning has helped it navigate supply chain issues even though it flagged a slight increase in inventories of raw materials since March. 
Group revenue for the six months ended Sept. 25 rose 34% to 65.7 million pounds, helping Mulberry report profit before tax of 10.2 million pounds compared to a loss of 2.4 million last year. The profit includes a one-off gain on disposal of a lease in Paris.

1296,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 03:29AM ET</span>","European Stocks Edge Higher; Covid Restrictions in Focus, Mulberry Soars","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com -- European stock markets edged higher Wednesday, rebounding from the previous session’s sharp losses, as investors await a big U.S. data dump and the presentation of the new German government's coalition agreement.
At 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 also climbed 0.5%.
The three German parties forming the new government will hold a press conference at 9 AM ET (1400 GMT) to present their coalition agreement, which will lay out the policy goals and the division of competences between the center-left Social Democrats, the free-market Liberal Democrats and the Greens.
Before then, the German Ifo institute will release its monthly business climate survey, and hopes for this have risen in the wake of strong purchasing manager indices for November and a better than expected result from the latest French business survey.  
On Tuesday, the flash composite PMI for the Eurozone's largest economy rose to 52.8, from 52.0 in October, suggesting that the slowdown in economic growth seen across the private sector over the previous three months is levelling off.
The key variable is whether economic momentum can be sustained as the latest wave of Covid-19, which is again the number one cause of death in the region. The total of Covid-19 deaths across Europe will exceed two million by March next year, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday.
Germany is expected to make a decision on stricter measures on Wednesday after hitting a fresh high for new infections on Tuesday. France recorded more than 30,000 new daily infections on Tuesday for the first time since August, while the Netherlands also hit a new weekly record.
Market participants will also scrutinize the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve policy committee's November meeting later in the session for signs that the pace of tapering could accelerate, potentially bringing forward the timetable for interest rate increases.
In the corporate sector, Mulberry (LON:MUL) stock rose over 15% after the British luxury brand said business is returning to pre-pandemic levels, reporting a 34% jump in first-half revenue helped by strong sales in the U.K. and growth in Asia.
 Britvic  (LON:BVIC) stock rose 3.1% after the soft drinks maker reported a jump in annual profits as pandemic restrictions eased, prompting it to lift its dividend despite cost pressures.
Crude prices edged higher Wednesday after Tuesday’s announcement of a coordinated release of oil from government reserves, led by the U.S., fell short of expectations, raising doubts about the effectiveness of the move.
The U.S. said it will release 50 million barrels, in concert with China, Japan, India, South Korea and the U.K. in an effort to tame prices, but influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated that the market had already priced in more than 100 million barrels.
Meanwhile, U.S. crude stocks rose last week, according to the industry body the American Petroleum Institute, with inventories climbing 2.3 million barrels against expectations of a decline by about 500,000 barrels.
By 3:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $78.86 a barrel, after climbing 2.3% on Tuesday, their biggest gain in two weeks, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $82.66, having gained 3.3% on Tuesday. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,792.90/oz, while EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1242.

1297,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 03:15AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Brace for it,"A look at the day ahead from Dhara Ranasinghe. 
If you were hoping that the day before a big U.S. public holiday would bring a semblance of calm, think again. 
First, before Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday comes a slew of U.S. data -- weekly initial jobless claims, the second Q3 GDP print, personal income and personal spending numbers for October, new home sales, and preliminary readings for October durable goods orders. 
The PCE index, a key inflation indicator, will be in focus given the recent surge in inflation to three-decade highs. 
And not to forget minutes from the Fed's last meeting - the one where they announced tapering - are also on the calendar. 
In Europe, Germany's closely watched Ifo business indicator may better illustrate the impact of resurgent COVID caseloads than Tuesday's upbeat PMI numbers. 
All of this comes against the context of increasingly edgy world markets as investors position for higher inflation and interest rates. 
Equity markets were particularly unnerved by a rise in real or inflation-adjusted yields in major economies.
German 10-year inflation linked bond yields jumped nine basis points to 3-week highs on Tuesday, surpassing a 7 basis-point rise in nominal borrowing costs. That came after hawkish comments on inflation by two ECB policymakers.
New Zealand's central bank meanwhile hiked interest rates for the second straight month on Wednesday to keep surging consumer prices in check.
Still, European stock futures are higher this morning. On Wall Street, where higher Treasury yields sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq down for two straight days, futures are flatlining.
And don't forget Turkey where the lira is headed back towards record lows hit during Tuesday's 15% crash.
With President Tayyip Erdogan defending recent rate cuts, the lira, is trading around 13 per dollar, down 22% since the beginning of last week. Contagion appears limited, but investors are watching closely.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn)'s power and gas exchange EEX plans to launch an index to price hydrogen next year to aid trading of the commodity that is expected to play a big role in the shift to a green economy, one of the bourse's board members said.
The index, details of which will be released before the end of the year, aims to publish a price of hydrogen that will reflect prices as they emerge from the over-the-counter market and bilateral trades in import and export agreements.
It would be the first publicly-traded index tracking hydrogen as a commodity.
""Europe has the potential to be an important pillar of global price determination,"" EEX Chief Strategy Officer Tobias Paulun said at the Reuters Events Hydrogen Economy Europe conference.
""Together with our customers, we see hydrogen as a long term opportunity,"" he said, adding the index would be launched over the next few months, without being more specific.
The European Union has announced a strategy to achieve 40 gigawatts of hydrogen production capacity by 2030 and aims to become a global leader in establishing a zero-carbon fuel for industrial uses to protect the climate.
EEX will draw on a number of contributors to provide quotes in euros for green hydrogen and certify the quality through guarantees of origin, a tool already used in renewable power, Paulun said.
Produced by electrolysis using renewable power, green hydrogen has attracted interest from utilities and oil majors, their customers and related services companies.
They are striving to cut production costs, create legal and funding frameworks for infrastructure newbuild and repurposing, and to build demand and import partnerships.
Paulun said an over-the-counter and bilateral market would evolve over the next two years in European import locations and local industry clusters, which would help to develop a common standard, ultimately to be tradeable on the exchange.
The EEX would monitor the process closely.
""Driving unit costs down whilst scaling up innovation will be vital to creating long-term trading platforms,"" Paulun said.
Andreas Schwenzer of consultancy Horvath said a bourse contract should attract interest.

""Trading via standardised contracts instead of individual agreements for each transaction is far more efficient,"" he said.

ARK Investment Management, which is already one of the largest shareholder of the video conferencing company, bought about $133 million worth of shares on Tuesday as they closed 15% down to their lowest since June 2020. 
The flagship ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) bought 538,573 shares of Zoom while ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) bought 106,537 shares, according to the asset manager’s daily trading updates. Ark has been accumulating Zoom’s shares this month.
Wood’s buying on dips in Zoom comes at a time when shares of pandemic winners from the U.S. to Malaysia are struggling amid economic reopening. Zoom saw about $100 billion wiped out from its market value since its October 2020 peak, which is a decline of 64% for the stock. Despite the pullback, the stock is still up nearly 500% since its 2019 debut.
Zoom on Tuesday reported a smaller-than-projected number of large customers for a second straight quarter, stoking concerns about growth as more workplaces and schools open back up. Bank of America Corp. downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, saying the results and outlook “suggest that reopening headwinds continue to weigh on growth.”

1302,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 01:56AM ET</span>","European Stock Futures Edge Higher; Covid Restrictions, Ifo in Focus","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com -- European stock markets are expected to open marginally higher Wednesday, rebounding from the previous session’s sharp losses, as investors digest the surge in Covid-19 cases in the region ahead of the release of key economic data.  
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.
The main indices in the Eurozone slumped Tuesday, with the DAX dropping 1.1% and the CAC 40 falling 0.9%, as investors reacted to the possibility that countries will announce tougher restrictions to combat the dramatic increase in the number of coronavirus cases on the continent.
The total of Covid-19 deaths across Europe will exceed two million by March next year, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, adding that the pandemic had become the number one cause of death in the region.
Germany is expected to make a decision on stricter measures on Wednesday, France recorded more than 30,000 new daily infections on Tuesday for the first time since August, while the Netherlands hit a new weekly record.
The news make a challenging backdrop for the latest Ifo business climate survey from Germany, which also hit a new high for new infections on Tuesday.  
On Tuesday, the flash composite purchasing managers' index for the Eurozone's largest economy rose to 52.8 in November, a two-month high, from 52.0 in October, suggesting that the slowdown in economic growth seen across the private sector over the previous three months is levelling off.
Market participants will also scrutinize the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve policy committee's November meeting later in the session for signs that the pace of tapering could accelerate, potentially bringing forward the timetable for interest rate increases.
In the corporate sector, earnings from the likes of  Johnson Matthey  (LON:JMAT), Virgin Money (LON:VM),  Britvic  (LON:BVIC) and United Utilities (OTC:UUGRY) are also due.
Crude prices edged higher Wednesday after Tuesday’s announcement of a coordinated release of oil from government reserves, led by the United States, fell short of expectations, raising doubts about the effectiveness of the move.
The U.S. said it will release 50 million barrels, in concert with China, Japan, India, South Korea and the U.K. in an effort to tame prices, but influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated that the market had already priced in more than 100 million barrels.
Meanwhile, U.S. crude stocks rose last week, according to the industry body the American Petroleum Institute, with inventories climbing 2.3 million barrels against expectations of a decline by about 500,000 barrels.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $78.89 a barrel, after climbing 2.3% on Tuesday, their biggest gain in two weeks, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $82.65, having gained 3.3% on Tuesday. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,792.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1246.

Shell said on Monday it was expanding into Australia's household power market by teaming up with Infrastructure Capital Group to buy Meridian Energy's Australian electricity business, which has more than 185,000 customers, for A$729 million ($526 million). The deal is expected to close in early 2022.
Activist group Environment Victoria said on Wednesday it had terminated a six-year partnership with Powershop Australia as it was no longer tenable if Shell was going to own the business.
""You can't slap a bit of green paint on a multi-billion dollar pollution machine and expect us to ignore it,"" Environment Victoria Chief Executive Jonathan La Nauze said.
Powershop customers went on social media saying they had switched to other green energy providers and recommended competitors.
""@PowershopAus such a shame to hear you have been sold out to @Shell ... Thanks for your previous service, but I made the switch to another provider today,"" Jen Basham said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Powershop said on social media on Monday that while its ownership was changing, its ""commitment to our customers and the planet is not"". 
The deal kept the company tied to its wind and hydropower assets through power purchase agreements and its energy would still be 100% carbon offset, it said.
A Shell Australia spokesperson said the company was committed to halving its absolute emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The Powershop acquisition fits with its effort to become a ""leading provider of clean Power-as-a-Service"", she said.

""We look forward to working with Powershop customers to support their energy decarbonisation ambitions,"" Shell's spokesperson said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp's second-largest shareholder on Wednesday objected to the Japanese conglomerate's plan to split itself into three companies and called on it to instead solicit offers from potential buyers.
Hedge fund 3D Investment Partners, which owns more than 7% of Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY), laid out its objections in a three-page letter to the company's board, becoming the first major shareholder to formally oppose the break-up plan https://www.reuters.com/technology/toshiba-set-announce-split-into-three-firms-shareholder-reaction-focus-2021-11-12 outlined this month.
The letter, seen by Reuters, highlights shareholder discomfort over Toshiba's proposal - an unease reflected in the company's recent weak stock performance - and raises the possibility that the break-up may struggle to win approval at a shareholder meeting early next year. 
A Toshiba spokesperson said it does not comment on individual exchanges with shareholders. 3D declined to comment.
The proposed break-up is ""extremely unlikely"" to resolve any of Toshiba's current problems and ""is instead very likely to create three underperforming companies in the image of today's Toshiba,"" Singapore-based 3D said in the letter. 
Some other hedge fund shareholders have also told Reuters, on condition of anonymity, that they were disappointed Toshiba had turned down the idea of going private.
In its letter, 3D said Toshiba should ""open a formal process, develop a compelling plan for each of the businesses, provide detailed diligence materials and management meetings to interested financial and strategic parties, encourage and enable stretch proposals from those parties and evaluate the best path forward"".
Toshiba launched its strategic review after pressure from investors following a governance scandal https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/independent-probe-says-toshiba-agm-last-year-was-not-fairly-managed-2021-06-10 over management's alleged collusion with Japan's trade ministry to pressure foreign shareholders.
FIVE-MONTH REVIEW
During the five-month review, Toshiba's review committee held talks with six private equity firms, which sources said included https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-toshiba-talks-with-four-investment-firms-strategic-ideas-sources-2021-08-25 KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) and Brookfield, seeking strategic ideas including going private.
While the review committee never conducted an auction process with due diligence for a possible sale, it has said talks with private equity firms suggested potential offers were ""not compelling relative to market expectations"".
The review committee, which consists of five external board directors, has said it did not receive any bona fide proposals to take the company private. The idea of going private, it has said, raised concerns inside Toshiba.
However, in its letter - which was also addressed to the review committee - 3D criticised the committee for what it said was a failure to ask for proposals for the sale of Toshiba, or the partial disposition of some of its businesses.
""Overly reliant upon an intransigent management team's uninspired projection model and dubious claims of regulatory, employee morale and customer concerns about a different ownership structure, the (committee) appears to have compromised its review and relented,"" the fund said.
3D, founded by former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Kanya Hasegawa in 2015, was one of dozens foreign hedge funds that participated in a $5.4 billion capital injection Toshiba received during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017.
In addition to Toshiba, 3D has stakes in a number of smaller Japanese firms including IT company Fuji Soft Inc, textile and technology firm Daiwabo Holdings Co Ltd and music publisher Avex Inc, according to Refinitiv data based on filings this year.
It also owns a stake U.S.-based biotech MediciNova Inc, according to Refinitv.
Founded in 1875, Toshiba plans to house its energy and infrastructure divisions in one company while its hard disk drive and power semiconductor businesses will form the backbone of another. A third will manage Toshiba's stake in flash-memory chip company Kioxia Holdings and other assets.
Toshiba plans to complete the overhaul by March 2024.

Shares of Toshiba have dipped more than 4% since the plan was first reported by the Nikkei business daily on Nov. 8.
The stock was down 2% at 4,652 yen versus a 1.4% decline in the benchmark Nikkei index on Wednesday afternoon.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest money manager, has joined electric vehicle charging (EV) venture Ionity in a 700 million euro ($788 million) funding round, providing a much-needed cash injection to speed up construction of high-power loading sites.
The investment, which also includes contributions from existing shareholders, will enable Ionity to more than quadruple the number of high-power 350 kilowatt charging points to 7,000 by 2025, Ionity said on Wednesday.
Ionity did not provide a detailed breakdown of the funding round, in which existing investors Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), BMW, Ford and Hyundai also participated.
Sources said last month that BlackRock alone was close to investing around 500 million euros in Ionity.
""Ionity really stood apart in terms of the maturity of the business and the sophistication of the existing partnerships,"" David Giordano, Global Head of Renewable Power at BlackRock, told Reuters.
Founded in 2017 to accelerate the installation of charging stations along European motorways, Ionity now operates more than 1,500 charging points in 24 countries.
BlackRock's investment in Ionity makes it the venture's first shareholder from outside the automotive industry, highlighting the growing interest in the EV sector, which not only covers production of cars but also vital infrastructure.
""It's the coupling of the energy and mobility sector in particular that makes it an attractive asset,"" Ionity CEO Michael Hajesch said.
He said that Ionity was likely to seek additional manufacturers for its hardware, which is so far mainly being built by ABB and Australia's Tritium, as part of the expansion plan.
Asked whether Ionity would pursue an initial public offering (IPO) or a deal with a special acquisition purpose company (SPAC), in its next growth phase, Hajesch said this was difficult to predict due to the market's dynamic development.

""And that's great. One has many options.""

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 01:15AM ET</span>","As holidays near, 'smash-and-grab' robbers hit U.S. retailers","By Julia Harte and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -A Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) department store in a Los Angeles mall on Monday night became the latest target in a string of ""smash-and-grab"" robberies that have hit luxury retailers in California and Illinois as the holiday shopping season approaches.
The Los Angeles Police Department said it had taken three suspects into custody. Local reports said as many as 20 people may have been involved in the break-in and theft.
Law enforcement authorities say they are alarmed by the brazen nature of the burglaries -- some involving dozens of people -- which have targeted high-end stores in the two states in the past week. 
Videos from the chaotic burglaries, called ""smash-and-grabs"", have flooded social media in recent days, showing masked figures breaking into stores, running out with bags of merchandise, and fleeing in cars idling outside.
The San Francisco Bay Area has been particularly hard hit given the high density of luxury retailers. The area is one of the most affluent in the country, with a median household income nearly double the national rate, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 
About 80 people entered a Nordstrom department store in the East Bay Area city of Walnut Creek on Saturday night, stealing merchandise until police arrived and arrested three people, according to a Walnut Creek Police Department news release.
""Police are investigating what was clearly a planned event,"" the release said.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has directed the California Highway Patrol to increase their presence near major retail areas.
Nordstrom said that it is heightening security by positioning guards both inside and outside stores and increasing training.
Stores operated by Louis Vuitton, part of French luxury giant LVMH, and Burberry were also subject to burglaries by groups of people over the weekend, according to media reports.
 Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY)'s CEO Corie Barry said on Tuesday that stores had seen a large increase in organized theft in recent weeks. 
""Sometimes it's with some kind of potentially menacing device like a gun or sometimes crowbars. Sometimes it's just literally run in, grab and leave,"" Barry said on a media call. 
Barry said she was taking steps to prevent more robberies by locking up display products and hiring security.
Experts on retail crime say the rise of organized crime before the holiday season is not a new phenomenon, but it has gotten more aggressive in recent years, in part because retailers have enhanced their security measures. 
""Retail crime groups need to stock up for the holidays just like legitimate retailers do,"" said Joseph LaRocca, a Los Angeles-based theft-prevention consultant and former vice president of loss prevention at the National Retail Federation.
The groups behind the recent robberies are sophisticated organizations, ""not your normal shoplifter that's in and out stealing little items,"" he said. But that can make it easier for investigators to follow the money to the leaders of such operations. 
LaRocca also said criminals may have been emboldened by the passage of laws lessening penalties for some crimes, such as California's Proposition 47, which reclassified certain felony offenses as misdemeanors in 2014.
But Charis Kubrin, a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California-Irvine, said she has conducted studies showing that increases in violent crime are not linked to criminal justice reform measures like Proposition 47.

Kubrin said it was difficult to explain the source of the current organized retail crime wave in California and other states.
""Between the pandemic and economic challenges and issues between the police and communities, there are a lot of factors happening at the same time that make it difficult to single out one factor,"" Kubrin said.

(Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase and Co's Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon joked on Tuesday that his bank would last longer than China's Communist Party.
While reiterating his bank's commitment to doing business in China, Dimon said: ""I made a joke the other day that the Communist Party is celebrating its 100th year - so is JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). I'd make a bet that we last longer.""
Dimon added: ""I can't say that in China. They are probably listening anyway."" He was speaking as part of a Boston College series of CEO interviews. 
JPMorgan has been operating in China since 1921, the same year the Communist Party was founded there.
It has branches in many Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.
In late 2019 the bank received approval to establish a majority-owned securities joint venture, offering brokerage, investment advisory and underwriting services.
In August, the bank won regulatory approval from Beijing to become the first full foreign owner of a securities brokerage in the country. Its other business interest in China include asset management and futures business.
Global executives typically choose their words carefully when discussing China, where foreign companies have occasionally been subject to backlash for perceived offenses.
In 2019, comments about pigs in China https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-politics-idUSKCN1TF0C8 by a senior economist at UBS, perceived by some as a racist slur, caused an outcry and prompted one Chinese firm to suspend all business ties with the Swiss bank.
BOOMING ECONOMY 
In Boston, Dimon also said he expected inflation from supply chain issues will prove fleeting but that higher oil prices and wages will not go away. He anticipates a percentage point or two of the recent 5% U.S. inflation pace will fade as prices for items such as used cars and lumber stop rising.
""There are other things which are probably not that transitory,"" Dimon said. ""I don't think oil prices are going down.""
Dimon estimated there is about a one-third chance that inflation would be slight enough to bring on moderate increases in market interest rates that do not push the economy into recession. 
There's an equal chance that inflation will pick up and push the Federal Reserve to withdraw support for the economy, perhaps causing a mild recession, he said.
Dimon described the U.S. economy as ""booming.""
""Consumers and businesses are in good financial shape and there is still more monetary and fiscal stimulus coming,"" he said.
Asked about cryptocurrencies, Dimon repeated prior warnings to buyers.

""It is not really a currency,"" Dimon said, calling them ""crypto tokens"" with no intrinsic value that have run up in price on speculation fueled by government stimulus payments.
""It is hysteria,"" he said.

Investing.com - China's  Xiaomi  (OTC:XIACF) Corp (HK:1810) announced an 8.2% rise in third-quarter revenue on Tuesday. The performance reportedly fell below expectations and is attributed to competition from rival smartphone makers.
Shares fell by 6.96% to HKD19.26 ($2.47) by 11:57 PM ET (4:57 AM GMT).
Xiaomi earns most of its revenue by selling smartphones. It said that its smartphone revenue rose 0.4% to CNY47.8 billion ($7.49 billion) in the three months to Sept. 30.
However, smartphone shipments fell 5.8% on the year in the third quarter to 43.9 million units. The global chip shortage was cited as the reason for the drop.
Xiaomi president Xiang Wang said in an earnings call that the company is ""working hard"" to obtain supplies for 4G handsets in overseas markets.
He expects the shortage to last until the first half of next year. But he still believes Xiaomi will ""maintain very high growth"" in 2022.
Overall sales rose to CNY78.06 billion in the third quarter of 2021 but missed a market estimate of CNY79.20 billion from Refinitiv.
Xiaomi had managed to grab market share in China after rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd retreated from being hit by sanctions. However, it has recently been facing stiff competition from just top-sellers Oppo and Vivo, as well as Huawei spinoff brand Honor.
Honor edged past Xiaomi to grab the No. 3 spot in China’s smartphone market share for the July-September quarter, according to market analyst firm Canalys.
Xiaomi's shipments in China grew just 4% year-on-year in the period, Canalys said. But its overall smartphone sales in the country still fell 5%.
Xiaomi has hit back by focusing on brick-and-mortar retail. Last month, the company opened its 10,000th store in China. It aims to triple the number over the next two to three years.
The company claimed in March that it would spend $10 billion to enter the electric vehicle (EV) market. It now expects to start mass production of EVs in the first half of 2024.
Xiaomi also earns revenue by selling online ads and other types of consumer hardware. Its internet services unit, which makes money mainly through ads across various apps, jumped 27% year on year.
Excluding one-time gains and losses, Xiaomi earned CNY5.18 billion in profit, largely in line with the average analyst expectations for CNY5.09 billion."

Shares fell nearly 7% at the market's open on Wednesday.
The company, which gets the vast majority of its revenue by selling mobile handsets, said smartphone revenue rose 0.4% to 47.8 billion yuan ($7.49 billion) in the three months to Sept. 30.

(Reuters) - A federal jury on Tuesday found that pharmacy chain operators CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc helped fuel an opioid epidemic in two Ohio counties, in the first trial the companies have faced over the U.S. drug crisis.
Jurors in Cleveland federal court after six days of deliberations concluded that actions by the pharmacy chains helped create a public nuisance that resulted in an oversupply of addictive pain pills and the diversion of those opioids to the black market.
Mark Lanier, a lawyer for Ohio's Lake and Trumbull counties, called the verdict a ""landmark decision"" that paved the way for them to each seek more than $1 billion from the companies to help address the deadly epidemic's toll in their communities.
U.S. District Judge Dan Polster will decide how much the companies owe to abate the epidemic in the counties and is expected to hold a trial on that question in April or May.
The verdict bolstered efforts by state and local governments to negotiate settlements resolving thousands of other cases against the pharmacy chains. Joe Rice, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he looked forward to discussing potential settlements.
""You can be sure the message from this jury is going to be talked about in the boardrooms of every corporation involved in the pharmaceutical chain that's involved in this litigation,"" he said.
Stock prices for the companies briefly fell after the verdict but quickly rebounded and closed up less than 1%.
CVS, Walgreens and Walmart said they would appeal the verdict, arguing it ran contrary to the facts and that it misapplied public nuisance law to hold them liable under a novel legal theory that courts in California and Oklahoma have recently rejected in similar cases against drugmakers.
""We will appeal this flawed verdict, which is a reflection of a trial that was engineered to favor the plaintiffs' attorneys and was riddled with remarkable legal and factual mistakes,"" Walmart said.
U.S. officials have said that by 2019, the health crisis led to nearly 500,000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades.
Over 100,000 people died from drug overdoses during the 12-month period ending April 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report last week, a record driven in large part by deaths from opioids like fentanyl.
THOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS 
More than 3,300 opioid lawsuits have been filed nationally against drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies, culminating with many of the companies - though not the pharmacies - agreeing to proposed global settlements.
The three largest U.S. distributors that supply pharmacies and hospitals - McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp - and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in July proposed paying up to $26 billion to settle most of the lawsuits against them.
A bankruptcy judge in September approved a settlement by OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its wealthy Sackler family owners that the company values at more than $10 billion.
The pharmacies, however, went to trial despite the urging of the judge to settle.
At trial, lawyers for Lake and Trumbull counties argued that the pharmacies failed to ensure opioid prescriptions were valid and allowed excessive quantities of addictive pain pills to flood their communities.
The pharmacy operators denied the allegations. They said they took steps to guard against diversion of pills and blamed others, including doctors, regulators and drug traffickers, for the epidemic.
The verdict followed recent setbacks for plaintiffs pursuing some of the other opioid cases nationally.

Oklahoma's top court on Nov. 9 overturned a $465 million judgment, and a California judge this month ruled in favor of four drugmakers in a case brought by several large counties.
Other trials are underway in New York involving drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd and  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV), and in Washington state with the three distributors.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Wednesday morning, as investors await the minutes from the latest U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, alongside other U.S. data. Investors are also weighing the risk that central banks will tighten monetary policy to curb inflation.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.07% by 9:36 PM ET (2:36 AM GMT), with markets re-opening after a holiday. Data released earlier in the day showed that November’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was 54.2. The data also included the services PMI.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.37% and in Australia, the ASX 200 inched down 0.09%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.20%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.19% and the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.10%.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was around 1.65%, as the prospect of the Fed quickening its asset tapering programs tempered bond market inflation expectations. However, expectations remain elevated.
With U.S. equity and bond markets due to be closed on Thursday for a holiday, data including the Fed meeting minutes, GDP, and initial jobless claims will be released later in the day.
In regards to the Fed minutes, the key detail that investors should look out for is “discussions around the criteria for quicker asset tapering,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Carol Kong said in a note.
Inflation trends indicate that the Fed needs to start tightening sooner than presently signaled, the note added.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) hiked interest rates to 0.75% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day. The RBNZ move, a bid to curb inflationary pressures, was smaller than expected and the central bank projected 2% benchmark borrowing costs by the end of 2022.
Investors are now looking at whether inflation, which continues to remain at high levels, will prompt other key central banks, including the Fed, to hike interest rates quicker than planned.
“For quite a while now that extra liquidity hasn’t been going into the economy, it has been going more into the markets. The Fed is going to start pulling back on that,” Miller Tabak + Co. chief market strategist Matt Maley told Bloomberg.
The Bank of Korea will release its own policy decision on Thursday. Across the Atlantic, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will speak at a Cambridge Union event on Thursday."

Extended factory closures in Vietnam, Gap's top country for sourcing which accounts for 30% of its production, have led to delays in the shipping of inventory and forced the retailer to invest about $450 million to lift freight by air and ensure shelves are not empty during the crucial holiday season.
""While we had planned into the known supply chain constraints as we entered the quarter, including COVID-related closures in Vietnam, the shock to our business persisted longer than anticipated,"" Chief Executive Officer Sonia Syngal said.
Inventory shortages due to port and airport congestion, surging shipping costs and labor crunches have been plaguing retailers globally, with companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) having to deal with the prospect of empty shelves.
Gap, which ended the third quarter with inventory down 1%, said shortages dented quarterly sales by about $300 million, as brands were unable to meet the strong demand stemming from eased restrictions and a return to social gatherings. 
However, Syngal remained optimistic over plans to invest into air freight due to continued strong demand for Gap's Yeezy hoodies and Old Navy clothing.

The Banana Republic owner expects annual net sales of about 20%, compared with its prior forecast for growth of 30%. Analysts expect a 28.4% growth, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Gap also cut its estimates for annual profit, excluding some charges, to between $1.25 and $1.40 per share from $2.10 to $2.25. Analysts on average expect a profit of $2.20 per share.

Consumers resorted to buying used cars and parts, which benefits a company such as AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN). The stock has seen strong revenue growth and share gains this year. Since AN is still very much undervalued, there is a lot more upside left for investors.AutoNation, Inc. (AN) is the largest automotive dealer in the United States, with over 230 dealerships and over 300 locations, including collision centers. AN has eight AutoNation USA used-vehicle stores, four auction sites, and over 50 collision centers across 16 states, but primarily in the Sunbelt metropolitan areas.
The company just posted its sixth consecutive record numbers for the third quarter. Earnings surged 115% year over year due to higher-than-expected profits from the new and used vehicle units. Low inventory due to the chip shortage is yielding strong pricing power for dealers.
Management believes demand will continue to exceed supply well into next year. An upside to recent inflation is that customers with trade-in vehicles are pretty happy as they are worth more than expected. This means inflation isn't likely to slow consumers' automotive purchasing power in 2022.

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq ended lower for a second straight session on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 rose, as rising Treasury yields prompted investors to sell Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other Big Tech names and buy stocks with lower valuations.
The S&P 500 growth index dipped 0.3% and the value index climbed 0.8%.
Treasury yields extended gains as investors ramped up expectations of interest rate hikes next year after Jerome Powell was nominated by President Joe Biden as fed chair for a second term.
Tesla fell over 4% and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) lost 0.6%, with the two companies dragging on the Nasdaq more than any other stocks. Rising interest rates tend to make growth stocks less attractive to investors.
“The market is being whipsawed by a holiday shortened week, and it’s taking its cue from the recent uptick in interest rates, giving investors additional reasons to take profits in an overvalued market,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York.
With banks benefiting from higher interest rates, the S&P 500 banks index jumped 2%, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) all rallying.

The company said it was expecting fourth-quarter revenue from continuing operations in the range of $27 billion to $28 billion, above analyst estimates of $26.23 billion, according to Refinitv IBES.
Revenue at Dell's client solutions business, home to its hardware devices, rose 35% in the quarter on booming demand from companies upgrading their computer systems to meet work-from-home challenges.
Dell benefits from having a diverse portfolio of software and hardware revenue streams, and it is now trying to tap into high-growth markets, such as edge computing, cloud and telecoms, that have gained traction since the pandemic began. 
Revenue from its infrastructure solutions group, which includes the data center business, was up 5% at $8.4 billion in the quarter.
Total revenue jumped 21% to $28.39 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $26.82 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The company's net income surged more than four-fold to $3.89 billion, or $4.87 per share, in the third quarter ended Oct. 29, from $881 million, or $1.08 per share, a year earlier. 
Meanwhile, rival PC-maker HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) also reported a quarterly profit that more than quadrupled to $3.09 billion, and said its personal systems unit posted a 13% rise in revenue.

Dell's freshly spun off cloud computing unit, VMware (NYSE:VMW), posted a 10% rise in revenue during the quarter.

The Seattle-based company, like other retailers, is under tremendous pressure to keep its shelves stocked for the holiday season as shipping logjams, shuttered factories in Asia and a scarcity of raw materials rip through global supply chains and result in product shortages.
Nordstrom Rack off-price stores have especially suffered from severe shortages of women's apparel and shoes.
The company said third-quarter net sales at Nordstrom Rack stores fell 8% from 2019 levels, at a time when rivals Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) have returned to above pre-pandemic sales levels.
Chief Executive Officer Erik Nordstrom said the business' underperformance was due to internal decisions as much as the broader supply-chain issues. 
""We have not responded as quickly and as aggressively as we needed to, with Rack in particular... we've been significantly under inventory plans all year,"" Nordstrom said on a call with analysts. 
The company also reported a jump in costs in the quarter as it spent more on staffing its stores amid labor shortages in the United States that have forced retailers to increase wages and hand out hefty bonuses.
Nordstrom said in October it would hire more than 28,000 workers for the holiday season, offering new store employees up to $650 in incentive pay.
Nordstrom maintained its annual revenue growth forecast of more than 35%, while rival Macy's last week raised its sales expectations to as much as 40%.

The company posted a quarterly profit of $64 million, or 39 cents per share, missing estimates of 56 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

The top-of-the-line ""Edition 1"" of the Hummer will have an electric driving range of 329 miles, Duncan Aldred told reporters on a conference call. GM is launching the vehicle with that model, with a starting price above $100,000, and subsequent models, with higher EV driving ranges and lower starting prices, will be added in 2023, he said.
Aldred said more than 80% of the reservations for the Hummer pickup were for the Edition 1 model and nearly half of the more than 125,000 people who have expressed interest in the Hummer have put down $100 to reserve the truck.
The Hummer EV will join the electric pickup made by Rivian Automotive Inc in the market. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co will introduce its electric F150 Lightning next year. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is building a plant in Austin, Texas, to assemble the Cybertruck pickup.

Last week, GM showed off the Hummer, which was developed in 18 months, when U.S. President Joe Biden visited the Detroit-Hamtramck plant, dubbed ""Factory Zero."" GM officials have said the No. 1 U.S. automaker has sold out the first year's worth of the pickups.
The GMC Hummer SUV, which will be introduced in 2023, will ultimately become the predominant seller among the Hummer vehicles, accounting for about 60% of sales, Aldred said.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street shares were mixed on Tuesday and the dollar slipped from a 16-month high as investors positioned for interest rate hikes in 2022 after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was nominated for a second term.
European shares slumped to a three-week low during their biggest daily loss in nearly two months as a resurgence in COVID-19 cases raised fears of tighter restrictions.
Oil prices jumped to a one-week high after a move on Tuesday by the United States and other consumer nations to release tens of thousands of barrels of oil from reserves fell short of some expectations.
In a historic rout, the Turkish lira plunged 15% and crashed to another record low during its second-worst day ever as investors panicked after President Tayyip Erdogan defended recent rate cuts and showed little concern for rising inflation.

Higher Treasury yields weighed on major U.S. technology stocks, pressuring the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Bank shares extended the previous day's gains, limiting losses elsewhere.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.54% to end at 35,813.28 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.17% to 4,690.69. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5% to 15,775.14.
""It's possible that interest rates will be moved higher earlier than expected,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. 
""But that result, while positive for bank stocks, is not positive for the rest of the stock market, particularly technology, which trades on very high price/earnings multiples.""
The pan-European STOXX 600 shed 1.3%, with only the oil & gas and basic resources sectors trading higher. 
U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday tapped Powell to continue as Fed chair, and Lael Brainard, the other top candidate for the job, as vice chair. The news initially buoyed Wall Street stocks, before the market pulled back in the afternoon with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closing well off all-time highs.
The sense that a second term under Powell could add to policymakers' desire to curb rising inflation also sent investors buying dollars.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.07%. The euro rose 0.12%, recovering slightly from a July 2020 low on better-than-expected business growth data.
U.S. Treasury yields were higher in choppy trading as investors prepared for the Fed to become more aggressive in fighting inflation, though two-year note yields dipped after hitting their highest level since early March 2020 on Monday.
""Interest rate hike expectations advanced with the market now pricing almost three hikes into 2022,"" Steen Jakobsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank, said. 
Market expectations for a first European Central Bank rate rise were brought forward to December 2022.
COVID CONCERNS
New concerns about the spread of COVID-19 added to the gloomy mood. Riskier assets have been shaken in recent sessions by surging COVID-19 cases in Europe and renewed curbs, dousing investor hopes of a quick recovery in consumption and growth worldwide.
Germany's outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel said the latest surge was the worst experienced by the country so far, while Austria went into a new lockdown on Monday.
The Euro STOXX 50 volatility index, Europe's main gauge of stock market anxiety, touched its highest level in almost seven weeks.
U.S. gold futures settled down 1.3% at $1,783 per ounce, also under pressure from the rate hike bets.
Elsewhere in commodities, oil prices rallied after the United States said it would release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain, to try to cool prices.

But analysts said the effect on prices was likely to be short-lived after years of declining investment in production and a strong global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Brent futures rose $2.61, or 3.3%, to settle at $82.31, while U.S. crude rose $1.75, or 2.3%, to settle at $78.50.

1322,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 04:51PM ET</span>",S&P 500 Ekes Out Gain After Cutting Losses as Tech Eases Off Lows,"By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The S&P 500 eked out a gain Tuesday, as cyclical sectors rallied and tech eased off session lows on dip-buying activity, though rising U.S. Treasury yields weighed on sentiment on the sector.   
The S&P 500 rose 0.17%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.55%, or 194 points, the Nasdaq, which had fallen more than 1% during the day, closed down about 0.50%.
Tech and communications services – growth sectors of the market that tend to include stocks with higher valuation – fell out of favor as rising U.S. Treasury yields weighed on sentiment.
The selloff in tech has been driven by the “re-steepening in the yield curve as the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year Treasury yields moved back to 105 basis points in a relatively short order,” Mark Luschini, chief investment officer at Janney Montgomery Scott, told Investing.com in an interview on Tuesday.
Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON),  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), were some of the hardest hit growth names, with the latter also pressured by concerns about future growth.
Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) fell more than 14% after warning of a slowdown in revenue growth as the pandemic-fueled boost to user growth is expected to slow as employees return to the office.
“While we're positive on Zoom's strategic initiatives and investments in key growth areas, we find it tougher to like a stock with more sharply decelerating growth and incremental pressure on profitability,” Deutsche Bank said in a note as it slashed its price target on the Zoom to $280 from $350.
Big tech ended mixed, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) higher, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ending lower. Despite the rise in yields, dip-buying in big tech is expected to continue.
“[W]hen somewhat frothy expectations build valuations up to the point where names that are among the leadership in tech are increasingly vulnerable to a pullback in their share price, [investors] should use those opportunities to add to positions if they're underweight or have established positions,” Luschini added.
Consumer discretionary also weighed on the broader market, paced by a 12% slump in  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) after the electronics retailer’s weaker-than-expected holiday comparable sales offset third-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Cyclical corners of the market including financials, energy and industrials racked gains amid a rotation from value to growth.
Energy jumped more than 3% as oil prices rallied despite President Joe Biden saying Tuesday the U.S. will release 50 million barrels of oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in tandem with other major oil consuming countries to curb rising energy prices.
“It will take time, but before long, you should see the price of gas fall where you fill up your tank,” Biden said on Tuesday. "

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (Reuters) - A New York trial judge on Tuesday extended a ban keeping the New York Times from publishing some materials concerning the conservative activist group Project Veritas, a restriction the newspaper said violated decades of First Amendment protections.
Justice Charles Wood of the Westchester County Supreme Court said his temporary ban imposed on Nov. 18 will run at least until Dec. 1, a deadline for Project Veritas to respond in writing to the Times' bid to end it.
The judge granted the extension at a 1-3/4-hour hearing in White Plains, which was part of a defamation lawsuit that Project Veritas filed against the Times last year.
Project Veritas, led by James O'Keefe, has used what critics view as deceptive tactics to expose what it describes as liberal media bias.
It has objected to a Nov. 11 Times article that drew from memos from a Project Veritas lawyer, and purported to reveal how the group worked with its lawyers to ""gauge how far its deceptive reporting practices can go before running afoul of federal laws.""
Wood said as the hearing began that the case involved a clash between two ""bedrock principles"" of law: ""freedom of the speech and freedom of the press, and attorney-client privilege.""
Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said the newspaper was disappointed but will press its First Amendment concerns. ""No libel plaintiffs should be permitted to use their litigation as a tool to silence press coverage about them,"" she said.
Project Veritas and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The group had been suing over a Sept. 2020 Times article describing a video it released that alleged voter fraud connected to the campaign of U.S. congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat.
Dean Baquet, the Times' executive editor, has said Wood's Nov. 18 order set a ""dangerous precedent,"" while the newspaper has said courts might find prior restraints acceptable only ""rarely,"" such as to protect national security.
Joel Kurtzberg, a lawyer for the Times, told Wood a longer ban would have broad, negative ramifications for journalists.
""What Project Veritas is seeking here is not about the continued use of information within this litigation, but limiting what journalists report and do outside this litigation,"" Kurtzberg said.
Libby Locke, a lawyer for Project Veritas, countered that the Times' use of memos by the group's lawyer Benjamin Barr ""compromises the uninhibited, robust communication between a client and lawyer.""
Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in a statement called the extended ban ""deeply troubling,"" reflecting how prior restraints are ""among the most grievous threats to the First Amendment.""

Project Veritas is also the subject of a Justice Department probe into its possible role in the theft of a diary from President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley, pages of which were published on National File, a right-wing website.
The Times had not faced any prior restraint since 1971, when the Nixon administration unsuccessfully sought to block the publication of the Pentagon Papers detailing U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.

Therefore, we think prominent grocery retailers The Kroger (KR), Albertsons (ACI), Casey’s General Stores (CASY), and Sprouts Farmers (NASDAQ:SFM) could be solid bets now. Let’s discuss.
Despite the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, rising inflation, a slowdown in third-quarter GDP growth, and supply chain logjams, retail sales have been rising since August, with a 1.7% month-over-month rise in October, owing to declining jobless claims and rising consumer spending ahead of the holiday season.
Although supply chain constraints and rising costs continue to worry grocery retailers, the rise in online grocery sales and pickup/delivery services, increasing consumer spending, and increasing foot traffic to the stores should help grocery retailers offset the consequences of inflation and benefit substantially this holiday season. The National Retail Federation (NRF) forecasts retail sales to rise between 8.5% -10.5% during November and December.
Therefore, we think fundamentally sound grocery retailers The Kroger Company (NYSE:KR), Albertsons Companies, Inc. (ACI), Casey’s General Stores, Inc. (CASY), and Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (SFM) could be solid bets now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it has filed an antitrust lawsuit aimed at blocking U.S. Sugar Corp from buying rival Imperial Sugar Co, a deal the government said could drive up the price of sugar for households as well as food and drink makers.
The deal, if it goes forward, would mean that U.S. Sugar, owner and member of a cooperative with three other companies, and another company would have some 75% of refined sugar sales in the U.S. Southeast, the department said. 
""U.S. Sugar and Imperial Sugar are already multibillion-dollar corporations and are seeking to further consolidate an already cozy sugar industry,"" said Jonathan Kanter, the new head of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division.
The two companies often compete head-to-head to win customer contracts, the government said in its 27-page complaint.
U.S. Sugar, however, said the deal would protect American jobs.
""We disagree with the Justice Department’s decision and fully intend to litigate this matter,"" the company said in a statement. ""This transaction will improve supply chain logistics and will not result in higher prices or any harm to customers and consumers. We look forward to making our case in court.""
The other major sugar refiner in the region is American Sugar Refining, which sells under the ""Domino"" brand, the department said. 

U.S. Sugar announced in March that it would buy Imperial Sugar from commodities trader Louis Dreyfus Co. The deal is worth about $315 million, the Justice Department said.
Imperial Sugar operates a refinery at Port Wentworth in Savannah, Georgia, and a sugar transfer and liquification facility in Ludlow, Kentucky. It was bought by Louis Dreyfus in 2012 for $78 million.

Autodesk announced earnings per share of $1.33 on revenue of $1.13 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.26 on revenue of $1.12 billion.
Autodesk shares are down 0% from the beginning of the year, still down 11.74% from its 52 week high of $344.39 set on August 24. They are under-performing the Nasdaq 100 which is up 26.52% from the start of the year.

""Demand was robust in Q3, driving strong new subscriptions growth and renewal rates. We expect it to remain so in Q4,"" said Debbie Clifford, Autodesk CFO.
""However, supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures, a global labor shortage, and the ebb and flow of COVID, are impacting the pace of our recovery and outlook.""

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 03:47PM ET</span>",Alcohol and auto parts: Canada's warehouses fill up as floods stop flow of goods,"By Julie Gordon, Rod Nickel and Nichola Saminather
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's warehouses are filling up with everything from furniture to alcohol, after floods in British Columbia washed out critical rail and road lines, disrupting already strained supply chains.
A week after a phenomenon known as an atmospheric river brought a month's worth of rain in two days to the Pacific coast province, road traffic between Vancouver's port, Canada's busiest, and the rest of the country remains largely suspended.
 Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway is set to restart service on Tuesday, while Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) plans to reopen to limited traffic on Wednesday.
Shippers, meanwhile, are seeking extra storage space and eyeing alternative routes to move key manufacturing components. The disruptions come ahead of the busy holiday shopping season, with the Retail Council of Canada estimating a ""significant"" hit to companies.
Love Dodd, who owns three furniture stores on Vancouver Island, said he has containers of stock just sitting on ships in Vancouver and truckloads of mattresses stuck on the side of a flood-hit highway.
""A lot of our Black Friday merchandise was on those trailers. We're going to be short now for our big event for the year,"" he said, adding he expects a hit of at least C$200,000 ($157,755) on Black Friday sales alone. 
From forest fires to floods, natural disasters are exposing Canada's supply chain vulnerabilities, piling pressure on retailers and manufacturers already grappling with global supply chain clogs.
In Vancouver, warehousing and trucking firm 18 Wheels Logistics has filled every inch of its existing storage space with alcohol, auto parts and other goods. It signed a lease for another 180,000 square feet, the equivalent of two city blocks, to deal with excess demand.
""It's quite a bit of space to take on,"" said Chief Executive Adrian Wen.
Wen's firm is also re-routing trucks laden with perishable goods and high-demand auto parts across the border into Washington state on a more circuitous route to destinations in Alberta and further east in Ontario and Quebec.
He said the trip takes two extra days for a firm relying on 350 drivers.
The infrastructure and emergency cost of the flood alone has been pegged at more than C$1 billion ($787 million), according to local officials. That does not include the hit to farmers, retailers and other businesses.
Logistics firm Volume Freight said it has secured storage in Vancouver for trapped goods from tires to furniture and is arranging for trucks to haul product from the city to provinces further east, via the United States, a costly endeavor.
""Right now, everyone is sitting and waiting... Everyone's just in limbo,"" said Chief Operating Officer Danica Sabourin, adding even when rail lines reopen, delays will last weeks due to the backlog.
The Port of Vancouver, which moves about C$240 billion of goods a year, said anchorage demand is ""high and nearing capacity across all vessel types.""
On the other side of the disaster, a driver for Lipsett Cartage was forced to leave his truck loaded down with 94,000 pounds of steel in Kamloops, a city in British Columbia that is north of some of the worst flooding.
The company flew the driver back to Regina, but was unable to make a single shipment to or from Vancouver last week, whereas it usually does 10.
""It's a mess,"" said office manager Zoe Lipsett. ""We're absolutely to the wall, having companies call us, asking 'How are we going to do this?'""
For Toronto-based shopping bag seller Progress Luv2Pak, the floods are the latest hurdle cutting them off from two long-delayed containers stuck at the Vancouver port.
Even when the shipments are released, Progress will have to find an alternative route to get them east, President Ben Hertzman said.

""I’m pretty numb to it by this point. I wake up everyday kind of expecting there to be another piece of chaos in the supply chain,"" he said.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 03:42PM ET</span>","With U.S. inventories tight, 'Black Friday' drags through November","By Richa Naidu and Arriana McLymore
CHICAGO (Reuters) -Facing scarce year-end inventories and a shortage of workers, retailers are turning ""Black Friday"" into a month-long event.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the world's largest retailer, said on Monday it had already started ""Black Friday"" discounts https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-bets-black-friday-deals-early-holiday-shopping-push-2021-10-04, such as $30 off AirPods and KidKraft dollhouses. Walmart, whose stores will be closed on Thanksgiving for the second year in a row, said it would only offer the same discounts in stores on Friday. 
Rival big-box retailer  Target  (NYSE:TGT) on Sunday began running its own Black Friday sales, such as up to 30% off Samsung (KS:005930) and TCL flat screen televisions, and 50% off headphones. Target said on Monday that from now on, it will keep all its roughly 1,900 stores closed on Thanksgiving.
The Thanksgiving weekend previously kicked off the U.S. holiday shopping season with ""doorbuster"" discounts that had consumers lining up for blocks outside brick-and-mortar stores across the country on Black Friday, the day following Thanksgiving. In recent years, shopping at stores on Black Friday has faded, with online sales on the day outpacing brick-and-mortar sales https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-holidayshopping-sales-idINKBN1Y50S5 for the first time in 2019. 
This year, retailers started promoting online holiday ""deals"" as early as September https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/amid-supply-chain-snarls-retailers-pitch-early-holiday-shopping-2021-10-01, because the ongoing supply chain logjam https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/global-supply-chain-logjams-costs-focus-restaurant-chains-report-earnings-2021-10-26 threatened to block them from bringing new merchandise from Asia into the United States in the weeks before the Christmas holiday. But the bargains are modest. Retailers are expected to dangle price cuts of 5%-to-25% this Friday, only slightly deeper than the 5%-to-10%-off discounts they offered in October, according to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Digital Economy Index. 
Best Buy said on Tuesday https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/best-buy-forecasts-holiday-quarter-comparable-sales-below-estimates-2021-11-23 during an earnings conference that starting its Black Friday promotions in mid-October hurt quarterly profit margins. 
Retailers have increasingly reduced Black Friday store hours as shoppers turn to online shopping. ""Are discounts going to be as prevalent and as deep as they normally have been in the last few years?” asked Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD Group. “No, not if the demand for product is high and the supply is low – there’s no reason to promote discounts.”
""Stores are trying to berate the public into thinking ‘get it now or it might be gone,"" said 70-year-old artist Maggie Smith from Tucson, Arizona. 
According to a Reuters/IPSOS poll of about 1,000 people, more than a fifth of shoppers said they planned to primarily buy gifts online this year, while only 12% said they would shop primarily in stores. Online sales on Black Friday itself are expected to increase by 5% to $9.5 billion, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index.
Walmart and Target both said they would invest more in same-day options, including the ability for shoppers to pick up merchandise ordered online.
But fulfilling quick-turn online orders could put pressure on retailers' labor forces at a time when warehouse workers are in short supply. 
""We're seeing double-time for those shifts and increases in the pay, but then that's going to be painful,"" said Andy Halliwell, senior director of retail at consultancy Publicis Sapient. ""That's going to come out of the retailers' margins.""
JC Penney (OTC:CPPRQ), which is owned by Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) and Brookfield Asset Management, wants to hire 3,000 supply-chain workers in distribution centers in addition to 25,000 seasonal associates. The retailer is offering $2,000 retention bonuses for select supply chain associates in certain locations.
Macy’s, which plans to hire 71,000 seasonal workers, said that nearly one-third of those employees will work in fulfillment centers across the country, and Kohl’s in July said it would give maximum bonuses of $400 to hourly store and supply chain associates who stuck around for the holiday season.
To be sure, some retailers said they are preparing for brick-and-mortar stores to make a comeback, and said they have enough inventory.
""We’re seeing our customers return to in-store shopping,"" William White, Walmart's chief marketing officer in the United States, told Reuters. White also said Walmart has expanded its toy assortment by ""more than double.""

For Marc Ivan, a 23-year-old student in Philadelphia, going to stores isn't a tradition he plans to give up, even though he said he will do most of his shopping online as early as possible this week.
""I'll still go out on Black Friday, just to do some casual shopping and hang out with friends.""

The medical device company beat the EPS consensus by 3 cents, coming in at $1.32, and reported revenue of $7.85 billion, below expectations of $7.98 billion.
The news has seen Needham & Company analyst Michael Matson lower the price target for Medtronic shares to $145 from $152, maintaining a buy rating.
 Matson told investors that ""while management provided F3Q22 guidance that was below consensus,"" they believe it could prove conservative.
The analyst also noted that two of Medtronic's major pipeline projects, renal denervation, and Hugo robot, have been delayed.
However, Needham explained that Medtronic gained market share in most of its business units, and while maintaining its buy rating, the lower price target reflects MDT's slower FY22 growth.
Elsewhere, it was reported that Piper Sandler remains cautiously optimistic on Medtronic, saying that its organic revenue growth was mainly due to Covid-related hospital staffing shortages and a slowdown in surgical volumes."

(Reuters) - Newpark Resources (NYSE:NR), a provider of drilling fluids systems and composite matting systems used in oilfields, is being pushed by an activist investor to separate its industrials systems and fluids business, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Bradley Radoff, a private investor who previously worked as a portfolio manager at Daniel Loeb's Third Point hedge fund, has approached Newpark's board and is pushing for the split. He argues that the two segments lack synergies, appeal to different investor bases and boost excessive corporate costs.
""The Company's own disclosures and investor presentations highlight that the Industrial Solutions segment is a high-margin business on a growth trajectory, while the Fluid Systems segment is an unprofitable business operating at the opposite end of the energy transition spectrum,"" Radoff wrote to the board.
""Newpark's board and management team are highly focused on creating shareholder value as we execute on our strategic priorities, particularly the expansion and diversification of our Industrial Solutions business,"" a spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added that the company already said that it hired JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) to review its portfolio and evaluate alternatives. The company also said it values shareholder input and hopes ""to have continued constructive dialogue with (Bradley Radoff).”
Newpark undermines its ability to have ""a credible environmental, social and governance story"" by keeping the two segments together, Radoff wrote. A majority of Newpark's board members are oil and gas industry veterans.
The company's stock price closed at $2.72 on Monday. Five years ago, the stock was trading at $7.80. 
Radoff, who sits on independent energy company VAALCO Energy's board and has successfully pushed for changes at Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI), where the company agreed to add a diverse director and appoint a new chairman, is urging Newpark to split at a time a number of other companies are breaking apart.

So, shares of auto giants Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and  Toyota  Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) should benefit. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG (VWAGY) manufactures and sells automobiles primarily in Europe, North America, South America, and the Asia-Pacific. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based company operates in four segments: Passenger Cars and Light Commercial Vehicles; Commercial Vehicles; Power Engineering; and Financial Services. In comparison, Japan’s Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) designs, manufactures, assembles, and sells passenger vehicles, minivans and commercial vehicles, and related parts and accessories. It operates in Automotive; Financial Services; and All Other segments.
The global semiconductor shortage, supply chain crisis, and labor shortages have wreaked havoc on the auto manufacturing industry. However, massive government and private investments to boost semiconductor production should gradually ease the problem and help auto manufacturers boost production. Furthermore, the rising demand for electric vehicles (EVs) due to rising oil prices and climate change concerns should drive the industry’s growth. In addition, traditional automakers might benefit more than specialist EV manufacturers because of their broad portfolio of cars and market dominance. According to a report by Market Research Future, the automotive industry is expected to grow at a 4.5% CAGR between 2021 -2028. Therefore, both VWAGY and TM should benefit.
TM stock has gained 4.1% in price over the past month, while VWAGY has returned 1%. However, VWAGY’s 49.9% gains year-to-date are significantly higher than TM’s 20.3% returns. Moreover, VWAGY is the clear winner with 62.2% gains versus TM’s 32% returns in terms of the past year’s performance.

Investing.com -- Tech stocks weighed on markets on Tuesday as bond yields climbed and investors turned to financials and energy. The Nasdaq was in the red most of the day, and remained there with a half-hour of trading left in the session.
Oil prices jumped after the U.S. joined with other nations to release crude from their strategic reserves, a move that is intended to lower gasoline prices for consumers, though it usually takes a few weeks for that transition. 
The move is also one of the ways President Joe Biden is trying to get a hold of inflation after October consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in 31, something that tends to anger voters.
An IHS Markit survey showed U.S. business activity slowed moderately in November, Reuters reported, with labor shortages and raw material delays. They are still in expansion territory on strength in the manufacturing sector.
Retailers continue to report issues with supplies going into the holiday season. Best Buy shares tumbled after it forecast slower fourth quarter comparable sales.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - T-Mobile USA agreed to settle a U.S. probe for $19.5 million after a massive 2020 outage led to more than 20,000 failed 911 emergency calls.
The settlement was prompted by a Federal Communications Commission investigation into a more than 12-hour outage in June 2020 that led to congestion across No. 3 wireless carrier T-Mobile’s networks, and caused ""the complete failure of more than 23,000 911 calls.""
T-Mobile as part of the consent decree with the FCC has also agreed to make new commitments to improve 911 outage notices.
An October 2020 FCC report found the T-Mobile outage disrupted calling and texting services nationwide and access to data service in some areas. It resulted in at least 250 million total calls failing. 
The FCC estimated ""over 250 million calls ... from other service providers’ subscribers to T-Mobile subscribers failed due to the outage"" and ""at least 41% of all calls that attempted to use T-Mobile’s network during the outage did not complete successfully.""
T-Mobile said Tuesday it has ""built resiliency into our emergency systems to ensure that our 911 elements are available when they’re needed. Following this outage, we immediately took additional steps to further enhance our network to prevent this type of event from happening in the future.""
Then-FCC chairman Ajit Pai said the FCC staff report showed the company did not follow established network reliability best practices that could have potentially prevented or mitigated the outage.

The FCC report said the outage was caused ""by an equipment failure and then exacerbated by a network routing misconfiguration that occurred when T-Mobile introduced a new router into its network.""
T-Mobile said earlier its network experienced an 18% reduction in completed calls during the outage but in the report acknowledged network congestion ""likely required many of its subscribers to make 2-3 call attempts before successfully connecting.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Detroit's Big Three automakers are not yet mandating vaccines for thousands of unionized workers even as they said in a joint statement with the United Auto Workers on Tuesday that they will extend requirements for workers to wear masks at work sites.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Chrysler-parent Stellantis and the UAW said they have agreed that unionized auto workers will be asked to report vaccination status on a voluntary basis, but not as a requirement. They also agreed to continue mask requirements at work sites.
The White House wants employers to mandate vaccinations.
Labor Department rules issued Nov. 5 requiring all companies with 100 or more employees to mandate vaccines or regular testing by Jan. 4 for nearly all employees have been put on hold by a federal appeals court. On Tuesday, the Biden administration asked a court to lift the stay.
""Vaccination requirements work. They’re implementable without disruptions. And they boost — they boost dramatically vaccination rates,"" White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said on Monday.
The UAW has resisted suggestions it agree to vaccine mandates.
UAW President Ray Curry in September told members that ""until the various rules described above are finalized, the UAW’s bargaining position continues to be that vaccination is strongly encouraged, but a personal choice.""
Biden has worked hard to win the autoworkers’ support, in part because UAW members are crucial to winning elections in Michigan and other Midwestern states.
But the UAW’s reluctance to support vaccination mandates reflects a broader resistance among many unions to the Biden administration’s policies.
Last week, Stellantis said it would require all of its 14,000 U.S. salaried non-union employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Jan. 5, as it prepares for a phased reopening of its U.S. offices next year.
Most, but not all, of the salaried workforce of U.S. automakers is not unionized.
Nearly 80% of its salaried non-union U.S. workforce self-reported that they are fully vaccinated, Stellantis said.
Earlier this month, Ford said it would require most of its 32,000-strong U.S. salaried workforce to be vaccinated.
The second largest U.S. automaker earlier this month said more than 84% of U.S. salaried employees already are vaccinated.

Ford said earlier it was still evaluating its policy for ""manufacturing locations, parts depots and Ford Credit, including analyzing federal and collective bargaining requirements.""
GM, Ford and Stellantis said last month they would mandate vaccines for all autoworkers in Canada. GM declined to say Friday if it would require vaccines for U.S. salaried employees.

Apple said it is seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices, a move that would make its software defunct.
According to Apple, the attacks are only aimed at a very small number of users, but they can affect people across multiple platforms, including iOS and Android.
While the tech company said it has now patched a previous vulnerability used to break into Apple devices, there is a publicly documented history from researchers and journalists of the spyware being used to target journalists, activists, dissidents, academics, and government officials.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street banks are planning for a sustained period of higher inflation, running internal health checks, monitoring whether clients in exposed sectors could pay back loans, devising hedging strategies and counseling caution when it comes to deals. 
U.S. consumer prices this month posted their biggest annual gain in 31 years, driven by surges in the cost of gasoline and other goods.
Senior bank executives have become less convinced by central bankers' arguments that the spike is a temporary blip caused by supply chain disruption and are stepping up risk management. 
Higher inflation is generally seen as a positive for banks, raising net interest income and boosting profitability. But if it jumps high too quickly, inflation could become a headwind, top bankers warn.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Operating Officer John Waldron last month identified inflation as the No. 1 risk that could derail the global economy and stock markets.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told analysts last month that banks ""should be worried"" that high inflation and high interest rates increase the risk of extreme price movements.
A sustained period of higher inflation would pose both credit and market risk to banks, and they are assessing that risk in internal stress tests, said one senior banker at a European bank with large U.S. operations.
Risk teams are also monitoring credit exposures in sectors most affected by inflation, another banker said. They include firms in the consumer discretionary, industrial and manufacturing sectors.
""We are very active with those clients, offering hedging protections,"" said the banker, who asked not to be named as client discussions are confidential.
Clients that may need extra funding to get them through a period of higher inflation are being advised to raise capital while interest rates remain relatively low, the banker said.
""It's still a very beneficial environment to be in if you need funding, but that won't last forever.""
Investment bankers are also assessing whether higher inflation and monetary tightening could disrupt record deals and public offering pipelines.
""We expect a sustained period of higher inflation, and monetary tightening could slow the momentum in the M&A market,"" said Paul Colone, U.S.-based managing partner at Alantra, a global mid-market investment bank.
Alantra is advising clients in the early stages of M&A discussions ""to review the risks sustained inflation could bring to both valuation and business results,"" Colone said.
Sales and trading teams, meanwhile, are taking more calls from clients looking to reposition portfolios, which are vulnerable to a loss in value. When inflation ran out of control in the 1970s, U.S. stock indices were hit hard.
""We're seeing more interest from clients in finding some manner of inflation protection,"" said Chris McReynolds,  Barclays  (LON:BARC)' head of U.S. inflation trading. 
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which are issued and backed by the U.S. government, are proving popular, he said. The securities are similar to Treasury bonds but come with protection against inflation. 
Traders are also seeing demand for derivatives that offer inflation protection such as zero-coupon inflation swaps, in which a fixed rate payment on an investment is exchanged for a payment at the rate of inflation.
""People are realizing they have inflation exposure and it makes sense for them to hedge their assets and liabilities,"" McReynolds said.
Banks with diversified businesses are likely to fare best during a sustained period of inflation, most analysts say. 
They expect that a steepening yield curve will boost overall profit margins, while trading businesses can benefit from increased volatility and the strength of deals, and initial public offering pipelines mean investment banking activity will remain healthy.

But Dick Bove, a prominent independent banking analyst, takes a different view. He anticipates the yield curve will flatten as higher rates reduce inflation expectations, crimping profit margins. 
""Perhaps for as long as 12 to 18 months, bank stock prices will rise,"" he said. ""At some point, however, if inflation continues to rise, the multiples on bank stocks will collapse and so will bank stock prices.""

Tighter restrictions in many countries and a reimposed lockdown in Austria - the first in western Europe since vaccines were rolled out - has raised the spectre of a second straight winter of tough curbs throughout the continent.
""Up until last weekend, things were going great. Volumes were back running at about 100% of our pre-COVID price volumes. It has been disrupted by the Austrian lockdown and there is a renewed concern across Europe about a fourth or firth wave of COVID,"" O'Leary told an online event
""I think we're in for a fraught period between now and Christmas where it looks like Europe is going to get very nervous again at the worst time of the year when people are making their Christmas travel plans.""
""I think it's inevitable we will undermine confidence between now and Christmas, and that will disrupt Christmas and also unsettle people between Christmas and New Year when they would normally start booking their summer holidays.""

O'Leary said earlier this month that while winter would be tough, he hoped that keeping prices low and passenger numbers high over that period would set Europe's largest low cost airline up for a very strong recovery in the summer of 2022.
He reiterated on Tuesday that it was inevitable air fares will increase into the summer of 2022 and the Irish carrier hoped to get back to pre-pandemic pricing levels.

Thus, we think renowned stocks TotalEnergies (TTE),  Nucor  Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), and  Steel Dynamics  (NASDAQ:STLD), each possessing impressive growth attributes, could be solid bets now. Let’s discuss.Growth stocks tend to outperform the broader markets during periods of economic recovery. This is evident in the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF’s (SPYG) 30.3% returns year-to-date, versus the benchmark S&P 500 index’s 24.7% gains over this period. Strong consumer spending and favorable government policies have helped growth stocks to rally so far this year as the global economy bounced back from its pandemic-led recession.
However, most European countries are now re-imposing travel restrictions in the wake of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. This raises concerns regarding the global economy's recovery. However, the White House has been clear that it has no plans to shut down the economy because 82% of the U.S. population is vaccinated. This, coupled with the recently passed landmark infrastructure bill, should allow the U.S. economy to expand steadily in the coming months.
The conducive macroeconomic backdrop should allow growth stocks to generate momentum in the coming months. Thus, we think fundamentally-sound growth stocks TotalEnergies SE (TTE), Nucor Corporation (NUE), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA), and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD) could be profitable bets now.

The shares have rallied more than 12% since news of the cancelled offering. So, with poor earnings growth prospects amid a decelerating housing market, the question becomes is UWMC an ideal bet now? Read more to find out.UWM Holdings Corporation (UWMC), in Pontiac, Michigan, is the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the United States and is the publicly traded indirect parent of United Wholesale Mortgage, LLC. On November 18, UWMC’s secondary offering of Class A stock and concurrent share repurchase was terminated by its principal shareholder SFS Holding Corp. 
Regarding the termination of the offering, company Chairman and CEO Mat Ishbia said, “As the principal owner of SFS, I was willing to sell a percentage of our ownership in UWM at less than what I think to be fair value because we were advised that increased float in the public market would be beneficial for the UWMC shareholders, including its largest shareholder, SFS. I was also willing to have SFS sell additional shares to the company at the same time and priced to make good on our buyback commitment and reduce the number of shares outstanding without also decreasing the public float. Unfortunately, while there was more than enough demand from potential investors, the overall market conditions were such that the prices offered were not at levels that I will entertain.”
UWMC’s public float was expected to increase 50% following the secondary offering, substantially lowering its EPS and ROE. Therefore, the cancellation of this offering has evoked a positive reaction from investors. Shares of UWMC have surged 12.3% in price since November 18 to close yesterday’s trading session at $6.93.

(Reuters) -Best Buy Co Inc on Tuesday projected quarterly sales below market estimates, a sign that shortages of electronic products would hamper its business during the crucial holiday season.
The forecast sent the retailer's shares tumbling 14% and reflected the toll of shipping logjams, shuttered factories and a scarcity of raw materials that have ripped through global supply chains this year.
Best Buy is facing supply constraints in categories such as appliances, mobile phones and gaming, Chief Executive Officer Corie Barry said on a post-earnings call. 
Sony Corp (T:6758) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have struggled to keep the latest versions of their gaming consoles in stock since their launch a year ago due to a widespread chip crunch, while some analysts have warned Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s latest iPhones could be in short supply during the holiday season.
Those devices are important for Best Buy as they sell in large numbers and act as a magnet for customers who often spend on other products.
""Getting hold of Apple's latest iPhone or its new laptops is very challenging. These items should, in theory, be providing a nice lift to sales as the holidays approach, but stock levels remain low,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of research provider GlobalData.
The company had included easier access to ""hardest-to-find"" products as a perk in a $200-a-year membership program launched last month to navigate the shortage.
But costs related to the program, increased expenditure to expedite some shipments and earlier Black Friday deals were expected to take a toll on its margins in the fourth quarter.

Best Buy forecast current-quarter comparable sales between a fall of 2% and a rise of 1%, the midpoint of which was below estimates of a 0.1% rise, according to Refinitiv data.
Its shares fell the most in intraday trading since the pandemic-driven selloff in March 2020.

1356,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 11:58AM ET</span>",U.S. tech execs hone approach to counter unions amid growing worker interest,"By Julia Love
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In June, managers at location data startup Mapbox came to employees with alarming news: The company had lost a $150 million investment, and worker organizing was to blame.
Prior to the all-hands meeting over Zoom, roughly two-thirds of the SoftBank-backed startup’s workers had signed cards indicating their desire to unionize, part of a wave of organizing in Silicon Valley. 
But after Mapbox management disclosed the botched investment – and said they worried funding trouble would persist if workers formed a union – the tide turned, one current and one former employee said. Workers at Mapbox, which was valued at more than $1 billion in its most recent private funding round and has engaged with so-called blank check companies about going public, voted against unionization in August.
Mapbox's response offers a window into how tech companies are pushing back as unions seek to bring workers into the fold. 
In recent years, the Communications Workers of America and the Office and Professional Employees International Union have launched campaigns in Silicon Valley, organizing workers at startups such as Kickstarter and Glitch. The CWA also formed the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Workers Union, a so-called minority union that does not have collective bargaining rights.
As unions continue engaging with workers, a playbook among tech companies is emerging, according to interviews with tech workers and union organizers: Warn employees about the impact a union would have on the startup’s prospects and, in particular, its ability to raise funds. Remind workers of their privilege to cast doubt on why they need a union. And hire law firms and consultants to help drive the point home. 
“Tech firms are willing to do whatever is necessary to keep unions out,” said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University. “They might think unions are fine for food-processing workers or for miners, but not in the tech sector.” 
SHIFTING POWER DYNAMIC 
The unions’ pushes are at an early stage, and it remains to be seen whether they will catch on widely. But the growing receptiveness in a sector long regarded as indifferent to organized labor speaks to a broader renegotiation of power that is playing out between tech companies and their employees, interviews with workers suggest. 
For many tech workers, the promise of a generous payday is no longer enough. They also want sound working conditions and assurances that the products they are building will not harm society, tech employees and organizers say.
Yet workers at high-risk, high-reward startups are loath to jeopardize the value of their stock options, or put their jobs at risk. That is why warnings about funding can be so effective, said Wes McEnany, a senior CWA campaign lead. 
In addition to Mapbox, management also said unionization could imperil future funding at Kickstarter and Glitch, according to former employees. Medium Chief Executive Ev Williams told workers that investors might shy away if the union prevailed, McEnany said. 
""After considering the benefits and costs, our employees voted overwhelmingly against forming a union,"" Mapbox said in a statement. ""It was their decision to make, and they made it unambiguously. We’re now focused on growing our business and supporting our customers."" 
Kickstarter and Glitch declined to comment. Williams did not respond.
Under U.S. law, companies may not threaten workers that they will lose their jobs if they unionize, but they can predict adverse consequences, said Gordon Lafer of the University of Oregon's Labor Education and Research Center. 
A VERY SCARY NUMBER
Some investors and financial advisers interviewed by Reuters said they view unions at startups as a drawback because they make it more difficult for companies to lay off workers and introduce more rules around compensation.
Yet Roy Bahat, head of venture capital firm Bloomberg Beta, said he doubted investors would pass up the chance to invest in a hot startup because it had a unionized workforce. 
""In the same way that (venture capitalists) overcome lots of obstacles to investing – everything from PR dilemmas to regulatory vulnerabilities to cofounder issues – unions are just another aspect of a company,"" Bahat said. ""They’re not fatal.""
In August, Jackson Lewis, a law firm known for its work in union avoidance, released a podcast https://www.jacksonlewis.com/event/unlikely-marriage-unions-and-tech-employees episode titled: “The Unlikely Marriage of Unions and Tech Employees.” Jackson Lewis lawyer Laura Pierson-Scheinberg said she was inspired to record the podcast by the increasing number of calls she received from tech companies inquiring about the prospect of union campaigns. 
The shift to working from home has weakened ties between companies and workers, creating an opening for unions, Pierson-Scheinberg said. 
Mapbox is known for its strong ties to nonprofits. But in recent years, some workers grew worried about how the mapping technology was being used by clients, one current and one former employee said.
Mapbox’s relationship with software company Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) Inc was of particular concern, one former employee said. Workers also wanted to formalize support for colleagues in the event of future layoffs.
Palantir could not immediately be reached for comment.
On their website, members of the Mapbox Workers Union wrote that they banded together ""to build a lasting, accountable, inclusive Mapbox.""

Mapbox management presented a variety of arguments against unionization, but funding concerns were especially resonant with workers.

Afterward, some workers who had supported the union told organizers they had had a change of heart.
The botched $150 million investment ""was a very large and very scary number,"" one employee said. ""The fear that that instilled didn’t go away.""

ROME (Reuters) -Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi has vetoed the third Chinese takeover in the country since his government took office in February, an official Hong Kong filing by the rebuffed group showed on Tuesday.
Zhejiang Jingsheng Mechanical said Rome had blocked its attempt to set up a joint venture with the Hong Kong arm of Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) to buy the U.S.-based group's screen printing equipment business in Italy.
The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Nov. 18, two government sources told Reuters, adding Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti had recommended the veto, arguing the takeover could have had consequences in the strategic semiconductor sector.
Among Applied Materials' products are machines used to manufacture semiconductors and other high-tech components.
The filing said the joint venture was also intended to take on Applied Materials' wafer equipment business in Singapore and its assets in China.
Italy reserves the right to use its anti-takeover legislation, or so-called ""golden powers"", to ward off undesired bids in industries deemed of strategic importance such as banking, energy, telecoms and health.
The government scrutinises a large number of merger and supply equipment deals, which in most cases are approved with recommendations intended to preserve the country's national interest.
Rome has so far stopped foreign interests in Italy five times since the introduction of the golden powers in 2012. 
Four of these episodes beat away Chinese bids. Three have been under Draghi's nine-month old government, with the other adopted in 2020 under Draghi's predecessor Giuseppe Conte.
Draghi vetoed last month the sale of a vegetable seed producer to Chinese-owned group Syngenta, and prevented in April Chinese company Shenzhen Invenland Holdings Co. Ltd. from buying a controlling stake in a firm producing semiconductor equipment.
Italy has also formally complained to Chinese investors over their undisclosed 2018 purchase of an Italian company making high-tech drones for the armed forces, in a first step towards possibly annulling the deal.

The so-called ""golden powers"" apply to non-EU groups and - under a temporary framework introduced in 2020 which is due to expire this year - to attempts by EU suitors to buy strategic companies.
One of the sources said Rome planned to extend the temporary regime by six months until June 30, 2022. This would include a measure forcing EU and non-EU suitors to seek government approval to buy a stake of at least 10% in strategic companies.

1358,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 11:57AM ET</span>","American Eagle Outfitters holiday inventory balloons, sales impress","By Praveen Paramasivam and Reshma Rockie George
(Reuters) -American Eagle Outfitters Inc said on Tuesday its inventory levels jumped ahead of the holiday season as it spent more on air freight to overcome supply-chain disruptions, after posting better-than-expected quarterly results.
Shoppers have been splurging on streetwear, visiting stores more after vaccinations and the easing of COVID-19 curbs. But congested ports and factory closures in Asia have resulted in nearly empty shelves for some retailers.
Abercrombie & Fitch Co on Tuesday also posted quarterly revenue above market expectations but said its inventory levels were largely flat from a year earlier. 
Shares in Abercrombie fell about 17%, tracking their worst day in 2-1/2 years, while those of American Eagle (NYSE:AEO) rose 5%.
Abercrombie is expected to take a hit of around $75 million in the fourth quarter due to higher freight rates, Chief Finance Officer Scott Lipesky said on a post-earnings call. 
American Eagle forecast additional holiday-quarter freight costs of $70 million to $80 million. The company, however, has been beefing up its logistics game, after it agreed this month to buy Quiet Logistics for $350 million, following its takeover of AirTerra earlier this year. 
Most other U.S. apparel sellers have reported an increase in inventory levels as they chartered their own container ships and ordered products in advance for the holidays.
American Eagle said its inventory at the end of the third quarter increased 32% to $740 million. ""We are in a healthy inventory position ... set up for a very strong holiday,"" Chief Operating Officer Michael Rempell told analysts. 

For American Eagle, third-quarter net revenue increased 24% to $1.27 billion, beating estimates of $1.23 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES. Helped by demand for its eponymous and Aerie brands, it also beat profit estimates.
Abercrombie's net sales, meanwhile, rose 10% to $905.2 million.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 11:57AM ET</span>",Not a dollar anymore: Most Dollar Tree products to get pricier,"(Reuters) -Dollar Tree Inc will start selling most products for $1.25 at all its eponymous stores, in an effort to offset the impact of spiraling freight costs and other pandemic-driven challenges.
The retailer said on Tuesday the new price point, which will be fully rolled out by the first quarter of 2022, would allow it to return to ""its historical gross margin range"" of 35% to 36% next year.
Chief Executive Officer Michael Witynski said the higher price point allows the discounter to expand assortments, introduce new products and sizes as well as bring back ""traffic-driving"" products.
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), known for selling everything from make-up to homeware at the $1 price-point, in September said it planned on adding new price points above $1 across some of its stores. 
The price increase is a good thing, as the 3Q results, and our first-quarter outlook indicate freight headwinds are worse than anticipated, Evercore analyst Michael Montani said.
Rising freight costs from global supply chain disruptions have dented profits for most of Corporate America, further pressuring many retailers already grappling with higher labor and raw material costs.
Dollar Tree said that freight costs were significantly higher than anticipated in the third quarter and expects this to continue in the near term.
It projected fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.69 to $1.79. Analysts on average were anticipating $1.75, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Net income for the company fell to $216.8 million, or 96 cents per share, in the quarter ended Oct. 30 from $330.0 million, or $1.39 per share, a year earlier.

Net sales rose 3.9% to $6.42 billion, edging past expectations of $6.41 billion.

The IG Metall trade union said seven employees had taken the first step towards setting up a works council, planning to choose an election committee on Nov. 29.
""A works council ensures that the interests of the workforce have a voice and a weight. This is in line with the democratic work culture in Germany,"" said Birgit Dietze, IG Metall district leader in Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony. The Tesla plant near Berlin will employ 12,000 workers, although only about a sixth of that have been hired so far, meaning the election of a works council will not take place soon, IG Metall said.
IG Metall has said applicants have told it that Tesla, whose CEO Elon Must is known for his rocky relationship with organised labour, is offering pay 20% below the collectively bargained wages offered at other German automakers.
Tesla is also shaking up conventional German contracts by offering packages with stock options and bonuses rather than predetermined holiday pay.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a phone call or email request for comment.

Earlier this year, Musk was ordered to delete a 2018 tweet threatening that U.S. employees would lose their stock options if they formed a union.
Musk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country's complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>",From pilots to ramp agents - U.S. airlines go all out to staff up,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) -From offering premium pay to hefty signing bonuses or poaching workers from other airlines, American carriers are scrambling to ramp up staffing for the holiday season and prevent disruptions that marred air travel this summer. After reducing headcount by thousands during the depths of the pandemic, the industry is grappling with shortages of pilots, flight attendants and customer service agents. Critics say the staff crunch is of the airline industry's own making as the deep job cuts last year, despite an infusion of $54 billion in federal aid to help cover payroll expenses, left it ill-equipped to handle the snapback in air travel.
Airlines have said the bailouts saved thousands of jobs, prevented bankruptcy and put them in a position to support the economy's recovery from the pandemic.
A Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) spokesperson said the company had no furloughs or job losses related to the pandemic. However, the company did have about 18,000 staff departures last year in the form of retirements or voluntary separations.
With willing workers in short supply across the United States and companies frantically vying for them, carriers are being forced to spend more to attract talent. ""The reality is that the hiring environment has changed as a result of the pandemic,"" American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)' chief operating officer, David Seymour, told employees in a memo this month. Piedmont Airlines, American's subsidiary, is trying to lure pilots with a $180,000 bonus offer. United Airlines is offering a $5,000 signing bonus for a ramp agent position in Boston.  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) has bumped up wages for its ramp agents by 30%. The ultra-low-cost carrier is offering a one-time graduation bonus of $1,250 and up to $4,500 a year in tuition reimbursement to flight attendants. The rush to hire in a tight labor market is driving up costs at a time when soaring jet fuel prices and higher airport charges are also squeezing profits. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)' wage expense as a percentage of revenue is up by 14 points this year versus 2019. There have been similar increases in salary costs at other carriers including United and American.
Yet headcount at U.S. scheduled air carriers in October was 14.3% below the pre-pandemic peak. By contrast, employment at restaurants and bars, struck equally hard by pandemic lockdowns, is just 6.4% below its peak before the COVID-19 outbreak. FADING ALLURE Industry experts attribute the sluggish recovery to the fading attraction of jobs with passenger airlines. Wages for some entry-level airline jobs, particularly low-skilled ones, pale in comparison with those in other industries even as the work has become more challenging. The situation is worse at regional carriers, which operate 43% of the flights of American, United and Delta. These companies provide connectivity to low-density networks, but their pilots and crews are paid far less. Even at the regional airlines that are subsidiaries of American and Delta, the wage gap is huge. For example, entry-level flight dispatchers at American earn more than twice the amount made by their counterparts at Piedmont Airlines. There is a similar gap between pay scales at Delta and its regional unit Endeavor Air. Keturah Johnson, who heads the union for Piedmont's flight attendants, said a lot of workers have been forced to pick up a second job as the wages at the regional carrier are not high enough to cover living costs. Piedmont's flight attendants last month voted to authorize a strike, demanding better pay and benefits. ""We are fighting for a livable wage,"" said Johnson. A CRISIS LONG IN THE MAKING Analysts say the labor crisis was in the making long before COVID-19 hit the industry. They trace its genesis to a wave of bankruptcies and consolidations after the 9/11 attacks, which made carriers too cost-conscious and excessively focused on productivity.

As airlines slimmed down, they became more reliant on employees logging more hours. The Association of Flight Attendants estimates the workload of flight attendants increased by at least 25% after 9/11. The pandemic-induced plunge in air travel prompted the industry to double down on cost cuts, leaving it with the lowest headcount in more than three decades. Meanwhile, quarantine requirements or illness further depleted its resources. ""COVID was the tipping point,"" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of travel consultancy Atmosphere Research Group. ""It ripped the protective layer of the airline industry and exposed many of its underlying challenges."" Airlines resumed hiring this spring as dipping COVID-19 cases brought passengers back. But the supply of new pilots is limited, and cargo carriers of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) are also vying for them. Faye Malarkey Black, head of the Regional Airline Association, said the supply of new pilots fell 60% in 2020. This year, it is about 36% below pre-pandemic levels, she said. Worries about a looming pilot shortage have dogged the industry for years. That did not stop carriers last year from pausing hiring and offering buyouts and retirement packages to thousands of aviators. SOARING ATTRITION RATE Faced with a crunch, they are now heavily poaching from regional carriers.  SkyWest  (NASDAQ:SKYW) Inc, which operates flights for Delta, American and United, last month said its attrition rate is running into double digits. To be sure, regional airlines have been losing pilots to major carriers for years. But Black said that trend is now ""on steroids."" 
Subodh Karnik, chief executive of Georgia-based ExpressJet Airlines, likened the demand for pilots to the frenzy in the U.S. housing market where houses are getting flooded with offers within days of their listing. He said one-fifth of the pilots at regional airlines are getting snatched away by big passenger and cargo carriers even before they can complete their mandatory training. Inadequate staffing runs the risk of causing operational meltdowns of the kind that have led to a spate of high-profile flight cancellations in recent months. Carriers such as American and JetBlue are offering bonuses, higher pay and other incentives to ensure they have enough workers for what is shaping up as the busiest holiday season in two years. If the shortages persist, Karnik warned that major carriers could stop servicing less profitable routes. United has decided to drop eight routes in the U.S. Midwest and South from its network. The airline's chief executive, Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX), told travel news industry website Skift last week that the cuts were the result of a pilot shortage. ""We don't have enough pilots to fly all the airplanes,"" he said.

1362,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",Anti-ARKK ETF Shines as Spiking Yields Drag Down Expensive Tech Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- The ETF designed to bet against Cathie Wood is starting to deliver as a jump in Treasury yields -- the bogeyman stalking growth shares -- slams her flagship fund.
The Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF (ticker SARK) has gained roughly 14% since launching two weeks ago. SARK -- originally named the Short ARKK ETF -- seeks to track the inverse performance of Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) through swap contracts.
Fueling SARK is a sell-off in the highly valued tech companies that populate Wood’s biggest ETF, which commands $18 billion in assets. President Joe Biden’s renomination of Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chairman sparked a surge in yields, hitting duration-sensitive growth shares.  Powell is perceived by market-watchers as more likely to raise rates than mooted rival Lael Brainard.
While SARK has only accumulated about $7.6 million since launching, its recent run-up should help attract cash, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. 
“Timing is everything for new ETF launches and SARK got lucky in that department. To pop 10% right off the bat should help it get going and attract audience,” BI senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said. “Beyond performance chasing, its main value add is convenience -- it makes betting against Cathie Wood a mere click of a button.”
Short interest in ARKK is currently 5.1% of shares outstanding, down slightly from a record 5.5% reached earlier this month, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd.
Wood’s bets have misfired as of late after ARKK’s dominant 150% rally in 2020. The ETF has slipped over 13% so far this year. Despite the drop, investors have continued to pour money into ARKK, which is on track for a $4.8 billion inflow in 2021.

Therefore, we think it could be an opportune time for buying oil extraction stocks to cash in on the commodity’s rebound. We believe low-priced extraction stocks W&T Offshore (WTI) and VAALCO Energy (EGY) could be solid bets amid the dip in oil prices. Let’s discuss.Oil prices fell to a six-week low last week on concerns over demand with new COVID lockdowns being considered or implemented in some countries. After Austria announced a nationwide lockdown on November 19, crude oil fell into negative territory. The U.S benchmark for oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), even fell more than 4% last week, to a price not seen since October 7.
However, according to OPEC, oil demand should exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2022. Therefore, stocks bought during the dip in the oil prices could deliver rewards to investors when oil prices rebound.
So, we think it could be worth betting on extraction stocks W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI) and VAALCO Energy, Inc. (EGY). These stocks are currently trading at less than $10 but possess solid rebound prospects.

The shares of Lucid Group (LCID) have gained recently despite the company’s weak fundamentals. So, we think they could witness a pullback in the near term. We also believe that the stocks of fundamentally strong EV companies NIO Inc. (NIO), XPeng Inc. (XPEV), Li Auto (LI), and Hyzon Motors (HYZN) are better bets than LCID now. So, let’s discuss.Concerns about climate change are causing carmakers to turn to electric vehicles (EVs). According to a Reuters study, carmakers plan to spend $515 billion over the next five to 10 years on developing battery-powered vehicles and financing the shift away from internal-combustion automobiles. Regulatory pressures on the industry are also powering this shift. Besides President Biden’s target of 50% of automobile sales to be EVs by 2030, countries including Sweden and Singapore are set to ban the sale of new combustion vehicles by 2030. As a result of these imperatives, the global EV market is expected to generate $812.89 billion by 2028, growing at a healthy 19.8% CAGR.
Last week, shares of EV start-up Lucid Group, Inc. (LCID) skyrocketed in price. The company’s market value increased to $89.9 billion following the stock’s 24% gain on November 16, after the announcement of increased reservations for its first vehicles. Company management also confirmed that its production plans for 2022 were still on track. However, the company’s fundamentals look weak. For its fiscal third quarter, ended September 30, LCID’s revenue decreased 30.5% year-over-year to $0.23 million. Its net loss and comprehensive loss increased 225.2% from the prior-year quarter to $524.40 million. Furthermore, Wall Street analysts expect a 12-month median price target of $44.33, indicating a 13.3% potential downside.
While LCID doesn’t look sufficiently fit to capitalize on the industry tailwinds, we think it could be wise to invest instead in the stocks of fundamentally strong EV companies NIO Inc. (NIO), XPeng Inc. (XPEV), Li Auto Inc. (LI), and Hyzon Motors Inc. (HYZN).

The forecast disappointed investors, coming at the start of the holiday season when electronic gadgets are among the most sought-after gift items.
A shortage of semiconductor chips used in electronic items has ensured that a lot of those products are in short supply, hurting retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Best Buy. This includes gaming consoles from Sony and Microsoft’s Xbox as well as Apple’s iPhones.
Higher spending to ensure stores are stocked has taken a toll on the company's profit margins.

Profit rate is seen declining by 30 basis points year-on-year.
Domestic revenue of $11 billion rose 1.2%, primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 2%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from permanent store closures in the past year, the company said.

Lockdowns and work from home policies due to the spread of COVID-19 over the past two years have been accompanied by a surge in pet sales, making companies that operate in the animal care market among winners of the pandemic. 
3.2 million UK households have brought a pet home since the start of the pandemic, as per the latest report from the Pet Food Manufacturers' Association (PFMA), a trade body representing the pet food industry.

The PFMA also estimates that around 17 million households were responsible for a pet's welfare, meaning roughly one in four British households owned a pet compared to one in five American households.

Pets At Home, which kept its stores, website and veterinary practices open for much of the pandemic, said new registrations at its high-margin veterinary practices business averaged at about 10,000 per week for the six months to Oct. 7.

Therefore, it we think it could be wise to bet on quality trucking stocks TFI International (NYSE:TFII), Schneider National (NYSE:SNDR), ArcBest Corporation (NASDAQ:ARCB), and  Marten Transport  (NASDAQ:MRTN). So, let’s examine the qualities of these names.The trucking industry is facing a worsening labor-shortage issue. The federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate did not go down well with most trucking associations amid record-high driver shortages. However, according to Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, “The ironic thing is most truckers are not covered by this, because they’re driving a truck, they’re in a cab, they’re by themselves, they wouldn’t be covered by this.” This re-assurance has paved the way for some optimism in the industry. And investors’ interest in trucking stocks is partly evident in the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF’s (XTN) 5.8% gains over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF’s (SPY) 3.2% returns.
President Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure spending is expected to rescue the country's ailing transportation systems, which has fostered a positive outlook on the trucking industry. With trucks predicted to be the predominant freight carriers in the future, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics and Federal Highway Administration recently estimated that U.S. freight activity would surge by 50% in tonnage to 28.7 billion tons between 2020 - 2050.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally strong trucking stocks TFI International Inc. (TFII), Schneider National, Inc. (SNDR), ArcBest Corporation (ARCB), and Marten Transport, Ltd. (MRTN).

However, advertising software start-up Phunware (PHUN), which is linked to former President Donald Trump, does not look financially fit enough to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. Therefore, we think it could be worth betting instead on software stocks  Rimini Street  (NASDAQ:RMNI), NetSol (NTWK), Evolving Systems (EVOL), and SilverSun (SSNT). These stocks are currently trading at less than $10 but possess strong fundamentals. So, read on.A growing dependency on data insights, data storage, and various other cloud-based services by small and large enterprises due in large measure to the continuing remote lifestyle has fueled the software market's growth. Businesses are spending billions of dollars on software to upgrade and improve their business processes. According to a  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) report, worldwide public cloud end-user spending is expected to grow 23% in 2021. The global software market is expected to reach $823.71 billion by 2026, registering a 7.2% CAGR.. Investors’ interest in the software industry is evidenced by the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF’s (IGV) 22.4% returns over the past six months.
Although shares of advertising software start-up Phunware, Inc. (PHUN)—which is linked to former President Donald Trump—skyrocketed in price in October due to the Trump-related frenzy on major Reddit forums, its revenues decreased 31% year-over-year to $2.16 million in its last reported quarter. Its gross profit declined 49.2% from its year-ago value to $1.13 million. While the stock gained 290.5% in price over the past three months, it has lost 61.3% over the past month. The stock began retreating after the ex-president detailed his social media plans in October. Considering PHUN’s weak financials, we think the stock is best avoided now.
We think fundamentally sound software stocks Rimini Street, Inc. (RMNI), NetSol Technologies, Inc. (NTWK), Evolving Systems, Inc. (EVOL), and SilverSun Technologies, Inc. (SSNT), which are currently trading at less than $10, could be ideal bets instead to capitalize on the industry’s solid growth prospects.

(Reuters) -Kellogg Co said on Tuesday it plans to hire permanent replacements for some of its U.S. breakfast cereal plant workers who are on strike, after lengthy negotiations with the union again fell apart.
The workers went on strike on Oct. 5 after their contracts expired the previous day, as negotiations over payment and benefits stalled due to differences between Kellogg (NYSE:K) and about 1,400 union members at its cereal plants.
After the latest setback in negotiations, Kellogg said it was left without a choice but to move to the next phase of its contingency plans, including hiring permanent replacements.
Union members previously said Kellogg proposed a two-tier employment system that did not offer its temporary workers, who make up 30% of its workforce, a pathway to become permanent workers with better benefits and pay.
Kellogg said on Tuesday it was ready to move workers with four or more years of service to permanent positions, but added that the union was not prepared to reach a deal and did not allow members to vote on the offer.
An update from the union earlier in the day said it still had to resolve issues related to the two-tier system and offered to meet again with Kellogg the week of Dec. 6.
The workers will be voting on an offer if the union and Kellogg could reach a tentative agreement, a union leader said.
""(The union) kept giving them counter offers but after 14 hours we felt like we (are) only negotiating with ourselves,"" Kevin Bradshaw, vice president of the local union in Memphis, said.

Kellogg has already brought in temporary workers to fill in for striking workers and is also importing cereals to ensure supply at a time corporate America is dealing with soaring expenses.
Earlier this month, the union rejected a revised offer from Kellogg.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc slumped to 17-month lows on Tuesday after the video conferencing platform posted its slowest quarterly revenue growth amid stiff competition from deep-pocketed rivals Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).
The company on Tuesday posted a better than expected third-quarter revenue of $1.05 billion, although that came at a 35% jump compared with an astronomical 360% in the pandemic-hit year earlier. 
""With topline growth still weighed down by weakening trends in the micro segment from pull-forward and temporary pandemic business, we look for a clear line of sight to the growth trough,"" said brokerage Needham.
Zoom's addition of new customers with over 10 employees also grew at its slowest pace at 18%, below pre-pandemic levels when the company was not yet a household name.
The company's growth at small and medium businesses might be saturating, while it has barely penetrated the large enterprise market, Third Bridge analyst Joe McCormack said.
However, developing it into a contact center product will take longer after its $14.7 billion deal to buy call-center software provider Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) fell through last month. 

Shares of Zoom fell about 14% to $208.15 in early trading. The stock has nearly halved in value since hitting a peak of $114 billion last year as the pandemic raged.
""For now, investors will need some patience as we do not see any upcoming catalysts that would change the sentiment on the stock,"" Evercore analysts wrote in a note.

Investing.com – Abercrombie & Fitch Company (NYSE:ANF) stock slumped 14% Tuesday as its profitability declined in the three months ended October 30 and the retailer warned of production and delivery delays and elevated costs in the ongoing quarter.
Analysts expected a better outlook at the start of the holiday season but the prospects of further reopening and return to office also marred the sentiment for the retailer of casual wear.
Supply chain costs eroded the company’s gross profit rate in the third quarter by 30 basis points year-on-year to around 64%. The company blamed this on freight inflation and efforts to offset supply chain issues.
The company’s board approved a share repurchase of $500 million but that did little to slow the fall in the stock price.
Digital net sales rose 8% from last year and contributed 46% of total third quarter sales of $905 million, which grew 10%.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday after President Joe Biden's widely-trailed measures to lower oil prices appeared to backfire. 
Biden said that the U.S. and other major importers including China, India, South Korea and Japan will all release oil from their strategic reserves to ease the short-term pressure on crude prices, which hit seven-year highs earlier this fall as the global economic recovery meant that demand - at least temporarily - ran ahead of supply.
However, the move had already been heavily discounted by markets after weeks of leaks, and crude prices rose over 2% in response - though they're still nearly 10% below where they were when the leaks first suggested that the move was coming.   Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 1.9% and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 1.7%.
By 9:50 AM ET (1350 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 101 points, or 0.3% at 35,721 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were up 0.2% each.  
While the overall market was reasonably steady, the pattern of stocks getting hammered for disappointing quarterly updates repeated itself as Zoom Video stock tanked 14%, despite its top and bottom line meeting estimates in the latest quarter. Analysts were disappointed by the lack of growth in its large corporate customer numbers, which they said boded ill for its ability to grow beyond its videoconferencing roots. The stock is now at its lowest since June 2020, when the market euphoria about its ability to profit from the pandemic was at its peak.
Another stock to fall heavily was  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY), after the electronics retailer warned of possible product shortages during the holiday season due to supply chain issues. Best Buy stock fell 14% to its lowest in over a month. Fashion retailers Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) and Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN), both of which are dependent on trans-Pacific supply chains, both fell over 11% after making similar warnings in their updates.
Elsewhere, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock fell 1.6% after reports suggesting that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) will pull some of its content from the Disney-controlled Hulu streaming service to improve the offering of its own rival streaming product, Peacock.  Also in the streaming space, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock reversed early losses to be down only 0.8% after announcing a partnership with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to create a Netflix 'hub' on its platform. Netflix stock edged down 0.3%.
On a more positive note, Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) ADRs rose 12% to their highest since January after the company announced record quarterly deliveries."

LONDON (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase has once again been named the world's most important bank to the health of the wider financial system, according to the latest annual ranking of top lenders by global regulators. 
The Financial Stability Board (FSB), made up of regulators from G20 countries, published its latest table of the world's 30 most systemic banks on Tuesday. 
The 30 lenders are divided between four ""buckets"" in order of how systemic, international, interconnected and complex they are, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) now in a higher bucket than its nearest peers. 
Last year the bank, which had also been the world's most systemic lender in 2019, shared the highest bucket with HSBC and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), but is now alone in the next bucket up, which had been empty.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were also declared more systemic, both moving up one bucket. 
Being included in the table means having to hold additional capital and undergo more intense supervision to avoid a repeat of taxpayer bailouts in the banking crisis over a decade ago. In practice, the lenders typically hold capital buffers that are already above FSB requirements.
JPMorgan had a core equity ratio of 12.9% of capital to risk-weighted assets at the end of September, well above the minimum 11.3% set out by the Federal Reserve, according to a filing from the bank.
The FSB's capital surcharge for JPMorgan is now 2.5%, up from 2% last year.
U.S. banks have been aggressively, if unsuccessfully, fighting the FSB capital surcharges, but they are unlikely to make much headway under the administration of President Joe Biden.
However the FSB raised the prospect of relief for euro zone banks on how their exposures to other countries in the bloc are taken into account.

Euro zone lenders argue they are all regulated by the European Central Bank under the EU's banking union, and therefore their exposures to other euro zone countries should not be viewed as 'cross-border', attracting tougher treatment.
The FSB said on Tuesday that the Basel Committee, which writes global bank capital rules, will conduct a near-term review of cross-border exposures within the banking union in relation to its list of most systemic lenders.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Some offshore bondholders of embattled Chinese developer Kaisa Group who did not receive coupon payments this month have tapped investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co to advise them on the matter, a source with direct knowledge told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Kaisa, which has the most offshore debt of any Chinese developer after China Evergrande Group, has not paid coupons totalling over $59 million due on Nov. 11 and 12, with 30-day grace periods for both.
Bloomberg reported earlier on Tuesday that an ad hoc group of offshore bondholders is also seeking advice from lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis, besides Moelis.
Kaisa has been scrambling to raise capital by divesting some of its assets including some land developments and the Hong Kong-listed property management unit. Reuters reported last month that Kaisa was seeking buyers for two residential sites in Hong Kong.
A separate source with direct knowledge of the matter said Kaisa recently sold the Hong Kong land parcel in Tuen Mun for HK$3.78 billion ($485.09 million) to local investor Francis Choi, a friend of Kaisa's chairman Kwok Ying Shing.
After repaying the loans for the land which Kaisa bought for HK$3.5 billion early last year, the Chinese developer will be able to book a profit of HK$1.3 billion, the source said. 
CITIC and Bank of East Asia (OTC:BKEAY) will provide a total of HK$4 billion financing to Choi, while Huatai Financial will lead a $150 million mezzanine loan. 
Kaisa and Moelis declined to comment. There was no immediate comment from Kirkland & Ellis to a Reuters query sent outside U.S. working hours. Choi could not be reached for comment.
The Shenzhen-based developer, which was downgraded by Fitch last week to ""C"" from ""CCC-"" on the missed coupon payments, has another big test coming up - a $400 million maturity on a 6.5% dollar bond due on Dec. 7. 
Kaisa has also missed some payments on its wealth management products onshore, and this month it pleaded for help from creditors and said it will not pay interim dividends. 
Chinese developers are facing an unprecedented liquidity squeeze due to regulatory curbs on borrowings, causing a string of offshore debt defaults, credit rating downgrades and sell-offs in some developers' shares and bonds in recent months.
Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer which is at the centre of the crisis, has been stumbling from debt-repayment deadline to deadline as it grapples with more than $300 billion in liabilities. Moelis and Kirkland & Ellis are advising a group of offshore bond holders of Evergrande.
Market participants and analysts expect Chinese policymakers to ease some tightening measures in an effort to avoid a further liquidity crunch in the sector. 
Some Chinese banks have been told by financial regulators to issue more loans to property firms for project development, two banking sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Monday.
However, the authorities have yet to publicly give any signal that they will relax the ""three red lines"" - debt ratio requirements introduced by the central bank last year that developers must meet to get new bank loans. 

Property shares generally gained on Tuesday, with top players Country Garden and Sunac China rising over 2%, and Agile Group and R&F Properties up over 5%. Evergrande jumped as much as 11.3%.

In comparison, Switzerland-based ABB manufactures and sells electrification, industrial automation, and robotics and motion products for customers in utilities, industry and transport, and infrastructure.
Although the shortage and rising prices of iron ore compelled the machinery industry to cut back production early this year, the supply of used iron has incentivized companies to manufacture efficient power and hand tools, advanced and automated hardware, machinery, and related equipment to meet the surging demand from the resumption of industrial activities. Also, efforts to address the shortage of new iron supplies and the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill should drive the growth of machinery manufacturing companies in the coming months.

Around 22 billion euros will be spent on E.ON's power and gas distribution network, Europe's largest, and 5 billion on services for its around 50 million customers across the continent, it said at its capital markets day.

Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for its core business is expected to reach 7.8 billion euros in 2026, which would represent a compound annual growth rate of about 4% from 2021 to 2026, E.ON said.
As part of the five-year plan, E.ON is also targeting 2 billion to 4 billion euros in proceeds from asset sales and partnerships, as well as additional annual savings of 500 million euros by 2026.
CEO Leonhard Birnbaum, in the job since April, did not elaborate on which assets the company could sell and whether a 16.7% stake in uranium enrichment group Urenco was also on the list.

After 35 years of selling goods for a buck, Dollar Tree is boosting its standard price point to $1.25 by the end of April, the company said in a statement Tuesday. While the decision is “not a reaction to short-term or transitory market conditions,” Dollar Tree acknowledged the inflationary environment and said the price boost will help mitigate historically high costs, including freight and distribution expenses, as well as wage increases.
“Lifting the one-dollar constraint represents a monumental step for our organization,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Witynski said in the statement. The move will allow Dollar Tree to expand its product assortment and reintroduce some items that were pulled due to the $1 constraint.
The move signals the end of an era for Dollar Tree, which has long based its business on the price point, as inflation pushes up the cost of many goods. 
The company recently rolled out the higher price in select stores, and the tests “have demonstrated broad consumer acceptance of the new price point,” Witynski said. Dollar Tree plans to bring it to more than 2,000 additional stores in December and complete the rollout by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

Cevian's offering, run by UBS, launched with price guidance of 10.20-11.29 euros per share, resulting in proceeds of 439 million to 485 million euros ($493 million-$545 million), Refinitiv news service IFR said.
Cevian disclosed investments in Thyssenkrupp in 2013 and 2014. While it did not disclose at what price, shares in the German conglomerate traded at about 17-19 euros at the time, indicating the fund is taking a loss in its latest placement.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.
The divestment highlights Cevian's sobering track record in Germany, which also includes a 26.67% stake in Bilfinger, shares of which have fallen in value since the fund first disclosed a stake in 2011.
Other holdings, including those in Switzerland's ABB, which makes industrial robots and drives, and Swedish telecoms company Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), have proven to be more successful.

The sale of Thyssenkrupp shares comes after a 30% share price rally this year and reflects the company's operational improvements after years of losses, including plans to list its hydrogen division in a share sale next year.
""The most recent results presented by Thyssenkrupp and the share price rise show that the turnaround is bearing fruit,"" Cevian said.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 08:10AM ET</span>","Bond investors ramp up US inflation, rate-hike expectations - Russell Investments","By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Fixed income managers have ramped up expectations for U.S. inflation and rate hikes in the face of stronger-than-anticipated price pressures, Russell Investments' quarterly survey of investors found.
Published on Tuesday, the survey of 53 leading bond and currency managers highlighted the challenges investors face in assessing the path ahead for long-dormant inflation.
The survey, conducted in October, found 55% of fund managers expected U.S. inflation at between 2.26% and 2.75% over the next 12 months, well above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target.
A full 20% expected inflation to move even higher. 
In contrast, the previous survey in June showed about 70% of managers expected inflation over 12 months to exceed 2%.
Inflation is running at multi-decade highs in the United States, with recent data showing the consumer price index at 6.2% in the year to October, the biggest annual gain since 1990.
Reflecting investors' view that price pressures will stay elevated for a while, around 80% of those surveyed by Russell said they did not expect inflation to fall below 2% in the next five years. 
Against this backdrop and in line with the recent repricing in money markets, fixed income managers also bought forward expectations for a first Fed rate increase.
While Russell's previous survey had shown that 80% of respondents expected no move before 2023, half of investors in the Q4 survey reckon the Fed will move in the second half of 2022.
Just over 40% of respondents expect 10-year Treasury yields to trade between 1.61% and 2% over the next 12 months, while 42% expected yields to rise above 2%.
Yields currently are around 1.63%.
""A key theme is that managers think inflation will be above the Fed's target,"" said Gerard Fitzpatrick, global head of fixed income at Russell Investments. ""But an important point is that managers are not looking at super high inflation"".
Expensive valuations and China's property sector were other concerns highlighted by bond investors, Fitzpatrick also said.
Fund managers' expectations for Europe were far more subdued -- 75% of respondents did not expect the European Central Bank to taper its asset purchases before 2023.
The ECB, which faces subdued inflation over the longer-term, has pushed back against market expectations for rate hikes as early as next year. Economists reckon it is unlikely to raise rates for several years.
That outlook has weighed on the euro, pushing it to 16-month lows around $1.1226. 
According to the Russell poll, 63% of respondents expected euro/dollar to trade over the next 12 months below the $1.16 level it trading at when the poll was conducted.

That is substantially lower than their prediction back in June, when around 80% of managers expected the euro to trade in a $1.21-$1.30 range. 
On emerging market currencies, fund managers said the Russian rouble, Brazilian real and the Egyptian pound were likely to be the best performers in the next 12 months.

Investing.com –  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) stock fell 1.2% in premarket trading Tuesday after the medical devices-maker cut its annual revenue guidance on fears of extended disruption to hospital schedules and staffing due to the pandemic.
The company sees its annual revenue now growing 7%-8% compared to the 9% growth it estimated earlier.  At the same time, the company reiterated its EPS guidance of $5.70 at the midpoint of its forecast range. Adjusted profit per share for the last three months was $1.32, ahead of consensus.
Staffing issues bogged down the company in the second quarter, keeping revenue growth at 3%. Overall revenue of $7.8 billion was slightly below expectations.
Sales of ventilators, which boomed last year, suffered as the pandemic waned. As a result, revenue from the medical surgical portfolio rose only 1%.
Excluding ventilators, medical surgical revenue increased 6%. 
Second-quarter U.S. revenue of $4 billion, amounting to 51% of the total, fell 1%. Non-U.S. developed market revenue rose 1% and accounted for 32% of overall sales.
Emerging markets, with 17% growth, drove the rise in overall revenue.   "
1393,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 08:06AM ET</span>",Woodside's giant Scarborough LNG project may be the last of its type: Russell,"By Clyde Russell
LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) -For the first time in a decade a massive new liquefied natural gas (LNG) project has been approved for construction in Australia, but the Scarborough venture's structure and market realities indicate it may well be the last of its kind.
Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum and BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) gave final backing on Monday to the $12 billion plan to develop the Scarborough natural gas field off Western Australia and expand the onshore Pluto LNG plant to process the fuel.
The deal also sees Woodside merge with BHP's petroleum arm, with BHP shareholders to be issued new Woodside shares and ending up with about 48% of the expanded share capital.
Scarborough field lies about 375 kilometres (233 miles) off the coast of Western Australia state and holds about 11.1 trillion cubic feet of dry gas.
Woodside expects to produce about 8 million tonnes of LNG per annum at the to-be-built second train at its Pluto liquefaction plant, and is targeting first cargo in 2026.
The company also said that the all-in cost of the LNG to be produced is around $5.80 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), which is well below the current spot price of $36.70, but also considerably higher than the $1.85 the super-chilled fuel sank to in May last year during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Scarborough and Pluto second train developments are also the first major LNG project to reach a final investment decision in Australia in about a decade, and comes after the industry spent around $200 billion to expand capacity to around 80 million tonnes, making the country the world's biggest LNG exporter.
At first glance the deal seems positive for both Woodside and BHP.
It transforms Woodside into a top-10 global independent oil and gas company and allows BHP, the world's biggest listed miner, an opportunity to profitably exit an area of business no longer viewed as core and frees it to concentrate on producing metals viewed as essential to the energy transition.
However, it also means that Woodside will face increasing environmental opposition to its business, especially in the wake of the COP26 climate summit and mounting calls for an end to new oil, gas and coal projects.
Woodside argues that Scarborough contains ""only around 0.1% carbon dioxide, and Scarborough gas processed through the efficient and expanded Pluto LNG facility supports the decarbonisation goals of our customers in Asia.""
It's highly unlikely that environmental and climate groups will share this view, and already they are lining up to fight against the new development.
The Conservation Council of Western Australia is bringing a case challenging the state's approval, without a full environmental review, to allow Woodside to process gas at the Pluto LNG plant from an expanded number of fields.
FINANCING
While there is likely to be ongoing and highly visible opposition to Scarborough, there are also other concerns more behind the scenes.
As part of the deal, Woodside entered into an agreement to sell 49% of the planned second LNG train at the Pluto processing plant to private equity group Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).
The terms of deal effectively commit GIP to providing financing, but virtually all of the risk lies with Woodside with regards to potential cost overruns, regulatory hurdles and changes to emissions liabilities.
While GIP has a solid track record of investment in major projects around the globe, the involvement of private equity in a major LNG project in Australia breaks the usual pattern of partnering with global oil companies, major trading houses or utility customers in Asia.
The deal with GIP doesn't look advantageous to Woodside, implying that it was unable to find any takers among more traditional partners.
This could be a sign that LNG projects are getting harder to finance and that already the major buyers in Japan and South Korea are thinking of ways to meet their net-zero emissions targets by transitioning away from LNG.

The Scarborough LNG will also be hitting the market just around the same time as major expansions from Qatar and Russia also come to market, potentially creating an overhang of LNG at a time when major buyers are likely to be increasingly transitioning to renewable alternatives.
Effectively, Woodside is taking a bet that LNG will last in Asia's energy mix for far longer than it should if net-zero emissions goals are to be achieved.

The latest round makes the Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc rival the most well-funded and richly valued plant-based burger startup in the United States, with more than $2 billion raised since its founding in 2011. 
Impossible Foods, valued at about $4 billion in its last fundraise in 2020, did not disclose its latest valuation on Tuesday. The fundraise comes ahead of a potential U.S. stock market listing next year.
Reuters reported in April the Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, California-based company was exploring options for going public at a valuation of $10 billion or more. 
The biggest investors in the world have written large checks for plant-based meat makers in recent years, encouraged by a boom in popularity of products considered more climate-friendly and humane.
In March, plant-based meat startup the Livekindly Collective raised $335 million from investors such as TPG's The Rise Fund and Rabo Corporate Investments.
Impossible was founded in 2011 by Stanford University professor Patrick Brown who decided to change his career during a sabbatical in 2009. 
Brown wanted to make the global food system sustainable by recreating meat, fish and dairy foods from plants. The startup debuted its first product, the Impossible Burger, in 2016.

It went on to secure backing from celebrities such as tennis star Serena Williams and rapper Jay-Z and has over the past 14 months expanded into four international markets - Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Australia and New Zealand.
The company also counts  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Ventures, UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG), Coatue, Khosla Ventures and Temasek among its backers.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Tuesday, with the tech-focused Nasdaq underperforming as investors digest the nomination of Jerome Powell for a second term as head of the Federal Reserve.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 20 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures largely flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dropping 30 points, or 0.2%.
President Joe Biden on Monday ended months of speculation over his pick to run the Federal Reserve, reappointing Powell as chair and promoting Fed Governor Lael Brainard to second in command.
Although stocks initially gained on the news, the broad market headed lower into the final minutes of trading as bond yields rose. Powell’s appointment, which has to be confirmed in the Senate, was seen resulting in a faster normalization of monetary policy than would have been the case under Brainard.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just 17 points higher on Monday, but the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, in particular, fell as growth stocks reacted to the jump in yields.
Looking at individual stocks,  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) will be in focus after the popular video-conferencing platform added fewer large clients than expected for the second straight quarter.
Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) stock slumped premarket after the retailer warned of possible inventory problems in the busy holiday quarter. Its guidance for around 16% sales growth failed to impress.
Additionally, there are quarterly earnings reports to study from American Eagle (NYSE:AEO),  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) before the bell, and Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), Gap (NYSE:GPS), HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) after the close.
The economic data slate centers around the flash PMI figures for November, which are expected to show some improvement, particularly after Eurozone business growth unexpectedly accelerated as consumers shrugged off another wave of coronavirus infections and new restrictions.
Crude prices fell Tuesday as the U.S. confirmed it will release 50 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves in an attempt to cool elevated prices  The likes of India, Japan and South Korea are also expected to join in the release of additional reserves.
The American Petroleum Institute releases its weekly estimates of U.S. oil inventories later in the session. Its data showed crude stockpiles increasing by 655,000 barrels for the week ended Nov. 9, compared with a draw of 2.5 million barrels the previous week.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $75.81 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.8% to $79.09. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,793.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1254.

Contractual provisions of a 2018 agreement between the companies meant only selected resellers were allowed to sell Apple and Beats products on Amazon.it, the watchdog said, adding that this was in violation of European Union rules and affected competition on prices.
Both Apple and Amazon said they plan to appeal against the fines.
The authority imposed a fine of 68.7 million euros on Amazon and 134.5 million euros on Apple, ordering the companies to end the restrictions to give retailers of genuine Apple and Beats products access to Amazon.it in a non-discriminatory manner.
""To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold,"" Apple said, denying any wrongdoing.
In a separate statement Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the decision of the Italian authority and that the proposed fine was ""disproportionate and unjustified"". 

""We reject the suggestion that Amazon benefits by excluding sellers from our store, since our business model relies on their success. As a result of the agreement, Italian customers can find the latest Apple and Beats products on our store, benefiting from a catalogue that more than doubled, with better deals and faster shipping,"" Amazon said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Market regulators set out a global framework on Tuesday to police environment, social and governance (ESG) investment ratings and help combat 'greenwashing' in the fast-growing, multi-trillion dollar sector.
Regulators are cracking down on many aspects of ESG investing with basic rules to make it easier to punish greenwashing, where the environmental credentials of an investment or activity are overstated, in a cross-border sector where investment is ""exploding"".
The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which groups securities watchdogs from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, published 10 recommendations for its members to apply in day-to-day work.
""What we are trying to do now is put this foundation in place so we have some possibility to go after greenwashing and not just talking about it,"" Erik Thedeen, chair of IOSCO's sustainable task force and director general of Sweden's markets watchdog said.
Asset managers use ratings from about 160 raters such as MSCI, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) and Morningstar to pick stocks and bonds for ""green"" products now popular with ethical investors, but there are no regulatory checks on how those ratings were put together.
IOSCO said its recommendations will begin shining a light on how ratings are compiled and conflicts of interest handled in a largely unregulated business which is already worth around $1 billion and growing at 20% a year.
It recommends that ESG ratings and data providers consider implementing written procedures to underpin high quality ratings, and make public disclosure a priority.
Some regulators are likely to go further, with IOSCO members Britain and the European Union having already expressed concerns over the lack of rules for ESG raters.
The recommendations will raise the bar to entry into the ratings sector, an official at a leading ESG rater said.

Earlier this month a new global body was set up to introduce rigour into how companies make ESG related disclosures. Until now, asset managers have relied heavily on ratings in the absence of high quality company disclosures.
IOSCO has already set out a framework for checks on how asset managers sell green funds and will now focus on what independent checks on company ESG disclosures could look like.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) has launched talks with investors to secure support for its plan to relocate its headquarters from the Netherlands to Britain, sources said, as a leading advisory recommended backing the move at a December vote.
Shell said this month it would scrap its dual Anglo-Dutch share structure and move its head office to London from The Hague due to the Dutch tax system and after a court ruling over its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The company also plans to move its tax residence to Britain and drop ""Royal Dutch"" from its name - part of its identity since 1907 - to become Shell Plc.
Shareholders will vote on the changes at a special general meeting on Dec. 10 where the resolution needs to secure more than 75% of votes cast.
To secure the high threshold, Shell's management has in recent days set up more than 100 meetings with leading investors, two sources close to the process said.
""We believe this is a very shareholder-friendly proposition and we're working hard and engaging with many of our shareholders to explain all of the benefits of this move and encourage them to vote,"" a Shell spokesperson said.
Proxy advisory Glass Lewis, which advises major funds, recommended shareholders vote in favour, in a note seen by Reuters.

The simplified structure would allow ""an acceleration in distributions by way of share buybacks, as there will be a larger single pool of ordinary shares that can be bought back,"" Glass Lewis said.
It would also strengthen Shell's ability to manage its energy transition, it added.

The company's shares, which have lost nearly 70% of their value since the start of the 2021, fell 27% on Tuesday after its second profit warning in two months. 
Trading during the holiday season was significantly weaker than anticipated only eight weeks ago, the company said, with poor availability in certain categories, particularly new products.
Retailers globally have been struggling with shortages and delays as economies opened up to stagnant supply chains and tightening labour markets. Britain is also adjusting to having fewer workers from the European Union.
""Our results over this period have inevitably been affected by the constraints and uncertainty seen across our industry,"" AO World founder and Chief Executive John Roberts said, while adding the company has cemented the progress of last year when profits tripled.
AO World, which sells laptops, washing machines, mobile phones and printers, saw profits soar during the pandemic as most people worked from home, but in October warned that profit would fall as a lorry driver shortage disrupted supply chains.
The company, which has recruited about 500 new drivers, said full-year sales are now expected to be flat to 5% lower. 
It cut its annual adjusted core profit outlook to a 10 million-20 million pound ($13.4 million-$26.8 million) range for the 12 months ending March 31 next year, from 35 million-50 million pounds earlier. 
It had reported profit of 64 million pounds for fiscal 2021, and an operating loss of 11 million pounds for the six months ending Sept. 30, compared with a profit of 16 million pounds a year before. 
Earlier this month larger rival Currys said it was well stocked for Black Friday and Christmas period despite supply chain disruption.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Tuesday, with the latest surge of Covid-19 cases on the continent weighing on sentiment as further lockdowns loom.  
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.3% lower, the CAC 40 in France also fell 1.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.6%.
Austria reintroduced a national lockdown on Monday to combat a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases, and this has investors fretting that neighboring Germany, the main growth engine for the Eurozone, will shortly follow suit. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the situation worse than anything her country has experienced so far, while Health Minister Jens Spahn issued a blunt assessment of the situation the country faced.
“Some would say this is cynical but probably by the end of this winter, pretty much everyone in Germany will be vaccinated, recovered or dead ... That’s the reality,” Spahn told a press conference in Berlin on Monday.
These fears have overshadowed stronger than expected flash PMI data for both Germany and France, suggesting businesses have continued to perform despite the recent surge of Covid cases.
The PMI release for the important German manufacturing sector, a key growth driver for the region, came in at 57.6, a small fall from the 57.8 level seen the previous month. 
In the corporate sector, E.ON (DE:EONGn) stock fell 3.5% after Europe's largest operator of energy networks said Tuesday it was planning to invest about 27 billion euros ($30 billion) in its core business by 2026 while preparing for a green future.
Compass (LON:CPG) stock fell 1.9% despite the catering giant resuming dividend payouts after reporting better-than-expected annual profit as economies reopened.
Market participants will also be digesting the decision by President Joe Biden to reappoint Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve. This renomination now heads to the Senate for confirmation, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the Treasury market closed sharply lower as investors wagered that he will be more aggressive at tackling inflation than his potential replacement, Fed Governor Lael Brainard, would have been.
Crude prices fell Tuesday on growing talk the U.S. will shortly announce a coordinated release of oil from strategic reserves in an attempt to cool elevated prices.
The United States is expected to announce a loan of crude oil from its emergency stockpile on Tuesday, Reuters reported, citing a Biden administration source familiar with the situation.
The likes of India, Japan, South Korea and China, the world’s biggest oil importer, are also expected to join in the release of additional output.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $75.84 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.8% to $79.05. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,804.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1254.

When advance prints of Purchasing managers' Indexes (PMI) land, focus will be on businesses' input cost increases and whether they show signs of easing. 
The readings may also reinforce the gap between robust U.S. activity and COVID-plagued Europe, potentially further depressing the euro, which plumbed new 16-month lows on Monday.
Monday's euro area consumer confidence indicator offered a warning, falling back below pre-pandemic levels. October PMIs showed bloc's activity slowing the weakest in six months, while businesses' costs rose at the fastest pace in two decades. U.S. and British PMIs fared better but eye-popping price increases still featured.
A price slowdown would vindicate central bankers' who have until now rejected surging inflation as transitory. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell (re-appointed for another four years) spoke on Monday the corrosive impact of inflation. The United States may also unveil an emergency oil release later in the day to dent energy prices. 
Powell's reappointment sent markets into a frenzy of policy-tightening bets; three U.S. rate hikes are priced for 2022, starting June.
U.S. Treasury yields are higher again this morning after 5-8 basis-point rises on Tuesday, while the dollar has moved into a fifth straight week of gains against a basket of currencies.
When does this become a problem for stock markets?
Nasdaq-listed tech shares, vulnerable to higher rates, fell on Monday and are tipped for another lossmaking session. Even a 2% rally in bank shares did not prevent a weaker S&P 500 close. Futures signal weakness there and for European shares. 
Finally, El Salvador's plans for a $1 billion bitcoin-backed bond doesn't seem to have benefited the coin very much; it's holding near one-month lows.

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 03:26AM ET</span>",Exclusive-U.S. investigators question Goodyear Malaysia workers over labour practices,"By Mei Mei Chu and A. Ananthalakshmi
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - U.S. government investigators have interviewed workers at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co's Malaysian factory about their working conditions, employees told Reuters, intensifying scrutiny of potential labour abuses by the tyre maker in the country.
The questioning by the Department of Homeland Security could lead to U.S. prosecutions of one of the world's biggest tyre makers, which faces related lawsuits and two ongoing investigations by regulators in Malaysia and the United States, each looking into potential exploitation of foreign workers.
Five current and former Goodyear Malaysia staff said Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents have asked about their working and living conditions, details of court cases they filed against Goodyear, a police complaint alleging threats from Goodyear staff and workplace accidents. 
In video calls over the past 11 months or more, the agents from the main criminal-investigation unit of the Department of Homeland Security also requested documents relating to their employment, said the workers, who asked not to be identified because they feared reprisals.
Reuters could not determine the specific violations that HSI is seeking to establish.
HSI said it does not comment on ongoing investigations. 
Ohio-based Goodyear said it was committed to ensuring its supply chain practices adhered to laws and to its own policies.
""Goodyear and Goodyear Malaysia are currently undertaking a thorough review of the matter, including retaining an independent social auditing firm to inspect working and housing conditions,"" Goodyear told Reuters in an emailed statement. Goodyear did not identify the audit firm. 
The HSI questioning follows initial allegations filed in three complaints by 185 migrant workers from Nepal, India and Myanmar - including the five who spoke to Reuters - against Goodyear Malaysia in the country's industrial court in 2019 and 2020. They alleged unpaid wages, citing non-compliance with a collective agreement, wrongful deductions and threats to migrant workers. 
In 2020 and in June, the court ordered Goodyear to pay back wages to some workers and comply with the agreement. The company has appealed the verdicts.
Goodyear told Reuters it has now committed to a settlement with the workers represented in the labour dispute. 
The company argued in court that foreign workers are not entitled to the benefits of the collective agreement because they are not union members. It has declined to comment on the allegations.
Malaysia's largest fund manager, Permodalan Nasional Berhad, which owns 49% of Goodyear Malaysia, did not respond to requests for comment.
FOCUS ON FORCED LABOURRepresentatives from the Malaysian government's Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Council (MAPO) were also on some of the video calls with HSI, the five workers said. 
Former MAPO head Mohd Hadzwan Zulkefle, who workers said was on the calls, told Reuters the agency has opened an investigation into Goodyear Malaysia over labour trafficking. He did not say when MAPO started the probe, which has not previously been reported. 
He declined to comment on whether MAPO was collaborating with U.S authorities. 
A MAPO spokesperson told Reuters it was aware of ""the alleged forced labour issue"" at Goodyear Malaysia, and that the issue is under investigation by ""responsible parties.""
The Department of Labour of Peninsular Malaysia, which last year charged Goodyear Malaysia with violating labour laws, did not respond to a request for comment. Goodyear has not commented on the labour department charges.
The U.S. State Department in July downgraded Malaysia to its worst ranking on human trafficking, after a string of complaints by rights groups and U.S. authorities over alleged exploitation by plantations and factories of migrant workers, on whom the Southeast Asian nation relies.
Goodyear Malaysia is already being investigated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection over its labour practices, according to Liberty Shared, a rights group that petitioned Customs for the probe. Customs can ban imports of goods it finds to be made with forced labour. 
Goodyear did not respond to a query on the MAPO investigation.
The company told Reuters in July it was not aware of the petition to U.S. Customs and that it had strong policies to protect human rights.
HSI can initiate criminal investigations and coordinate potential criminal prosecutions of American firms and U.S-bound supply chains whose goods are made by means of forced labour, according to its website.
A formal HSI investigation ""would be extremely significant because it will move the discussion on forced labour from business ethics and sustainability, into one that relates to criminal law,"" said Duncan Jepson, managing director of the Hong Kong-based Liberty Shared.
However, Jepson said one challenge to establishing wrongdoing would be a lack of precedent.
In the United States, he said, ""Law enforcement and attorneys prefer to have previous cases to support their strategies and in forced labour there are no previous criminal cases against transnational corporations.""
Documents previously seen by Reuters show some Goodyear Malaysia workers logging as much as 229 hours of overtime a month, more than twice the maximum allowed under Malaysian law. Workers said money was wrongfully deducted from their salaries and that the company was denying them free access to their passports.
Goodyear has declined to comment on the allegations, citing court proceedings.

Malaysia's labour department said in May it had charged Goodyear in 2020 for nine violations of labour laws, unrelated to the lawsuits, regarding excessive hours and wrongful salary deductions. 
The five workers interviewed by Reuters say they told the HSI investigators they were not happy with facilities the company provided, their hostels were congested, they paid recruitment fees in their home countries and did not get salary increases and allowances that they were eligible for.

The world's largest catering company, which had suspended dividends in April 2020 to deal with the blow from COVID-19, said it would pay an annual dividend of 14 pence per share.
""With ongoing mobilisation costs and inflationary pressure, further improvement will be weighted towards the second half of the year as we return to underlying margin of around 7% by year end,"" said Chief Executive Office Dominic Blakemore.
Food catering volumes at Compass have picked up from pandemic lows, as students return to universities and schools, sports fans fill up stadiums and crowds attend music events again. New businesses have also risen as more companies outsource their catering needs for the first time to cut costs.
Its underlying operating profit for the year ended Sept. 30 rose 55.4% to 811 million pounds ($1.09 billion), while underlying revenue recovered to 88% of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter.
Analysts on average had expected underlying operating profit of 797 million pounds, according to a company-compiled consensus.
Compass, which serves office staff, students, seniors in old age homes, armed forces and events attendees across 45 countries, expects fiscal 2022 organic revenue growth to be 20%-25%.
The company's outlook comes after French catering and food services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) said last month it expects sales to accelerate in 2022 and will resume dividend payments after posting better-than-expected annual results.
Compass also said there was still some uncertainty related to labour shortages, inflation and the pandemic, which was expect to continue hurt its business in the nearer term.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Tuesday, ahead of the release of the latest PMI data for the region as Covid-19 cases surge.  
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%.
The main focus Tuesday will be on the release of the flash purchasing managers' index data for the Eurozone later in the session, as this will serve as a guide of how business activity in the region has reacted to the recent surge of Covid cases.
The PMI release for the important German manufacturing sector, a key growth driver for the region, is expected to drop to 56.9 in November from 57.8 the previous month.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Employees of India's Future Retail have asked the Supreme Court to allow the company to sell its retail assets and rule against Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in an ongoing dispute, citing risks to 27,000 jobs, according to a legal filing seen by Reuters.
Future has failed to close https://reut.rs/3DJfYpP its $3.4 billion deal to sell its retail assets to market leader Reliance Industries due to successful legal challenges by Amazon, which argues that Future violated some pre-existing contracts the two sides had struck, by deciding to sell its retail assets to Reliance.
As India's Supreme Court hears the dispute, a group of Future Retail (FRL) employees have filed a petition urging the court to rule against Amazon, saying their livelihoods were at stake.
If the deal fails, Future ""will be pushed into liquidation, resulting in its 27,000 employees losing their livelihoods. The families of employees will be on the streets,"" the FRL Employee Welfare Association said in a Nov. 20 filing, seen by Reuters. The filing has not previously been reported and is not public. 
Future, which denies any wrongdoing, has said it would face liquidation if the Reliance deal doesn't go through, while Amazon has repeatedly argued that its 2019 investment into a Future unit prohibits the Future-Reliance deal.

The employee's filing will likely be heard on Dec. 8, when the Supreme Court is next due to take up the matter.

(Reuters) - Five members of Congress called for federal consumer-privacy legislation after a Reuters report published Friday revealed how Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has led an under-the-radar campaign to gut privacy protections in 25 states while amassing a valuable trove of personal data on American consumers.
""Amazon shamefully launched a campaign to squash privacy legislation while its devices listen to and watch our lives,"" U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who has been involved in bipartisan negotiations on privacy legislation, wrote Friday on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""This is now the classic Big Tech move: deploy money and armies of lobbyists to fight meaningful reforms in the shadows but claim to support them publicly.""
The revelations underscored the need for bipartisan action on stronger privacy protections, he wrote. No major federal privacy legislation has passed Congress in years because members have been deadlocked on the issue.
U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who has introduced several privacy bills in recent years, said in a statement that the Reuters story showed how companies including Amazon are ""spending millions to weaken state laws,"" and hoping Congress will also water down federal legislation ""until it's worthless.""
""Congress needs to prove Amazon wrong, and pass legislation that finally stops massive corporations from abusing and exploiting our personal data,"" Wyden said.
Asked for comment, Amazon did not directly address the lawmaker criticisms of its lobbying campaign against privacy protections. The company reiterated its statement for the previous Reuters report, saying it prefers federal privacy legislation to a ""patchwork"" of state regulations. The company said it wants one federal privacy law that ""requires transparency about data practices, prohibits the sale of personal data without consent, and ensures that consumers have the right to request access to and deletion of their personal information.""
U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat who chairs a key House consumer protection subcommittee that deals with privacy issues, said the Reuters revelations show how Amazon is working to block consumer privacy legislation while ""claiming to support"" such regulations. 
""What they mean is that they support privacy legislation that protects their profits and their right to mine consumers' data, including voice recordings and facial scans,"" she said in a statement. ""Congress is not convinced nor are we intimidated.""

Two other lawmakers who represent areas with a significant Amazon presence - U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, and U.S. Representative Suzan DelBene, a Washington state Democrat - also said Reuters' findings showed the need for federal action to protect consumers.
""Congress will protect consumers' privacy to stop big tech companies from stealing Americans' personal information, whether these companies like it or not,"" Blackburn said in a statement.

South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.54% by 9:16 PM ET (2:16 AM GMT), with the Bank of Korea handing down its policy decision on Thursday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.66%, and across the Tasman Sea, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand hands down its policy decision on Wednesday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.02%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.24% while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.23%. Investors are also keeping an eye on China’s outlook over concerns that the slowdown in the country’s economic recovery from COVID-19 could test the policy mettle of the People’s Bank of China.
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday and there will be no Cash Treasuries trade in Asia.
U.S. President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second round at the Fed’s helm over Lael Brainard on Monday. Brainard, who was promoted from governor to vice-chair, was viewed by some to hold a more dovish stance on monetary policy than Powell.
U.S. Treasuries fell after Powell’s re-nomination was announced. Markets priced in a full quarter-point rate hike into the June 2022 Fed meeting, and also view a second by September and a third by December of that year, as inflationary pressures continue.
Curbing these pressures, while maintaining the economic recovery from COVID-19, will be the next challenge awaiting Powell in his new term.
“While investors no longer have to wonder about who will be leading the Fed for the next few years, the next big dilemma that the central bank faces is how to normalize monetary policy without upsetting markets,” Blanke Schein Wealth Management chief investment officer Robert Schein told Bloomberg.
Investors now await a slew of U.S. data, including the purchasing managers’ index (PMI), minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting, GDP, and initial jobless claims, that are due on Wednesday.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Shares of Swiss private bank Julius Baer dropped nearly 5% in early trading on Monday after it said client activity had continued to slow during the year.
The wealth manager, Switzerland's third-largest listed bank, also said margins from brokerage commissions and from financial instruments had shrunk compared to the first half of 2021.
Wealth managers enjoyed a boom during 2020 as lower consumption combined with an increase in disposable income from government transfers allowed households to save and invest more. Surging equity and housing prices also made some households wealthier. 
Gross margins in the first 10 months of 2021 of 82 basis points, down from 88 basis points a year earlier, reflected what Julius Baer described as a ""softening"" in client activity from ""exceptionally"" high levels the previous year.
""The slowdown in client activity relative to the strong first quarter of 2021 continued from the second to the third quarter and well into October,"" the bank said in a statement.
""Initial results for November, however, indicate a potential recovery for the final two months of the year,"" it added.
Shares in the bank fell 4.6% in early trading in Zurich, with Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti describing the statement as weaker than expected.
""JB guides for a potential recovery in the last two months of the year. Still, we might have to lower our estimates slightly,"" Venditti said.
Nonetheless, Julius Baer said - without giving a figure - that profitability had grown ""significantly"" during the first 10 months of 2021, due to strong growth in client assets and efficiencies, complemented by a near absence of credit losses.

Assets under management increased 12% to 484 billion Swiss francs ($520.93 billion), driven by a 4.4% increase in net new money, as well as positive stock market performance and currency movements.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Gun makers including Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co on Monday asked a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit by the Mexican government accusing them of facilitating the trafficking of weapons to drug cartels, leading to thousands of deaths.
The gun manufacturers in a brief https://tmsnrt.rs/3FE0DaS told a federal judge in Boston that Mexico was seeking through its $10 billion lawsuit to punish them for sales of firearms ""that are not only lawful but constitutionally protected in the United States.""
The companies, who also include Beretta USA, Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Colt's Manufacturing Co and Glock Inc argued Mexico was trying to use U.S. courts to circumvent a diplomatic dispute with the United States yet lacked the ability to sue them.
Successive Mexican governments have urged the United States to put a stop to the illicit trafficking of U.S. firearms into Mexico.
""At bottom, this case implicates a clash of national values,"" the companies argued. ""Whereas the United States recognizes the right to keep and bear arms, Mexico has all but eliminated private gun ownership.""
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard during a United Nations Security Council meeting on small arms on Monday called the country's decision to file the unusual lawsuit in August ""a question of principle and a moral obligation.""
The lawsuit claimed https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-sues-several-weapons-manufacturers-us-court-2021-08-04 the companies undermined Mexico's strict gun laws by designing, marketing and distributing military-style assault weapons in ways they knew would arm drug cartels, fueling murders, extortions and kidnappings.
Mexico's lawsuit said over 500,000 guns are trafficked annually from the United States into Mexico, of which more than 68% are made by the manufacturers it sued.
The companies argued Mexico failed to establish its harms were attributable to them and that a U.S. law, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, protected gun manufactures from lawsuits over their products' misuse.

While the companies said Mexico believed the law does not apply to its claims, ""the plain text of the statute forecloses that theory.""
Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement it would respond to the companies' arguments on Jan. 31.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 08:25PM ET</span>",KKR's $37 billion approach boosts Telecom Italia shares,"By Valentina Za and Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) -Investors in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) on Monday cheered a proposal by U.S. fund KKR to buy Italy's debt-laden former phone monopoly for 33 billion euros ($37 billion) in what would be Europe's biggest ever private equity buyout.
The move comes as a boardroom war rages at Telecom Italia (TIM), which has been mired in crisis for years but is crucial to government efforts to expand broadband connectivity because it owns the country's main network.
KKR's offer, which is conditional on the government's backing and the outcome of a four-week analysis, values TIM at 10.8 billion euros excluding net debt of 22.5 billion - or 45.7% above Friday's closing price for ordinary shares.
The shares were 32% higher in afternoon trade at 0.4585 euros each, versus the offer's ""indicative"" price of 0.505 euros, with more than 8% of TIM's capital changing hands.
However, yields on TIM's bonds, which on Friday S&P cut further below the investment grade, spiked higher, with investors fretting about a possible further increase in debt.
Successive deals have inflated TIM's debt to a gross 30.5 billion euros, crippling a company that was a crown jewel of government assets before its ill-fated 1997 privatisation. 
Private equity-backed M&A deals have reached $1 trillion globally in 2021, 53% above the all-time yearly record of $663 billion of 2007, Refinitiv data show.
KKR's offer, which the New York-based fund has described to TIM as ""friendly"", would expose the company's top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) to a steep loss on its 24% stake, for which it spent on average 1.07 euros per share.
A person close to the French media group said Vivendi believed KKR's offer did not adequately value TIM. KKR is targetting a 51% acceptance threshold so the offer does not need Vivendi's backing.
TIM's board did not give a view on the proposal.
Vivendi has been pushing to replace TIM CEO Luigi Gubitosi, who has failed to stem a revenue haemorrhage, leading to two profit warnings in three months and an almost 40% fall in the group's market value during his three-year tenure.
Italy has special powers to block foreign bids for strategic assets, and it has said it would decide whether to use them depending on plans for TIM's fixed line business.
""The path towards a formal offer may not be certain, nor fast - but we think the offer is articulate and credible,"" HSBC said. 
BROADBAND ROLLOUT
As well as protecting the jobs of 42,500 local staff, Rome wants to ensure plans for the network are in line with efforts to deploy billions of euros of European Union recovery funds to rollout ultra-fast broadband across Italy - an EU digital connectivity laggard.
KKR wants to take TIM private, which analysts say would make a restructuring easier. Its offer targets both ordinary and savings shares.
""An experienced private capital provider such as KKR might prove a better fit to support TIM's turnaround,"" UBS said. 
KKR, which is working with Citi, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on the deal, has a long track record in the sector.
In April, it set up wholesale fibre firm Open Dutch Fiber, while in 2020 it acquired with rivals Cinven and Providence Spain's fourth-largest phone group MasMovil.
KKR would carve out TIM's fixed-line business to be run as a government-regulated asset along the model of power grid Terna or gas grid Snam, sources have said.
KKR already holds a 37.5% stake in FiberCop, the unit holding TIM's last-mile network running from the street to people's homes.
Gubitosi has been trying to revive a project to merge TIM's network assets with those of rival Open Fiber, a competitor in which state investor CDP is set to gain control. CDP is also the second-biggest investor in TIM, with a 10% stake.

The single network plan has run aground under Prime Minister Mario Draghi, though a source close to the matter said the Treasury was still studying a possible merger of TIM's fixed network with Open Fiber's under CDP's control.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 07:26PM ET</span>",Analysis-Visa's Amazon spat shows power is shifting to retailers in fee battle,"By David Henry and Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s latest spat with Visa (NYSE:V) shows big retailers, armed with a growing array of payment options, are gaining the upper hand in their power struggle with card providers, but it's not a crisis for the payment company. 
Amazon said last week that it would stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the United Kingdom from Jan. 19, 2022, saying that despite technology advancements the fees on such transactions remained high or in some cases were rising.
While Amazon may yet back down on the UK front, where the company accounts for less than 1% of Visa's credit card volume, according to an estimate by Piper Sandler analysts, the dispute is a bad sign for the card industry. Some analysts said it could presage a fight in the much bigger U.S. market. 
""Amazon is treating this dispute with Visa as an experiment,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat. ""Our biggest concern is that Amazon seeks concessions from Visa in other geographies."" 
Visa Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu told Reuters in an interview on Friday that he expected a resolution. ""We've resolved these things in the past and I believe we'll resolve them in the future,"" he said. Amazon declined to comment. 
Credit cards dominated a third of North American ecommerce spending in 2020, according to payments giant WorldPay, but mobile payment options like Venmo and 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) financing plans are chipping away at their market share. 
While alternative payments have been growing for years, the pandemic accelerated a downward trend in credit card applications boosting the popularity of BNPL financing, especially among younger consumers. 
Credit cards' share of North American e-commerce spending declined 7% last year, according to WorldPay, while BNPL's share increased 78%, making it the fastest-growing form of payment.
In August, Amazon partnered with BNPL provider Affirm to offer installment financing option on U.S. Amazon purchases. 
""Credit cards are still dominant players for non-cash transactions, but they need to be aware of the growing competition,"" Chris Dinga, payments analyst at GlobalData, wrote on Friday.
""BNPL is gradually being adopted by retailers as they see higher conversion and growth opportunity by providing it to their customers,"" Dinga wrote, adding high credit card fees could accelerate BNPL adoption by retailers.  
Some analysts said past disputes suggested Visa may have to blink before Amazon, such as when U.S. restaurant owners stopped taking Amex cards in the 1990s, leading Amex to reduce its fees. 
""Visa may need to follow  American Express  (NYSE:AXP)'s example,"" Evercore analysts said in a research note.
'AGNOSTIC'
Still, Visa has survived such fights and few other merchants have Amazon's heft, said Prabhu. 
""Even a very large retailer like Amazon represents a relatively small portion of our payment volume,"" he said. 
And Visa is not wedded to credit cards as the primary transaction source, he added. 
""If a merchant wants to offer credit in a different way, we're agnostic. We will do both. The buy now, pay later business has been a positive for us.""
Visa has been partnering with BNPL providers, including Sweden's Klarna.
Retailers also benefit from credit card issuers offering their customers cash rebates and rewards programs to encourage them to spend more than they otherwise would. 
Prabhu said he expected credit card spending to pick up now that borders are opening and affluent customers are spending more on travel, entertainment and eating out.

And Amazon also needs a partner for its own co-branded credit card. The company is considering replacing Visa on U.S. co-branded credit cards with either Mastercard (NYSE:MA) or American Express, suggesting its UK fee dispute could be a negotiating tactic, said analysts.
""It's not necessarily a good idea for merchants to restrict consumer choice,"" said Prabhu. ""Amazon will have to think about that, too.""

(Reuters) - Delivery company DoorDash Inc is paying more than $5 million to settle an investigation by San Francisco into alleged labor law violations, with the bulk of the money going to delivery workers, the city attorney said on Monday.
DoorDash will pay more than $5.3 million under the agreement, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu said in a statement. About $5.1 million will go to the nearly 4,500 DoorDash workers who completed deliveries in San Francisco between 2016 and 2020.
""We are living through an era of deep inequality, and nothing could be more important than ensuring workers are paid fairly and their benefits are safeguarded,"" Chiu said in a statement.
DoorDash did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement and in a statement said it was proud of the flexible earning opportunities it offered.
""While we deny any wrongdoing, we feel that this settlement represents a fair compromise that will allow us to focus on continuing to provide the best experience for Dashers,"" the company said.
The city opened a formal investigation into DoorDash in 2019 after media reports said the company was using customer tips to subsidize workers' base pay.
The city alleged DoorDash was violating San Francisco's health care benefit and paid sick leave laws by misclassifying workers as independent contractors, rather than employees.

The settlement is part of a larger fight between gig economy companies and lawmakers, which culminated in a California ballot initiative in Nov. 2020, during which voters cemented gig workers' status as independent contractors, while entitling them to some benefits.
Fights over the status of workers at DoorDash, Uber (NYSE:UBER),  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and other gig companies continue across the United States, in Canada and Europe. Companies say the majority of workers do not want to be employees and enjoy the flexibility offered by on-demand work.

Revenue was at $1.05 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31, Zoom said, after rising 54% in the previous quarter and surging 360% a year earlier.
The stock, a pandemic winner, fell to $227.5 in extended trading, after having lost about 28% this year. 
Moreover, stiff competition posed by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)'s conferencing tool Webex and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Teams has made it challenging for Zoom to win over enterprise customers.
To retain its users, the company launched a variety of new offerings such as Events platform, where businesses can host large-scale conferences, cloud-calling service Zoom Phone and in-office meetings feature Zoom Rooms. 
""Their Rooms and Phone businesses are 5% penetrated or below and that seems to imply plenty of remaining runway for growth even within their existing capabilities only,"" said Joe McCormack, senior analyst at Third Bridge said.
Investment bankers and analysts have warned that Zoom faces several hurdles in sustaining growth after its $14.7 billion bid to buy call center software firm Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) Inc fell through.

Still, Zoom reported an adjusted profit of $1.11 per share, beating Wall Street's estimates $1.09 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
The company also forecast current-quarter revenue and earnings above expectations, and raised its full-year revenue estimate to around $4.08 billion from about $4.01 billion earlier.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended slightly higher.
Climbing Treasury yields kept tech stocks broadly lower, with holdouts including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which many investors view as relatively safe, giving up gains late in the session. 
Apple ended up 0.3%, its highest closing level ever, after rising over 3% earlier in the day. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) flagged possible improvements to the supply of the iPhone 13 in coming months.
Microsoft ended down almost 1% after earlier rising almost 2%.
""The market is nervous. We know we have Powell, but that doesn't help with the inflation issue,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC. ""Under the hood, growth tech got hit all day, and then all of tech got hit at the end.""
Powell's nomination was welcomed by many investors hoping for no big changes in the Fed as it guides the economy through a recovery from the pandemic. The central bank is set to herald a return to pre-pandemic policy by end-2022.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who was the other top candidate for the job, will be vice chair, the White House said. 
""Markets like predictability. ... While Brainard may have been a fine choice, the markets would not know what to expect from her even though the general consensus was that it meant lower rates for longer,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.

Investors were awaiting a slew of economic data this week, including IHS business activity readings, personal consumption expenditure, and minutes of the Fed's latest meeting.
In Monday's session, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 2.8% and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) declined 1.8%, both weighing heavily on the Nasdaq.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc gained 1.7% after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the Model S Plaid will ""probably"" be coming to China around March. The stock has almost recovered from a steep selloff earlier this month that started after Musk polled Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users about whether he should sell some of his shares in the electric car maker.
Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) slipped 0.3% after a media report that the video game publisher's chief executive, Bobby Kotick, would consider leaving if he could not quickly address concerns about company culture.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Monday it has approved  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ)'s more than $6 billion acquisition of pre-paid mobile phones provider TracFone Wireless with conditions to protect low-income consumers.
The FCC's announcement followed the California Public Utilities Commission's approval of the deal last Thursday after Verizon agreed to additional consumer-protection conditions. Verizon is the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers. TracFone, a unit of Mexican telecom company  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX), serves more than 20 million customers. 
Verizon said in September 2020 it would buy TracFone in a $6.25 billion cash and stock deal with up to $650 million in potential additional future payments. 
FCC approval should allow the deal to close as soon as Wednesday.
The FCC said required conditions will protect low-income consumers from price increases and require the company to continue to participate in a low-income telecommunications subsidy program called Lifeline. The agency will require an internal and an independent compliance officer ""empowered to proactively monitor conditions, ensure that low-income consumers are not being harmed, and facilitate consumer complaints about potential violations.""
Verizon welcomed the FCC's approval, saying the deal would ""provide customers with the best of both worlds: more choices, better services and new features.""
The deal was approved by the Justice Department last year.
Under the California agreement, TracFone or Verizon must participate in Lifeline for 20 years.
TracFone is one of the largest providers in the Lifeline program, with 1.7 million low-income subscribers in 43 states and the District of Columbia.
Verizon said it has committed to participate in Lifeline for at least seven years and will offer existing TracFone Lifeline rate plans for at least three years.

Lifeline in total provides 9.1 million Americans with free or discounted broadband and voice services.
Democratic U.S. senators Richard Blumenthal, Sheldon Whitehouse, Dianne Feinstein, Ron Wyden and Edward Markey said the ""FCC’s binding conditions on Verizon’s acquisition of TracFone can have real-life benefits for consumers — if they’re vigorously followed and enforced.""

This isn’t how I thought things would end, but I am relieved to have closure,"" Terra Field said in a statement posted online https:// Chappelle's latest Netflix comedy special ""The Closer"" was criticized https://reut.rs/3CfwWuq by some who saw it as a ridicule of transgender people. Supporters of the comedian viewed it as a cry against cancel culture. Field and a former colleague, B. Pagels-Minor, are withdrawing an unfair labor practice charge they filed against Netflix in late October that accused the company of retaliating against them for trying to organize a company-wide walkout over Chappelle's Netflix special. ""We have resolved our differences in a way that acknowledges the erosion of trust on both sides and, we hope, enables everyone to move on,"" Netflix spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Monday. Neither side immediately responded to requests for further comment, including about whether there was a financial settlement in the case. ""My clients have resolved their differences with Netflix and will be voluntarily withdrawing their NLRB charge,"" Laurie Burgess, a labor lawyer representing Pagels-Minor and Field, said in a statement quoted by NBC News https://nbcnews.to/30SzhPh.

WASHINGTON/MONTREAL (Reuters) -Air Canada has agreed to a $4.5 million settlement to resolve a U.S. government investigation into claims thousands of air passenger refunds were delayed, the Transportation Department said.
The proposed settlement, which still must be approved by an administrative law judge, would resolve the U.S. Transportation Department investigation into what it said were ""extreme delays in providing refunds to thousands of consumers for flights to or from the United States that the carrier canceled or significantly changed"".
Of the $4.5 million settlement, $2.5 million would be credited to Air Canada for refunding passengers and $2 million would be paid to the U.S. Treasury.
Air Canada said it agreed to settle without any finding of wrongdoing ""to avoid protracted litigation as Air Canada focuses, together with all stakeholders, on rebuilding following the pandemic.""
Air Canada said it has provided C$730.4 million ($575 million) in refunds on flights to or from the United States significantly changed since March 2020 as well as more than C$10 million in goodwill payments to passengers not entitled to refunds under U.S. law. 
In June, the department said it was seeking a $25.5 million fine https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-seeks-255-million-fine-air-canada-over-delayed-refunds-2021-06-15 from Air Canada over the carrier's failure to provide timely refunds, alleging Air Canada continued its no-refund policy in violation of U.S. law for more than a year.
The U.S. Transportation Department said it plans to soon propose formal rules to codify its interpretation of requirements that airlines provide prompt refunds when carriers cancel or make a significant change, including when the ticket purchased is non-refundable. The rules will also ""address additional protections for consumers who are unable to travel due to government restrictions.""
Air Canada said in June it has been refunding non-refundable tickets as part of the Canadian government's financial package.

The Transportation Department in June disclosed it was also ""actively investigating the refund practices of other U.S. and foreign carriers flying to and from the United States"", saying it would take ""enforcement action"" as appropriate. It reiterated those comments Monday.

The SEC's order said Redman charged ProPetro $380,594 worth of personal and travel expenses unrelated to the performance of his duties as CEO and failed to disclose stock pledges for two private real estate transactions, the regulator said in a statement. 
Redman resigned from ProPetro last year less than three weeks after Reuters sent company executives a letter seeking comments for an investigation into the stock pledges and other aspects of his financial affairs.
The investigation by the SEC found that between January 2017 and December 2018, Redman and his family members used corporate credit cards for roughly $127,698 in undocumented and personal expenses. The company also incurred $252,896 in charges related to Redman's personal use of an aircraft.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Monday called on the Justice Department to open a broad investigation on the impact of price- fixing and consolidation in the poultry sector on consumers and farmers.
The former Democratic presidential candidate also urged the department's Antitrust Division to review ""with suspicion"" any large mergers in the industry, after Cargill Inc and Continental Grain said in August they would buy chicken company  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) for $4.53 billion.
Warren said in a letter that consumers are paying higher prices because of excessive consolidation, price-fixing and ""plain-old corporate greed.""
Prices for chicken breasts have jumped 26% over the past year, according to U.S. Labor Department data, while turkey prices were up 24% in an annual American Farm Bureau Federation survey ahead of Thanksgiving.
The meat industry has said increased demand and the labor shortage have boosted prices. Four processors control 54% of the chicken market, up from 35% in 1986, according to the Biden administration.
""Lack of competition in the poultry industry is allowing these massive companies to squeeze both American consumers and farmers to fuel record corporate profits and payouts to shareholders,"" Warren said.
The Justice Department is investigating price-fixing among some chicken producers. The Biden administration is also promising a tougher stance toward four companies that control the U.S. beef market as a way to rein in prices.
In February, chicken company Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Corp pleaded guilty and settled federal charges that it conspired to fix prices and passed on the costs to consumers.
A month earlier,  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) settled civil litigation by three groups of plaintiffs that accused it of illegally conspiring to inflate chicken prices.

Warren asked the Justice Department to report by Dec. 20 on how price-fixing and consolidation have contributed to higher poultry prices.
Republican U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley previously raised concerns about the takeover of Sanderson Farms, the third-largest U.S. chicken producer.

Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said last week that quickening the pace of tapering might be worth discussing at December's meeting. Minutes of the Fed's November meeting are due for release on Wednesday.
In commodities, gold prices were under pressure as Powell's nomination drove expectations that the central bank will stay the course on tapering economic support. Spot prices were down 2.16% by 4:23 EST (2124 GMT) and U.S. gold futures settled 2.4% lower at $1,806.30.
Oil prices rebounded from recent losses on reports that OPEC+ could adjust plans to raise oil production if large consuming countries release crude from their reserves or if the coronavirus pandemic dampens demand.
Brent crude settled up 1.03% at $79.70 a barrel and U.S. crude finished up 1.07% to $76.75 per barrel.

""The Biden administration is serious about tackling inflation and we’re not going to have runaway inflation kill the U.S. economy,"" OANDA's Moya said, citing the expected tapping of strategic petroleum reserves. 
Bitcoin dropped 4.5%, extending its rout after posting its worst week in two months last week.

Over the past year, such pullbacks have proven to be great entry points. 3 oil and gas stocks that investors should consider buying on this correction are Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), and Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU). .Crude oil has been one of the best-performing assets in 2021 with a 61.9% gain. The major factor in this rise has been that demand has bounced back much faster than anticipated, and it never declined as much as expected during the pandemic and shutdowns. According to the IEA, global oil demand fell to an average of 91.5 million barrels per day in 2020 from 100.3 million barrels per day in 2019. 
On the other hand, oil production was drastically cut during 2020 and has been slower to come back to pre-pandemic levels. 2019 saw production of 95 million barrels per day, while it declined to 88.4 million barrels per day. In 2021, we are expected to average around 92 million barrels per day with this figure expected to reach 100 million barrels per day over the next couple of years.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Investors looked to shed some risk in the U.S. corporate bond market on Monday, pushing a fund tracking the high-yield sector to its lowest level since March after Jerome Powell's nomination for a second term as Federal Reserve chair raised expectations of sooner rate hikes.
The iShares iBoxx exchange-traded fund fell about 0.38% to an eight-month low of $86.22. 
Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research in New York, said there was some shifting out of risk assets as U.S. Treasury yields rose with the two-year yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, topping 0.59%, its highest level since early March 2020.
""If the market is correct that the Fed is going to tighten a couple of times next year, then financial conditions are going to get tighter and some of the lower-quality companies in the high-yield market are going to have a tough time,"" Jones said.
""You tend to see risk reduction when you get into a rate- hike cycle or tightening cycle,"" she added. 
With the end of 2021 looming, investors may also be cashing in gains.
Kenneth Monaghan, co-director of high yield at Amundi Asset Management US, said that after the sector's record issuance and generally good performance, ""people want to close down shop in this particularly exhausting year.""
""If I had to guess what will happen between now and the end of the year, it's going to be a sideways to maybe modestly weaker conversation,"" he said.

President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second four-year term, positioning the former investment banker to continue the most consequential revamp of monetary policy since the 1970s and finish guiding the economy out of the pandemic crisis.
On Friday, high-yield spreads widened. After diving to 303 basis points on Nov. 8, the option-adjusted spread on the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA U.S. High Yield Index, a commonly used benchmark for the junk bond market, was at 324 basis points on Friday, its widest since Oct. 13.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 04:07PM ET</span>",U.S. holiday air travel week opens briskly,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans have begun hitting the roads and skies in large numbers in advance of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday as weather so far looks favorable for travel plans.
On Sunday, the Transportation Security Administration screened 2.21 million U.S air passengers, the fourth consecutive day with checkpoint volume topping 2 million.
The TSA said Friday was the single busiest air travel day since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, with 2.24 million travelers screened. 
AccuWeather said Monday that ""a largely quiet weather pattern should prevent widespread travel worries from the weather ahead of Thanksgiving.""
The weather forecaster added that ""some Americans could still face minor weather-related delays during one of the busiest travel periods of the year - and weather for the trip home may be a different story.""
As vaccination rates have risen, many Americans are traveling for the holidays after skipping family gatherings last November and December.
Travel group AAA forecasts 53.4 million people will travel for the Thanksgiving holiday, up 13% from 2020, with most travelers going by car. About 48.3 million Thanksgiving travelers are expected to go by car, up from 47.1 million last year, but still below 2019's 49.9 million.
Those on the roads will face gasoline prices hovering near the highest since 2014, and the high prices likely will prompt some Americans not to make holiday trips.
Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said some Americans ""are responding to the prices by slamming the car door shut and staying off the road.""
TSA expects to screen about 20 million air passengers during the busy Thanksgiving travel period, compared with nearly 26 million in the same period in 2019.
""We are ready,"" TSA Administrator David Pekoske told reporters on Friday at Washington Reagan National Airport. ""We will be able to handle the passenger volumes that we anticipate seeing.""
Airlines have ramped up staffing and offered bonuses and other incentives to employees facing the busy holiday travel season.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said it expects to fly up to 5.6 million passengers from Friday through Nov. 30, nearly 300% over 2020's 2.2 million Delta passengers for the period but still below the 6.3 million passengers during the same period in 2019.
United Airlines said it anticipates more than 4.5 million passengers during the Thanksgiving travel period - about 88% of 2019 volume.
United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told Skift last week he has confidence in the airline's ability to fly its holiday schedule. ""We've left ourselves a margin of error,"" Kirby said.
He cautioned, however, that problems can ripple and ""If you are not careful it can cascade into a meltdown.""

Some airlines have in recent weeks faced weather issues, resulting in hundreds of daily cancellations over several days.
United said it was adding about 700 domestic flights for Thanksgiving week, and would fly 87% of its 2019 domestic schedule in November.

Investing.com -- Buoyed by bank stocks, the S&P 500 jumped on Monday after President Joe Biden said he would nominate Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to a second term. But the broad market gave back gains heading into the final minutes of trading.
The move, which has been anticipated for weeks, means Biden wants to chart a steady course through the economic reopening, choosing continuity over a candidate in Lael Brainard many had thought to be more to the liking of liberal progressives in Congress. 
Bank stocks rose on the prospect of higher interest rates when the Fed moves to tame inflationary pressures growing in the economy. But that means tech stocks lagged, falling even as the broader index rose.
Biden’s choice in Powell was greeted favorably by investors. The president has a number of Fed appointments yet to make and has the opportunity to put his stamp on the institution even if Powell was nominated to lead the bank by his predecessor.
Brainard, who is currently a governor on the Fed’s board, will be nominated as vice chair. While some in the Senate said they wouldn’t support Powell’s nomination, the two are expected to get through confirmation without much of a battle. 
Investors will have plenty of economic data to digest this week, which is abbreviated because of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. on Thursday. The minutes of the Fed's latest meeting are due out Wednesday.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Zoom Video earnings
Pandemic darling stock  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) is expected to report adjusted profit per share of $1.09 in the third quarter after today’s closing bell. Analysis tracked by Investing.com expect revenue of $1.02 billion. Investors will be listening for the company’s outlook considering people are returning to office settings and may not have the need for so much videoconferencing.
2.  Medtronic  earnings
Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)’s second-quarter revenue is seen at $7.98 billion, with adjusted EPS coming in at $1.29. The medical device maker is seen as poised to benefit from a resurgence in elective surgeries, though a new spike in Covid cases could toss a wet blanket on that.
3. Tesla tweets
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)rose on Monday after CEO Elon Musk tweeted the company’s Model S Plaid is expected to hit the Chinese market “around March.” The world's second largest economy is the company’s biggest market outside the U.S. and it is also an export hub for the EV-maker.

(AMD) make a strong comeback from bankruptcy. The company has gained over 1,680% over the past five years. Consistent product innovations have made AMD a rival to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market. Also, the company has recently been awarded a contract from Meta Platforms, Inc. (FB) to provide its EPYC chip processors to power its data center computers.
This, combined with its better-than-expected results in the third quarter, has helped the stock gain investor attention over the past month, as evident from its 33.6% gain during the period. However, a Northland Securities analyst has downgraded the stock recently on concerns over lower demand for its semiconductors, high inflation, and INTC’s yet-to-launch Alder Lake lineup of processors. These factors could lead to AMD witnessing a slowdown next year. In addition, given its lofty valuation and rising mentions on the r/WallStreetBets dashboard, analysts expect AMD to witness a pullback in the near term.
Despite the global chip shortage, the industry witnessed 27.6% year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter. Rising government and corporate investments and various measures to address this crisis will likely improve the situation by the second half of 2022. Moreover, innovation in the chipmaking process and manufacturing of advanced chips should foster the industry’s growth.

The suit filed in September alleges the deal would lead to higher fares in busy northeastern U.S. airports and seeks to unwind the alliance. The airlines said Monday the alliance has been in place for nine months but the suit does ""not allege that it has caused a single higher price, any reduction in quality or the slightest reduction in output.""
The Justice Department declined to comment on Monday. The government and airlines on Friday backed a proposed trial date of September 2022 but that schedule has not yet been approved by a U.S. judge.
The partnership was announced in July 2020 and approved by the U.S. Transportation Department (DOT) shortly before the end of the Trump administration. The Justice Department said the alliance would cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars.
The airlines argue the Justice Department and states should allow the alliance to continue to prove itself in the market. They note their commitments to expansion, oversight and measures to address possible anticompetitive effects. 
The suit also signals the Biden administration's interest in greater competition where American and three other airlines control 80% of the domestic air market.

The agreement allows American and JetBlue to sell each other's flights in their New York-area and Boston networks and link frequent flyer programs in a move aimed at giving them more muscle to compete with United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in the Northeast.
The Justice Department complaint said the partnership at least partially removed JetBlue as a disruptive maverick that would work to drive down prices.

Investing.com — General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) shares soared Monday after it said it would take a 25% stake in Pure Watercraft, a Seattle-based all-electric boating company.
GM shares are up over 4.6%, at $64.48, approaching recent intraday highs of $65.18.
While there were no details provided about the amount invested in Pure Watercraft, the deal is part of GM's plan to invest $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicle technology through 2025. The $35 billion investment will include work to improve performance and reduce battery costs.
The company is aiming to become the market leader in EVs in North America.
The collaboration will combine Pure Watercraft's marine propulsion technology with GM's engineering, supply chain, and manufacturing capabilities to help them develop and commercialize battery-electric watercraft.
""Building upon GM's existing efforts to strategically deploy our technology across rail, truck and aerospace industries, the combined expertise of these two enterprises should result in future zero-emissions marine product offerings, providing consumers with more choice than before,"" explained said Dan Nicholson, GM's vice president of Global Electrification, Controls, Software & Electronics.

(Reuters) - European shares ended flat on Monday as Germany's warning of tighter lockdown restrictions overshadowed gains in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) following a $12-billion proposal from U.S. fund KKR to take Italy's largest phone group private. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index finished flat after falling earlier in the day when German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe's biggest economy needed tighter restrictions to control a wave of COVID-19 inflections.
This came after a surge in COVID-19 cases prompted Austria to go back into lockdown.
Meanwhile, telecom stocks rose 1.8% - their best day since March - fuelled by a 30.3 jump in Telecom Italia (TIM).
KKR reportedly set an indicative price of 50.5 euro cents for its buyout offer - a 45.7% premium to TIM's closing price on Friday.
""The premium is very attractive, which is why we're seeing a big jump in shares, but an interesting thing is going to be the Italian government's response to the bid, which lays the groundwork for future outside offers - and all the important Italian companies who've fallen on tough times,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. 
Italian mobile tower company Inwit, partly controlled by TIM, gained 4.6% as the KKR approach created speculative appeal for the firm, while TIM's top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) rose 2.0%. 
Markets in the United States rose after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's nomination for a second four-year term by President Joe Biden.
""The reappointment of Jerome Powell marks the return of the approach pursued by new U.S. presidents since 1980, namely reappointing the incumbent Fed chair in order to provide the continuity that markets crave,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. 
The European benchmark logged its first weekly drop in seven weeks on Friday as worries about the impact of renewed COVID-19 restrictions knocked cyclical sectors such as automakers and banks. 
But those sectors rebounded on Monday, with banks, mining and industrial companies all advancing. 
In another telecoms deal, Norway's Telenor climbed 1.5% after agreeing with Charoen Pokphand Group to merge their Thai units in a deal valued at about $8.6 billion.

AUSTIN (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is planning to spend more than $1 billion on its new vehicle factory in Austin, Texas, and plans to complete construction by the end of this year, public filings with a Texas state agency showed.
Filings submitted to the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) on Friday outlined Tesla's spending on various manufacturing capabilities at its Austin factory. The company said it plans to complete construction of its general assembly, paint, casting, stamping and body shop facilities by Dec. 31.
The five facilities would have a combined square footage of nearly 4.3 million (0.4 square kilometer), and cost a combined $1.06 billion, according to the filings.
Electric vehicle news outlet electrek first reported on the filings on Monday.
The TDLR regulates and licenses a broad range of businesses, facilities and equipment. The Tesla filings were made under the agency's architectural barriers project, which reviews and inspects projects ensure they comply with Texas' accessibility regulations. 
The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has previously said the company plans to start limited production of its Model Y mid-size SUV this year, and high-volume production next year.
Construction for Tesla's new factory, located close to the airport on the eastern outskirts of Austin and projected to cost $1.1 billion, began during the summer of 2020. The company is expected to receive nearly $65 million in local tax rebates for the factory, which Tesla said will create some 10,000 jobs, most of them low skilled.

Construction groups can be seen working on the massive plant day and night, and the factory building is expected to be at least 0.75 miles (1.21 km) long once completed.
Tesla has also said it would move its headquarters to Austin, Texas from California.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a tweet on Monday that the Model S Plaid will ""probably"" be coming to China, the electric-car maker's second-largest market, around March.
The company introduced a new Model S Plaid, a 520-mile range sedan that can reach top speeds of up to 200 miles per hour (320 km per hour), in September last year, with deliveries starting in 2021.
Musk, known for his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) banter, did not provide any further details in his tweet. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
There is demand in China, at least initially, for the Model S Plaid, especially among high-end luxury automotive buyers, Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said.
While Tesla has weathered the chip crisis better than rivals and legacy automakers, some analysts believe supply-chain issues could raise costs and negatively affect margins.
The electric-vehicle maker's Shanghai factory helped sustain the company when its factory in Fremont, California was forced to shut down due to pandemic-related curbs early last year.
Tesla could also export the Model S Plaid to other markets in Europe and Asia, so it makes sense to add the model to the Shanghai site, Goldstein said.
The company's Shanghai factory has exported about 41,000 vehicles of the more than 54,000 made at the plant.

In the recent past, Tesla has been facing regulatory scrutiny in China over how it handles data, consumer complaints and other issues.
Shares of Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, were up 3.5% at $1,177.11.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Washington, DC, subway system said on Monday it expects to continue reduced rail service through at least Dec. 31 after a derailment in mid-October.
On Oct. 17, the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission ordered the system to remove about 60% of Metro's rail cars indefinitely. The Washington subway system that serves the U.S. capital and parts of Virginia and Maryland said on Monday there is still no timeline to return 7000-series cars to service but added that ""incremental service improvements will be made"" as it receives parts for older 6000-series rail cars that can be returned to use.
The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating, said the 7000-series train had derailed at least three times on Oct. 12. The derailment did not injure any of the 187 passengers onboard, but NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said the incident could have been ""catastrophic.""
""As we get more parts, we will return more of the 6000-series rail cars to service for our customers during December,” said Metro Chief Executive Officer Paul Wiedefeld. ""While we know service is not as frequent as customers would prefer, we will add each train as it becomes available to help incrementally improve service reliability and frequency.""
Metro is still operating with 70% fewer riders on average weekdays compared with pre-pandemic levels - and weekday ridership is down 17% from October traffic before the service reductions.
Metro continues to test inspection protocols for its newest 7000-series rail cars and is preparing eventually to return more than 700 of those cars to service.

""We are intentionally not setting deadlines so that safety and good data drive our decisions,"" Wiedefeld said.
The rail service outlook for January will depend on completion of the 7000-series test plan and restoration plan, which will require approval from the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. bank stocks rose on Monday as senior bankers and industry figures welcomed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's nomination by President Joe Biden for a second four-year term.
A Republican and former private equity lawyer, Powell has long been favored by Wall Street bankers and fund managers who saw him as one of their own, sympathetic to their gripes that the industry has become over-regulated as a result of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
Biden, in a statement emailed to reporters, paid tribute to the ""decisive action"" which the Fed had taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Senior bankers echoed the presidential praise for Powell's swift and steady hand.
""Chairman Powell has been a steadying force throughout the pandemic and I'm glad to see him continue in this role,"" Christiana Riley, chief executive of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s U.S. business, said.
""Consistency at the top of the Federal Reserve is reassuring during this critical point in the post-pandemic recovery.""
The S&P 500 bank index was up 2.6%, on pace for its best day in two months.
Powell presided over a historic run-up in stocks. The S&P 500 has risen around 70% under Powell, fueled in part by extraordinary measures taken during the coronavirus pandemic. The Fed added $4.4 trillion to its balance sheet during the pandemic, purchasing assets including Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
Over the past four years, Powell also backed a review led by Fed vice chair for supervision Randal Quarles of key post-crisis regulations, agreeing with Quarles' view that many were too blunt and onerous and should be better tailored to banks' risks.
Among the most contentious changes were revisions to the ""Volcker Rule"" curbing speculative bank investments; scrapping a requirement for big banks to hold capital against certain swap trades; and stripping the Fed of its power to fail banks on their annual ""stress tests"" based on subjective concerns.
Powell's perceived ""bank-friendly"" agenda had led Democrat progressives to favor Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard, who had won respect from progressives for opposing Quarles' efforts to ease bank regulations. 
Brainard has, instead, been appointed vice chair. 
One area of lingering concern for banks might be Biden's failure to announce a new regulatory chief to replace current head of supervision Randal Quarles, who stepped down from his role overseeing the country's biggest banks in October.
Brainard had been favorite for that role but did not want it, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Biden said the supervision post and other Fed picks would be announced in early December.
Some analysts and investors raised concern that Biden might appoint a candidate with an aggressive regulatory agenda to satisfy progressive Democrats unhappy at Powell's reappointment. 
""The oversight role is still a risk for the banks. And so that's something we're going to pay attention to,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. 
Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, said the best outcome banks can hope for would be a candidate with a similar agenda to Brainard while a politically-motivated appointment could be more negative for banks.
""Higher capital requirements and tougher CCAR (stress tests) are inevitable,"" Seiberg said.

Kevin Fromer, CEO of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the largest eight U.S. banks and their CEOs, congratulated both Powell and Brainard.
""We expect regulators will continue to hold the largest banks to the high regulatory and supervisory standards that have remained in place to support a resilient and essential part of the U.S. financial system.""

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who presided over a historic run-up in stocks during his tenure, will likely begin his second term amid worries over how rising inflation and looming monetary policy tightening will affect asset prices.
Powell replaced Janet Yellen as Fed Chair in February 2018 and has had to steer the economy through its worst crisis since World War Two, as the COVID-19 pandemic battered U.S. growth last year.
The S&P 500 has risen around 70% under Powell https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/powells-rollercoaster-ride-fed-enemy-economic-savior-2021-11-22, fueled in-part by extraordinary measures taken during the coronavirus pandemic. The index increased by 59% under Yellen's four-year tenure and rose 39% during Ben Bernanke's eight-year term through January 2014. 
Fed heads and the S&P 500: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjvqkwjzmvx/Pasted%20image%201636131372302.png 
Among investors' most immediate concerns are whether a recent inflationary surge will prove more sustained than the Fed had expected, pushing the central bank to accelerate the unwinding of its $120 billion-per-month bond buying program and raise rates earlier than anticipated. 
The Fed's policymakers are publicly debating whether to withdraw support for the U.S. economy more quickly to deal with inflation, with one official signaling on Friday that the idea will be discussed at the central bank's upcoming meeting.
Inflation expectations in the U.S. bond market have climbed in recent weeks, bolstering the view that the Fed may need to act more aggressively.
The difference between yields on 5-year and 10-year Treasury inflation protected securities and those on typical Treasuries stand near record highs. 
Breakeven inflation rates: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykdlyypg/Pasted%20image%201637270035728.png 
The pace at which the Fed unwinds its roughly $8.6 trillion balance sheet and moves on to a series of expected interest rate hikes can also be a key driver of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. currency rose by around 20% between mid-2014 and early 2015, when it became evident that the Fed would be far more aggressive than other central banks in normalizing monetary policy. 
Fed heads and the dollar index: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgvomklgnvd/Pasted%20image%201637272425310.png 
The greenback is up around 7% under Powell, and its gains have accelerated in recent weeks as some investors bet U.S. monetary policy will take a more hawkish course.
With inflation rising at its fastest pace in decades, investors increasingly believe the Fed will need to raise rates faster than suggested in its so-called dot plot, released in September. The Fed's next meeting is December 14-15. 
When will Fed raise rates?: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xmvjorkdxpr/Pasted%20image%201636131734331.png 
One key metric the Fed is watching as it fine tunes its monetary policy is unemployment. Powell said on Nov. 3 that the economy is not yet at maximum employment, meaning it is not yet time to raise interest rates. 
But he added that the labor market could reach full employment by the second half of 2022 if it continues to improve at the same pace seen over the last year.

And the trend is unlikely to end anytime soon. Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to add quality home improvement stocks Lowe’s Companies (LOW), Builders FirstSource (BLDR), and  Mohawk Industries  (NYSE:MHK) to one’s portfolio now. Read on.The home improvement trend has skyrocketed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Since people began spending more time indoors than outdoors with the pandemic, home improvement and maintenance expenditure has grown significantly. Many people are also ‘flush with cash’ due to federal spending, and they’ve not been shy to spend even though inflation has climbed to its highest level in 31 years. The low-interest rates are also fueling the demand for home improvement.
With the economy's recovery, property prices have moved up to unprecedented levels, and many homebuyers have had to pay more than they anticipated to secure a home. The high home prices have also encouraged many potential home buyers to spend money on improving their existing homes rather than purchase an expensive new one. Because both new and old homeowners have opted for renovations, the home improvement industry has benefited. The managing director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies, Chris Herbert, said, “Home remodeling will likely grow at a faster pace given the ongoing strength of home sales, house price appreciation, and new residential construction activity.”
Investors’ interest in the home improvement industry is evident in the SPDR Homebuilders ETF’s (XHB) 46.9% returns over the past year. Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to invest in quality home improvement stocks Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW), Builders FirstSource, Inc. (BLDR), and Mohawk Industries, Inc.

According to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University, the United States reported a seven-day average of nearly 95,000 new cases on November 18, up 31% over the past two weeks.
With rising concerns, most organizations are sticking to a hybrid work mode for the winter. This is expected to sustain the demand for 5G. For example, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has decided to push its return to office plan until February. Furthermore, the recently passed $1.2 trillion U.S. infrastructure bill has approximately $65 billion assigned to deliver broadband to unserved and underserved areas of the United States. This is expected to provide a significant boost to the 5G industry. Also, according to the Delaware 5G Infrastructure market study report, the global 5G infrastructure market is expected to grow more than 29% between 2019 -2026.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally strong 5G stocks Ciena Corporation (CIEN), A10 Networks, Inc. (ATEN), and Aviat Networks, Inc. (AVNW). They have an overall B (Buy) rating in our proprietary POWR Ratings system.

Investing.com —  Stoke Therapeutics Inc  (NASDAQ:STOK) shares rose 13% after it was given a bullish rating from JPMorgan analyst Jessica Fye.
Stoke was upgraded to overweight from neutral, with a price target of $41.
The analyst told investors that she likes the company's proprietary platform, Targeted Augmentation of Nuclear Gene Output (TANGO), ""as a driver of long-term value creation.""
Fye also said she sees reason for efficacy with Stoke's lead therapeutic candidate, STK-001, a therapy for treating Dravet Syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy.
STK-001 is currently in a Phase 1/2 study with efficacy and safety data expected in the fourth quarter and the second half of 2022.  
""We see near-term upside driven by ‘001 (and limited downside) and a solid technology platform that could continue to generate shareholder value through follow-on assets over the next 12 months,"" explained Fye."
1466,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 12:20PM ET</span>",Union group says U.S. should reject Amazon's plan to buy MGM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four big unions, including the Service Employees International Union and the Teamsters, urged the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Monday to oppose Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s plan to buy Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, saying it would reduce competition in the streaming video market.
Amazon announced the $8.45 billion deal in May, saying the purchase of the fabled U.S. movie studio, home to the James Bond franchise, would give it a library of films and TV shows to compete with rivals like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+.
The unions, in a report by an entity they support called the Strategic Organizing Center, argued that the deal would bring Amazon's industry-leading streaming library to more than 55,000 titles, with more under development, which would give the company greater incentive to discriminate against rivals. Netflix has the second-greatest number of titles at just under 20,000, the letter said.
""The prospect of Amazon acquiring a trove of additional MGM content to build on Amazon's existing vast library should raise alarm bells,"" the group said. ""With control over MGM's vast library, Amazon may acquire enough market power over streaming content to raise prices for (streaming video-on-demand) SVOD competitors or for SVOD consumers.""
Amazon, which the group said grew exponentially during the U.S. coronavirus lockdown, has used its streaming service to attract new Prime members. Prime members make up some 68 percent of Amazon shoppers and spend significantly more than non-Prime shoppers, the group said.

The Service Employees International Union, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Communications Workers of America and the United Farmworkers, sent the letter to Holly Vedova, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition.
Amazon handily beat back an effort by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union to organize a Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse earlier this year. But unions have continued to organize, with the RWDSU gearing up potentially to try again.

Investing.com – Shares of Melco Resorts (NASDAQ:MLCO) and Wynn (NASDAQ:WYNN) rose 5% and 2.5%, respectively, Monday on a report in South China Morning Post that Hong Kong residents would be allowed to enter the mainland from early December without undergoing quarantine.
This limited reopening comes about two weeks sooner than originally planned, the report said.
The number of visitors will initially be limited to “only a few hundred per day” and then “a few thousand” in the following months once a testing and tracking system is put in place, according to the report.
Reopening to China is key to reviving the flow of people into Hong Kong and crucial to the city’s economy.
Hong Kong and China have had strict restrictions on the movement of people to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
According to a separate report in SCMP today, a visiting delegation from Beijing urged local officials to bolster efforts to shut out imported cases. It was mostly satisfied with the city’s overall strategy to keep the virus in check and create conditions to allow the border to reopen, according to this report.
SCMP said Tam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong’s sole delegate to China’s top national legislative body, has been told to travel to Beijing next month after being denied the permission in October on grounds of a single coronavirus infection on the island.

Airlines such as BA and Virgin Atlantic had pinned their hopes on the reopening of the Europe to United States routes as vital to rebuilding their finances, after more than 18 months of restrictions left them nursing billions of dollars of debt. 
Luis Gallego told the Airlines UK conference that the group was recovering, and he expected a return to pre-pandemic flying levels by 2023. 
""Now as the world opens up, we are growing our capacity,"" he said. ""Transatlantic bookings have already reached almost 100% of 2019 levels. I expect North Atlantic routes to reach full capacity by next summer.""
Gallego warned however that a move by London's Heathrow Airport to hike charges could hit the recovery, and he noted that the 40% of passengers who use the airport to transit on to different final destinations could use alternative hubs. 

The UK's Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) has made an initial proposal for Heathrow to be allowed to charge as much as 50% more per passenger over the 2022-2027 period.
""If the rise in landing charges goes ahead, I know IAG would not be alone in reconsidering our airlines’ use of Heathrow as a port,"" he said. ""Right now, aviation is trying to emerge from its worst crisis ever. UK operators need to be able to compete.""

Shai Weiss told the Airlines UK conference that the airline still did not have great visibility on bookings more than three to six months out, but he expected the UK to U.S. route to drive the recovery as large parts of Asia remained highly restricted.

Virgin Atlantic, founded by billionaire Richard Branson, is 51% owned by Branson's Virgin Group with the balance held by Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL).
Virgin Atlantic was forced to raise cash during the pandemic to survive, including a 1.2 billion pound ($1.6 billion) rescue deal. It also axed almost half of its staff to cut costs.

Sky News reported on Saturday that Branson and Delta were in talks about a further capital raise, of around 400 million pounds, after talk of an IPO faded in uncertain market conditions. Weiss declined to comment on Monday.

With winter now approaching the Northern Hemisphere, coal prices are expected to rise further even after China’s intervention to lower prices. Hence, we think it could be wise to buy the dip in coal stocks of Warrior Met Coal (NYSE:HCC), Ramaco (METC), and Hallador Energy (HNRG). Read on.Despite the worldwide push for cleaner energy, fossil fuels such as coal remain relevant. Coal usage in the United States for energy generation has experienced its first year-over-year increase this year, since 2014.
Furthermore, due to the doubling of natural gas prices, U.S. coal prices peaked in mid-November to their highest price since 2009 because producers are unable to keep up with the rising demand for carbon substances. In addition, thermal coal prices tend to rally in winter. And despite China’s intervention to lower coal prices by expanding supply, coal is expected to trade at $159.82 per metric ton by the end of this quarter.
Hence, we think it could be wise to buy the dip in the fundamentally strong coal stocks of Warrior Met Coal, Inc. (HCC), Ramaco Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:METC), and Hallador Energy Company (NASDAQ:HNRG).

Read on.While countries worldwide are trying to return to normalcy, the latest news reports from various parts of Europe point to a sharp surge in COVID-19 cases. Germany reported its highest number of infections in a single day since the start of the pandemic. Similarly, Austria and the Netherlands have implemented partial lockdowns to prevent the virus’ spread.
Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc.’s (NYSE:SPCE) Richard Branson once famously said, ""If you want to be a millionaire, start with a billion dollars and launch a new airline."" Airlines as a business venture are often highly risky due to the industry's uncertainty. The airline industry was already facing headwinds before the pandemic. And even with the elimination of some restrictions, widespread anxiety due to the healthcare crisis remains.
With the COVID-19 situation deteriorating in Europe, the airline industry is again expected to receive a blow as rising infection rates and restrictions reduce travel demand. Amid this scenario, we think it could be wise to avoid airline stocks Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL), United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), and  American Airlines Group  Inc. (AAL).

Hedge fund managers are known to capitalize on such market slowdowns to rake in substantial profits by identifying fundamentally strong stocks that possess tremendous growth potential. Therefore, tracking activist hedge funds can allow investors to identify key investment opportunities now.
Despite the current market pause, hedge funds have been investing heavily in renowned industry leaders Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), AT&T Inc. (T), Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), and  Coty Inc . (COTY). These companies are expected to generate substantial growth over the next few months despite the slowdown in consumer spending and supply chain concerns, thereby delivering an adequate return on investments (ROI).

Furthermore, high travel activity due to Thanksgiving and other holidays will likely increase the number of cases in multiple states, enhancing the importance of testing. Hence, we think that fundamentally strong coronavirus testing stocks of Abbott Laboratory (ABT), Laboratory Corporation of America (NYSE:LH), and Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) could be solid bets now. Read on.The steady recovery from COVID-19 came to a halt in the summer as new cases climbed due to the virus’ Delta variant. Fortunately, cases began declining again from September to October as various guidelines, vaccine and mask mandates were implemented. However, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) indicated that cases had surged 16.1% from the previous week, as of November 18, raising concerns about a winter resurgence, because cold and dry conditions help the virus thrive.
In addition, as people travel back to their hometowns for Thanksgiving, cases have been increasing across the country, with more than 90,000 cases being reported each day and more than 30 states experiencing upticks.
Last month, it was announced that unvaccinated travelers entering the United States would face stricter restrictions, requiring them to produce a document indication they’ve had a recent negative COVID-19 test. So, this mandate should drive the revenues of coronavirus testing companies. Indeed, the global COVID-19 diagnostics market is expected to expand at a 3.1% CAGR between 2021 - 2027.

1484,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>",Activists urge Biden to push for intellectual property waiver for COVID-19 vaccines,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Fifteen medical and human rights groups are urging U.S. President Joe Biden to get personally engaged in a long-running fight to enact an intellectual property waiver for COVID-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization, calling his leadership ""a moral necessity.""
Amnesty International, Doctors without Borders, Human Rights Watch, Public Citizen and 11 other groups told Biden in a letter that an emergency waiver was urgently needed to combat the pandemic, noting that fewer than 7% of people in low-income countries had received a first COVID-19 shot and vaccines remained scarce.
More than 5.4 million people have died of COVID-19 around the world https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019. 
Biden reversed the previous U.S. position to endorse a waiver in May https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biden-says-plans-back-wto-waiver-vaccines-2021-05-05, a move that caught some allies by surprise, but there has been little progress since then. The European Union, Britain and Switzerland remain opposed, arguing that issuing such waivers would undercut years of investment and research.
The White House last month called on all WTO members to support a temporary waiver https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-wto-members-must-support-intellectual-property-waiver-covid-vaccines-2021-10-21 and WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is pushing for a deal at a WTO ministerial conference in Geneva from Nov. 30 to Dec. 3. 
In their letter, a copy of which was viewed by Reuters, the rights groups said they were ""very disappointed"" that the Biden administration had not done more to secure an agreement on a waiver text since Biden's strong statement in May.
""U.S. passivity has empowered close U.S. allies - the European Union, on behalf of Germany, plus Switzerland and the United Kingdom - to block progress even as millions die or become seriously ill waiting for effective vaccines and treatments,"" the groups wrote. 
They urged Biden to step up his personal engagement and lead the world in reaching a meaningful agreement on the long-standing issue. Doing so would help end the pandemic and restore U.S. standing around the world, they said.
Activists say they have gathered 3 million signatures on petitions urging Biden to step up U.S. efforts and will deliver them on Tuesday.
The White House had no immediate comment on the letter, which was dated Friday.
Ending the ministerial meeting without a waiver agreement would be entirely unacceptable,"" the groups said. They said drugmakers were using their intellectual property rights to segment global markets instead of maximizing the scale of generic production.

U.S officials oppose a separate effort to issue a ""declaration on trade and health"" led by David Walker, the New Zealand envoy to the WTO, according to a Geneva trade delegate and a second source briefed on the matter.
In their letter, the groups said the declaration, if passed without a meaningful intellectual property rights waiver, would ""further undermine the WTO's relevance and legitimacy.""

HAMBURG (Reuters) -Volkswagen's supervisory board executive committee will meet on Tuesday to discuss the future of Chief Executive Herbert Diess, who is likely to remain at the helm of the carmaker despite tensions over his management style, sources said on Monday.
It was not clear whether any decision would be made at Tuesday's meeting, to be attended among others by works council head Daniela Cavallo and representatives of the majority shareholder families, Hans Michel Piech and Wolfgang Porsche, the sources with knowledge of the negotiations said.
But any decision would come before a Dec. 9 supervisory board meeting to discuss Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s five-year spending plan, they added, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Volkswagen and top shareholder Porsche SE declined to comment. German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung first reported plans for an executive committee meeting on Tuesday.
Diess and union representatives have clashed in recent weeks over his management style and electrification strategy, after the CEO warned at a previous supervisory board meeting that 30,000 jobs could be https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-considering-cutting-up-30000-jobs-handelsblatt-2021-10-13 lost if the process was not managed well.
The goal of current negotiations is to announce a series of new board members alongside details on job prospects for employees and investment plans for the group as a package, the sources said.
""It looks as though the threads are coming together,"" one of the people said.

A solution will likely include the appointment of Ralf Brandstaetter, CEO of Volkswagen's namesake brand, to the management board, the people said, where he would take over responsibility for the mass-market brand group from Diess.
Diess last year ceded responsibility https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-management-brandstaetter-idUSKBN23F2AG for the Volkswagen brand to Brandstaetter after weeks of squabbling between the company's powerful labour leaders and managers over the pace and scale of cost cutting plans.

Investing.com —  iSpecimen  Inc (NASDAQ:ISPC) stock jumped 126% from recent lows after it was contracted by the U.S. Government and private researchers to support new advanced research on Covid-19.
The company, an online marketplace for human biospecimens, told investors that the research is exploring insights on the virus's transmissibility, variants, outcomes, and testing validity.

iSpecimen isn't new to Covid-19 research and work. In the last 10 months, it has partnered with multiple organizations on a range of projects requiring various Covid-19 samples, including nasal swabs, saliva, and blood products.
Immediately after the outbreak last year, it began sending serum samples to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help researchers monitor antibody development.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened at fresh record highs on Monday after President Joe Biden said he will nominate Jerome Powell for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
Lael Brainard, the Fed governor who was also in the frame for the job, will instead be promoted to deputy chair, replacing Richard Clarida when his term expires in February.
The appointments signal an endorsement of a highly pragmatic Fed policy that has been in place since the beginning of the pandemic, characterized by Powell's refusal to be hurried into tightening. The Fed will only begin reducing its bond purchases - which currently inject $120 billion of liquidity into the economy every month - from December. Much of the liquidity created by that policy over the last two years has found its way into securities markets, pushing stocks to all-time highs and real interest rates - bond yields adjusted for current inflation - to their lowest in decades.  
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 150 points, or 0.4%, at 35,752 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.6%. 
On Friday, markets had dipped after Clarida had indicated that the Fed will discuss accelerating the phase-out of bond purchases in view of the sharp rise in inflation in recent months. 
""Powell has said the Fed will be patient but will not hesitate to accelerate tapering of asset purchases and raise rates,"" said Diane Swonk, Grant Thornton's chief economist, via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Now the challenge is to be prudent with rate hikes without panicking. Central bankers are hardwired to worry more about inflation than employment.""
Currently, the market is more aggressive about pricing in rate hikes than the Fed. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool suggests nearly a 50% chance of the first hike coming before June, when the quantitative easing program is set to end. It also suggests a more than 60% likelihood of three 25 basis point rate hikes by the end of next year.
Among individual movers, Vonage stock stood out with a 25% gain after receiving a bid from Swedish telecoms equipment company Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC).  Ericsson ADRs were down 4.9% on concerns that the company is overpaying to find a way out of its current problems, which have included loss of market share in China.
Chipmakers were strong again, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rising 3.6% and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock rising 3.5%, against a backdrop of sustained enthusiasm for all things linked to the so-called 'metaverse'. While are there are few certainties about how the metaverse will look, one of the more certain bets, as Nvidia's CEO pointed out last week, is that it is going to require a lot of computing power. One other stock that has enjoyed a metaverse-linked surge in recent days - gaming company Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) - took a breather however. Roblox stock fell 4.8% but is still up more than 60% over the last two weeks.

Austria brought back lockdowns starting today after cases surged while Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel today said the situation is worse than anything the country has experienced so far. She called for tighter restrictions to help check the spread.
Jens Spahn, the country’s health minister, had last week said he couldn’t rule out another full lockdown. Many of the country’s famed outdoor Christmas markets have already been canceled for the second year in a row, and people who aren’t inoculated face possible curfews, according to Bloomberg.

Uber Eats will list cannabis retailer Tokyo Smoke on its marketplace on Monday, following which customers can place orders from the Uber Eats app and then pick it up at their nearest Tokyo Smoke store, the spokesperson said.
Uber, which already delivers liquor through its Eats unit, has had its sights set on the burgeoning cannabis market for some time now. Its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told media https://cnb.cx/3HL1R5I in April the company will consider delivering cannabis when the legal coast is clear in the United States.
With more than three years into Canada's legalisation of recreational cannabis, the country is trying to fix its ailing pot market, where illegal producers still control a large share of total annual sales.
The partnership will help Canadian adults purchase safe, legal cannabis, helping combat the underground illegal market which still accounts for over 40% of all non-medical cannabis sales nationally, Uber said on Monday.
Global cannabis stocks tracker MJ ETF climbed 2%, while Uber's shares were up 1.2% at $44.78 in premarket trading.

Asked about the possibility of expansion into other Canadian provinces, or in the United States, an Uber spokesperson said there is ""nothing more to share at this time"".

""We will continue to watch regulations and opportunities closely market by market. And as local and federal laws evolve, we will explore opportunities with merchants who operate in other regions,"" the Uber spokesperson told Reuters.

""When we now do this, we give up a majority control over the company we have,"" Sigve Brekke told Reuters. ""Therefore, it is important for us to make a company where there are equal partnerships, as in, the two big owners have the same shareholder position,"" he said.
The news comes months after Thai power producer Gulf Energy Development offered to buy Intouch Holdings, which controls AIS, though Gulf Energy has only managed to raise its stake in Intouch to 42.3% so far.
Telenor and CP Group's merged company will have ""revenue market share in the low 40% that is similar to AIS,"" Brekke told media. ""AIS is still a big brother when it comes to profitability so we will learn as we go.""
The tie-up between True and Dtac is set to become the third biggest merger deal between Thai companies, according to Refinitiv data. The combined firm will be listed on the Thai stock exchange.
""Telenor's decision to amalgamate its Thailand holdings with True is hardly surprising, given its ASEAN subsidiary's M&As and exits,"" analyst Thapana Phanich said in a co-branded research report from Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) and TISCO Securities, referring to a similar deal struck in Malaysia earlier this year.
""Dtac has little hope of beating its rivals, or even surviving, in the long run"".
Telenor believes regulators will view the deal favourably, Chief Financial Officer Tone Hegland Bachke told a conference call.
""We are positive that we will reach regulatory approval,"" she said.
The offer of 47.76 baht ($1.45) per Dtac share represents a premium of 15.8% to its Friday close and the offer of 5.09 baht ($0.1549) per True Corp share represents a premium of 17.8% to its close on the same day.
Telenor plans to inject between $300 million and $500 million into the new firm to help pay minority shareholders of Dtac and True who decide to opt for cash rather than stock.
CP Group will also inject cash, albeit a smaller amount, Telenor said, ensuring the two end up holding equal stakes.
Meanwhile, Telenor will continue to look for merger opportunities in Asia, including in Pakistan and on a regional basis, Brekke said.
Dtac and True Corp shares rose 9.1% and 10.2%, respectively, on Monday, while the benchmark Thai index was up 0.3%. Telenor was up 1.7% in Oslo at 1156 GMT.

Citi is advising Telenor and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is advising CP Group.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded 2.5% higher in premarket Monday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted the company’s Model S Plaid is expected to hit the Chinese market “around March”.
Musk was responding to a tweet asking when the model was coming to China.
The world's second largest economy is the company’s biggest market outside the U.S. and it also an export hub for the EV-maker.  
Tesla launched the Model S Plaid in June, costing a reported $129,990, and claims it to be the highest performing sedan ever built with acceleration up to 60 mph in 1.99 seconds and a 396-mile range.
Tesla faces tough competition in the Chinese market from local automakers like Nio (NYSE:NIO), Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) and Geely (OTC:GELYY) as well as global rivals like Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY).
The company sold 54,391 China-made vehicles in October, including 40,666 for export, according to Reuters. Total passenger car sales during the month in the country were 1.74 million units.
Musk's comments overshadowed less positive publicity for the company at the weekend, when a software glitch left many Tesla owners unable to unlock their cars through their smartphone app."

The blank-check company, known earlier as Emerald ESG Acquisition Corp, is offering 22 million units at $10 each, it said in a filing.
Cohen-backed SPACs have clinched several deals to take companies public over the past few years, including ones with boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners and payments provider Payoneer.
Since SPACs became Wall Street's hottest investment trend over the past 18 months, Cohen has emerged as one of the biggest names in the business of blank-check deals, alongside the likes of Chamath Palihapitiya and Michael Klein.
She will chair FTAC Emerald's board, according to Monday's filing. Cohen also has a similar role in nine other blank-check firms, five of which have completed their mergers and two have announced their deals.
Emerald ESG Sponsor, a firm managed by Cohen and a backer of FTAC Emerald, has committed to buy 890,000 units at $10 each in a private placement, the SPAC said in the filing.
SPACs are publicly traded shell companies with a pool of capital that merge with unlisted companies to take them public.
FTAC Emerald said it would target companies in sectors such as renewable energy, water sustainability, agricultural technology, shared economy software or next-generation mobility.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is the sole underwriter for the offering.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 07:11AM ET</span>","Explainer: In gasoline-guzzling U.S., high pump prices can be political poison","By Steve Holland and Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden launched an aggressive attack on gasoline prices last week, enlisting China and other nations in a possible joint release of oil reserves, and sharpening a probe into oil giants' pricing.
The efforts may have limited impact on prices at the pump, experts say, but doing nothing would be a political mistake as gasoline prices hit a seven-year high.
The average U.S. retail gasoline price is $3.41 a gallon, up from $2.11 a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association.
Americans are by far the world's heaviest consumers of gasoline, thanks to big cars, long driving distances and little public transportation in many areas. 
""Americans expect the president to do something about this,"" said Larry Sabato, political scientist at the University of Virginia. ""We need to have a national conversation about the law of supply and demand.""
""Inflation is so cutting, and can really destroy a presidency,"" Sabato added, citing Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, who both tried unsuccessfully to encourage Americans to curb gasoline consumption as prices jumped.
American purchases of bigger sport utility vehicles and trucks, which have lower fuel efficiency, have jumped in recent years, suggesting gasoline prices will be a political issue for years to come. 
HIGH U.S. GASOLINE CONSUMPTION NOT SLOWING DOWN 
U.S. consumers use more gasoline per person than any other country in the world at nearly 1.2 gallons (5.5 litres) per day, according to calculations by Global Petrol Prices, 10 times the rate of China and many European countries. Those figures do not include diesel fuel. Including diesel would increase European fuel consumption by about 20%, the research group's economist, Neven Valev, estimates. 
Global gasoline consumption, per capita https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-OIL/zdvxonwwzpx/chart.png The United States lags Europe and other parts of the world in fuel efficiency, because of an American preference for SUVs and trucks that is only increasing. 
U.S. lags in fuel efficiency: Here's one big reason why https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/gdpzydenyvw/chart.png
PAIN AT THE POLLS
Biden's approval ratings recently slipped to the lowest they have been all year, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows , with just 44% of Americans approving of his job performance. His Democrats face midterm elections in November 2022 when they will try to maintain their slim congressional majorities.
Americans' top issue of concern is the economy, the poll shows, as it has been for 11 weeks. 
Stock markets are at record highs, manufacturing is surging and employment has returned to nearly pre-pandemic levels. But consumer costs rose the most in 31 years in October, thanks in big part to high gasoline prices. 
U.S. retail gasoline prices https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-OIL/zgpomkedmpd/chart.png 
Crude oil accounts for more than half the cost of a retail gallon of gasoline, with taxes an additional 15% or so. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries still has 3.8 million barrels per day in supply cuts from last year that it has not returned to the market. 
Since the OPEC oil embargo of 1973-1974, U.S. presidents have struggled at some point with rising gasoline prices, often with little control over the crises abroad that usually are the underlying cause.
Richard Nixon was president during the world’s first oil shock - a dramatic increase in pump prices in 1973 when OPEC nations decided to punish the United States and other countries for supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War.
""It had a devastating effect on Nixon’s overall standing, which was already weakened by Watergate,” said presidential historian Thomas Alan Schwartz. ""He tried to rally the country around energy independence. That didn’t work.""
When Ford took over as president on the resignation of Nixon, the Republican faced inflation of 12.3%. 
His “Whip Inflation Now,” campaign featuring WIN buttons, T-shirts and coffee cups, urged Americans to fight high fuel prices by carpooling and turning down thermostats. It was viewed as a political disaster, and he lost to Carter, a Democrat, in the 1976 election. 
Carter also tried to encourage Americans to wean themselves from OPEC through conservation. But after a second major oil shock in 1979, when the Iranian revolution took place and production plummeted, he faced rising prices and long lines at gasoline stations. He lost his bid for re-election to Republican Ronald Reagan. 
Oil prices jumped to $140 per barrel and pump prices to $4 a gallon during Republican George W. Bush's second term. With the onset of the Great Recession in late 2007, his approval rating sank to 25%. 
PRESSURE ON BIG COMPANIES 
The White House has also redoubled pressure on big gasoline refiners, slowing down mergers in the oil and gas industry and asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate possible anti-competitive behavior - something others have tried.
""There is a long history that says that these are frequently used political gestures,"" said former FTC Chairman William Kovacic. ""The consequence of these inquiries is futile.""

Bush and his Democratic successor, Barack Obama, called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate gasoline price rises that occurred after Hurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005 and the economic recovery following the 2007-2009 recession.
In Biden's case, ""there may be something to his claims,"" Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset, an investment firm, wrote last week. ""Gasoline prices are 34 cents higher than what can explained by crude oil prices.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, starting the Thanksgiving week on a positive note ahead of the release of the minutes from the last Federal Reserve Meeting and a deluge of important economic data.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 90 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.3%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures outperformed, climbing 70 points, or 0.4%.
Thanksgiving week traditionally marks the start of the key holiday shopping period, and has tended to correlate with gains for the U.S. equity markets. This could well continue to be the case this year after last week’s unexpectedly strong 1.7% jump in retail sales in October.
Ahead of Thursday’s holiday, there are a number of important economic data releases due this week, the highlight will be the figures on personal income and spending, which includes the core PCE price index, widely seen as the Fed’s favored inflation gauge.
The economic calendar also features revised data on third-quarter GDP, initial jobless claims, durable goods orders, new and existing home sales, consumer sentiment and the November PMI release.
Additionally, the Fed is scheduled to publish the minutes of its November meeting, the gathering that resulted in the start of the scaling back of its pandemic-era asset purchase program.
President Joe Biden is also set to announce this week who he wants to chair the Fed for the next four years, the choice being between incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed governor Lael Brainard.  
Turning to the corporate sector, Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock will be in focus after the company and auto giant Ford (NYSE:F) called off their plan to jointly develop an electric vehicle late on Friday.
Meanwhile, the Chief Executive Elon Musk of rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said in a tweet on Monday that its Model S Plaid will ""probably"" be coming to the important China market around March. That offset the negative vibe from the software glitch that kept many Tesla owners locked out of their cars on Friday night.
Crude prices edged lower Monday, continuing the sharp selloff at the end of last week.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signalled on Saturday he was ready to help combat soaring oil prices by exploring a way to release oil from the country’s strategic reserves, joining a group of top consumers following a request from the United States late last week.
The demand outlook meanwhile is under pressure from the soaring number of Covid cases in Europe which has prompted a fresh round of restrictions on economic and social activity.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $75.69 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $78.66. Both benchmarks hit their lowest levels since the start of October earlier in the session, having fallen around 3% on Friday.

ADRs of Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) fell more than 3% on valuation concerns surrounding the biggest deal in the history of the Swedish company. The maker of telecom equipment is paying $21 in cash for each share of Vonage, a 28% premium to its closing price on Friday.
Ericsson will fund the deal through internal accruals. It sees potential for the total addressable market for the Vonage Cloud-communications platform to hit $69 billion by 2025, from $31 billion in 2020.
The Cloud-communications industry has seen a flurry of activity lately as demand for digital services has boomed, attracting new investors and forcing companies to widen their offering for end-to-end solutions.

Ericsson expects the transaction to be EPS accretive. Vonage employs 2,200 people and its sales totaled $1.4 billion in the 12 months ended September 30.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Spiralling shipping costs and COVID-19 supply chain disruptions are accelerating a shift by South African retailers to end their heavy reliance on Asia and move to source products locally.
More than 50% of South Africa's clothing textiles, shoes, and leather products are imported, mostly from China, putting Africa's leading economy and its retailers at the mercy of forces beyond their control such as Chinese power shortages.
While the government launched a programme in 2019 offering tax incentives to source goods locally, the recent spate of problems arising out of Asia has added urgency to what had been a slow shift, four top retailers in South Africa told Reuters.
""Most furniture in South Africa is currently imported, we are looking at various options to manufacture more here, particularly at the moment when shipping costs are up 400%. So it's even more of a reason if you needed one,"" TFG Chief Executive Anthony Thunström said in an interview.
TFG, which sources 72% of its clothes locally, said earlier this month it wants to locally manufacture 30 million pieces a year within four years, up from 11.5 million currently, and is adding furniture and jewellery to its growing local list.
Thunström said a lot of TFG's jewellery is already made in South Africa, but he wants to further increase local sourcing.
The owner of British women's wear brands Hobbs and Whistles and South Africa's @Home homeware brand wants these products to be manufactured on a quick turnaround basis to improve lead times and be competitive against global chains such as Zara, owned by  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and Swedish rival H&M.
TFG said on Nov.11 it will spend a further 575 million rand ($37 million) over the next three to five years to build local manufacturing capability.
South African retailers are not alone in looking local as constraints expose the vulnerability of globe-spanning supply chains and low-cost manufacturing hubs which have led to an over-dependence on imports, particularly from Asia. 
Italy's Benetton and Hugo Boss, have already indicated they are sourcing clothes closer to home.
POWER CUT IMPACT
Norman Drieselmann, CEO of South Africa's Retailability, which owns the Edgars department store chain, said that China's power cuts have added a two week delay to clothing on top of four weeks due to COVID, ahead of the critical festive season.
Woolworths told Reuters it expects the power cuts will impact its orders for March next year. The retailer, which sources about 30% of its fashion, beauty and home products from China, said it is making arrangements to buy more locally.
Retailers who spoke to Reuters did not share potentially competitive information about who would be producing goods for them in South Africa or exactly where in the country.
But budget clothing and electronics retailer Pepkor did say it wants to work with existing and strategic suppliers to manufacture easy to make clothing like t-shirts and shorts and provide financial capital to buy machinery.
""We've now identified some vendors that we want to work with, now the next thing is to develop the further capacity for them,"" Pepkor CEO Leon Lourens told Reuters.
However, South Africa will not provide all the answers.
Industry has suffered in a country itself long blighted by power shortages and prone in some sectors to labour disputes, while raw materials such as fabrics are sourced by South African suppliers from Asia. 
Retailability's Drieselmann said that while it is looking to grow its local vendor base by placing more orders from local manufacturers instead of abroad, it is also shifting sourcing from China to other existing offshore suppliers.

The company has ""started to engage more actively with India as an alternative, particularly from a fabric sourcing perspective,"" Drieselmann added.

Investing.com – Trading in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) stock was up 27% by mid-session in Milan on Monday, after a friendly $12-billion offer from private equity giant KKR (NYSE:KKR).
The offer for Italy’s biggest phone company fueled a surge in the share prices of other European telcos, many of which trade at depressed valuations due to their limited profitability and heavy investment needs due to the rollout of 5G. BT in London (LON:BT) and KPN in Amsterdam (AS:KPN) were up around 3% each. ADRs of Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), Europe’s largest telecom operator, were up around 2%.
KKR has offered 50.5 euro cents per share, giving the company an enterprise value of 33 billion euro (around $37 billion). The stock currently trades at 44 cents. The non-binding offer is conditional on the government's backing and the outcome of a four-week due diligence analysis.
Italy's government has the power to block unwanted foreign interest in strategic companies. The country's s Treasury said on Sunday that the decision on whether to use those powers would hinge on plans for the network. 
Those powers have principally acted as a brake on the ambition of France's Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), which has accumulated a 24% stake in the company, albeit at a level more than twice what KKR is now offering.  
The Italian firm has issued two profit warnings in three months, prompting Vivendi to push to replace Chief Executive Luigi Gubitosi.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Malaysian budget airline AirAsia Group Bhd reported a wider quarterly net loss on Monday, as pandemic restrictions on travel in two of three of its operating markets weighed on revenue, while it logged a foreign exchange loss.
It said enhanced lockdowns and travel restrictions in Malaysia and Indonesia impacted its aviation revenue, although its Philippines unit had a strong quarter.
The group said in bourse filings it recorded a net loss of 887 million ringgit ($212 million) for the July-September quarter, 4.1% more compared with a loss of 851.8 million ringgit a year earlier.
Revenue for the period dropped 37% to 295.9 million ringgit. However, its logistics business Teleport tripled its revenue, contributing 53% to the group total revenue.
AirAsia's income statement filed to the stock exchange showed that a foreign exchange loss of 216.9 million ringgit further dragged its financial performance during the period.
The group said investments in technology, talent and network for its digital businesses and in Teleport also added to its losses.
The airline carried 351,971 passengers in the third quarter, 82% less than 1.9 million a year ago, while the load factor - which measures how full planes are - was little changed at 67%.
AirAsia said it has seen ""an upward trajectory of sales with the gradual recovery of travel"" since domestic travel reopened in the region.
""We expect the current sales momentum and reduced cashburn trend to continue into (the following quarter) as the Group is well positioned to serve the pent up leisure travel demand,"" it said.
It has also completed two rounds of renegotiation with lessors for lower lease rental in the future and expects to complete the renegotiations with all lessors by the end of the year. 
AirAsia maintained that it will have sufficient liquidity to sustain the business operations throughout 2021 and 2022.

Investing.com – Rivian stock (NASDAQ:RIVN) slipped 5% in Monday’s premarket trading after the company and Ford Motor called off their plan to jointly develop an electric vehicle.
Ford (NYSE:F) traded 0.4% higher premarket.
The two companies initially announced joint development of a Rivian-powered vehicle when Ford invested $500 million in the startup in 2019. Those plans, initially intended to be pursued under Ford’s luxury Lincoln brand, were dropped last year. At that time, Ford said the partners would look at other opportunities together. Those plans too are now shelved while Rivian is still to begin large-scale deliveries.
“When you compare today with when we originally made that investment, so much has changed: about our ability, about the brand’s direction in both cases, and now it’s more certain to us what we have to do,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told The Verge. “We want to invest in Rivian — we love their future as a company — but at this point, we’re going to develop our own vehicles.”
Ford holds around 12% stake in Rivian which debuted on the exchanges on November 11 and took just four trading sessions to catapult to the position of the world’s fourth largest automaker by market cap, behind only Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). Since then, the stock has lost around 57% of its value - but is still up around 66% from its IPO price.
Seeing the global shift towards EVs, Ford has doubled down on its commitment to EVs, striking new partnerships and putting in equity in startups while committing billions in investments. This includes setting up three factories for batteries and one to make electric versions of the F-series pickup. Ford expects 40% to 50% of its global vehicle volume to be fully electric by 2030.

SANGLI, India (Reuters) - For eight straight days, household goods salesman Vipresh Shah has failed to sell a single pack of Dettol soap to the storekeepers who have been buying from him ever since he took over his family business as a teenager, 14 years ago. 
Shah is an official distributor for Britain's Reckitt Benckiser in Vita, near Sangli city, around 200 miles south of Mumbai. But he said once-loyal customers now point to an app - JioMart Partner - on their smartphones showing prices up to 15% lower, instead of placing orders.
""As Reckitt's distributor, I used to be like a prince in the market,"" said Shah. ""Now the buyer tells me, 'See how much you've been ripping us off!'""
The 31-year-old said he lost $2,000 of his own money as he discounted products to match prices on JioMart, the app rolled out by Reliance Industries billionaire Mukesh Ambani in his drive to revolutionise retail https://reut.rs/3olTzsa distribution in India.
Up and down India in places like small town Vita, the mom-and-pop stores that account for four-fifths of a near-$900 billion retail market https://reut.rs/2OYLmMV - more than $700 billion - are increasingly turning to JioMart to stock up on foreign and domestic brands.
Just as Ambani, India's richest man, has disrupted the country's telecoms industry, the tycoon is intent on shaking up retail distribution, taking on U.S. e-commerce giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, expanding fast in India.
The country has around 450,000 traditional distributors, who have legions of salespeople to service every corner of the vast nation, including 600,000 villages. They typically earn a margin of 3-5% on product prices and mostly take orders physically once a week, making deliveries to retailers within a couple of days.
But Reliance's model throws a wrench in that supply chain: the mom-and-pop stores, known as 'kiranas', can order goods on JioMart Partner with deliveries promised within 24 hours. Reliance also offers training on ordering, credit facilities and free product samples for affiliated kiranas' customers.
That means hundreds of thousands of salesmen representing consumer giants like Reckitt, Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), face an existential threat to their business, according to interviews with salespeople, 20 distributors and a trader group with members across India.
Many of the distributors contacted by Reuters said they have slashed their workforce or vehicle fleet, seeing their sales from door-to-door agents drop 20-25% in the last year as shopkeepers partner with Reliance.
In Vita, salesman Shah said he has had to lay off half of his staff of four. He fears the 50-year-old family firm might not last beyond the next six months.
'GUERRILLA TACTICS'
The scale and speed of the disruption have triggered tensions between traditional distributors and Reliance that have boiled over into physical confrontation in some cases.
In Maharashtra state in the west - home to Vita - and Tamil Nadu in south, traditional salesmen have organised blockades of some JioMart delivery vehicles.
""We will employ guerrilla tactics,"" said Dhairyashil Patil, president of the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation, which represents 400,000 agents of local and foreign consumer firms. ""We will continue to agitate,"" he told Reuters, ""we want (consumer goods) companies to realise our value."" 
Reliance remains undeterred in pushing ahead with Ambani's ""new commerce"" retail venture, first announced in 2018.
Last year it raised funds from marquee investors including Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc as it seeks to integrate mom-and-pop stores in what it has touted as a more inclusive approach to digital commerce. That push is widely seen countering the likes of Amazon, which have for years faced - and denied - claims in India of favouring select big sellers at the expense of smaller retailers.
A source close to Reliance said the company was determined to keep expanding its business for mom-and-pop stores. It believes its model can co-exist alongside the traditional approach in one of the world's biggest retail markets, the person said, declining to be identified because of lack of authority to disclose company plans.
Ambani in 2018 said he eventually wanted to connect 30 million small merchants to the Reliance network. So far, it has 300,000 merchant partners in 150 cities who order consumer goods from Reliance, but the transformation will be magnified many times over if it meets a target of adding 10 million partner stores by 2024.
Reliance did not respond to requests for comment for this article. 
Colgate declined to comment, while Reckitt said its customers and distributors were an integral part of its business but it does not comment on its relationship with them. Unilever's India arm, Hindustan Unilever, did not respond to a request for comment.
WHICH CHANNEL?
The traditional distribution methods remain important to the consumer goods makers, even amid the disruption, industry watchers say.
Himanshu Bajaj, former Asia consumer and retail head at consulting firm Kearney, said CEOs of consumer firms he met in September raised concerns about Reliance's strategy upsetting the traditional distribution chain.
""The companies don't want to kill their own distributors. The worry is real,"" he said.
Asked about Reliance's model and concerns among distributors, Sunil D'Souza, CEO of India's Tata Consumer Products, told Reuters in an interview last month it ""can't afford to sit back and ignore"" any major distribution channel, but Tata was trying to minimise conflict and strike a balance.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in March estimated kiranas will ""steadily increase the share of procurement"" from Reliance ""at the cost of traditional distributors"". Such sales for Reliance could mushroom to $10.4 billion by 2025 from just $200 million in 2021-22, Jefferies estimates.
One executive who works for a rival to Reliance said Ambani ""was spreading his wings very fast"" in servicing kiranas and already has an edge on negotiating prices, due to long-standing relationships with consumer good makers which have for years counted Reliance and its 1,100 supermarkets as a big client. 
With kirana partners, Ambani is adding another, major vertical. ""Brands cannot afford to sideline Reliance, it's just their sheer purchasing power,"" said the executive, who declined to be identified as he wasn't authorised to speak with media.
ALL ABOUT PRICING
Many kiranas are cramped shops in ageing buildings, where branded products are placed on wooden shelves and small sachets dangle from the ceiling. Such retailers are embracing Reliance as a means to boost profit margins.
When Reuters accompanied Anuruddh Mishra, a sales agent for Colgate, during a field trip in Mumbai's Dharavi area, he struggled to convince Shivkumar Singh, the 50-year-old owner of a dilapidated store, to make purchases. Dharavi is home to 1 million people and rated one of the world's biggest slums. 
Singh opened his JioMart app and showed the far lower prices on offer. ""How can I order from traditional distributors?"" he said. ""The difference in price is huge. Now I order mostly from Reliance.""
A Reuters review of purchase deals on the JioMart Partner app showed the Dharavi retailer could bulk buy a two-tube combo of Colgate MaxFresh toothpaste for about 115 rupees ($1.55). Salesman Mishra's distribution company gets it for 145 rupees, and his last offer to the Dharavi retailer was 154 rupees - still more than a third higher than the Reliance price.
Back in Sangli, traditional distributors said they have at times chased down Reliance vehicles and confronted drivers, alleging unauthorised deliveries.
Sunil Pujari, who works in the city for one JioMart delivery agent, said he had been warned by his supervisors to immediately alert them if angry distributors stopped vehicles.

But business remains brisk. 
""Prices offered by JioMart cannot be matched by anyone,"" he said, making another delivery in a crowded market.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 05:01AM ET</span>","Tencent boosts Prosus profit, e-commerce trading loss widens","By Toby Sterling and Promit Mukherjee
AMSTERDAM/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Prosus (OTC:PROSF), which owns a $175 billion minority stake in Chinese internet gaming and social media group Tencent, posted an 8% rise in first-half trading profit to $2.9 billion as revenue rose rapidly in its overall portfolio.
Sometimes compared to SoftBank and its Vision Fund, Prosus NV, owns stakes in a wide range of consumer internet companies, with returns from Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) dominating its overall performance. 
Although its net profit spiked after Prosus booked a one-time profit of $12.3 billion on the sale of part of its Tencent stake, operating losses at businesses it controls increased.
Prosus said in a statement on Monday that revenues at its e-commerce portfolio had risen by 53% to $4.2 billion, while that segment's trading loss increased to $372 million from a loss of $214 million in the same period a year ago. 
The e-commerce portfolio, which does not include returns from its holding in Tencent, spans a group of businesses that Prosus either owns or controls in classified advertising, food delivery, educational technology and fintech and payments.
Prosus estimated the market value of the e-commerce businesses at around $49 billion. 
It showed better profitability in its classifieds businesses, and strong growth at its food delivery businesses, which includes iFood in Brazil and Swiggy in India.
The figures were in line with indications the company had given in a Nov. 16 pre-announcement.
Bob Van Dijk, the Prosus CEO, said he did not expect China's recent moves to crack down on large technology firms to impact future earnings negatively.
""In spite of some regulation coming up ... Tencent is in my view the best-positioned internet company in the most attractive internet market in the world,"" he told reporters on a call.

In August, Prosus set up a cross-holding structure with Naspers, under which Prosus shareholders own 60% of their underlying assets but Naspers retains control. They share a single board.
In its separate earnings report, Naspers, South Africa's largest company by market capitalization, posted half-year revenue of $17.2 billion, up 29% from a year ago.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 04:41AM ET</span>",Some Chinese banks told to issue more loans for property projects - sources,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Some Chinese banks have been told by financial regulators to issue more loans to property firms for project development, two banking sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Monday, in efforts to marginally ease liquidity strains across the industry.
Chinese authorities have yet to publicly give any signal that they will relax the ""three red lines"" - financial requirements introduced by the central bank last year that developers must meet to get new bank loans.
But lenders have recently adjusted their lending practices to reflect the latest central bank guidance of ""meeting the normal financing needs"" of the sector.
The marginal relaxation of loan policies to developers will still stick to the major principle that ""homes are for living in, not for speculation,"" said the sources, one from a city commercial bank and the other from a big bank, who received the guidance from regulators.
Financial regulators have told the banks to specifically accelerate approval of loans to develop projects, and to ensure that outstanding loans to project development show positive growth in their loan books in November compared with October, the two sources said. 
Both sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As of end-September, banks' outstanding loans to project development stood at 12.16 trillion yuan ($1.91 trillion), up by 0.02% from a year earlier, central bank data showed. 
Quarterly growth of this loan type slowed further from the second quarter by 2.8 percentage points, the data showed. 
The real estate sub-index of the Chinese mainland's blue chip index jumped nearly 5% on Friday following market rumours about potential relaxation of property loans. 
The sub-index ended down 4% on Monday.
China will stand firm on policies to curb excess borrowing by property developers even as it makes financial tweaks to help home buyers and meet reasonable demand, bankers told Reuters previously.
Some banks have accelerated disbursement of approved home loans in some cities, the bankers said.
Last month, central bank official Zou Lan said there had been ""misunderstanding"" among lenders about the PBOC's debt-control policies, causing financial strains for some developers.

""Banks should have supported new projects reasonably after (developers) have repaid existing loans,"" Zou said.

Investing.com – Activision Blizzard stock (NASDAQ:ATVI) traded nearly 3% higher in Monday’s premarket on a report in The Wall Street Journal that Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick has hinted at leaving the company if he can't quickly resolve issues surrounding allegations of sexual misconduct by senior staff.
Kotick, who has led the video games publisher for three decades, has faced criticism from employees, investors and other stakeholders for not doing enough to address the allegations for years. He is himself accused of mistreating women.
The company behind the 'Call of Duty' franchise and Candy Crush faces a lawsuit in California alleging discrimination against women. The stock has fallen around 30% since the July lawsuit was filed.
Last week, according to reports in Bloomberg and The WSJ, senior officials at Sony and Microsoft, Activision’s largest and fourth-largest customers respectively, wrote to their own staff to express their strong displeasure of the way Activision Blizzard had handled cases of sexual misconduct.
The allegations have led to the exit of at least 20 staff, according to a recent statement by Activision. The company has created an $18 million fund to compensate victims of inappropriate behavior, the statement said.

Embattled property developer China Evergrande's electric vehicle (EV) unit said on Friday it would issue about 900 million shares, or 8.3% of the enlarged capital, at HK$3 apiece through a top-up placement.
The new shares are priced at a 15% discount to their Friday's close of HK$3.53.
Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer which has been stumbling from debt-repayment deadline to deadline as it grapples with more than $300 billion in liabilities, said last month it plans to give future priority to its electric vehicles business over real estate.
In a filing late on Friday, Evergrande New Energy Vehicle said it intends use the proceeds on the research and development and production of its new energy vehicles, paving the way for putting the cars into production.
The EV unit has already done a top-up placement earlier this month, raising HK$500 million ($64.17 million) by issuing 174.8 million shares at HK$2.86 a piece.
Evergrande's total holdings in the EV unit will drop to 58.54% from 63.84% after the new fundraising. 
The unit is seeking Chinese regulatory approval to sell its inaugural Hengchi 5 sport-utility vehicles, as the embattled company vows to start making cars early next year.

Shares of Evergrande Group declined 1.1%, while Hang Seng Index eased 0.4%.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Ericsson on Monday agreed to buy cloud communications firm Vonage in a $6.2 billion all-cash deal, as the telecom gear maker moves to broaden its 5G portfolio.
The deal, one of the largest in Ericsson (BS:ERICAs)'s history, follows its $1.1 billion purchase of Cradlepoint last year which gave it access to tools that can connect devices using the so-called Internet of Things over a 4G or 5G network.
U.S-based Vonage makes Application Programming  Interface  (NASDAQ:TILE) (API), which helps different software communicate with each other. 
""Vonage is complementary to what we have built in enterprise so far ... Cradlepoint was one of the big stepping stones as well in building an enterprise presence,"" Ericsson CFO Carl Mellander told Reuters.
Ericsson will pay $21 for each outstanding Vonage share, a 28% premium to Friday's closing price and a 34% premium to the average of the last 3 months, a price analysts said was high. 
Ericsson shares fell 3.8% in early trade, on track for their worst day since July and the worst performer on the pan-European STOXX 600 index.
""We see this acquisition as strengthening Ericsson's vertical integration and product offering within the cloud space, but we also deem the price-tag quite steep,"" said Danske Bank Credit Research analyst Mads Rosendal. 
Vonage, which operates across sectors such as healthcare, finance, education and transportation, had sales of $1.4 billion in the 12-month period to Sept. 30, 2021, with a margin on adjusted earnings before interest, tax and depreciation of 14% and free cash flow of $109 million.
It has more than 1 million registered developers and more than 120,000 business customers.
""That's where magic happens when developers use the Vonage platform to create applications for various enterprises,"" Mellander said.
The acquisition marks a new phase after a period of restructuring and refocusing since Borje Ekholm took over as CEO in 2017. 
Ericsson had branched out into multi-media in the early 2000s but struggled to fit its purchases into its operations, weighing on margins and profits.
""The transaction builds upon Ericsson's stated intent to expand globally in wireless enterprise, offering existing customers an increased share of a market valued at $700 billion by 2030,"" Ericsson said in a statement.

It said it expected the Vonage deal to boost earnings per share - excluding non-cash amortisation impacts - and free cash flow from 2024 onwards. 
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to Vonage shareholder approval, regulatory approvals, and other conditions.

The move, likely the first such announced by a financial institution in the city, comes as the Asian financial hub's COVID-19 measures, some of the strictest in the world, are said to hurt businesses.
It comes after Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, visited Hong Kong last week for 32 hours after he was given a government exemption from quarantine.
The memo said staff at the executive director level and below would be entitled to the one-off payment for a single quarantine stay in Hong Kong.
The program will run from December 1 to November 2022 and is for staff returning from visiting immediate family members overseas, the memo said.
""We recognize that the costly quarantine measures in place in Hong Kong associated with COVID-19 have impacted many of you with respect to visiting family and loved ones overseas,"" the memo said. 
A JPMorgan spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo, which was first reported by the South China Morning Post on Monday.
Hong Kong's current rules stipulate returning residents and visitors from most countries must spend two to three weeks in hotel quarantine paid for by themselves. 
The Chinese-ruled city has registered barely any new infections in recent months but the government is keeping strict rules in place and closed borders.
Hong Kong has recorded 12,402 cases during the pandemic while the double dosed vaccination rate stands at 66.8% , according to a government website.

Tight rules have been hitting Hong Kong's largest businesses, and financial lobby groups have urged the government to consider relaxing some of the quarantine measures.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, as M&A speculation helped to the market start the new week on a positive tone and shrug off the return of Covid-induced restrictions to the continent.  
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France also rose 0.4% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.4%.
The major equity indices in Europe have shown strength of late, boosted by strong corporate earnings and helped by the European Central Bank resisting the temptation to join a growing list of central banks that are tightening monetary policy. That has pushed the euro to its lowest in 16 months against the dollar and its lowest in 21 months against the pound.
Investors will be studying the return of Covid-19 restrictions to the region, with Austria starting its fourth national lockdown since the start of the pandemic. 
This move is meant to put a brake on infections before mandatory vaccinations kick in from February. That would be the first such policy in Europe, where governments have mostly kept inoculations voluntary.  
Neighboring Germany also refused to rule out a lockdown on Friday, while the likes of Ireland and the Netherlands have encouraged working from home in order to try and contain the spread of the virus.
If the whole of Europe is forced into these extreme restrictions once more, investors would have to rethink growth scenarios and expectations for fourth-quarter earnings.
In the corporate sector,  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) stock soared 24% after the company confirmed over the weekend that it has received a 10.8 billion euro ($12 billion) approach from U.S. fund KKR aimed at taking Italy's biggest phone group private. Other incumbent telecoms also rose, with BT Group (LON:BT) stock rising 3.2% and  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) stock rising 4.1%. Dutch-based Koninklijke KPN (AS:KPN) stock rose 2.4%.
On the flip side, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) stock fell 3.4% after the Swedish mobile telecoms equipment maker agreed to buy cloud communications firm Vonage (NASDAQ:VG) for $6.2 billion.   Marks & Spencer stock rose 3.5% to a fresh 2 1/2-year high after a report suggesting that private equity firm Apollo Global Management  (NYSE:APO) may be preparing a bid for it.
In earnings news,  Julius Baer  (SIX:BAER) stock fell around 4% after the Swiss bank reported a reduction in its gross margin, reflecting a softening in client activity from exceptionally high levels witnessed last year.
Crude prices edged higher Monday, recovering to a degree from the sharp selloff at the end of last week.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signalled on Saturday he was open to exploring a way to release oil from the country’s strategic reserves, joining a group of top consumers following a request from the U.S. last week.

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>",COVID comeback threatens fresh setback for European market bulls,"By Julien Ponthus and Yoruk Bahceli
LONDON (Reuters) -COVID-19 lockdowns have returned anew to haunt Europe's economic prospects, forcing investors on Friday to reassess portfolios and sell vulnerable assets such as the euro and bank stocks.
Days after the Netherlands, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic reimposed curbs, Austria put itself back under lockdown and Germany's health minister refused to rule out one.
Markets were little soothed by Germany's foreign minister ruling out a lockdown and mandatory vaccinations for all to tabloid Bild. 
The developments upended the buoyant mood in European equity markets where French and German shares had hit a string of record highs, thanks to a strong earnings recovery.
A pan-European equity index, up 80% from March 2020, slipped half a percent on Friday.
""One thing is certain, if the whole of Europe had to go under lockdown once more, and depending on how long that would last, we would need to rethink our growth scenarios,"" said Stephane Ekolo, a global equity strategist at the brokerage Tradition.
As markets started scaling back wagers on euro zone interest rate rises for next year, an index of European banks plunged 2.5%, its biggest daily drop since late September.
The question now is to what extent lockdowns might hammer expectations for fourth-quarter earnings. Refinitiv I/B/E/S currently flags a 51% rise for the STOXX 600 benchmark, only marginally below 60% in Q3.
It still compares favourably with predictions of a 21% earnings growth for S&P 500 companies.
But some ominous signs had emerged for Europe even before the latest COVID resurgence. European data lags U.S. equivalents by the biggest margin in over a year, according to economic surprise indexes compiled by Citi.
Hospitality turnover was also weakening, Oxford Economics pointed out, noting Germany's 3.5% drop in September.
""Markets have been aware for a few weeks now that this winter will be difficult and that the vaccination rollout doesn't reduce lockdown risk by 100%,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The setback, if it deepens, will prove painful to many. BofA's widely followed monthly investor survey showed funds most bullish on euro zone equities, with a 33% ""overweight"" and EU banks especially in favour.
Cau says it is too early to see the lockdowns as a gamechanger and that investors are booking profits off recent sizzling rallies. And deeply negative inflation-adjusted bond yields probably means that the tsunami of cash chasing global stocks will not ebb entirely. 
And there will be winners: healthcare stocks rose 1% on Friday, while the technology sector gained 0.6%.
BUND BOOST
Investors made a beeline for bonds, turning Germany's entire yield curve negative for the first time since August as 30-year government borrowing costs fell below 0%.
Ten-year yields, the euro area benchmark, dropped as much as 6 basis points to the lowest since mid-September at -0.342%. 
The euro tumbled to more than six-year lows versus the Swiss franc and approached 16-month troughs against the greenback.
""It's just building, that story of the pandemic not being quite over in Europe and that's a knee-jerk flight to quality,"" said Peter McCallum, rates strategist at Mizuho.
""The more that becomes a theme and we get the market thinking about a dovish ECB....we've got some room to fill the (10-year Bund yield) gap down to -0.45%,"" he added.
Some market watchers are starting to look beyond Europe.

 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) noted that on the cusp of winter, vaccination rates in Austria and Germany at 64% and 69% were well above the U.S. 58% level.
""Although all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the United States be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter?"" the bank wrote.

Markets have suddenly woken up to COVID-19 risks, and after Austria imposed 10-days of nationwide restrictions to fight the winter virus wave, investors swiftly shifted to lockdown trading mode.
Oil hit 7-week lows in Asia hours, and equities in Europe look set for a muted start after clocking on Friday their first weekly decline in seven weeks, as bond yields and banking stocks tanked. The euro is also under pressure at 16-month lows.
Concerns are that Germany and other countries could follow suit, forcing million of people to stay at home, hitting tourism-dependent economies and outdoor businesses just before key Christmas holidays and spending.
Little wonder then that Italian and Spanish stocks look particularly vulnerable at this stage, while Big Tech and online economy names are once again in favour, sending Nasdaq futures to new record highs overnight.
Shares in vaccine makers meantime could also benefit. German politicians are debating making COVID-19 vaccinations compulsory, and other countries are also pondering what to do with the unvaccinated.

On the corporate front, eyes are on  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) after KKR made a $12 billion approach to take the Italian phone group private. Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) is also on the watch-list after the equipment agreed to buy cloud communications firm Vonage for $6.2 billion.

Its core headline earnings per share, which strips out gains or losses from non-operational items, stood at 416 U.S. cents, versus the 376 cents per share posted a year earlier. 
Naspers, Africa's biggest company by market capitalisation, has parked all its international assets, including its Tencent stake, in its Amsterdam-listed subsidiary Prosus (OTC:PROSF) NV, in which it holds a 57% stake.
Naspers, through Prosus, has investments spread across a multitude of online businesses including classified ads, food delivery, payments and education in countries from Brazil to India to China as well as in many parts of Europe. 
However, most bring minimal revenue gains and are overshadowed by profits generated by its Tencent stake.
Its e-commerce portfolio excluding Tencent started showing signs of rapid growth from last year.
""Our progress is reflected in the increasing value attributed to our ecommerce portfolio and, to capture the significant opportunity ahead, we stepped up investment in our core segments,"" Chief executive Bob van Dijk said in a statement. 

Naspers, which also owns media house Media24 and e-commerce company takealot.com in South Africa, posted half-year revenue of $17.2 billion, up 29% from a year ago.
E-commerce revenues grew 52% to $4.6 billion, outpacing revenue growth at Tencent, although the e-commerce portfolio as a whole posted a loss of $374 million.

1526,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 01:58AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Higher; Telecom Italia in Spotlight After Approach,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Monday, starting a new week on a positive tone despite the return of Covid-induced restrictions to the continent.  
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
The major equity indices in Europe have shown strength of late, boosted by strong corporate earnings and helped by the European Central Bank retaining a dovish monetary policy stance.
This strength could be tested Monday following the return of Covid-19 restrictions, with Austria starting its fourth national lockdown since the start of the pandemic. 
The lockdown is meant to put a brake on infections before mandatory vaccinations kick in from February. That would be the first such policy in Europe, where governments have mostly kept inoculations voluntary.  
Neighboring Germany also refused to rule out a lockdown on Friday, while the likes of Ireland and the Netherlands have encouraged working from home in order to try and contain the spread of the virus.
Still, the reemergence of the virus is likely to add weight to European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde’s view that tightening policy now could choke off the region’s economic recovery.
The central bank has been under increasing pressure to tighten its ultra-loose monetary policy to offset rising price pressures, especially after Eurozone inflation surged 4.1% year-on-year in October, more than twice the ECB's target.
Turning to the quarterly corporate earnings season, Swiss bank  Julius Baer  (SIX:BAER) reported that its profitability rose ""significantly"" in the first 10 months of 2021, boosted by buoyant markets and new money inflows.
Elsewhere, the telecoms sector will be in focus after  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) stated over the weekend that it has received a 10.8 billion euro ($12 billion) approach from U.S. fund KKR aimed at taking Italy's biggest phone group private.
Additionally, mobile telecoms equipment maker Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) said it had agreed to buy cloud communications firm Vonage for $6.2 billion.   
Crude prices weakened Monday, continuing the sharp selloff at the end of last week as Japan joined a group of top consumers considering adding supply to the market following a request from the United States late last week.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida signalled on Saturday he was ready to help combat soaring oil prices by exploring a way to release oil from the country’s strategic reserves. 
At the same time, demand could take a hit as a soaring number of Covid cases in Europe prompted further restrictions.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $75.84 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $78.66. Both benchmarks hit their lowest levels since the start of October earlier in the session, having fallen around 3% on Friday. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,843.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1268.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 01:01AM ET</span>","No stranger to turmoil, Dutch dealmaker Wynaendts set for Deutsche chair","By Tom Sims and Frank Siebelt
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -As head of Dutch insurer Aegon (NYSE:AEG), Alexander Wynaendts led a complex European financial institution with staff around the world and a large U.S. presence during a turbulent decade, experience that should serve him well as the next chair of Germany's  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
On Friday, a committee of Deutsche Bank's supervisory board nominated Wynaendts https://www.reuters.com/article/deutsche-bank-chair-idCAKBN2I41SQ to oversee Germany's largest lender from next year. The full board backed him at a meeting on Sunday, and shareholders will vote on his appointment in May.
If elected, the position will catapult Wynaendts, who is relatively unknown in Germany, into a role as one of the country's top bankers at a time when Deutsche is also steadying itself after a rocky decade with a view to a possible future merger.
Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer, in a note to staff on Sunday dislosing the full board's support for Wynaendts, called the Dutchman a true European and expert in international finance.
""Alex has experience in the fields that always made Deutsche Bank stand out: strong expertise in retail, corporate and capital markets business as well as in asset management – and a global network,"" Sewing said in the memo, which was seen by Reuters.
Just months into his tenure at Aegon, a company that in the mid-19th century helped the Dutch pay for funerals, Wynaendts, 61, navigated a 3 billion euro ($3.39 billion) state bailout and restructuring as the 2008 financial crisis took its toll. 
Deutsche has lost billions of euros and faced huge fines, leaving regulators fearing it was on the brink of collapse five years ago. Although it has started reaping small profits under new leadership, there remains plenty of unfinished business. 
The bank is currently working on a new strategy plan to be presented in March and has yet to make good on a promise to shed 18,000 jobs, while analysts say it is at risk of missing a key profitability target next year.
A major question for the wider industry is the consolidation of Europe's fragmented banks. Deutsche executives says they are working to make the lender strong for a potential future tie-up after it called off talks to merge with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in 2019.
Wynaendts - who oversaw a steady stream of acquisitions, disposals and partnerships from Canada to Mexico and Romania to China during a decade as the head of Aegon - is expected to embrace the strategy. 
Aegon was involved in 87 M&A deals from 2012 through 2020, based on Refinitiv data. 
He will also be well aware of the challenges of low interest rates and volatile markets, which hit Aegon's capital position near the end of his time at the company. Aegon's shares fell sharply during his tenure due to the financial crisis and the pandemic.
Wynaendts would take over from Austrian Paul Achleitner, another former insurance executive who previously worked at Allianz (DE:ALVG), when he steps down in May. Achleitner is credited with installing current CEO Christian Sewing to help turn the bank around after a number of management reshuffles during his decade at the helm. 

Separately, Deutsche announced on Sunday that it had filled the role of chief risk officer, poaching Olivier Vigneron from France's Natixis.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2021 11:01PM ET</span>","Australian tycoon to help small publishers strike deals with Google, Facebook","By Byron Kaye and Renju Jose
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian small publishers will get a leg up in their fight to secure licensing deals with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the country's richest person said his philanthropic organisation would seek a collective bargaining arrangement for them.
The Minderoo Foundation, owned by Andrew Forrest, chairman of iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY), plans to help 18 small publishers by applying to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) on their behalf so they can negotiate together without breaching competition laws.
The move was welcomed by publishers including the Star Observer, Australia's oldest LGBTQ title, which like some other small publishers did not get a deal with Facebook despite having secured a deal with Google.
Forrest's extra clout as well as the differing approaches to small publishers by Google and Facebook could build momentum for the Australian government to intervene and set fees.
Australia broke new ground with a law that has since March required the two tech giants to negotiate with Australian outlets for content that drives traffic and advertising to their websites.
But while most major news providers have secured deals, many small publishers have been left out in the cold, criticising Facebook in particular for its reluctance to take their calls.
Other publications that have secured deals with Google but not Facebook include TV broadcaster SBS, the main source of foreign language news, and the Conversation, which publishes public affairs commentary by academics. 
The ACCC Chair Rod Sims has also on several occasions expressed concern about whether Facebook is approaching the law in the right spirit.
The law allows for Australia's government to set fees if negotiations between tech giants and news providers fail, but at present rejected companies have been left with little recourse as they wait for the government to review the law next March as planned.
The 18 small publishers being helped include online publications that attract multicultural audiences and focus on issues at a local or regional level, Emma McDonald, director of Frontier Technology, a Minderoo Foundation initiative, said in a statement. 
Google reiterated that ""talks are continuing with publishers of all sizes."" Facebook said it ""has long supported smaller independent publishers.""

The foundation's move comes after ACCC late last month allowed a body representing 261 radio stations to negotiate a content deal.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Monday morning. However, parts of Europe implemented restrictive measures to curb the continent’s latest COVID-19 outbreak, and investors are also calculating the risk that the U.S. Federal Reserve will speed up asset tapering.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.30% by 9:13 PM ET (2:13 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.07%, with the Bank of Korea due to hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.50% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.10%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.41% while the Shenzhen Component was gained 0.53%, with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) keeping its one-year loan prime rate unchanged at 3.85% earlier in the day. The yuan also remains in focus after PBOC advisor Liu Shijin warned that the Chinese economy could enter a period of “quasi-stagflation” at Sunday’s China Macroeconomy Forum.
Soaring numbers of COVID-19 cases in Europe forced Austria into a full lockdown starting on Monday and Germany to tighten restrictive measures.
U.S. Treasuries trimmed a rally, with the gap between yields on five-year and 30-year maturities near the lowest since March 2020, over concerns that the Fed could accelerate the drawdown of its bond-buying program.
Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Governor Christopher Waller, and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard have all indicated that speeding up the pace of asset tapering could be discussed at the central bank’s next meeting in December.
“What we are likely to see this week is more Fed members socializing that idea of a more rapid QE taper,” Prestige Economics president and chief economist Jason Schenker told Bloomberg.
“If that idea gets out there and is repeatedly underscored, that will increase the probability that the tapering that’s announced in December will be quicker than the pace that was announced early in November,” he added
Despite worries over the rising number of COVID-19 cases as winter begins in the northern hemisphere, and high inflation prompting central banks to tighten monetary policy, global shares remain near record levels overall.
On the data front, the U.S. and the eurozone will release their purchasing managers’ indexes on Tuesday. Further data from the U.S., including the Fed minutes from its latest meeting, GDP, and initial jobless claims, will be released on Wednesday ahead of Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday."
1530,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2021 08:45PM ET</span>","China property bonds score strong weekly bounce, Evergrande misses out","LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese property firms saw their battered bonds cement a strong weekly bounce on Friday, although there was one notable absentee from the rally: China Evergrande Group.
A flurry of asset sales and share placings, including some from Evergrande itself, has sparked hopes this week that the heavily-indebted sector will be able to avoid a full-blown crisis and finally stabilise. 
Friday's gainers included China's top property developer Country Garden, whose bonds were nearly back to par, or 100 cents on the dollar, having tumbled to around 80 cents last week in a sector-wide slide. 
Shimao was also a notable rebounder. Its bonds completed a yo-yo back up to 90 cents having plunged to around 70 last week in a breakneck fall capped when S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) stripped it of its prized investment grade credit rating.
Market watchers put the rebound down to relief that firms have been able to raise money via share placing and asset sales this week, even if they have had to offer deep discounts to get the deals done. 
Country Garden Services Holdings, the property services unit of China's top developer, raised $1 billion on Thursday from share placings, two sources told Reuters.
Sunac China, among the top four developers in the country, raised a total of $949.70 million, while Evergrande also struck a deal to sell its entire stake in streaming services firm HengTen for HK$2.13 billion ($273.5 million).
Despite the gains elsewhere, though, Evergrande's bonds have remained rooted at between 23 and 29 cents on the dollar this week - a 71%-77% mark down from their value back in May when the Chinese property sector's troubles first began to snowball.

S&P cautioned this week that Evergande, the world's most indebted developer with around $19 billion of international market bonds and $300 billion of liabilities altogether, was still ""highly likely"" to default as it has $3.5 billion to repay in March and April next year alone.

In a meeting on Friday with executives of the video game publisher’s Blizzard Entertainment unit, Kotick stopped short of saying he would step down, but left it open if misconduct issues at the company weren’t fixed quickly, the people quoted told WSJ.
Activision Blizzard did not respond to a Reuters request for comment outside business hours.
The move comes after some employees at the company staged a walkout last Tuesday after a Wall Street Journal report https://on.wsj.com/30IoWoL stated that Kotick knew about allegations of sexual harassment and assault earlier than previously reported. 
The comments on Friday by Kotick were part of a series of internal meetings across Activision last week, in which he and other members of the leadership team met with employees to reaffirm their commitment to a healthy workplace, the Journal reported quoting people familiar with the meetings.
Kotick held meetings last week with senior leaders from two of Activision’s units, Activision Publishing and Blizzard Entertainment, WSJ reported, adding top executives of Activision Publishing relayed to Kotick in an online meeting that some employees would not be satisfied unless he stepped down. 

Activision has been facing mounting pressure in recent months of allegations from employees of equal pay violations, sexual discrimination and sexual misconduct. The company said it had fired more than 20 employees following allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination last month.
The allegations at the company have also led to delays in launch of products and exit of top executives.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2021 07:25PM ET</span>",KKR makes $12 billion approach to take Telecom Italia private,"By Elvira Pollina, Valentina Za and Pamela Barbaglia
MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) has received a 10.8 billion euro ($12 billion) approach from U.S. fund KKR aimed at taking Italy's biggest phone group private, the company said on Sunday.
KKR's move comes as TIM's CEO Luigi Gubitosi battles for survival after coming under fire from top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) following two profit warnings in three months.
TIM said KKR had set an indicative price of 0.505 euros for its possible buyout offer -- a 45.7% premium to the ordinary shares' closing price on Friday. KKR would also offer the same price for TIM's savings shares.
The TIM board, chaired by former Bank of Italy official Salvatore Rossi, met for several hours on Sunday afternoon but in a short statement it gave no indication of whether it would support the approach. It noted that KKR had termed its action as ""friendly"" and aimed at winning the backing of the company and of the government.
Italy's Treasury said foreign interest in Italian companies was ""positive news for the country"" and the market would assess how valid KKR's plan is were it to materialise.
The government will closely follow developments with a focus on plans for TIM's fixed-line assets, which would be key in determining whether it uses its veto powers.
Rome has special anti-takeover powers to shield companies deemed of strategic importance from foreign bids. 
A new owner would also have to assume TIM's 29 billion euro gross debt.
CARVE OUT
Gubitosi brought KKR onboard last year in a 1.8 billion euro deal that handed the New York-based fund a 37.5% stake in FiberCop, the unit holding TIM's last-mile network connecting street cabinets to people's homes.
KKR's plan would see TIM carve out its fixed network to be run as a government-regulated asset along the model used by energy grid company Terna or gas grid firm Snam, two sources close to the matter said earlier on Sunday.
The government wants any plans for TIM's grid to be in line with the goal of rapidly completing broadband rollout across Italy, supported by adequate investments, and protecting jobs, the Treasury said in its statement.
Gubitosi has started looking at ways to squeeze money out of TIM's assets, revisiting in particular a plan to merge TIM's fixed-line grid - its most prized asset - with that of fibre optic rival Open Fiber.
Sponsored by the previous government, that project had run aground under Prime Minister Mario Draghi.
Rome, preparing to tap billions of euros of European Union recovery funds to boost broadband connectivity in Italy, is aware of the need to find a way to shore up the former telecoms monopoly and protect its 42,500 domestic workers.
PRICE ""TOO LOW""
Vivendi, which is pushing to replace Gubitosi, believes KKR's offer does not adequately value TIM, a person close the French media group said. 
Vivendi, which faces a steep capital loss on its 24% TIM stake after paying on average 1.071 euros a share, remains ready to work alongside Italy's authorities and institutions for TIM's long-term success, a spokesperson said.
Vivendi sees Gubitosi as a short-term solution for TIM, people close to the matter have said. One person said on Sunday KKR's plan may buy Gubitosi a few more months. 
Private equity firms CVC and Advent have also studied possible plans for TIM, working with former TIM CEO Marco Patuano, now a senior adviser to Nomura in Italy.
A spokesperson for the two funds said they were open to working with all stakeholders on a solution to strengthen TIM, denying any contacts with Vivendi.
To oversee a strategic asset such as the fixed line, state investor CDP has taken a 9.8% stake becoming TIM's second-largest investor after Vivendi.
TIM's fixed network is also a key asset supporting the debt burden which was cut further below the investment grade level by credit rating agency S&P on Friday.

TIM's revenue have shrunk by a fifth over the past five years hit by aggressive competition at home from rivals such as Iliad, Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), Wind Tre and Fastweb.

1533,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2021 05:15PM ET</span>",Move to hinterland triggers brain drain at Korea's mega pension fund,"By Cynthia Kim, Jihoon Lee and Yena Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - Earlier this year, Lee left her fund management job at South Korea's national pension fund, the world's third-largest, fed up with long commutes between her home in Seoul and her office in Jeonju, 200 kilometers away.
For four years, Lee lived in a studio apartment in Jeonju, a city of 658,000, on weekdays, and traveled back to Seoul for the weekend. She feared her family would break up if she didn't make the hard decision to quit. 
Lee is one of some 140 money managers who has left the 930.5 trillion won ($788 billion) National Pension Service since 2016, shortly before it moved to Jeonju, a sleepy provincial capital, as part of the government's relocation of major agencies away from the capital Seoul.
That is almost half the 320 currently working at the fund's investment arm, an alarming brain drain for the main public retirement plan of Asia's fourth-largest economy and a major investor in Korean blue-chips such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and Hyundai Motor Co..
""Staying in Jeonju for the weekdays, I felt I was missing out on so much of my life, I couldn't stand it anymore and decided to head up to Seoul,"" said Lee, who now works for an asset manager based in Seoul's financial district and agreed to be identified only by her surname.
With assets valued at nearly half the nation's gross domestic product, the NPS manages pensions for private sector workers and self-employed South Koreans.
A massive wave of retirements due in coming years in the world's fastest aging society has raised the stakes for management at the fund.
Over the past five years, however, the NPS has only filled 57% of jobs it opened.
An NPS official said that partly reflects the greater number of openings as the fund grows investments but acknowledged the issues around the relocation.
""Although it has stabilised a lot compared to before our relocation to Jeonju, the issue regarding manpower seems to have re-emerged because we recently increased job openings in a large scale which seemingly pushed up the relative vacancy rate,"" the official told Reuters in response to queries.
""As our overseas investment expands, so are opportunities to work abroad, and efforts are being made to motivate talent to stay in service by improving working conditions, and we also have talent development programmes.""
To plug staff shortages, it removed the mandatory one-year work experience requirement for the first time from its job postings in September and began offering opportunities to work abroad, even to domestic equity fund managers.
The NPS's annualised investment return for 2020 was 9.7%, below 25.15% for Japan's GPIF in fiscal 2020 and 20.4% at Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.
That partly reflects the more conservative nature of its investments, fund managers say, which also means it is less exposed during downturns.
However, the NPS now plans to expand its overseas investment allocations to 50% by 2024 from 34% in 2019.
It has 30 staff across branches in New York, London and Singapore as of 2020, far fewer than the 351 staff at Canada's CPPIB and 252 at Norway's NBIM in their various overseas offices, 2020 data from the NPS shows.
More ambitious returns would demand a deeper pool of investment talent, which has become harder to attract and retain since the relocation in 2017.
""When I was a manager there about eight to 10 applicants used to compete for one fund manager position, after we screened out inexperienced ones, and that's when the fund's pay level was even lower,"" said Hong Chun-uk, who resigned from a senior fund manager position at the NPS in 2015.
He left the fund after it announced its relocation and has since become an economist at Seoul-based brokerage.
BIG MONEY, SMALL TOWN
The NPS is one of about 150 state agencies and public corporations that have moved out of Seoul since 2005, with another batch of about 100 institutions, including part of the National Assembly, also planned for relocation.
The major shift was part of a government plan to decentralise economic and political power away from Seoul, ease congestion in the capital and develop regional cities.
The struggle to fill roles at the fund has fueled debate over the merits of relocating crucial public institutions.
Two fund managers who left the NPS said the brain drain issue hasn't adversely affected the fund's performance yet but pension experts say it will. 
""In Korea, there's strong preference to live in the capital Seoul, among families, for schools and lifestyle,"" Yun Suk-myung, head of the Korean Pension Association said. ""Obviously the political push ignored that and having inexperienced, incompetent fundies will eventually hurt its investment returns.""

For many fund managers used to a certain standard of urban living, Jeonju has its limitations.
""There is one popular restaurant I went to often and I used to meet my boss and folks from other teams all there,"" Lee said. ""Everyone at the NPS kind of expects colleagues to be around the town.""

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - The box office ain't afraid of no ghosts.
""Ghostbusters: Afterlife,"" a sequel to the sci-fi comedy classic, collected $44 million in its opening weekend, a better-than-expected result. It's a sign that family audiences are willing to visit their local movie theater, provided there's something broadly entertaining to be found there.
At the international box office, ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" earned $16 million from 31 overseas markets, pushing its worldwide total to $60 million. The latest installment in the decades-old franchise is looking like a win after the studio failed to revive the supernatural series years earlier. It should be noted that  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s 2016 all-female reboot of ""Ghostbuster"" opened to $46 million, $2 million more than ""Afterlife."" However that film cost $144 million -- compared to ""Afterlife's"" $75 million budget -- making the earlier version a box office dud. 
But despite rapturous reviews and Oscar buzz, the Warner Bros. sports drama ""King Richard"" became the latest adult-oriented drama to crumble at the box office. The film, starring Will Smith as the father of tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams, eked out a meager $5.7 million from 3,302 venues in North America. It may be slightly premature to call it an out-and-out bomb because Warner Bros. is releasing it concurrently on HBO Max, which likely cut into ticket sales. It was embraced by audiences, who awarded it an ""A"" CinemaScore, meaning ""King Richard"" could build steam as word-of-mouth grows. Oscar pundits believe the movie could find itself in the awards race, another factor that could extend its life in theaters. The film wasn't cheap; it carries a $50 million production budget. Plus, Smith received his full backend box office bonus in addition to his $20 million salary as a make-good for sending the film to HBO Max. 

""King Richard"" landed in fourth place on box office charts, behind holdovers Marvel's ""Eternals"" and Paramount's ""Clifford the Big Red Dog."" 
After two weekends at No. 1, ""Eternals"" slid to second place, collecting $10.8 million from 4,055 theaters. To date, the superhero epic has generated $135.8 million in the U.S. and Canada and $200.3 million internationally. Meanwhile, ""Clifford"" pulled in $8.1 million in its second weekend of release, pushing the family friendly film to $33.5 million in North America. 
Warner Bros. sci-fi spectacle ""Dune"" rounded out the top five with $3 million in ticket sales, buoying its domestic tally to $98.1 million. The film, directed by Denis Villeneuve and adapted from Frank Herbert's seminal novel, is expected to surpass the $100 million mark in the coming week. "

DUBAI (Reuters) - State oil firm Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is weighing an initial public offering (IPO) of its marine services, logistics and shipping arm next year, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
ADNOC Logistics & Services (ADNOC L&S) has been selected for a potential float in Abu Dhabi in 2022, said the sources, declining to be named as the matter is not public.
A deal could follow after testing investor appetite and market conditions, they said.
ADNOC declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Sunday.
Gulf oil producers are looking at sales of stakes in energy assets, capitalising on a rebound in crude prices to attract foreign investors.
ADNOC, which supplies nearly 3% of global oil demand, is seeking to extract value from businesses it owns and divest assets seen as non-core businesses.
It is also taking advantage of a rally on the Abu Dhabi equities index, which is up about 65% this year, the best-performing market in the Gulf region. 
ADNOC in September offered an 11% stake in its drilling business, which raised more than $1.1 billion from investors. ADNOC and chemicals firm OCI raised $795 million in October through the public share sale of its fertiliser venture Fertiglobe.
ADNOC L&S delivers crude oil, refined products, dry bulk and liquefied natural gas from Abu Dhabi to its international customers. 
It was created in 2016 following a merger between Abu Dhabi National Tanker Co, Petroleum Services Co and Abu Dhabi Petroleum Ports Operating Co.
The unit has a fleet of over 240 owned and chartered vessels, which include tankers and very large crude carriers. It is also the only licensed operator to service all petroleum ports in Abu Dhabi.

The business is an essential unit of ADNOC, which is seeking to boost its crude oil production capacity to 5 million barrels per day by 2030.
The unit also operates feeder vessels that transport cargo on behalf of ADNOC and other customers. Shipping rates for cargo have soared in the past year as the coronavirus pandemic created bottlenecks and disrupted supply chains.

Brussels Airlines flight 101 was en route from Brussels to New York on Friday when pilots issued a ""pan-pan"" message, which indicates a problem less serious than a ""mayday,"" when flying at 37,000 feet, aviation media and tracking websites said.
Pilots of the 12-year-old Airbus A330-300 requested to divert to Shannon in western Ireland but switched to Dublin on instructions from the airline, according to Aviation Herald, an independent website which tracks airplane incidents.
Lufthansa unit Brussels Airlines confirmed that the plane had diverted after an engine warning and said pilots had followed standard procedure.
Passengers praised the crew but said they had been put up in hotels in Dublin before being flown to Paris on Saturday, where many were then unable to get on overcrowded flights to New York days before Thanksgiving in the United States.
They included 18-year-old Maja Schmidt from Germany who was heading to New York to work as an au pair.
""They didn't have anything vegetarian so I ate bread and a cookie,"" she told Reuters. The airline said it had a policy of offering vegetarian meals and blamed the problem on a hotel.
Also on board was 22-year-old Oliver Sommerburg from near Hamburg, Germany, taking only the second flight of his life.
""It was crazy, I don't know what's going on. They don't tell us anything,"" he said.
Bernard Vidick, a Belgian judicial officer, said he had been refused a connecting flight in Paris because the plane bringing stranded passengers from Dublin had also been delayed.
""This means we are blocked in Paris whereas we should be in New York. We are wasting two of the few vacation days we have,"" he told Reuters.

""We have done our utmost to give care to our passengers in difficult circumstances ... but unfortunately we could not provide an optimal solution to all. We very much regret the inconvenience this caused for our customers,"" the airline said.
Carriers serving the United States are bracing for congestion and delays next week as the Thanksgiving holiday overlaps with airline labour shortages.

Police in the central Madhya Pradesh state arrested two men with 20 kg of marijuana on Nov. 14 and found they were using the Amazon India website to order and further smuggle the substance in the guise of stevia leaves, a natural sweetener, to other Indian states. 
State police said in a statement that executive directors of Amazon India were being named as accused under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act due to differences in answers in documents provided by the company in response to police questions and facts unearthed by discussion. 
Police did not disclose how many executives were charged.
The police, who had previously summoned and spoken to Amazon executives in the case, estimate that about 1,000 kg of marijuana, worth roughly $148,000, was sold via Amazon.
Amazon said in a statement that it does not allow the listing and sale of legally prohibited products, adding that it takes strict action against sellers in case of any contravention.

""The issue was notified to us and we are currently investigating it,"" Amazon said of the alleged marijuana smuggling.
Indian authorities have in recent years intensified their efforts to crack down on illicit drugs. Many high-profile Indian actors and TV personalities have been under scrutiny from narcotics officials since last year.

(Reuters) -  Disney  World near Orlando, Florida, operated by Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co, has put its COVID-19 vaccination mandate on hold, a spokesperson said on Saturday.
The move comes amid the Biden administration's workplace COVID-19 vaccine rule, which requires businesses with at least 100 employees to require staff get vaccinated against COVID-19 or be tested weekly and wear a face covering at work.
Local TV station Fox 35 was first to report the news, citing a cast member at the resort complex.
A Disney spokesperson had earlier told Reuters by email: ""We believe that our approach to mandatory vaccines has been the right one as we have continued to focus on the safety and well-being of our Cast Members and Guests."" 
""At this point, more than 90% of active Florida-based Cast Members have already verified that they are fully vaccinated,"" the spokesperson added.
Executives of Walt Disney Co, along with  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and others, met with White House officials last month to discuss President Joe Biden's COVID-19 vaccine requirement plan for private-sector workers, amid concerns it could worsen labor shortages and supply-chain woes.
In addition, vaccine mandates are deeply controversial in the United States. Supporters say they are helping to end the nearly two-year coronavirus pandemic, while opponents argue they violate the U.S. Constitution and curb individual liberty.

Biden imposed the requirement in September, telling Americans that ""our patience is wearing thin"" with those refusing to get inoculated.
Walt Disney Co had made vaccination mandatory on July 30 for all its on-site salaried and non-union hourly employees in the United States, as the highly infectious Delta COVID-19 variant drove a resurgence in cases then.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>","Apple tells workers they have right to discuss wages, working conditions","By Julia Love
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered a message to employees on Friday that was striking given its reputation for secrecy: a reminder that workers may discuss wages, hours and working conditions.
The notice came as some employees have been pushing Apple to do more to ensure there are no unfair gaps in pay across the company. 
In a post on an internal site, Apple said its policies do not preclude employees from ""speaking freely"" about working conditions, according to a copy of the message viewed by Reuters. 
""We encourage any employee with concerns to raise them in the way they feel most comfortable, internally or externally,"" the post states. 
A spokesperson for Apple declined to comment.
Apple's business conduct policy already included language stating that workers were not restricted in their ability to discuss wages, hours and working conditions, which is generally protected under U.S. law.
But employees who have spoken out in recent months have faced resistance, said former Apple program manager Janneke Parrish.
Parrish, who was fired after playing a leading role in employee activism, said she is hopeful that Apple's message will ease the path for others.
""The first step is making sure people are aware of their rights,"" she said. 
Apple has previously said it does not discuss specific employee matters and is ""deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace.""
The move comes amid a broader push by Silicon Valley workers to speak out about their working conditions and the impact of technology on society.
Earlier this week, another prominent activist, Apple software engineer Cher Scarlett, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that she is leaving the company. 
Scarlett filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that Apple halted discussions of pay among employees. Her lawyer, Aleksandr Felstiner, said the matter had been settled and the charge would be withdrawn. Scarlett said she could not comment.
Scarlett and Parrish worked together on ""#AppleToo,"" a group through which current and former employees have been sharing stories of what they call harassment and discrimination. 

Apple is known for its secretive culture, intended to keep details of new products under wraps. Employees sometimes are unaware of their right to speak about topics such as pay and working conditions, Parrish said. 
Ashley Gjovik, a senior engineering program manager who was fired by Apple in September after raising concerns about harassment and workplace safety, has filed NLRB charges in which she alleges that Apple policies violate the National Labor Relations Act.

With an 840 horse power, 12-cylinder (V12) aspirated mid-rear-mounted engine, the Daytona SP3 pays tribute to the Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) 330 P3/4, which dominated the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1967.
The Daytona SP3 will be produced in 599 units, with a not-for-everyone price of 2 million euros ($2.26 million) in Italy. Deliveries will start at the end of next year and are expected to be completed in 2024.
Ferrari presented its latest Icona on Saturday just as new Chief Executive Benedetto Vigna sets the Italian luxury sports car maker on the road to full electrification.
Vigna is a tech industry veteran who in September became CEO of Ferrari, which has promised to deliver its first fully electric vehicle in 2025.
In the meantime, Ferrari fans have been waiting more than three years for the second Icona after the Monza in 2018.
Ferrari's Iconas are special series cars produced in limited numbers, reserved for ultra wealthy private collectors and inspired by legendary models from the past. 

Recognised by its 'Prancing Horse' logo and red racing cars, Ferrari already has three electric hybrid models in its range, including the 296 GTB sports car it unveiled this year.
Ferrari has increasingly reserved its polluting V12 engines for limited series models and Iconas made up just 2% of the units it shipped in the last quarter, while V12 cars accounted for 12% of group shipments. It will make less than a combined 1,600 V12 812 Competizione and 812 Competizione A models, launched this year, with a starting price just under half a million euros ($564,000).

Gubitosi survived a boardroom showdown on Nov. 11 but after two profit warnings this year at Italy's former phone monopoly he remains under fire, having failed to convince top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) that he could tackle the company's problems.
The French media giant, which holds a 23.8% stake in TIM, has called into question the role of Gubitosi, pushing to replace him with TIM Brasil head Pietro Labriola, sources have previously said.
Weighed down by an adjusted gross debt of 29 billion euros ($33 billion), TIM is wrestling with fierce price competition on its home turf at a time when it needs to invest heavily to support Italy's drive to improve broadband connectivity.
On Friday, S&P downgraded TIM's long-term rating to BB from BB+ due to the declines in revenue and profit. 
The new extraordinary board meeting was called after a letter from a group of five board members close to Vivendi and a separate request from other independent board members, one of the sources said.
Gubitosi had won a second term in March with backing from Vivendi and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, which owns a 9.8% stake in TIM with the aim to oversee its network assets.
His reappointment was originally part of a broader plan championed by the previous government to merge TIM's access network assets with those of state-backed rival Open Fiber.

However, that plan has stalled with key figures in Prime Minister Mario Draghi's coalition opposing it and question marks hanging over whether it would ever get past regulators in Brussels.

Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd fired the three cargo pilots who were infected with COVID-19 during a layover in Frankfurt, over an unspecified ""serious breach"" of crew rules while overseas.
Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health said it had ended the compulsory quarantine of the 111 staff, but 10 aircrew members were classified as close contacts and were asked to remain in isolation.
The health authority also said German authorities had confirmed that no Covid-19 cases had been reported in connection with the Frankfurt hotel.
""It is very likely that they [the three pilots] acquired the infection from each other or a common source outside the hotel and the chance of an outbreak in the hotel was relatively low,"" the Department of Health said.

Hong Kong has recorded barely any local coronavirus cases in recent months but authorities in the global financial hub have tightened up quarantine rules.
After the pilot cases were reported last week, Cathay said it would step up compliance checks at overseas ports to ensure health and safety protocols were being strictly followed during layovers.

ZURICH (Reuters) -UBS named former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) President Colm Kelleher on Saturday as its surprise pick to succeed Axel Weber as chairman of the world's biggest wealth manager when his mandate ends in April. 
Kelleher, an Irishman from County Cork, retired from his post at Morgan Stanley in 2019 after three decades at the U.S. investment bank, including as finance director during the global financial crisis, but stayed on as a special adviser. 
UBS has been keen to hire a chairman with investment banking experience to work closely with former ING boss Ralph Hamers, who became chief executive of Switzerland's biggest bank last year and pledged to improve its digital services after a career focused primarily on retail banking.
""UBS is pleased to propose a Board member and future Chairman who has a deep understanding of the global banking landscape,"" Weber said in a statement. ""His more than 30 years of leadership experience in banking and excellent relationships around the world make Colm an ideal fit for UBS.""
The bank had been aiming to pick a new chairman by the end of the year and shareholders must now approve the appointment of Kelleher at their annual meeting on April 6.
During the financial crisis, Kelleher drastically shrank Morgan Stanley's balance sheet and converted it to a traditional bank holding company so it could access funding from the U.S. Federal Reserve as well as negotiating a $9 billion investment from Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group.
UBS also said it would nominate Lukas Gaehwiler for election to its board as vice chairman.
OUTSIDERS IN
The selections of Kelleher and Gaehwiler come as several of Europe's biggest banks pick outsiders from other countries to take the helm. Cross-town rival  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) brought in Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank's former Portuguese boss Antonio Horta-Osorio as chairman this year to lead it through an overhaul after a string of scandals that have cost it billions of dollars.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), meanwhile, said on Friday that it would nominate Dutch businessman Alexander Wynaendts as the next chairman of its supervisory board following a turbulent decade for Germany's largest lender.
The nominations have been surprise steps for some banks whose identity and leadership have been closely associated with their home countries. UBS, however, made such a move in 2012 with the selection of Weber, who is from Germany and previously served as president of the country's central bank.
Three sources told Reuters this week that UBS's board had included former UniCredit Chief Executive Jean-Pierre Mustier in a shortlist of possible candidates.
A source close to Mustier, however, said the 60-year-old Frenchman had no immediate plans to leave the Pegasus Europe special purpose acquisition vehicle he set up and invested in after leaving UniCredit a year ago. If confirmed, Kelleher will take the reins of a Swiss bank with healthy accounts. 
In October, UBS posted its highest quarterly profit over the past 11 years, with trading by the world's ultra-rich fuelling a 23% rise in fee income.

With Gaehwiler's addition to the board, UBS will also be restoring its second highest non-executive role to a Swiss national, succeeding Jeremy Anderson who will remain on the board as an independent director.
Gaehwiler, currently chairman of the bank's Swiss entity - UBS Switzerland AG - would be tasked with representing UBS in the country's most important associations, financial industry organisations and in political interaction, the bank said

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A senior executive of carmaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) raised concern about the future of renewable energy usage in Mexico, saying that without a solid legal basis for it, automotive investment in Latin America's no. 2 economy would suffer.
Francisco Garza, chief executive of GM Mexico, spoke as debate rages over a Mexican government proposal to give priority to the state-run power utility in the electricity market at the expense of private investors, particularly in renewable energy.
Participating in a panel in Mexico City, Garza said it was important for Mexico to forge conditions enabling investment in renewables, to which the company was itself committed.
""Unfortunately, if the conditions aren't there, Mexico won't be a destination for investment, because the conditions won't be given that permit us to meet our objective of having zero emissions in the long term,"" Garza said.
""We're evaluating that if there aren't the conditions, that dollar that was going to be invested in Mexico will go to the United States, Brazil, China or Europe, and Mexico will no longer be a key destination,"" he added.
Garza did not make explicit reference to the government's electricity initiative, although others on the panel did.
GM, which has been one of the top investors in Mexico since the start of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, earlier this year said it planned to invest $1 billion https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/general-motors-make-1-bln-electric-auto-investment-mexico-2021-04-29 to build electric vehicles in the northern state of Coahuila.

HOPE, British Columbia (Reuters) - British Columbia imposed temporary restrictions on fuel and non-essential travel on Friday to ease supply chain disruptions and support recovery work after floods and mudslides destroyed roads, houses and left thousands stranded in the western Canadian province.
The orders, announced by Deputy Premier Mike Farnworth in a briefing, limits people in some areas, including the Vancouver Island, to 30 liters (7.9 gallons) of fuel per visit to a gas station until Dec. 1. Non-essential travel along severely affected highways will also be prohibited.
""These orders will help keep commercial traffic moving, stabilize our supply chains and make sure everyone gets home safely,"" Farnworth said.
The storms, which started on Sunday, forced the closure of the Trans Mountain pipeline and cut two critical east-west rail lines owned by  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway and Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co that lead to Canada's busiest port of Vancouver, impeding the supply of fuel and goods.
Farnworth said the province was also working with the federal government to import fuel via alternate ways including by truck and barge from the United States or neighboring Alberta.
Hours before the restrictions were announced, the flood-battered province received some good news when CP said work to repair damaged infrastructure would continue non-stop and service should be restored in the middle of next week.
""Barring any unforeseen issues, we currently estimate service will be restored mid-week,"" spokesperson Salem Woodrow said in an email.
The Trans Mountain pipeline, which carries up to 300,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Alberta province to the Pacific coast, also said it was ""optimistic"" that it can restart the pipeline in some capacity by the end of next week.
CN said it was making progress in repairing its impacted rail network in British Columbia, but it expects the repair work to continue at least into next week.
The disaster looks set to be the costliest natural disaster to ever hit Canada.
The railway shutdowns have left exporters of commodities scrambling to divert shipments away from Vancouver and underscored the vulnerability of Canada's supply chains to climate change.
Water pumps are still working flat out in the city of Abbotsford to the east of Vancouver. If they fail, officials said all 160,000 residents may have to leave.
Bruce Banman, a provincial lawmaker who represents the area, surveyed the damage from a helicopter on Friday and said about 50% of agriculture-rich Sumas prairie remains underwater.
""The damage is significant, it's catastrophic,"" he said. ""It's heartbreaking to see. There are farmers still trying to save livestock."" 

He said infrastructure repairs alone would cost more than C$1 billion ($790 million) and that did not cover the loss of crops.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 08:10PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors bet on second wind for lagging U.S. small caps,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors believe the stars are aligning for small-cap stocks, as the category stands to benefit from cheap valuations, robust economic growth and a relatively benign impact from looming tax policy changes.
About $2.4 billion has flowed into U.S. small-cap equity funds so far this month, already the biggest monthly inflow since March, according to data provider EPFR. That had helped fuel an 8% gain in the S&P 600 small-cap index as of earlier this week since late October, doubling the large-cap S&P 500’s performance in that period. The Russell 2000, a broader small-cap index, gained about 7% over that time.
The small-cap indexes pared gains somewhat this week amid fears of a COVID-19 re-emergence.
Small caps, which have a median market capitalization of $1.2 billion in the Russell 2000, rallied in the early months of 2021 as investors bet that smaller firms would benefit more from a broad U.S. economic reopening. They floundered in subsequent months, when technology stocks took the market’s reins amid worries over whether the Delta variant of the coronavirus would stifle the economic rebound. The Russell 2000 is up 19% this year against a 25% rise for the S&P 500.
With a blistering S&P 500 rally stretching valuations on large-cap stocks and above-trend U.S. growth expected next year, some investors now believe small caps are a bargain. 
The forward price-to-earnings ratio of the Russell 2000 compared to the large-cap Russell 1000 recently stood at 24% below its long-term average, while small caps also trade at historical discounts on other measures such as price-to-book and price-to-sales, according to BofA Global Research.
“Smaller-cap stocks on a relative basis just look much more attractive,” said Ryan Jacob, chief investment officer of Jacob Asset Management. 
His firm’s growth stock funds ""probably have our highest weightings ever"" in small-cap shares compared to large, Jacob said.
RBC strategists said the U.S. economy is expected to expand 4% next year, compared with its long-term average of 2.5%, and believe small caps are a “pure play” on domestic growth. Analysts at BofA Global Research said the disparity in valuations between larger companies and smaller ones suggests high single-digit price returns annually for the Russell 2000 over the next decade compared with slightly negative annual returns for the S&P 500.
Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana, said his firm has added more small-cap exposure in the past four months, including shares of shipping company  Matson  (NYSE:MATX) and semiconductor firm Onto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO).
""After trading pretty much sideways for seven months, you had a pretty nice breakout,"" Carlson said. ""We like the fundamentals.""
The improving picture for smaller companies comes as a relief to investors looking for ways to diversify out of the megacap technology stocks that have led markets higher for most of the last decade, with the top five companies alone comprising more than 23% weight in the S&P 500.
""Now you don’t have to be in a FAANG stock to get some reasonable growth,"" said Mike Petro, portfolio manager of the Putnam Small Cap Value Fund, using a common acronym for massive tech and growth stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). ""You could be in some forgotten, little small-cap stock and get reasonable nominal growth on that."" Jacob, of Jacob Asset Management, has pared back holdings in megacap stocks Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta Platforms, while favoring smaller companies such as OptimizeRx (NASDAQ:OPRX) and Digital Turbine (NASDAQ:APPS).
Some investors remain wary of small caps, which over the past decade have lagged overall, with the Russell 2000 rising 230% against a 285% gain for the S&P 500.
Signs that yet another wave of COVID-19 is taking a greater hold in the United States, as it has in some European countries, could once again push investors out of economically sensitive stocks and into technology companies, which are expected to better weather short-term growth fluctuations.
Strategists at the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute this week urged investors to take profits on gains in ""lower-quality"" small-cap stocks and move into larger-capitalization companies, saying the economy is entering the middle phase of its expansion where growth historically has slowed.

Others, however, believe they could be a haven of sorts if tax policy changes backed by the Biden administration are put into law, in particular a minimum 15% tax on companies making over $1 billion.
Should that happen, ""the impact on small-caps could be less than on large-caps,"" said analysts at Ned Davis Research, which recently began favoring small-cap stocks.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -What a difference two years make. The 2019 Los Angeles auto show featured a parade of vehicle debuts, a flurry of press conferences and other events in the opening two days, along with hundreds of thousands of people eager to see new cars.
Fast forward to 2021. The Los Angeles Auto Show, the first major U.S. auto show since the start of the pandemic, kicked off on Wednesday with a single day of press events, with some automakers even skipping the show.
The show illustrates how the pandemic has accelerated automakers' shift toward the online world, as consumers buy more vehicles on the internet, though many still favor in-person visits. 
The LA Auto Show opened to the public on Friday for 10 days. A smaller crowd waited for the doors of an exhibition hall to open, and visitors were spread out at convention halls.
""I would really like to see it with my own eyes instead of seeing it on the iPad all the time,"" said Peter Borch, who flew from Denmark to see Fisker's electric sport utility vehicle Ocean.
""The size is bigger than on the photo,"" Borch, 52, said, saying he spent all of his pension to buy an Ocean, which will start deliveries late next year.
Dustin Haug, 47, a construction manager in Los Angeles, said, ""It is nothing like seeing an actual car in person, touching, feeling."" 
David Fortin, head of consumer marketing at Los Angeles Auto Show, told Reuters that although online reservations lag 2019 levels, they are ""strong enough that we believe we're going to have a great year.""
Honda and BMW both skipped the show in favor of separate, earlier events. Honda showed off a reincarnation of its iconic Integra prototype sedan at a livestreamed event in Los Angeles about a week earlier.
""That was an event that was exclusively ours. We find that we don't have to compete like you do on the press days of an auto show to get the attention,"" Honda executive vice president Dave Gardner told Reuters on a Zoom interview. 
Korean automaker Kia expressed a similar view. 
""The pandemic has taught us that we can work differently. ... There will be auto shows still in the future, but there'll be also different types of presentations,"" Karim Habib, head of Kia Design Center, told Reuters at the show. 
Kia and affiliate  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) were among the few automakers that debuted electric SUV concepts at the show and flew in executives, including chief executives, from their Seoul headquarters to Los Angeles.
""Auto shows used to be very, very popular for automakers to make a big media splash. That has changed with social media and with other forms of access to the media by consumers,"" Brett Smith, technology director at Center for Automotive Research, said. ""I think the pandemic was maybe the last straw in this."" 
Smaller companies see a positive side to the changes.

""It gives more attention to us,"" Henrik Fisker, CEO of electric vehicle startup Fisker, told Reuters. 
He said his Ocean SUV is a ""sexy sports car"" best seen in person. ""I know I'm zoomed out. I don't think I enjoy any more sitting just looking at computers and pictures. I want to see the real stuff,"" Fisker said.

(Reuters) - U.S. regulators expanded eligibility for booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines to all adults on Friday, allowing millions more Americans to get additional protection against the virus amid a recent rise in infections.
The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rochelle Walensky, signed off on the expanded eligibility on Friday evening after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration broadened its authorization of booster doses to all adults who had received their second shot of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc vaccine at least six months prior.
Regulators had previously authorized boosters for all recipients of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-dose vaccine, two months after their primary dose.
""Booster shots have demonstrated the ability to safely increase people’s protection against infection and severe outcomes and are an important public health tool to strengthen our defenses against the virus as we enter the winter holidays,"" Walensky said in a statement.
Most adults were already eligible for the additional shots, but fewer than 18% had received one, according to CDC data. But many public health officials felt the previous eligibility requirements were too complicated.
""The current guidelines - though well intentioned and thoughtful - generate an obstacle to uptake of boosters. In pursuit of precision, they create confusion,"" said Nirav Shah, a top Maine public health official and president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. 
""Our concern is that eligible individuals are not receiving boosters right now,"" Shah said.
According to an agency spokesperson, the CDC stopped short of saying all adults should get a booster. For those aged 18 to 49, the agency said individuals may get the vaccine if they choose to.
The CDC also moved to further clarify recommendations for people aged 50 to 64, suggesting all in this age group should get a booster, rather than only those with underlying medical conditions that put them at risk.
The agency's guidelines mirrored recommendations unanimously backed by a panel of CDC advisers earlier in the day. 
CASES ON THE RISE
After about two months of declining infections, the United States has reported daily increases for the past two weeks, driven by the more easily transmitted Delta variant of the virus and people spending more time indoors due to colder weather.
Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, said the guidance did not go far enough to encourage booster doses. 
The United States could face a major wave of COVID-19 cases this winter, Topol said, and protection is now waning. 
""We're sitting ducks,"" he said
The nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said this week that boosters, along with increasing overall vaccination, should help the country move beyond the worst of the pandemic in the coming months.
The FDA said its decision was supported by data showing that a third round of shots increased the immune response to the virus in studies of both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.
Some scientists remain concerned about rare cases of heart inflammation in young men following vaccination, particularly for recipients of Moderna's vaccine. Data from Israel suggested the rate of heart inflammation following a third dose of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine is lower than after a second dose. 
The Biden administration first proposed boosters for everyone in August, but has made them available in stages as health experts argued there was not enough data to support the need for further vaccination in all groups.

More than 32 million Americans have received boosters, which had been authorized for the immunocompromised, those aged 65 and above, and for individuals with health issues that put them at high risk of severe disease, including obesity, or who are regularly exposed to the virus through work or living conditions.
Nearly 60% of adult Americans - some 195.7 million people - are considered fully vaccinated, having received two doses of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, or one shot of J&J's vaccine.

The Chamber of Commerce wrote three letters and filed more than 30 Freedom of Information Act requests about what it said were Federal Trade Commission failures to strictly follow rules and giving in to political interference.
The FTC defended itself, saying it would not change course despite criticism from the big business lobby group about a series of actions spearheaded by FTC Chair Lina Khan.
Also Friday, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google asked the U.S. Justice Department to consider requiring Jonathan Kanter, the newly confirmed head of the department's Antitrust Division, to recuse himself from matters related to the search and advertising giant because of his work for a long list of Google critics.
Kanter had worked for such Google critics as  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP), which the letter described as ""vociferously advocating for an antitrust case against Google for years.""
The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google last year and is believed to be preparing a second focused on the company's dominance of online advertising.
The Chamber of Commerce said it was particularly concerned about votes cast by Commissioner Rohit Chopra before he left the FTC but which were announced after his departure. He now heads the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
The chamber expressed concern about what it said was White House interference in FTC decision-making and the agency's decision to use civil penalty authority.
The FTC said it would not change direction.

""The FTC just announced we are ramping up efforts to combat corporate crime and now the chamber declares 'war' on the agency. We are not going to back down because corporate lobbyists are making threats,"" said FTC spokesman Peter Kaplan.
The agency has filed a lawsuit accusing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of breaking antitrust law, tightened some merger reviews, been asked to probe high gasoline prices, and is considering a study to probe the role of competition in supply chain disruptions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) agreed to pay $60 million to settle class-action litigation by investors who accused the largest U.S. bank of intentionally manipulating prices of precious metals futures and options.
The settlement disclosed on Friday stemmed from sprawling U.S. government investigations into a form of illegal trading in precious metals and U.S. Treasury markets, known as spoofing.
JPMorgan did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which covers traders in precious metals futures and options from March 2008 to August 2016 and requires approval by a federal judge in Manhattan.
Lawyers for the investors called the accord ""substantively fair,"" citing among other reasons the risks of continued litigation.
The payout would recover about 7% of the estimated $915 million of classwide damages, the lawyers added.
JPMorgan declined to comment.
Spoofing is where traders place orders they intend to cancel, hoping to move prices to benefit their market positions.
In Sept. 2020, JPMorgan entered a deferred prosecution agreement and agreed to pay $920 million, including a $436 million criminal fine, to settle U.S. government probes into spoofing in precious metals and Treasuries.

The New York-based bank in September reached a $15.7 million settlement with investors over Treasury spoofing.
Lawyers for the precious metals investors plan to seek up to one-third of their settlement, or $20 million, to cover legal fees.

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq Composite Index closed above 16,000 points for the first time on Friday, in its second-straight record finish powered by technology stocks, while pandemic jitters sent the Dow to its fourth losing session in the last five.
Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 index scored a winning week, up 1.2% and 0.3% respectively, after last week's declines snapped a five-week run of higher finishes.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average's second-successive weekly loss - this one of 1.4% - wiped out the last of its November gains, extending the index's drop from a Nov. 8 record high to 2.3%.
Friday's fall was caused by banking, energy and airline stocks slumping on fears that European countries, battling a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, could follow Austria in moving towards a full lockdown. 
Banking stocks fell 1.6%, tracking a drop in Treasury yields as investors snapped up safe-haven bonds. The S&P energy index dropped 3.9%, the worst performing sector, as crude prices fell on demand implications. [O/R] [US/]
Carriers including Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and cruiseliners Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp all dropped between 0.6% and 2.8%.
""It's a normal time to take risk off. And in this case, there's just so much liquidity that the market doesn't go down - just people take risk off by going into safe havens,"" said Jay Hatfield, chief executive of Infrastructure Capital Management in New York.
Falling yields and safe-haven demand supported major technology stocks, which in turn lifted the Nasdaq.
FAANG stocks, which have largely persevered through economic shocks since 2020, traded broadly higher. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) gained along with other stay-at-home stocks.
Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp rose 4.1% to its third straight closing high, and the Philadelphia semiconductor index, up 0.3%, hit its third record closing high in four.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 268.97 points, or 0.75%, to 35,601.98; the S&P 500 lost 6.58 points, or 0.14%, at 4,697.96; and the Nasdaq Composite added 63.73 points, or 0.4%, to 16,057.44.
The S&P 500 gyrated on Friday before slipping into negative territory, after a week in which retailers pushed it to a record finish the previous day.
The S&P consumer discretionary sector rose 0.3% to a closing peak for a second day in a row, after breaking its lifetime intraday high on Friday. This follows strong retail earnings this week and positive signs for holiday shopping.
Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) rose 0.9% to its third successive record close after reporting third-quarter results on Wednesday. Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Inc, which posted earnings earlier this month, achieved the same closing feat after finishing up 1.4%.
""Out of the Q3 earnings, one of the trends we have seen is the resounding strength of the U.S. consumer,"" said Jessica Bemer, portfolio manager at Easterly Investment Partners.
""We've heard it all through this week from retailers talking about the consumer coming back into the store, enjoying the shopping experience and getting ready for the holidays. It makes sense but it was really validated during earnings season.""
Profit-taking in names which gained earlier in the week led to drops of between 2.9% and 8.8% in Macy's Inc (NYSE:M), Kohls Corp and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS).
The information technology segment, up 0.8%, was the best performer on the S&P 500.
It was buoyed by  Intuit  Inc (NASDAQ:INTU), which jumped 10.1% as brokerages lifted their price targets on the income tax software company after it beat quarterly estimates and raised forecasts.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.68 billion shares, compared with the 11.12 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 100 new highs and 309 new lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York appeals court judge has rejected the New York Times' request to lift an order temporarily blocking it from publishing or seeking various documents related to the conservative activist group Project Veritas.
Friday's order from Justice Leonard Austin of the state Appellate Division in Brooklyn means the Times cannot use the documents, which Project Veritas said are protected by attorney-client privilege, until a Nov. 23 hearing on whether to extend the prohibition.
The Times had been appealing a Thursday order by a trial judge, Justice Charles Wood of the Westchester County Supreme Court, that the newspaper called an unconstitutional prior restraint, a view shared by some First Amendment advocates.
""Today's decision to allow the injunction is deeply disappointing,"" Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in an email. ""We look forward to explaining our position in court.""
Project Veritas did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Wood's order was part of Project Veritas' defamation lawsuit against the Times over a September 2020 article describing a video the group released alleging voter fraud in Minnesota.
It followed a Nov. 11 Times article discussing Project Veritas' journalism practices, and a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the group's possible role in the reported theft of a diary from President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley.
That article discussed memos by Benjamin Barr, a lawyer for Project Veritas. The group has said those memos were privileged, and the Times wrote about them to harm and embarrass a litigation adversary.
Wood's order blocks the Times from reporting on or trying to obtain privileged Project Veritas materials until the Nov. 23 hearing.
The judge will also consider whether the newspaper must remove references to Barr's memos from the Nov. 11 article.

The Times has said Wood's order ran afoul of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1971 decision rejecting the Nixon administration's bid to halt publication of the Pentagon Papers, which described U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
The case is Project Veritas v New York Times Co et al, New York State Supreme Court, Westchester County, No. 63921/2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Friday said it selected  Northrop Grumman ,  Lockheed Martin  and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) to research and develop a missile system that would be able to defend the United States against a hypersonic weapons attack.
The three companies were awarded separate contracts totaling about $60 million to develop a glide phase interceptor that would be guided by a constellation of satellites and sensors to intercept a hypersonic missile inside Earth's atmosphere as it glides towards its target. 
The Missile Defense Agency 2022 budget earmarked $136 million for research, development, testing and evaluation for the interceptor, but the program will ultimately yield billions of dollars of revenue for defense contractors. 
The United States and its global rivals have intensified their drive to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that fly at high speeds. As a result hypersonic arms require quicker defenses and new systems to defeat them. 
Often the Pentagon runs competitions for arms or defense contracts in an effort to get the highest quality product at the lowest price for the taxpayer. Many of the competitions are phased so that the technology can mature and inferior offerings are weeded out along the way. 
Earlier this fall a defense official said the Missile Defense Agency was working with industry and hoped to have awards by the end of the calendar year. 

There was a broad expectation the Missile Defense Agency would select two companies to proceed. The inclusion of a third competitor underscores the Missile Defense Agency's desire to incentivize industry to perform research and develop around this new class of weapon. 
Arms makers Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp all touted their hypersonic weapons programs at the top of their quarterly earnings calls recently as an anticipated source of profits in the future.

Nearly 80% of its salaried U.S. workforce self-reported that they are fully vaccinated, the company said. 
The Chrysler parent said all workers would need to submit proof of their vaccination status by Dec. 4 and receive their final dose by Jan. 5.
The company said in a memo to employees the action was also ""in preparation for a phased reopening of our offices in 2022.""

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Leaders of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said Friday they asked for a government review of the Federal Aviation Administration's oversight of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner.
Committee Chair Representative Peter DeFazio and top Republican Representative Sam Graves asked the Transportation Department’s Office of Inspector General to conduct a review of the FAA’s oversight of the manufacture and production of the Boeing 787. The lawmakers noted numerous production issues have halted deliveries for lengthy periods over the last 13 months.
The lawmakers, aviation subcommittee Chair Rick Larsen and top Republican Garret Graves, asked the inspector general to determine ""whether the FAA’s existing inspection program is sufficient to identify production issues, including whether FAA has enough inspectors, whether FAA performs enough inspections, and whether FAA has appropriate processes in place to identify production issues.""
Boeing shares were down more than 5% after a Wall Street Journal report that it had further slowed production of 787s.
Boeing said on Friday that it is ""completing comprehensive inspections across 787 production and within the supply chain, while holding detailed, transparent discussions with the FAA, suppliers and our customers.""
It said ""production is ongoing, and rates will continue to be dynamic,"" adding that ""these methodical inspection and rework efforts continue to impact 787 deliveries.""
Last month, Boeing said some titanium 787 parts were improperly manufactured over the past three years, the latest in a series of problems to plague the wide-body aircraft.
The defect was found as Boeing grapples with other problems in the 787 that have caused it to cut production and halt deliveries since May.
Problems started in September 2020 when the FAA said it was investigating manufacturing flaws. Airlines using the model removed eight jets from service.

Boeing was able to resume deliveries of 787s in March after a five-month hiatus - only to halt them again in May after the FAA raised concerns about its proposed inspection method.
In July, the FAA said some Dreamliners had a manufacturing quality issue near the nose of the plane that must be fixed before Boeing can deliver to customers.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 04:51PM ET</span>",Mexico expects arms suit to bring change in industry-officials,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico expects the lawsuit it has filed in a U.S. court against prominent arms makers for negligent business practices will force the industry to change, in spite of companies efforts' to have the case thrown out, Mexican officials said on Friday.
The Mexican government argues the companies knew their practices had encouraged illegal arms trafficking into Mexico, helping to cause thousands of gangland deaths.
The arms industry has rejected Mexico's allegations.
The firms, including Smith & Wesson, Barrett Firearms and Colt's Manufacturing Co have until Monday to respond to the lawsuit Mexico filed in a Massachusetts court in August, and Mexican officials are confident they are winning the argument.
In a briefing with reporters, officials said that once more facts about the industry became known during the process, firearms makers would have to tighten up their practices.
""After discussions on the motion to dismiss (the lawsuit) are over ... we get to the heart of it,"" said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""And in the discovery process, I can assure you the companies will self-regulate.""
The official said Mexico expected the companies to say that corruption in Mexico and other failings were to blame for illicit entry of arms into the country, and to use other arguments to deflect from their own responsibility.

Noting that holding arms makers to account had widespread support in Mexico, the official said that if firms tried to pass the matter off as being about Mexican corruption, Mexico would end up talking about corruption in U.S. law enforcement on the border and the role of the National Rifle Association in U.S. politics.
Lawyers for the arms companies did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at a new record high Friday, but blue-chip U.S. stocks and oil sank amid renewed concerns about COVID-19, which also boosted safe havens like the U.S. dollar.
The surge by the tech-heavy Nasdaq came as investors fretted about renewed lockdowns, after Austria announced new restrictions to deal with rising cases and fears Germany could follow suit.
Banks and travel companies bore the brunt of the losses, as investors fretted about reduced economic activity if case numbers rise and jumped to safer havens in tech stocks.
""It's a normal time to take risk off. And in this case, there's just so much liquidity that the market doesn't go down - just people take risk off by going into safe havens,"" said Jay Hatfield, chief executive of Infrastructure Capital Management in New York. ""Right now, COVID-19 is kind of a headline of the day. Every trade in the market right now is being driven by COVID.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week down 0.75%, closing for its fourth week down in five. The S&P 500 lost 0.14%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4% and closed above 16,000 for the first time.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, fell 0.28%.
Renewed COVID worries also helped send oil prices down over 3%, after the sector had already been grappling with concerns over reduced demand and potential release of crude reserves to ease gas prices.
Brent crude was down 3.47% to $78.42 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 3.67% to $76.11 per barrel. Both benchmarks were down for four straight weeks for the first time since March 2020.
SAFETY SEARCH
The return of COVID-19 fears led to a boost across a range of safe havens.
Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields dipped Friday on heightened demand. Benchmark 10-year notes last yielded 1.545%, after dropping as low as 1.515%, the lowest since Nov. 10.
The dollar surged after Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller called for quicker tapering of economic support to tighten up the central bank's monetary policy. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said separately it may be appropriate to consider a quicker wind-down when the Fed next meets to set policy in mid-December.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.51% to 96.029. The dollar is up roughly 1% on the week, while the euro hit a 16-month low.

The dollar's gains came at the expense of gold. Spot gold prices fell 0.62% to $1,846.91 an ounce. 
""Gold prices are declining after some hawkish Fed speak about accelerated tapering boosted the dollar,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA.

Investing.com — VNET Group Inc DRC (NASDAQ:VNET) shares tumbled 14.5% Friday following a double downgrade from Goldman Sachs after it reported third quarter earnings on Thursday evening. 
VNET's report underwhelmed investors and caused worry after comments about regulatory uncertainty and competition despite it beating expectations on both revenue and EPS.
Goldman analyst Tina Hou downgraded the stock to sell from buy, slashing the price target to $11.50 from $32.80.
Hou told investors that the company will struggle to maintain its wholesale customer acquisition and order momentum, with the data center industry experiencing a slowdown.
The Goldman's analyst also cited potential competitors, stating the internet data center services provider faces heightened competition with new market entrants. Therefore, the competition and regulatory issue is concerning for the analyst, while she also believes the company will fail to meet targets for growth.
However, investment firm Jefferies maintained its buy rating despite the recent sell-off. 
Edison Lee, an analyst at the firm, said that market concerns about VNET are misplaced as retail is a more profitable business than wholesale, and so retail growth is good for the company.
In its Q3 earnings, VNET reported total cabinets under management increased by 2,388, but Lee said investors should not be fixated on the cabinet target numbers set by the company.
Lee maintained a $41.30 price target."

Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) reported third-quarter results and fourth-quarter guidance that fell short of estimates as supply shortages continue to weigh on growth. Its shares fell more than 5%.
The melt-up in tech was also spurred by fresh appetite for growth stocks amid concerns about a potential slowdown in the global economy as parts of Europe looks set to step up Covid-19 restrictions.  
Austria said it would reimpose a nationwide lockdown on Monday to curb surging Covid-19 cases, raising concerns about the impact on the global economy as larger economies in the bloc including Germany could also introduce fresh restrictions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa (NYSE:V) expects to resolve its credit card fee dispute with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in Britain and hopes to continue its co-branded credit card partnership with the e-commerce giant in the United States, its Chief Financial Officer told Reuters.
Amazon said on Wednesday that it would stop taking payments from Visa credit cards in Britain from mid-January next year.
""We've resolved these things in the past and I believe we'll resolve them in the future,"" Vasant Prabhu said in an interview on Friday, adding: ""It is our expectation that there will be a resolution so that UK consumers are not impacted.""
Shares in Visa pared losses after Reuters reported Prabhu's comments, moving from 1.4% lower on the day to 0.5% lower. The shares then gave back those gains and were last trading down 1.4%.
Amazon said in its Wednesday statement that credit card charges should be ""going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise.""
Analysts have suggested its stance may be a negotiating tactic. In the past, other big retailers have settled fee disputes with Visa after announcing they were going to quit taking its credit cards in narrow segments of their businesses.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's unit in Canada, for example, said in 2016 it would stop accepting Visa credit cards after being unable to reach an agreement on fees. Seven months later the companies said they had settled the matter. 
Prabhu said reports on Wednesday suggesting the dispute was the result of an EU-enforced cap on fees no longer applying in the UK after Brexit were ""entirely inaccurate."" 
That rule applied to cross-border transactions between the EU and UK, whereas the dispute relates to domestic transactions, he said.
In recent months, Amazon has also introduced surcharges on customers using Visa credit cards in Singapore and Australia, citing high fees, as the relationship between the two companies appeared to deteriorate.
Some analysts had expressed concern Amazon's move in the UK could be a precursor to the retailer dropping Visa's credit card in other territories, something Prabhu said he hoped would not materialize.
""Restricting consumer choice doesn't help merchants either,"" said Prabhu. ""If a merchant tells me I can't use my preferred card that is not helpful to me as a consumer.""
Amazon also said it is considering dropping https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/amazon-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-britain-2021-11-17 Visa as partner on its U.S. co-branded credit card and is in discussions about this with both with Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa.

Visa said it remains in discussions about continuing its partnership with Amazon and is hopeful that it will continue.
""We hope to get to the point where our relationship with Amazon goes back to being what it was,"" Prabhu said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two key U.S. House Democrats on Friday urged the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to take action to prevent potential air safety risks from the planned use of C-Band spectrum for 5G wireless.
At issue are concerns of potential interference caused by the 5G deployment with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters.
""We’re now on the precipice of a dangerous situation in which the safety of flight hangs on the telecom industry’s decision regarding when to switch on its 5G networks,"" said House of Representatives Transportation Committee Chair Peter DeFazio and Representative Rick Larsen, who chairs an aviation subcommittee, in a letter to FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel.
A spokeswoman for Rosenworcel did not immediately comment. On Thursday she told reporters she was confident concerns about air safety can be addressed.
The White House National Economic Council was holding a meeting on the issue Friday afternoon, sources told Reuters.
Earlier this month, AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) agreed to delay commercial launch of C-band wireless service until Jan. 5 after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) raised safety concerns even as telecom groups warn that a six-month delay in deployment could cost the U.S. $25 billion in economic benefits.
The FAA issued a Nov. 2 bulletin warning that action may be needed to address the potential interference caused by the 5G deployment.
The FAA may issue an emergency directive to airlines, and the lawmakers said it could include ""draconian but necessary restrictions on many types of critical flight operations.""
The two lawmakers asked the FCC to prohibit 5G broadband use in the C-band until the FAA has conducted a robust risk assessment.
The FAA did not immediately comment on the letter Friday.
The lawmakers said Friday that after a year of discussions ""we appear no closer to resolving the serious concerns that the use of the C-band for 5G would create harmful interference.""
They cited the 2009 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 accident near Amsterdam as an example of how an ""erroneous radio altimeter reading could potentially result in a fatal air disaster with multiple fatalities, even on a clear day.""
That crash https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-48276020100506 killed nine people.
People briefed on the matter told Reuters that potential mitigation measures include small exclusion zones around airports, downward tilt of some antennas and reduced power levels to areas around airports.
A coalition of wireless and other trade groups on Thursday told the White House, ""Further delays in launching C-Band could have serious consequences for our nation’s ability to leverage the economic growth associated with 5G."" They argue that there have no been C-Band aviation safety issues in other countries using the spectrum.
 Boeing Co , Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and U.S. airlines have urged administration action to resolve concerns, saying 5G could ""cause harmful interference to radio altimeters, which are crucial systems used by every commercial aircraft and helicopter.""

The Democratic lawmakers decried what they termed the FCC and telecom industry’s ""deploy now, fix later"" approach as ""anathema to the strong safety culture we have created and nourished in aviation over the last 20 years.""
""In aviation, we never roll the dice with safety,"" the lawmakers said. ""We never run headlong into a possible hazard to the safety of flight without a full and complete assessment and mitigation of those risks.""

1579,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 03:40PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank to name Dutchman as next chair in changing of guard,"By Tom Sims and Frank Siebelt
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said on Friday that it would nominate the Dutch businessman Alexander Wynaendts as the next chairman of its supervisory board, marking a new era for Germany's largest lender.
The former chief executive of Aegon (NYSE:AEG) will succeed Chairman Paul Achleitner, one of Germany's most prominent bankers. He plans to step down in May after 10 difficult years that saw two chief executive changes, billions of euros of losses and huge fines.
The European Central Bank has been pressuring Deutsche Bank to name a candidate so that it can have time to vet them and provide for an orderly transition.
""Alex Wynaendts has exactly the right personality and skills to ensure a continued trustful working relationship between both boards at Deutsche Bank,"" Achleitner said in a statement.
Achleitner's departure will mark the end of particularly turbulent decade for Deutsche Bank. 
The bank has returned to profit, but remains under the close watch of regulators who guard the health of the global financial system, of which the bank, as one of the world's biggest lenders, forms a critical part.
The appointment of Wynaendts, a Dutchman, is a surprise. 
Achleitner had long preferred that a current Deutsche Bank supervisory board member succeeds him, but the chances of an outsider taking on the role had recently dimmed. 
That is because a leading choice for the job, Theodor Weimer, who sits on the supervisory board, is also chief executive of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn). Regulators have said privately that they would not allow him to hold both posts at once.
Deutsche Bank said that as CEO of Aegon from 2008 to 2020 ""he redefined Aegon's strategy, successfully transforming the company into a client centric, purpose-driven and profitable organisation"".
He is on the boards of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and Air France-KLM. He will step down from Citigroup's board.
Achleitner, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) partner and Austrian native, has survived three shareholder votes to oust him.
In 2017, the bank was fined $7.2 billion in the United States for its role in the mortgage crisis, nearly toppling the bank. 

Regulators have also fined and criticized the bank for lapses in controls to prevent money laundering.
In 2018, Achleitner installed CEO Christian Sewing, who has enacted steep cuts, including plans to shed 18,000 staff. The bank has invested in money laundering controls, posted five quarters of profit and received upgrades from ratings agencies.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 03:36PM ET</span>",GM to retrofit heated seat feature on newly sold vehicles in mid-2022,"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Friday that vehicles sold without heated and ventilated seats due to the global semiconductor shortage will be eligible, likely starting in the middle of 2022, for a retrofit that activates those features.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it will cover the cost to retrofit new vehicles built without the chips needed for the heated and ventilated seats. It expects the chips to be available for the retrofits late in the second quarter of 2022, but the timeline could improve if chip supplies get better.
The global chip shortage over the past year has forced GM and other automakers to curtail vehicle production or in some cases build vehicles without certain features in a move to conserve chip supplies. GM and others have focused on protecting production of their most profitable vehicles through the shortage.
The action Friday came a week after the Detroit company had told U.S. dealers it was temporarily removing the heated and ventilated seat features on certain models due to the chip shortage.

GM told dealers in a memo obtained by Automotive News that it will discount vehicles missing heated or ventilated seats by $50, instead of up to $500 as it originally said. Heated steering wheels cannot be retrofitted, the memo said, so vehicles missing that feature will still be discounted by $150, Automotive News reported.
GM said other features that had been temporarily removed on certain vehicles due to the chip crisis but have since been reinstated included climate control digital temperature displays, side blind zone alert and Super Cruise driver-assist technology.

In the U.S. Democrats in Congress are contemplating a cut in prescription drug costs for older Americans as a part of President Biden's Build Back Better social spending plan. Furthermore, according to a Linchpin report, the pharmaceutical industry is expected to increase to $1.50 trillion by 2023.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to add fundamentally sound pharmaceutical stocks Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (NYSE:TAK) to one’s portfolio now. These stocks have declined more than 20% in price year-to-date and are trading at significant discounts to their peers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Policyholders are starting to pull back from digital channels as the COVID-19 pandemic eases and revert to in-person ways to file insurance claims, a senior executive at Zurich Insurance Group (OTC:ZFSVF) told the Reuters Connected Claims USA event this week.
The move, according to Group Chief Claims Officer Ian Thompson, was despite significant customer adoption of online tools in the last two years, and strides the industry has taken to humanize the experience.
Among areas where technology has gained ground during the pandemic includes filing of auto repairs and legal negotiations around workers' compensation claims.
""We're seeing some customers are heading back towards saying 'I was willing to do that during lockdown, but I want to go back to a place where I can see people and speak to them directly',"" he added.
Across financial services, the pandemic has driven American companies to prioritize technology investments to ensure services are available, even when physical locations are not.
People previously averse to using technology for everyday tasks have also embraced it. The percentage of U.S. adults over 50 years old using a smartphone to make financial transactions rose to 53% by the end of 2020, up from 37% a year earlier, according to an April report from advocacy group AARP.
In terms of digital strategies, Thompson said the pre-pandemic era was overly-focused on building an ""app"" through which customers would have to engage. Now, insurers are creating multiple channels for customers to access services.
There has also been a push to make the digital experience more empathetic, important when the world continues to face pandemic challenges, Thompson said.

""You hear the dog barking or a child playing in the background and you start talking about what our realities are like, not just what is your policy number. Service is important but it's about making it a human experience.""
In the United States, Zurich offers insurance products to businesses. Zurich's U.S. footprint also includes Farmers Group, an administrator of policies for Farmers Insurance, which focuses on property and casualty coverage. Zurich Insurance acquired Farmers Group in 1998, while Farmers Insurance is owned by its policyholders.

Investing.com —  Amplitech  Group Inc (NASDAQ:AMPG) shares rose more than 20% after it announced Friday afternoon that it will acquire Spectrum Semiconductor Materials.
AmpliTech is set to pay $8 million in cash for the semiconductor components company. In addition, an extra $1.5 million will be held in an escrow account until December 2022 to fund any purchase price or other adjustments, while they will also grant Spectrum 188,442 restricted shares of AmpliTech common stock.
Commenting on the deal, AmpliTech CEO Fawad Maqbool said: ""With Spectrum, we will add a well-managed, growing business with a long-term track record for high quality and excellent customer service and the ideal distribution platform for the launch of our MMIC chip solutions. 
""This transaction will allow us to more than triple our current annual revenue run rate, while also being immediately accretive to our bottom line.""
AmpliTech said Spectrum is on track to achieve an unaudited 2021 revenue of between $10 million and $11 million, while AmpliTech's revenue for the past four quarters was $3.5 million.
The deal will help expand AmpliTech's technical and management expertise and distribution reach, with Spectrum a worldwide authorized distributor that has been around for over 30 years. AmpliTech explained that it sees the potential of Spectrum as a distribution platform in various regions for its new line of monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) chip designs.

The approval for Voxzogo, intended for children aged five and older, comes months after it became the first therapy to be greenlighted by regulators for the treatment of the genetic condition in Europe. 
Many countries still do not have an approved therapy for Achondroplasia, a condition characterized by short stature which occurs in about one in every 25,000 newborns worldwide. 
BioMarin expects the therapy's annual net revenue per patient in the United States to be about $240,000 and expects about 3,000 children with achondroplasia in the country to be eligible for the treatment. Voxzogo is expected to be available in the United States by mid-to-late December at a list price of $899 per vial, the company said. 
BioMarin's late-stage Voxzogo study showed improvements in patients' growth rate over a year and was well tolerated. The drug is also being studied in children below five years and has already been approved in Europe for those aged two and above. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had in April extended the review of the drug by three months to assess two-year data on the drug.
It has now cleared the drug under the accelerated approval pathway, which requires a post-marketing study assessing final adult height. 

BioMarin said it intended to use the results from ongoing extension studies to receive final approval.
The drug is also under regulatory review in Japan, Brazil, and Australia and could receive approval in the countries next year, BioMarin said.

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 02:41PM ET</span>","China property bonds score strong weekly bounce, Evergrande misses out","(Corrects spelling error in first paragraph)
LONDON (Reuters) -Chinese property firms saw their battered bonds cement a strong weekly bounce on Friday, although there was one notable absentee from the rally: China Evergrande Group.
A flurry of asset sales and share placings, including some from Evergrande itself, has sparked hopes this week that the heavily-indebted sector will be able to avoid a full-blown crisis and finally stabilise. 
Friday's gainers included China's top property developer Country Garden, whose bonds were nearly back to par, or 100 cents on the dollar, having tumbled to around 80 cents last week in a sector-wide slide. 
Shimao was also a notable rebounder. Its bonds completed a yo-yo back up to 90 cents having plunged to around 70 last week in a breakneck fall capped when S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) stripped it of its prized investment grade credit rating.
Market watchers put the rebound down to relief that firms have been able to raise money via share placing and asset sales this week, even if they have had to offer deep discounts to get the deals done. 
Country Garden Services Holdings, the property services unit of China's top developer, raised $1 billion on Thursday from share placings, two sources told Reuters.
Sunac China, among the top four developers in the country, raised a total of $949.70 million, while Evergrande also struck a deal to sell its entire stake in streaming services firm HengTen for HK$2.13 billion ($273.5 million).

Despite the gains elsewhere, though, Evergrande's bonds have remained rooted at between 23 and 29 cents on the dollar this week - a 71%-77% mark down from their value back in May when the Chinese property sector's troubles first began to snowball.
S&P cautioned this week that Evergande, the world's most indebted developer with around $19 billion of international market bonds and $300 billion of liabilities altogether, was still ""highly likely"" to default as it has $3.5 billion to repay in March and April next year alone.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq eased from record highs Friday, but remained supported as investors piled into growth corners of the market like tech amid concerns about global growth following fresh lockdowns in Europe.
The S&P 500 fell 0.08%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.73%, or 261 points, the Nasdaq gained 0.44% after hitting an intraday record of 16,121.1.
Austria said it would reimpose a nationwide lockdown on Monday to curb surging Covid-19 cases, raising concerns about the impact on the global economy as larger economies in the bloc including Germany could also introduce fresh restrictions.
“[S]uddenly markets are paying attention [to raising Covid-19 cases in Europe] perhaps because policy responses are beginning to emerge,” Scotiabank Economics said.
Against the backdrop of rising concerns about a possible slowdown in the global economy, investors piled into growth sectors like tech.
Meta, formerly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded higher.
Semiconductor stocks also supported the broader tech sector as a surge in Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) offset weakness in Applied Materials.
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) reported third-quarter results and fourth-quarter guidance that fell short of estimates as supply shortages continue to weigh on growth. Its shares fell more than 4%.
The gains in consumer discretionary stocks, one of the best performing sectors this week, continued, with  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) up more than 2%.
Investor jitters over a slowdown in the global recovery dragged cyclical stocks lower, with energy and financials taking on the brunt of the selling pressure.
Energy fell more than 3% and is on track for second-weekly losses as oil prices fell below $80 a barrel on concerns fresh restrictions in Europe will dent oil demand.
 Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), Hess (NYSE:HES),  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR) all fell more than 5% and led the selloff in the energy sector.
Travel-related stocks including United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) were under pressure as investors eased bets on the reopening trade.
In health care, meanwhile,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) was the standout performer, racking up a 6% gain after the Food and Drug Administration authorized Covid vaccine booster shots for all U.S. adults. Pfizer’s vaccine also received approval.
On the political front, the House of Representatives passed President Biden’s $1.75 trillion ""human infrastructure"" package, or Build Back Better Act.
The legislative measure will progress to the Senate, where Democrats hope to pass it using the budget reconciliation process, without Republican support.
The bill will likely have to be revised as centrists such as Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia have balked at its hefty price tag, and ""question claims the initiative was fully paid for,” Stifel said.
“The bill would contribute $791B to the deficit in the next five years and $367B to the deficit over the coming 10 year period,” Stifel added, citing findings from the Congressional Budget Office."

LONDON (Reuters) -  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), which divested its thermal coal mines this year after pressure from investors, plans to retain its steelmaking coal portfolio as it is confident that they will not press for an early exit, the mining group's chief executive said.
Anglo spun out its South African thermal coal operations and sold its stake in a Colombian mine to Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) after shareholder calls to ditch the more polluting fossil fuel to meet emissions targets.
However, the price of thermal coal, which is burned for steam to produce electricity, rose as high as $280 a tonne in the second half of 2021 from as low as $57 in 2020, generating strong returns for the new owners.
""For us it (thermal coal) created disincentives ... yes the EBITDA will be a bit lower this year, but ... we are playing the long game,"" boss Mark Cutifani said in an interview for the upcoming Reuters Next conference on Dec. 1-3.
Thermal coal, a relatively small part of Anglo's copper to platinum, nickel and diamond portfolio, had deterred some large investors from owning its shares, Cutifani said. 
Anglo also produces metallurgical, known as 'met', coal and iron ore, which are key ingredients in steelmaking.
Emissions from steelmaking account for up to 9% of the global total and producers are pushing to develop technology to meet global climate commitments.
""The conversation around met coal has become a lot more mature and we are arguing that we think we are the best holders of those assets for the next 15 years at least and that argument seems to be resonating better with shareholders,"" he added. 
The coking coal mines owned by Anglo have a relatively short life until the 2040s.
Some shareholders are warming to the idea of holding stocks in coal companies that pledge to run down mines responsibly rather than selling them.
""We are looking at sustainability and you don't want to pull out of an investment and destroy livelihoods and communities,"" Mduduzi Bhulose, portfolio manager at South Africa's Public Investment Corporation (PIC), said.
PIC is Anglo's largest shareholder with a 6.9% holding, according to Refinitiv data. 

""In the event that they decide to get out of any other metal, the expectation is that they do it in a responsible manner and Anglo has over time shown that they can do that,"" PIC's Bhulose added.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 02:29PM ET</span>","Breakthrough infections raise health, death risk; vaccine passports without testing allow cases to be missed","By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Breakthrough COVID-19 raises risk of health problems, death
COVID-19 is generally less severe in vaccinated patients but that does not mean breakthrough infections will be benign, a large study shows. Researchers analyzed data collected by the U.S. Veterans Affairs Administration from 16,035 survivors of breakthrough infections, 48,536 unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors and nearly 3.6 million uninfected people. At six months after infection, after taking their risk factors into account, people with breakthrough infections had lower rates of death and long-term lingering health problems than COVID-19 patients who had not been vaccinated. But compared to people who never had COVID-19, those who had breakthrough infections had a 53% higher risk of death and a 59% higher risk of having at least one new medical condition, particularly problems affecting the lungs and other organs. Even when breakthrough infections did not require hospitalization, the increased risks of death and lasting effects were ""not trivial,"" the research team reported on Monday on Research Square ahead of peer review. ""The overall burden of death and disease following breakthrough COVID-19 will likely be substantial,"" the researchers conclude. 
Vaccine passports would allow infections to be missed
""Vaccine passports"" that exempt vaccinated people from regular COVID-19 testing would allow many infections to be missed, Israeli data suggest. Researchers analyzed infection rates in citizens returning to Israel through Ben-Gurion airport, for whom PCR tests upon arrival are required regardless of vaccination status. ""Surprisingly,"" in August 2021, the rate of positive tests among vaccinated travelers was more than double the rate among the unvaccinated, said Retsef Levi of the MIT Sloan School of Management, coauthor of a report posted on the SSRN server ahead of peer review. Travelers (NYSE:TRV) who had received the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine within the past six months or who had received a booster dose were considered vaccinated. The group considered to be unvaccinated included the never-vaccinated and those whose most recent shot was more than six months prior, given evidence of waning vaccine efficacy by then. In September, when the Israeli government was recommending booster shots for all adults, the positive-test rate dropped among vaccinated travelers and was about 3.5 times lower with vaccination than without. By October, the positive-test rate in the vaccinated group, while still lower, had started to climb again, Levi said. The data suggest that limiting frequent COVID-19 testing to unvaccinated people would ""pose potential risks by reinforcing the misrepresentation that vaccinated individuals are protected from infections.""
Masks, social distancing still worthwhile

Mask wearing and physical distancing are tied to reductions in the spread of COVID-19 and should be continued, according to researchers who reviewed 72 previous studies. When they analyzed results from eight of the studies in detail, they saw a 53% reduction in the incidence of COVID-19 with mask wearing and a 25% reduction with physical distancing. There is not yet enough data to confirm the overall benefits of more stringent measures such as lockdowns, school and workplace closures, and border closures, the researchers reported on Thursday in The BMJ. Very few of the studies analyzed were randomized trials, so they cannot prove the interventions directly reduced infection rates. Still, the researchers conclude, ""It is likely that further control of the COVID-19 pandemic depends not only on high vaccination coverage and its effectiveness but also on ongoing adherence to effective and sustainable public health measures.""

The driver told The Information that the battery drained about 40% faster than normal if the van's heating or cooling was on.
Amazon, which disclosed a 20% stake in Rivian at the end of October, in 2019 ordered 100,000 of its electric delivery vans as part of the e-commerce giant's effort to cut its carbon footprint.
Rivian had disclosed the vans would have a range of between 120 miles and 150 miles depending on their size. But that range is much lower depending on the weather, the report said. 
According to the report, Ross Rachey, Amazon's director of Global Fleets and Products, said air conditioning and heating could drain the battery in the vehicles being tested, and these vans did not have the insulation the final vehicles manufactured by Rivian will have.
The prototype van used had as many as 12 cameras inside and outside the van, but Amazon plans to add another four once the vehicles hit the road, the report said, citing Rachey.
Amazon and Rivian did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Since it went public earlier this month, Rivian has grown to become one of the most valuable automakers, even though it has just started production and delivery of its electric vehicles. 
Its shares pared gains following the news and were last up about 4%.

The move, which involves having a separate section for workers who have not had a COVID-19 vaccine, has been in place for the past month, a SEAT spokesperson told Reuters. 
The initiative is one the first of its kind implemented in Spain. 
""A few weeks ago, it was decided with the agreement of union representatives, to set up areas within the company canteens to protect unvaccinated workers,"" SEAT said in a statement. ""The areas for those who are unvaccinated have the strictest COVID measures to protect their health.""
It said these were recommendations and the company could not force people to eat separately.
The car manufacturer said the objective of the measure was to protect all workers, both unvaccinated and vaccinated, as well as to ""guarantee the operational activity of the company"". 
Mask-wearing is compulsory throughout the factory, except for the canteen. SEAT said 96% of its workers were vaccinated and received their doses at the factory. 
""This is to guarantee the health of those who are not vaccinated as well as those who are vaccinated,"" Matias Carnero, the top union leader for the UGT union at SEAT, told Reuters. 
He said of the 11,000 workers at the plant in Martorell, outside Barcelona, five ate separately this week.
Vaccination is not compulsory in Spain, which has fully vaccinated 79% of its population. It has not seen the kind of large-scale anti-vaccination protests common in several other European countries and vaccination rates have been advancing in line with the government's goal. 

The move comes as nations and companies across Europe tighten their policies around vaccination with the onset of winter and a rising number of COVID-19 cases.
Some countries have made vaccinations compulsory for all or part of the population as they grapple with rising rates including Austria, which said on Friday it would make COVID-19 vaccines compulsory.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) named Haoxiang Zhu as head of the agency's Division of Trading and Markets, where he is expected to help the regulator lead major new policies around equity market structure, among other priorities, the agency said on Friday.
Zhu, a professor of finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will begin at the SEC on Dec. 10, the agency said, adding that acting division head, David Saltiel, will serve as deputy to Zhu.
""The work of our Division of Trading and Markets links the investors in our capital markets with those companies seeking to raise money, hire employees, and grow,"" said SEC chair, Gary Gensler.
""Haoxiang brings to the SEC deep expertise and commitment to the agency's efforts to enhance and update our rules to continue to maintain markets that are the envy in the world.""
Zhu is taking up his role as the SEC contemplates a number of major equity market structure changes following January's GameStop (NYSE:GME) saga. 
Gensler told Congress earlier this year that the agency would address short selling disclosures, game-like trading prompts used by brokers, and brokers' practice of sending customer orders to wholesale market makers for a fee.
In October, the agency published a post-mortem into how amateur traders using commission-free retail brokerages drove shares in GameStop and other popular ""meme"" stocks to extreme highs, squeezing hedge funds that had bet against them.

Despite the extraordinary series of events, the SEC concluded that the basic plumbing of the market remained ""sound.""
It did not address several outstanding questions, including whether bad actors manipulated social media to whip up positive sentiment in GameStop, or whether hedge funds tried to pressure retail brokers to restrict trading in GameStop, something that all parties concerned have denied.

French-based CMA CGM, one of the world's largest container lines, said net profit rose to $5.6 billion in the third quarter from $567 million in the same period last year, while core EBITDA earnings rose to $7.1 billion from $1.7 billion.
An economic rebound following a coronavirus pandemic costs has disrupted supply chains and exacerbated logistics problems like ageing infrastructure and driver shortages.
Maersk, the world's largest container line, said this month that port delays would persist into next year.
""The pressure on effective shipping capacity for consumer goods observed since the summer of 2020 is expected to persist until at least the first half of 2022,"" CMA CGM said.
""The current context is thus likely to enable the Group to achieve an even stronger financial performance during the fourth quarter.""
The group, which is privately controlled by the Saade family, had increased its shipping capacity by nearly 6% in the year to September 2021, it said.
The company has also expanded like Maersk in non-maritime transport, using the acquisition of CEVA Logistics two years ago and the creation of an air freight division this year.
As part of its air cargo push, CMA CGM announced with Airbus on Friday an order for four A350F freighter jets.

Rising earnings have helped CMA CGM accelerate investments this year, including the planned acquisition of a port terminal in Los Angeles for around $2 billion.
The group also said its net debt had fallen sharply, standing at $11.9 billion as of Sept, 30, down $4.9 billion compared with the end of last year.

However, coal supplies are tight because production was halted for several months, and coal mines operated at reduced capacity, during the worst of the pandemic. And because output is unlikely to match the growing demand, prices should keep soaring.
Given this backdrop, we think fundamentally sound coal stocks SunCoke Energy, Inc. (SXC) and Ramaco Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:METC) could be the ideal bets on their recent price dip.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 01:27PM ET</span>",Fashion giant PVH to close factory; Ethiopia blames U.S. sanctions,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Global fashion giant PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH). is closing a manufacturing facility in Ethiopia, the company told Reuters on Friday, two weeks after the African country lost duty-free access to the United States over the ongoing conflict in Tigray.
Government spokesperson Legesse Tulu said the closure showed the impact of the ""unfair sanctions"" from the U.S. which would disproportionately affect the country's poor and women.
The move by PVH, which owns Calvin Klein, Speedo and Tommy Hilfiger, is the first retreat from a large manufacturer following suspension of duty-free access. It is a blow to the Ethiopian economy, already grappling with high inflation, drought, and a year-long war that has killed thousands of civilians and displaced millions.
This year, PVH sold several brands, and the company said this prompted it to begin planning a transition of the facility to a trusted supply partner active in Ethiopia.
""The speed and volatility of the escalating situation there made the transition no longer possible, resulting in the difficult decision to close the facility,"" PVH said in a statement.
On Nov. 2, U.S. President Joe Biden moved to suspend Ethiopia from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) ""for gross violations of internationally recognised human rights.""
Ethiopian officials had warned the suspension could take away 1 million jobs, disproportionately hurting poor women who are the majority of garment workers.
Conflict erupted last year between the federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which used to dominate national politics and now governs Tigray.
Around 400,000 people are believed to be living in famine conditions in Tigray, where the U.N. said on Thursday it has been unable to deliver food for a month.
All sides fighting in the conflict have committed violations that may amount to war crimes, the U.N. has said.
PVH arrived in Ethiopia in 2017. Like most of its peers, it was in Hawassa Industrial Park, located south of Addis Ababa and designed by the government to attract garment and textile manufacturers and make Ethiopia a light manufacturing hub.
The AGOA suspension threatens those aspirations and could force other manufacturers to close, too.
PVH did not say how many people worked at the factory and did not immediately answer a question about it.
Ethiopia exported $237 million duty-free to the U.S. last year, U.S. Commerce Department data said.
PVH said in its statement that it was still ""committed"" to its third-party manufacturing partners in Ethiopia.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Investment group EQT (NYSE:EQT) and the Struengmann family, who are investors in BioNTech, are considering a joint offer for Sandoz, the generics arm of Swiss drugmaker Novartis, Handelsblatt reported on Friday.
A potential offer could value Sandoz at more than 20 billion Swiss francs ($21.6 billion), the German daily newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources.
After years of revamping the business, Novartis in October raised the prospect of divesting Sandoz, as price pressures mount in the off-patent drug sector.
It said it had begun a strategic review which would ""explore all options, ranging from retaining the business to separation"".
The Struengmann family and EQT, who have already made several joint investments, were looking to bring further investors on board in a consortium, Handelsblatt reported.
Several other private equity firms have taken an interest in Sandoz, the newspaper report added.
EQT and Novartis declined to comment. The Struengmann family office could not immediately be reached for comment.
Sandoz would be a return to their roots for biotech investors Thomas and Andreas Struengmann, who sold generic drugs business Hexal to Novartis in 2005. Hexal became part of Sandoz. 
The Struengmann twins were early backers of BioNTech when it was founded in 2008 and remain major shareholders in the group that together with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) has developed one of the leading COVID-19 vaccinations in response to the pandemic. 
They have also retained some generic drug activities, such as their ownership of Uruguay-based Mega Pharma SA.

For Novartis, a divestment would further simplify its structure after it spun off the Alcon (NYSE:ALC) eye care business in 2019 and this month agreed to sell a nearly one-third voting stake in Roche back to its cross-town rival.

Below are the major banks' and insurers' plans for bringing staff back to work locations, with some setting return dates, while others' intentions are more fluid: 
Royal Bank of Canada: Most of the bank's 61,000 employees are working from home, but many have begun returning to offices or will do so over the coming weeks and months. Many of those will adopt a hybrid work model, working some days from home and some days in the office. 
Each business group and region is determining the best work arrangements for them, and employees will receive at least four weeks' notice before they return to offices. 
Toronto-Dominion Bank: Employees working from home are not expected to return to the bank's locations before 2022, but it is ""monitoring the evolving situation."" The bank is preparing for employees to return to TD premises when conditions allow.
Bank of Nova Scotia: Scotiabank plans to begin a phased return for head-office employees working remotely from Jan. 17. The return will be staggered for different groups and most head-office staff will follow a hybrid working model. 
Bank of Montreal: Some employees who were working from home returned to BMO locations in June, and others started during the fall. The timetable for a full-fledged return will differ by groups, teams and geographies. 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce: Most Canadian employees working from home will return to offices on a hybrid basis in early 2022. 

Manulife Financial (NYSE:MFC): Manulife expects employees in Canada and the United States to return to offices on Jan. 24, with many working three days a week - Mondays, Wednesdays and one flex day - in the office. 
In addition, the banks and insurers have put in place mandatory vaccination policies that employees will need to follow to return to their premises.

Investing.com — Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares rose 1.6% on Friday after Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives raised his price target, saying the Street continues to digest the ""massive"" EV transformation taking place in the auto industry. 
Ives raised Tesla's price target to $1,400 from $1,100, around $294 above its share price at the time of writing.
EV stocks have been rallying recently, with both Rivian and Lucid climbing over 10% on Friday. Ives sees several stocks taking advantage of the rapid EV transformation, including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID),  Rivian Automotive  Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN), and Fisker Inc (NYSE:FSR).
“We also believe the Biden Infrastructure signing kicks off the first phase of EV infrastructure (charging stations, tax credits) build-outs signaling a new era of adoption for electric vehicles in the US,"" the analyst explained. 
Ives believes this is the ""biggest transformation to the auto industry since the 1950s,"" with the potential for over 100 manufacturers to attack the $5 trillion market opportunity. He estimates Tesla could “own $2.5 trillion of this pie.”

VIENNA/BERLIN (Reuters) - Austria will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full COVID-19 lockdown, it said on Friday as neighbouring Germany warned it may follow suit, sending shivers through financial markets worried about the economic fallout.
Europe has again become the epicentre of the pandemic, accounting for half of global cases and deaths. A fourth wave of infections has plunged Germany, Europe's largest economy, into a national emergency, Health Minister Jens Spahn said, warning that vaccinations alone will not cut case numbers.
Austria said it in addition to lockdown it would require the whole population to be vaccinated from Feb. 1. Both decisions infuriated many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high, encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament.
Party leader Herbert Kickl posted a picture on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with the inscription: ""As of today Austria is a dictatorship."" The party is planning a protest on Saturday, but Kickl cannot attend because he has tested positive for COVID-19.
Roughly two-thirds of those eligible in Austria are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, one of the lowest rates in western Europe. Its infections are among the highest in Europe, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people.
""We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,"" Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference, saying the lockdown would start on Monday and the requirement to be vaccinated on Feb. 1.
""It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.""
Asked if Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown, Spahn said: ""We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out.
""We are in a national emergency,"" he told a news conference.
The threat of fresh lockdowns comes as optimism grows about experimental drugs developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Merck that cut the chance of hospitalisation and severe illness, more weapons in the world's fight against the virus.
On Friday, the EU drug regulator said it was reviewing data on Pfizer's COVID-19 pill to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval.
Looming lockdowns weighed on a range of financial market sectors on Friday, pushing stocks and oil down and boosting the dollar.
""We expect targeted measures (against COVID-19) across some countries mainly according to the health situation, but other factors, such as domestic political situations, will be relevant,"" Oxford Economics analysts said in a note. 
""And while it might take a while before a political consensus can be reached in other countries, it is clear that the tide has turned.""

CHRISTMAS CONUNDRUM
As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria's full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, said there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life.
Whether or not countries opt to lock down again depends on a wide range of factors, including vaccination rates, mask mandates and the extent to which booster shots are being made available.
Germany has said further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns.
Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open. 
While the new measures across Europe are not seen hitting the economy as much as the all-out lockdowns of last year, analysts say they could weigh on the recovery in the last quarter, especially if they hurt the retail and hospitality sectors over Christmas.
A full lockdown in Germany would be more serious, however.
""With Germany ... imposing new restrictions, any thoughts that the vaccines would offer a way to a more normal Christmas period appear to have gone up in smoke for now, in Europe at least,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
""Although there is a nagging fear this could ripple out across the region.""
The pressure on intensive care units in Germany has not yet reached its peak, Spahn said, urging people to reduce contacts to help break the wave. ""How Christmas will turn out, I dare not say. I can only say it's up to us,"" he added.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday Germany will limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of COVID-19 patients to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness.

""It’s clear from our experience in England and from what’s happening across Europe that while vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting ... other interventions are required to prevent case numbers rising,"" said Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick.
""Less mask wearing, more mixing indoors due to colder weather and waning immunity are also contributing to the high case levels across Europe.""

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 12:41PM ET</span>",A look at the intimate details Amazon knows about us,"By Chris Kirkham and Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - As a Virginia lawmaker, Ibraheem Samirah has studied internet privacy issues and debated how to regulate tech firms’ collection of personal data. Still, he was stunned to learn the full details of the information Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has collected on him.
The e-commerce giant had more than 1,000 contacts from his phone. It had records of exactly which part of the Quran that Samirah, who was raised as a Muslim, had listened to on Dec. 17 of last year. The company knew every search he had made on its platform, including one for books on “progressive community organizing” and other sensitive health-related inquiries he thought were private.
“Are they selling products, or are they spying on everyday people?” asked Samirah, a Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates.
Samirah was among the few Virginia legislators who opposed an industry-friendly, Amazon-drafted state privacy bill that passed earlier this year. At Reuters’ request, Samirah asked Amazon to disclose the data it collected on him as a consumer.
The company gathers a vast array of information on its U.S. customers, and it started making that data available to all upon request early last year, after trying and failing to defeat a 2018 California measure requiring such disclosures. (U.S. Amazon customers can obtain their data by filling out a form on Amazon.com. https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GXPU3YPMBZQRWZK2)
Seven Reuters reporters also obtained their Amazon files. The data reveals the company’s ability to amass strikingly intimate portraits of individual consumers.
Amazon collects data on consumers through its Alexa voice assistant, its e-commerce marketplace, Kindle e-readers, Audible audiobooks, its video and music platforms, home-security cameras and fitness trackers. Alexa-enabled devices make recordings inside people’s homes, and Ring security cameras capture every visitor.
Such information can reveal a person’s height, weight and health; their ethnicity (via clues contained in voice data) and political leanings; their reading and buying habits; their whereabouts on any given day, and sometimes whom they have met.
One reporter’s dossier revealed that Amazon had collected more than 90,000 Alexa recordings of family members between December 2017 and June 2021 – averaging about 70 daily. The recordings included details such as the names of the reporter’s young children and their favorite songs.
Amazon captured the children asking how they could convince their parents to let them “play,” and getting detailed instructions from Alexa on how to convince their parents to buy them video games. Be fully prepared, Alexa advised the kids, to refute common parent arguments such as “too violent,” “too expensive” and “you’re not doing well enough in school.” The information came from a third-party program used by Alexa called “wikiHow” that provides how-to advice from more than 180,000 articles, according to Amazon’s website.
Amazon said it does not own wikiHow, but that Alexa sometimes responds to requests with information from websites.
Some recordings involved conversations between family members using Alexa devices to communicate across different parts of the house. Several recordings captured children apologizing to their parents after being disciplined. Others picked up the children, ages 7, 9 and 12, asking Alexa questions about terms like “pansexual.”
In one recording, a child asks: “Alexa, what is a vagina?” In another: “Alexa, what does bondage mean?”
The reporter did not realize Amazon was storing the recordings before the company disclosed the data it tracked on the family.
Amazon says its Alexa products are designed to record as little as possible, starting with the trigger word, “Alexa,” and stopping when the user’s command ends. The recordings of the reporter’s family, however, sometimes captured longer conversations.
In a statement, Amazon said it has scientists and engineers working to improve the technology and avoid false triggers that prompt recording. The company said it alerts customers that recordings are stored when they set up Alexa accounts.
Amazon said it collects personal data to improve products and services and customize them to individuals. Asked about the records of Samirah listening to the Quran on Amazon’s audiobooks service, Amazon said such data allows customers to pick up where they left off from a prior session.
The only way for customers to delete much of this personal data is to close their account, Amazon said. The company said it retains some information, such as purchase history, after account closure to comply with legal obligations.
Amazon said it allows customers to adjust their settings on voice assistants and other services to limit the amount of data collected. Alexa users, for instance, can stop Amazon from saving their recordings or have them automatically deleted periodically. And they can disconnect their contacts or calendars from their smart-speaker devices if they don’t want to use Alexa’s calling or scheduling functions.
A customer can opt out of having their Alexa recordings examined, but they must navigate a series of menus and two warnings that say: “If you turn this off, voice recognition and new features may not work well for you.” Asked about the warnings, Amazon said consumers who limit data collection may not be able to personalize some features, such as music playback.
Samirah, 30, got an Amazon Alexa-enabled smart speaker during last year’s holiday season. He said he only used it for three days before returning it after realizing it was collecting recordings. “It really sketched me out,” he said.
The device had already gathered all of his phone contacts, part of a feature that allows users to make calls through the device. Amazon said Alexa users must give permission for the company to access phone contacts. Customers must disable access to phone contacts, not just delete the Alexa app, in order to delete the records from their Amazon account.
Samirah said he was also unnerved that Amazon had detailed records of his audiobook and Kindle reading sessions. Finding information about his listening to the Quran disclosed in his Amazon file, he said, made Samirah think about the history of U.S. police and intelligence agencies surveilling Muslims for suspected terrorist links after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
“Why do they need to know that?” he asked. Samirah’s term ends in January, after he lost a bid for re-election earlier this year.
At times, law-enforcement agencies seek data on customers from technology companies. Amazon discloses that it complies with search warrants and other lawful court orders seeking data the company keeps on an account, while objecting to “overbroad or otherwise inappropriate requests.”
Amazon data for the three years ending in June 2020, the latest available, show the company complied at least partially with 75% of subpoenas, search warrants and other court orders seeking data on U.S. customers. The company fully complied with 38% of those requests.
Amazon stopped disclosing how often it complies with such requests last year. Asked why, Amazon said it expanded the scope of the U.S. report to make it global, and “streamlined” the information from each country on law enforcement inquiries.
The company said it is obligated to comply with “valid and binding orders,” but that its goal is to release “the minimum” required by law.
Amazon’s 3,500-word privacy policy, which links to more than 20 other pages related to privacy and user settings, gives the company wide latitude to collect data. Amazon said the policy describes its collection, use and sharing of data “in a way that is easy for consumers to understand.”
That information can get quite personal. Amazon’s Kindle e-readers, for instance, precisely track a user’s reading habits, another reporter’s Amazon data file showed. The disclosure included records of more than 3,700 reading sessions since 2017, including timestamped logs – to the millisecond – of books read. Amazon also tracks words highlighted or looked up, pages turned and promotions seen.

It showed, for instance, that a family member read “The Mitchell Sisters: A Complete Romance Series” on Aug. 8, 2020, from 4:52 p.m. until 7:36 p.m., flipping 428 pages.
Florian Schaub, a privacy researcher at the University of Michigan, said businesses are not always transparent about what they’re doing with users’ data. “We have to rely on Amazon doing the right thing,” he said, “rather than being confident the data can’t be misused.”

Industry analysts say the auto sector in Italy could be hit harder than elsewhere because of the small average size of firms in the country and the scale of investment needed to comply with the European Union's ""Fit-For-55"" climate plan to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030.
Unions and Italy's business lobby Confindustria alike have said many small and medium-sized countries may be forced to close unless the government provides tax breaks and incentives for the sector. 
""In spite of the complaints and requests from trade unions and companies, in the budget law the government has not included any intervention to support a sector overwhelmed by changes caused by the energy and green transition,"" Ferdinando Uliano, Head of FIM CISL union, and Stefano Boschini, FIM CISL Chief for the automotive sector, said in a statement. 
A group of industry associations for the automotive sector also issued a statement on Friday to complain about the lack of support in the budget law and in Italy's plan for the post-pandemic recovery.
FIM CISL's top officials urged the government to create a fund to shield workers and small and medium enterprises, adding that incentives were needed to encourage the purchase of electric and hybrid cars and the renewal of public administrations' car fleets.
FIM CISL also asked the industry ministry to define conditions and advantages to attract investments from multinational groups including Vitesco Technologies, Bosch and Denso. 

The automotive supply chain in Italy employs 278,000 direct and indirect workers and accounts for 6.2% of the gross domestic product, the country's automotive association ANFIA says.
The union did not say how it had calculated the number of those jobs that are at risk.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Detroit's Big Three automakers, General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler parent Stellantis lag other automakers in fuel economy performance as they sell a rising number of large trucks and SUVs, a government report released on Friday shows.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said fuel economy for new vehicles hit a high in the 2020 model year at 25.4 miles per gallon but added that projected industry fuel economy for the 2021 model year will decline to 25.3 mpg.
The three U.S. automakers have the lowest fleet wide fuel economy of 14 major car companies. 
GM is projected to be the lowest of all automakers in 2021 with a fleet average of 21.5 mpg for all its vehicles, just behind Stellantis at 21.6 mpg, with  Ford Motor Co  at 22.7 mpg.
The report said since 2004, carbon dioxide emissions have decreased by 24% as fuel economy has improved by 32%. 
The report said only Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) and Honda Motor met requirements without using credits. Automakers can either purchase credits or use credits earned from earlier model years.
The report shows GM,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes and Stellantis all bought significant credits in 2020, while Tesla, Honda and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) all sold credits.
In August, the EPA proposed reversing the Trump-era loosening of vehicle emissions rules with a new plan to boost efficiency 10% in the 2023 model year, aiming for a fleet average of 52 mpg by 2026.
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said ""automakers are producing cars that are barely more fuel efficient on average than what they sold a year ago.""
Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign, said the report shows ""auto companies have made sky-high promises to turn out clean cars, but the EPA’s report shows they have produced very few.""
He said the 2020 improvement - just 1.9% over 2019 - showed that ""with weak rules, automakers will keep pushing gas guzzlers, sticking consumers with high gas bills and plentiful pollution.""
For 2020, GM and Ford both averaged 23 miles per gallon, while Stellantis averaged 21.3 mpg. Tesla, which makes only electric vehicles, led the industry, while Honda averaged 29.1 mpg, which was first among automakers building gas-powered vehicles.
The report showed that over the last five years, GM's and Ford's performances barely improved, while Stellantis' fell by 0.5 mpg.

Stellantis said on Friday it is investing more than $35 billion through 2025 to develop battery electric vehicles but said ""consumer and manufacturing incentives and recharging infrastructure"" are needed to move the market toward EVs.
The report also showed average vehicle weight in 2020 rose to another all-time high of 4,166 pounds, while average horsepower and size both also set records.

(Reuters) -European stocks ended in the red on Friday, clocking their first weekly decline in seven weeks on concerns over the economic damage from fresh COVID-19 lockdowns in the region that hammered cyclical sectors such as banks and automakers.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3% after hovering near record highs earlier in the session. The index ended the week 0.1% lower.
It lost ground after news that Austria will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full COVID-19 lockdown this autumn to tackle a new wave of infections.
Germany's Health Minister Jens Spahn said the coronavirus situation in the country was so grave that a lockdown, including for people who have been vaccinated, cannot be ruled out.
""Any thoughts that the vaccines would offer a way to a more normal Christmas period appear to have gone up in smoke for now, in Europe at least, although there is a nagging fear this could ripple out across the region,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
Frankfurt shares fell 0.4%, while sectors more exposed to economic cycles such as banks, automakers and travel & leisure fell between 1.5% and 2.2%.
South European markets, including those in Spain and Italy, fell about 1.5% each.
European stocks have hit a series of record highs this month as a stronger-than-expected earnings season helped investors look past concerns about rising inflationary pressures.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said inflation in the euro zone will fade so the ECB should not tighten policy as it could choke off the recovery, and hinted at continued bond purchases next year.
The ECB is due to decide on the future of its bond-purchase programmes at its Dec. 16 policy meeting.

LONDON (Reuters) - COVID-19 lockdowns have returned anew to haunt Europe's economic prospects, forcing investors on Friday to reassess portfolios and sell vulnerable assets such as the euro and bank stocks.
Days after the Netherlands, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic reimposed curbs, Austria put itself back under lockdown and Germany's health minister refused to rule out one.
Markets were little soothed by Germany's foreign minister ruling out a lockdown and mandatory vaccinations for all to tabloid Bild. 
The developments upended the buoyant mood in European equity markets where French and German shares had hit a string of record highs, thanks to a strong earnings recovery.
A pan-European equity index, up 80% from March 2020, slipped half a percent on Friday.
""One thing is certain, if the whole of Europe had to go under lockdown once more, and depending on how long that would last, we would need to rethink our growth scenarios,"" said Stephane Ekolo, a global equity strategist at the brokerage Tradition.
As markets started scaling back wagers on euro zone interest rate rises for next year, an index of European banks plunged 2.5%, its biggest daily drop since late September.
The question now is to what extent lockdowns might hammer expectations for fourth-quarter earnings. Refinitiv I/B/E/S currently flags a 51% rise for the STOXX 600 benchmark, only marginally below 60% in Q3.
It still compares favourably with predictions of a 21% earnings growth for S&P 500 companies.
But some ominous signs had emerged for Europe even before the latest COVID resurgence. European data lags U.S. equivalents by the biggest margin in over a year, according to economic surprise indexes compiled by Citi.
Hospitality turnover was also weakening, Oxford Economics pointed out, noting Germany's 3.5% drop in September.
""Markets have been aware for a few weeks now that this winter will be difficult and that the vaccination rollout doesn't reduce lockdown risk by 100%,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The setback, if it deepens, will prove painful to many. BofA's widely followed monthly investor survey showed funds most bullish on euro zone equities, with a 33% ""overweight"" and EU banks especially in favour.
Cau says it is too early to see the lockdowns as a gamechanger and that investors are booking profits off recent sizzling rallies. And deeply negative inflation-adjusted bond yields probably means that the tsunami of cash chasing global stocks will not ebb entirely. 
And there will be winners: healthcare stocks rose 1% on Friday, while the technology sector gained 0.6%.
BUND BOOST
Investors made a beeline for bonds, turning Germany's entire yield curve negative for the first time since August as 30-year government borrowing costs fell below 0%.
Ten-year yields, the euro area benchmark, dropped as much as 6 basis points to the lowest since mid-September at -0.342%. 
The euro tumbled to more than six-year lows versus the Swiss franc and approached 16-month troughs against the greenback.
""It's just building, that story of the pandemic not being quite over in Europe and that's a knee-jerk flight to quality,"" said Peter McCallum, rates strategist at Mizuho.
""The more that becomes a theme and we get the market thinking about a dovish ECB....we've got some room to fill the (10-year Bund yield) gap down to -0.45%,"" he added.
Some market watchers are starting to look beyond Europe.

 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) noted that on the cusp of winter, vaccination rates in Austria and Germany at 64% and 69% were well above the U.S. 58% level.
""Although all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the United States be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter?"" the bank wrote.

Investing.com – Biomarin stock (NASDAQ:BMRN) soared 8% Friday as a U.S. regulator approved the company’s injection aimed at improving growth in children suffering from achondroplasia.
The condition, achondroplasia, is a genetic disorder affecting bone growth and is the most common form of disproportionate short stature.
Given the Food and Drug Administration has cleared the drug under its accelerated approval pathway, the company still needs to conduct a post-marketing study.
BioMarin's drug, Voxzogo, works by reducing the activity of a gene that prevents normal bone growth in patients with the disorder.
The European Commission had given the approval in August, making the drug the first therapeutic treatment for achondroplasia. Marketing authorization reviews are in process in Japan, Brazil, and Australia with potential approvals in these countries in 2022, the company said.
BioMarin said Voxzogo should be available in the U.S. by late-December."

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Investment giant Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc made a $6.2 billion approach for troubled Australian casino firm Crown Resorts Ltd, sweetening an earlier offer as its main rival bidder is beset by regulatory problems.
The A$12.50-a-share proposal, disclosed by Crown on Friday, is the third from Blackstone and pushed Crown's shares 17% higher. The stock was still below Blackstone's indicative price, suggesting a degree of doubt that a deal will eventuate.
The revised offer puts Blackstone in the box seat to win control of Crown, which has faced devastating misconduct inquiries in every state it operates in, plus protracted COVID-19 lockdowns.
Rival bidder Star Entertainment Group Ltd, an Australian casino operator, has backed off its proposed deal citing regulatory uncertainty. It now faces its own misconduct allegations.
Crown still faces a public inquiry into governance and anti-money laundering compliance at its second-biggest earning casino, in Western Australia state, as well as a federal anti-money laundering investigation. 
The company founded by billionaire James Packer has already acknowledged to regulators in New South Wales and Victoria that it failed to prevent criminal transactions.
The most consequential of the inquiries, which threatened to withdraw the gambling licence in Victoria behind three quarters of Crown's profit, ultimately cleared the company last month to keep operating under supervision.
Crown had favoured Star's buyout approach over an earlier Blackstone proposal, but Star's troubles threaten to derail any attempt to reopen talks and Blackstone's latest proposal matches Star's cash option.
""Crown is a high-quality, strategic asset,"" said Steve Johnson, chief investment officer at Forager Funds Management.
It was ""not surprising private equity is back at the table"" after it was allowed to keep its Victorian licence, but Blackstone's offer appeared to undervalue Crown, Johnson added.
Crown said its board would consider the latest Blackstone proposal although it had not yet formed a view on its merits.
A spokesperson for Blackstone, Crown's second biggest shareholder with 9.99% of its shares, confirmed the offer without commenting further.

A Star spokesperson said recently the company had withdrawn its Crown proposal but ""as we have said consistently since that time, The Star remains open to exploring potential value enhancing opportunities with Crown"".

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc subjects female workers to ""nightmarish"" conditions of rampant sexual harassment at its main factory, and supervisors turn their backs when complaints are brought, according to a new lawsuit.
Jessica Barraza, 38, said she has endured ""near daily"" catcalls and inappropriate touching in her three years at the electric vehicle maker's factory in Fremont, California, where she works night shifts as a production associate.
The married mother of two said male workers would routinely proposition her, stare at her breasts, describe her as having an ""onion booty"" or ""Coke bottle,"" and brush up against her body while pretending it was accidental.
Barraza, a Modesto, California resident, said the final straw came on Sept. 28, when a man snuck up behind her and put his leg between her thighs as she clocked in from her lunch break.
""Oh, my bad,"" he said, chuckling, after she jumped away, according to Thursday's complaint in a California state court in Alameda County, outside San Francisco.
Barraza said Tesla's human resources department has not addressed complaints she filed in September and October, and even disabled its mailto:hr@tesla.com email address for receiving complaints. 
Tesla did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. It closed its main press office in 2020. Barraza's lawsuit was reported earlier by the Washington Post.
The automaker run by billionaire Elon Musk is not unfamiliar with claims of mistreatment at the Fremont factory.
A federal jury in San Francisco on Oct. 4 ordered Tesla to pay Owen Diaz, a Black former elevator operator, $136.9 million because he faced racial harassment there.
Tesla on Nov. 16 sought to overturn that verdict.
It said it ""abhors and condemns"" all racial slurs, and that even if it should have done better rooting out racism the most Diaz deserved was $600,000. 
Barraza is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for violations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act.

She also said that like many ""tech employers,"" Tesla requires many workers to sign arbitration agreements, keeping workplace disputes out of court, but that her agreement's ""unconscionable"" terms make it unenforceable.
Barraza said she is on doctor-ordered medical leave, with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound fertilizer stocks  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR), The Mosaic (MOS), and Intrepid Potash (NYSE:IPI). Read on.Soaring fertilizer prices have been worrying farmers. The Green Markets North American Fertilizer Price Index increased by 4.4% to hit $1,094.35 per short ton on November 12, 2021, surpassing the $1,048.23 per short ton previous high set the week before. Farmers are unable and unwilling to soak up the price hikes as they set their sights on shifting to other less fertilizer-intensive crops.
Meanwhile, natural gas prices in Europe and Asia have skyrocketed to record highs due to low storage levels and supply constraints. This is contributing to increasing fertilizer prices. Natural gas is a necessary raw material for making nitrogen fertilizers like ammonia, urea, and nitrates. In addition, China has restricted its fertilizer exports until June 2022 to maintain domestic availability. So, fertilizer prices are expected to remain high amid demand-supply imbalances.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to scoop up quality fertilizer stocks Nutrien Ltd. (NTR), The  Mosaic Company  (NYSE:MOS), and Intrepid Potash, Inc. (IPI) to capitalize on the rising fertilizer prices due to the supply constraints.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday said an affiliate of consulting firm McKinsey & Co has agreed to pay $18 million for compliance failures in handling nonpublic information.
McKinsey's affiliate MIO Partners, which handles investments for current and former McKinsey employees, maintained inadequate policies and procedures to prevent partners from misusing material nonpublic information they obtained as consultants to public companies and other clients while they were simultaneously overseeing the MIO's investment decisions, the SEC said in a statement. MIO was investing hundreds of millions of dollars in companies that McKinsey was advising. 
Some McKinsey partners who oversaw MIO’s investment choices also had access to material nonpublic information as a result of their McKinsey consulting work. They had routine access to confidential information including financial results, planned bankruptcy filings, and mergers and acquisitions, the SEC said.

MIO Partners, which did not admit or deny the SEC's findings, agreed to a cease-and-desist order and censure in addition to the civil penalty.

Investing.com – Farfetch stock (NYSE:FTCH) slumped 8% Friday as the luxury retailer’s third-quarter sales disappointed and it lowered its guidance.
Gross merchandise value of goods sold rose 28% to exceed $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter.
GMV is the most commonly used barometer to determine the size and health of an e-commerce site and signifies the total value of products and services sold on the platform.
Revenue rose 33% year-over-year to $583 million as supply from both multi-brand retailers and other partners continued to increase.
GMV had risen 40% and revenue 43% year-on-year in the second quarter.
Revenue was lower than expectations, however, and the company attributed the slowing pace to strong comparative growth delivered in the third quarter of 2020.
Farfetch closed September with 3.5 million active consumers compared to 2.7 million at the end of the same month in 2020.
The adjusted loss of 14 cents narrowed from last time and was ahead of estimates.
The retailer now expects its digital platform GMV to grow by 33%, down from the 35% to 40% growth forecast it had put out just three months back.
Digital platform GMV in the third quarter rose 23%, to $829 million.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 11:03AM ET</span>",Near-term indicators point to a breather for bitcoin,"By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Medha Singh
(Reuters) - Cryptocurrency market indicators such as average bitcoin funding rates, inflows into crypto investment products and the ratio of old-to-new coins being sold suggest a near-term consolidation for the sector and lower odds of a year-end rally bitcoin bulls are predicting.
Bitcoin rose 1.6% on Friday to $57,850.56 but was on track for weekly losses of over 11%, its worst week since May. It is 16% lower than its Nov. 10 record high of $69,000. Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market value, was 14% off of its peak at $4,202.45.
Market participants cited profit-taking after bitcoin hit those highs, its increasing sensitivity to global inflation expectations and regulatory headwinds as behind the week's declines.
Concerns that creditors of Mt Gox, a crypto exchange that collapsed in 2014, could liquidate their bitcoin-denominated repayments also weighed on sentiment.
In the past week, traders have become less willing to pay to hold long positions in bitcoin futures. Average funding rates, a barometer for sentiment in the perpetual swaps market, have fallen to around 0.008%, according to cryptocurrency analytics platform CryptoQuant, their lowest since early October.
Positive funding rates imply that traders are bullish, as they must pay to hold a long position.
""Do we set new highs before the end of the year? I'd say we've come a long way,"" said Paul Eisma, head of trading at crypto firm XBTO Group in New York, adding he expected bitcoin to trade between $53,000 and $57,000 for the rest of the year. 
Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade over the weekend, its first major update since 2017 that enables its blockchain to execute more complex transactions, was well telegraphed and largely priced in as the asset rallied into the event, market experts said.
There is also increased spending of older coins -- associated with long-term investors exiting their positions -- though it remains small in relative magnitude, according to blockchain data provider Glassnode. 
A ratio between short-term and long-term bitcoin holders signaled stable equilibrium between 1-week and 1-year old coins, meaning a balanced distribution between newer and older, ""smart money"" investors and indicating a likely period of consolidation. Tops in price are typically established when large volumes of coins are held by newer investors.

The administration is reviewing whether Paxlovid, the antiviral from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), can be available on the commercial market in retail pharmacies if it gets regulatory clearance, the Journal reported.
Molnupiravir, an oral pill from Merck & Co Inc and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP that is also under regulatory review, may be included in the government's plan to make it commercially available, the journal reported, citing the person. 
The United States has agreed to buy 10 million courses of Pfizer's drug and has so far secured 3.1 million courses of Merck's pill. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently reviewing applications for emergency use authorization of the drugs.
Pfizer pointed to its supply deal with the U.S. government announced on Thursday, in response to a Reuters request for comment. Merck and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) did not immediately respond. 

Both drugs are viewed as promising weapons in the fight against the public health crisis, with countries scrambling to secure supply deals after promising data reported by the companies.
The U.S. government is pushing the drugmakers to boost production, the report said, adding that commercial sales could occur when supply of the pills increases.

BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) - French cosmetics giant L'Oreal is offering shopping vouchers to some Chinese customers to settle a dispute over discounts that drew the ire of the country's top two livestreaming sales stars, the pair said.
Li Jiaqi, known as ""lipstick brother"", and fellow top influencer Viya gave details of the compensation scheme to followers during a livestreaming event late on Thursday. L'Oreal Paris confirmed the details on its Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account in China. 
The duo this week said they had cut ties with L'Oreal after some followers said facial products the pair had promoted as carrying the biggest discounts of the year during  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group's Singles Day shopping promotion could be bought for less days later on L'Oreal's own platform.
The spat has thrown the spotlight on the sway of popular culture personalities in China and how retail companies are relying on them to market products.
Li, 29, who counts 47 million followers on his Taobao livestream room and Viya, 36, who counts 92 million, have risen to become two of the country’s most influential shopping hosts.
Li started his career as a cosmetics counter sales person. He has built his popularity with entertaining and at times, critical commentary on cosmetics, famously trying on hundreds of lipsticks in one sitting.
Viya, who won a popular singing contest in China early on in her career, shot to fame selling products ranging from fashion apparel to houses. 
She has grown her fan base with a laid-back, intimate conversation style, and has hosted Singles Day livestream shopping sessions featuring U.S. stars including Kim Kardashian, patching in from abroad.
News that Viya and Li had suspended their collaboration with L'Oreal, giving the company 24 hours to come up with a plan to compensate customers who felt misled about shopping discounts, became one of the most viewed topics on China's Twitter-like Weibo social media network on Thursday, with 450 million hits.
According to the pair, L'Oreal is to offer a coupon of 200 yuan ($31) to consumers who spent more than 999 yuan over the last 11 days in October on facial masks at the center of the dispute, redeemable for any L'Oreal products. 
Those who purchased the facial masks but did not spend 999 yuan, are eligible for two coupons, worth 100 yuan each, that can be used when the buyer spends at least 499 yuan.
L'Oreal, which apologised to customers for a ""too complicated promotion mechanism"", said earlier it had found a constructive and satisfactory solution to address the complaints.

According to Chinese media, Li and Viya pre-sold a combined 18.9 billion yuan ($2.96 billion) worth of goods on Oct. 20 in pre-Singles Day promotions. China is the biggest sales growth engine for luxury goods and cosmetics groups.

However, to us the sneaker giant  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) doesn’t look fit enough financially to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. So, we think it could be worth betting instead on footwear stocks  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL),  Shoe Carnival  (NASDAQ:SCVL), and Caleres (NYSE:CAL), which possess strong fundamentals. So, let’s discuss these names.
The footwear industry suffered declining sales and profits last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, efforts to strengthen digital platforms, launch smart concepts of connected fabrics, customized material innovations, rising consumer spending and pent-up demand for multifunctional convertible shoes have been driving the footwear market’s growth of late. The sector is projected to witness a significant boost in both e-commerce and brick-and-mortar store sales. The global footwear market is expected to reach $281.2 billion by 2026, registering a 3% CAGR.
Although the leading athletic footwear company NIKE, Inc. (NKE) is preparing for the metaverse, its business has most recently been impacted by global supply chain issues. In its last earnings report, the company lowered its fiscal 2022 outlook to account for longer transit times, labor shortages, and extended production shutdowns in Vietnam. Also, NKE expects its full-year sales to increase by mid-single digits, compared with a prior outlook of low double-digit growth. Furthermore, analysts expect NKE’s EPS to decrease 19.2% in the current quarter and 17.8% in the next quarter.
Therefore, we think fundamentally sound footwear stocks Foot Locker, Inc. (FL), Shoe Carnival (NYSE:CUK), Inc. (SCVL), and Caleres, Inc. (CAL) could be ideal bets instead to capitalize on the industry’s solid growth prospects.

1634,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 09:54AM ET</span>","House Passes Biden’s Economic Plan, With Senate Fate Uncertain","(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s signature plan to expand the social safety net, address climate change and rewrite tax policies passed the House Friday morning as Speaker Nancy Pelosi united fractious Democrats to send the legislation to the Senate, where its fate remains uncertain.
The 220-213 vote, followed months of intra-party squabbling. It came only after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office delivered a cost estimate for the bill, which moderates had demanded before casting their votes. The CBO finding that it would increase the deficit by $367 billion of a decade proved acceptable to enough holdouts for the bill to pass. Maine Representative Jared Golden was the only Democrat to vote no, along with all Republicans.
The House action is an incremental political victory for Biden -- his agenda is still far from the finish line. Democratic senators are expected to make extensive changes before voting on it, potentially in December. Passage in that chamber will require unanimous support from the Democratic caucus, and two pivotal members, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have yet to give their full public support. Republicans are united in opposition.
Pelosi’s plan to pass the legislation on Thursday was delayed by House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who spoke for more than eight hours on the House floor to criticize the bill as the “single most reckless and irresponsible spending bill in our nation’s history.”
The Build Back Better proposal, as Biden’s plan is known, would spend $1.64 trillion over ten years, according to the CBO’s analysis. When tax credits are factored in, the investment in the economy is more than $2 trillion, however. The spending increases and tax cuts add up to $2.4 trillion according to an analysis by the watchdog group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
It would provide universal pre-K, childcare subsidies, four weeks of subsidized paid family leave, subsidized Obamacare premiums and an alternative to Medicaid in some states, and would allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices for the first time while capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors. Medicare would cover hearing benefits for the first time. 
The legislation aims to fight climate change by imposing a fee on methane and providing a slew of tax credits for renewable energy and electric vehicle purchases, and it would provide relief from deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants.
On the tax side, the bill would extend expanded child tax credits and make them permanently refundable to those without sufficient income-tax liability to get the full benefit. It would also increase the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes, a provision that will benefit wealthy taxpayers and which has sparked some push-back from progressives. 
To raise revenue, it would impose a new 15% corporate minimum tax and a 5% surtax on individual incomes over $10 million, with an additional 3% tax above income of $25 million. There are also taxes on large individual retirement accounts, stock buybacks and nicotine. 
Republican Opposition
Republicans point to data showing the biggest jump in year-over-year inflation in 30 years in arguing against the bill. They contend the Democrats’ plan would stoke inflation by pumping more money into the economy at a time of supply-chain bottlenecks and worker shortages. GOP lawmakers also say it provides disincentives to work, by de-linking the child tax credit from employment requirements.
White House economic adviser Brian Deese has said the bill would reduce inflation by lowering healthcare, childcare and drug costs and encouraging more workers to enter the workforce.
The White House estimates that the bill cuts the deficit by $112.5 billion over ten years when its estimate of higher tax revenue from increased tax enforcement is included.
“I have confidence in that estimate,” said moderate Democratic holdout Stephanie Murphy of Florida. “I feel that this bill is in good fiscal discipline standing”
Overall, it’s a smaller package than Biden and some Democrats initially envisioned. Progressives initially wanted a $6 trillion bill and compromised on a $3.5 trillion top-line this summer, before agreeing to further cuts to their ambitions. Proposals such as free community college and Medicare vision and dental benefits were dropped due to opposition from Manchin and Sinema, while other proposals such as the child tax credit expansion were shortened to just a year.  
A compromise was struck this month to add in elements of House Democrats’ drug-price legislation. That proposal allows limited negotiation for a set number of drugs, provides rebates to seniors if prices rise faster than inflation and caps out-of-pocket costs. The provisions don’t feature a tax penalty on drug companies that fail to lower prices for private insurance, however.
More cuts to the bill may be coming very soon. The Senate’s top rules official over next week’s Thanksgiving recess will review the package and determine whether any provisions, such as a new policy addressing immigration, break the chamber’s rules for the special budget process that Democrats are using to ram the bill through without any Republican support. That would force Democrats to drop the proposals in order to continue to use the filibuster-proof budget tool to pass the legislation. 
Senate Changes
Manchin and Sinema will largely determine whether the Senate can pass the Biden bill before the end of 2022 and how much further it is trimmed back. Manchin has objected to the four weeks of guaranteed paid family leave in the House bill, as well as an immigration proposal granting deportation relief for some undocumented immigrants and a new Medicare hearing-aid benefit. 
The Senate is also not fully on board with a provision lifting the $10,000 cap on federal deductions of state and local taxes to $80,000. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Bob Menendez of New Jersey have proposed an alternative, of means-testing the cap to up to $500,000 in income. Colorado Senator Michael Bennet is also fighting against attempts to lift the SALT cap. 
The job of resolving those conflicts and navigating Senate floor amendments on the bill will fall to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who said this week he wants to have it all wrapped up before Congress breaks for the Dec. 25 Christmas holiday. That would then allow the House to vote on the Senate-amended version.
Some elements of the House-passed bill appear to have the 50 votes needed to pass the Senate, including most of the tax increases on the wealthy and businesses. Biden last month concluded months of back-room talks with senators and said that these items can garner enough votes to pass. 
Consensus has largely been achieved on a provision to make the child tax credit permanently refundable for low-income parents without an income tax liability and for one year boost the payments to as much as $3,600 per child. The same holds for subsidies for Obamacare insurance premiums and a provision to provide insurance to the poor living in the 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility. 
The bill also addresses climate change, including tax incentives for renewable energy generation, the purchase of electric vehicles, biofuels, and energy storage, are likely to pass. More vulnerable to being cut are a first-time fee on the emission of methane -- a potent greenhouse gas -- from the oil and gas sector while barring oil drilling in oil drilling in most U.S. waters and Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, due to Manchin opposition. 
Democrats hope that progress on the economic bill, paired with enactment earlier in the month of the largest infrastructure investment in decades, will boost Biden’s flagging popularity and the chances of the party bucking historical trends in order to keep its congressional majorities in the 2022 midterm elections. Biden’s job approval sank to 36% in a a national survey conducted by the Quinnipiac University Poll and released Thursday.

Earlier Friday, Austria announced plans to reimpose a full Covid-19 lockdown to combat soaring infections, becoming the first country in western Europe to reimpose such severe sanctions. Neighboring Germany warned it may follow suit, raising fears of another step backwards in global economic activity.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 200 points, or 0.6% at 35,879 points. The S&P 500 was also down 0.1%, but the  Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4%, climbing to a new record high. 
Stocks of tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) headed higher Friday as investors sought out the safety of these financially strong companies, although Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) underperformed following a report that the iPhone-maker may debut its electric car as soon as 2025.
On the flip side, stocks linked to the travel industry, like the airlines Delta (NYSE:DAL), United (NASDAQ:UAL) and American (NASDAQ:AAL) and the cruise operators, Norwegian (NYSE:NCLH) and Carnival (NYSE:CUK), were hit hard by the lockdown news. Additionally, oil firms  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) fell 2.1% and 1.8% as crude prices sank.
Elsewhere,  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) stock slumped almost 8% after the sports apparel retailer warned of global supply constraints heading into the busiest time of the year for retailers, while Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) stock traded 6% lower amid valuation concerns over its proposal to buy VNDLY for over $500 million.

In other news, the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on President Joe Biden's $1.75 trillion social spending bill on Friday. If the measure passes, it would still need approval in the Senate before Biden could sign it into law. 
Additionally, Federal Reserve policymakers Richard Clarida and Christopher Waller are due to speak Friday, with investors looking for signs of increased concern at the surging inflation levels in the economy, as this could point to a speeding up of the central bank’s tapering process.

FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany's Lufthansa is in talks with Boeing (NYSE:BA) on buying a possible new freighter version of the 777X jetliner, while welcoming competition with a new Airbus A350 cargo plane, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said on Friday.
""We have been negotiating about this morning, but there is much more negotiation to be done,"" Spohr said at an event to present the upcoming Boeing 777X passenger plane.
Fitted with bulky test equipment instead of seats, the giant twin-engined test plane stopped off in Frankfurt after visiting the Dubai Airshow, where host Emirates is the largest 777X customer, and Qatar, whose flag carrier is also a customer.
Spohr's comments come amid competition to sell new cargo planes to meet demand in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.
Qatar Airways said this week it had an ""interesting"" proposal from Boeing for a potential 777X freighter, for which it is widely expected to be a launch customer later this year.
Airbus this week announced an inaugural leasing customer for the freighter version of its A350 as it seeks to break into a Boeing-dominated market for cargo planes.
Bloomberg News reported it may announce a new freighter order later on Friday.
Cargolux, a major operator of Boeing 747 freighters, is being heavily wooed by Airbus, industry sources said.
Simple Flying reported last month that a delegation from the Luxembourg-based cargo carrier had visited Airbus headquarters in Toulouse. Online publication 'aero Telegraph' reported that two recent A350 test flights had carried the call sign CARGOLUX.
Speaking in Frankfurt, Spohr said Lufthansa would be the first airline to receive the 777X passenger plane in 2023.
""That was confirmed today ... we will be the first operator to receive the aircraft,"" Spohr added.

It also expects to receive its first Boeing 787 plane on time for the summer season next year.
The first 777X delivery has been delayed by two and half years, partly due to coronavirus pandemic and talks with aviation regulators in the U.S. and Europe, Boeing said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian jeweller Sokolov is planning a dual listing in New York and Moscow in 2023, its co-owner told Reuters, betting on strong revenue growth and the development of its retail network as it joins a raft of Russian companies pursuing market debuts.
Russian initial public offering (IPO) activity has picked up as the economy improves after the COVID-19 pandemic last year and as concerns over more Western sanctions fade, although a couple of postponements have marred the listing spree.
""In the spring of 2022 we want to do a pre-roadshow for a year... and we plan to enter the market in the United States and Moscow in 2023,"" Artem Sokolov, managing partner and co-owner of the almost 30-year-old jewellery network, told Reuters. 
""In the United States we are considering both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq,"" he said. ""To have good free float and liquidity, we need to raise about $500 million.""
Sokolov, which manufactures jewellery and operated as a wholesaler for many years, tripled its market share with the launch of its brand in 2014 and soon after moved into retail, which now accounts for almost half of revenue. It expects to have 350 stores by the end of 2021, up from 20 in 2019. 
Sokolov's January-September revenue was around 20 billion roubles ($275 million), with full-year revenue expected to reach around 30 billion roubles, more than doubling year on year. 
The company did not disclose profit data, but Sokolov said: ""We have always been profitable. Now we have exponential development of revenue and profit.""
Sokolov forecast that the company should become Russia's jewellery market leader by retail revenue, overtaking domestic rivals Sunlight and 585 Gold in 2023. He views Swarovski and Pandora (OTC:PANDY) as the company's closest international competitors.
The group also sells jewellery on a mobile app, which has one million monthly active users. It has three million monthly active users on its website. 
""We will fight to be the number-one mobile jewellery application in the world with our own retail and production,"" he said.

Sokolov is also planning to open 15-20 stores in Kazakhstan in 2022 and will launch a retail network in Germany next year.

TOKYO (Reuters) -From the prime minister to people in the street, Japan on Friday celebrated Shohei Ohtani winning one of U.S. baseball's top awards with joy, banners and newspaper extras filled with pride at the achievement of one of their own.
Ohtani, 27, with the Los Angeles Angels, won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award for Major League Baseball's American League, becoming only the second Japanese player after Ichiro Suzuki, then with the Seattle Mariners, did so in 2001.
""I'm proud. He worked hard and showed Japanese presence,"" said Minoru Tanaka, 68 and a part-time worker.
Others were even more enthusiastic.
""I'm simply happy, I think it's amazing,"" said office worker Chihiro Nakamura, 36. ""I want to keep cheering him on.""
Newspapers handed out extras and the iconic Tokyo Tower was illuminated in the Angels' colours with a congratulatory message at exactly 17:17, or 5:17 p.m., to match Ohtani's jersey number. 
City hall workers in Ohtani's hometown of Oshu, in rural northeastern Japan, gathered in Angels jerseys, cheering and clapping. Later, banners proclaiming the win were hung from city hall.
Even Prime Minister Fumio Kishida joined, telling reporters: ""It's an extraordinary accomplishment and as a Japanese citizen, I feel very proud.""
Ohtani's popularity stems from both his athletic ability and his character, which combines quiet strength and the humbleness Japan respects most in its heroes, said Hirotaka Matsuoka, a sports marketing professor at Tokyo's Waseda University.
""Ohtani is earnest and humble, so even if he doesn't say anything he's appealing - and he appeals to men, women, young and old,"" he added.
Though Suzuki was popular, Ohtani goes one better, said Robert Whiting, the author of several books on Japanese baseball.
""He gives Japan a certain status in MLB it has never had before ...,"" he said in remarks made to Reuters before the award announcement. ""Some people are calling him the best baseball player they've ever seen."" 
High school baseball players practicing in downtown Tokyo agreed.
""It is very rare that a Japanese baseball player becomes this successful in the world, and in the Major League, so it is very encouraging,"" said Koki Kawabata. 
""It makes me think that we might one day (have the chance to be MLB players) too, if we make an effort, and gives us a new goal.""

Though baseball has lost ground to soccer in Japan in recent years, Ohtani's MVP is likely to inspire more to play the game - and more to watch, giving Japanese professional baseball a boost, Matsuoka said.
""After all, who knows when you might be able to see the next Ohtani in a game right here?"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - UBS has identified former UniCredit Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier as a possible successor to chairman Axel Weber, whose mandate ends in 2022, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
However, a source close to Mustier said the 60-year-old Frenchman has no immediate plans to leave the Pegasus Europe special purpose acquisition (SPAC) vehicle he set up and invested in after leaving UniCredit a year ago.
The board of Switzerland's biggest bank is aiming to pick a new chairman by the end of the year and has included Mustier in a shortlist of possible candidates, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential.
UBS and representatives for Weber declined to comment.
The sources said Mustier may face investor criticism if he bows out before Amsterdam-listed Pegasus, which is focused on financial services, completes a merger.
""Timing is the main complication,"" one of the sources said.
Mustier, who teamed up with luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault and former Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) banker Diego De Giorgi to launch Pegasus in April, started his career within the corporate and investment banking division of Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
He has previously been a contender for top jobs at some of Europe's biggest banks, including HSBC and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
The board of UBS has been working with headhunters on a shortlist of possible candidates to succeed Weber for several months and will ask shareholders to approve its preferred candidate at its annual general meeting in April next year.
Weber will not seek to extend his tenure at UBS after his mandate ends in April, a source familiar with the matter said.
UBS is keen to enlist a chairman with an investment banking background who could work closely with former ING boss Ralph Hamers, who became CEO of the Swiss bank last year pledging to improve its digital services after a career focused primarily on retail banking.
One of the sources said Mustier's work ethic and discipline, combined with his investment banking expertise, would mean he could take an active approach and have a say in key matters.
""Mustier and Hamers have different but complementary backgrounds,"" one of the sources said. ""Mustier has wholesale experience, while Hamers brings all the digital expertise.""
NON-SWISS CITIZEN
UBS has been struggling to find qualified Swiss nationals for senior leadership roles and is open to the idea of offering the chairmanship to a non-Swiss citizen, the sources said.
Swiss banker Philipp Hildebrand, a former head of the Swiss central bank who joined BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in 2012, has been ruled out from the shortlist, two of the sources said.
Jens Weidmann, a German known as a conservative policymaker who is due to leave his role as Bundesbank President on Dec. 31 for personal reasons, was initially seen as a possibility but he is subject to a one-year cooling off period once he leaves, making him an unlikely candidate for a transition in 2022.
Spokesmen for Hildebrand and Weidmann were not immediately available for comment.

Whoever succeeds Weber will take the reins of a bank with a healthy balance sheet. 
In October UBS posted its highest quarterly profit over the past 11 years, with trading by the world's ultra rich fuelling a 23% fee income rise.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Several thousand workers at autos supplier Robert Bosch protested in Germany on Friday against planned plant closures and job relocations which the company said are needed to adapt to changing demand in the transition to electric vehicles.
Around 3,000 workers from various plants gathered outside a Bosch plant in Buehl, union IG Metall said, where around 1,000 staff in Germany will lose their jobs by 2025 as a result of relocations, cuts, or new hires, according to the company.
Workers also gathered in the town of Arnstadt, where a plant making so-called generator regulators - a car part no longer needed in electric vehicles - is due to close at the end of the year because of a lack of customers, taking a hundred jobs with it. 
Protests also took place outside Bosch's Munich plant, where 250 jobs could be relocated abroad, though no final decision has been made.
""On every fuel pump manufactured in Munich, we make losses,"" plant manager Joerg Luntz said in an email to Reuters. 
""Nobody denies that structural change at Bosch requires great effort. But the transformation must be fair and have workers in focus,"" Frank Sell, head of the works council for Bosch's mobility solutions division, said.

A spokesperson for Bosch, the world's largest automotive supplier, said: ""Our aim is always to design measures in dialogue with social representatives with the aim of exhausting all opportunities for continued employment ... while also pointing towards opportunities for new employment outside the company.""
Unions in Germany and elsewhere have warned the transition to producing electric cars could cost millions of jobs if workers are not retrained, with one study in May estimating 100,000 positions could be lost in Germany alone.

(Reuters) -Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd slashed its forecast for annual revenue growth on increased competition and a regulatory crackdown, sending its stock tumbling 11%.
Alibaba now expects revenue for the year ending in March to rise between 20% and 23%, the slowest pace since its 2014 stock market debut and down from a May forecast of 29.5% growth. The company also undershot expectations for earnings per share in the second quarter.
Chinese shoppers have become more cautious about spending amid coronavirus outbreaks and that, combined with supply disruptions, contributed to slower growth for China's economy in the quarter.
""These economic headwinds, coupled by intensifying market competition also affected our core commerce business in China,"" Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said on an earnings call, adding that demand for apparel and general merchandise had been particularly affected.
But analysts also noted that while Alibaba had been hit by slower-than-expected growth in demand for fashion and accessories, its rivals had done much better in apparel sales.
At the same time, big e-commerce companies in China are having to contend with the expansion into e-commerce from the likes of short video apps Kuaishou and ByteDance's Douyin and which are now benefiting from unprecedented regulatory efforts to ensure there is more competition in the marketplace.
""We see intensified competition further eating into Alibaba's market share and widening the difference in revenue growth of Alibaba vs. peers,"" Daiwa Capital Markets analysts said in a research note.

For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Alibaba earned 11.20 yuan per share on an adjusted basis, missing an average estimate of 12.36 yuan.
Revenue climbed 29%, the smallest rise in six quarters, to 200.7 billion yuan ($31.4 billion), just under a Refintiv consensus estimate.
Alibaba said it had recorded single-digit growth for physical goods gross merchandise value, a key online retailing metric for the total value of merchandise sold through a marketplace, though it did not provide more details or a comparison with previous quarters.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Thanksgiving dinner will cost U.S. consumers an average of 14% more this year in the biggest annual increase in 31 years, the American Farm Bureau Federation said, though shoppers can still find deals in grocery stores.
Rising food and gas prices are squeezing U.S. consumers as the pandemic snarls global supply chains and the economic drag from the summer wave of COVID-19 infections fades.
The Farm Bureau, which represents U.S. farmers and the broader agriculture industry, pointed to inflation and supply-chain disruptions for lifting the average cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for 10 people to $53.31 from a 10-year-low $46.90 in 2020. The cost is based on Farm Bureau shoppers who checked prices for turkey, cranberries, dinner rolls and other staples in stores from Oct. 26 to Nov. 8.
""The cranberry sauce, the stuffing, all those things that are traditional, have gone up,"" said Sherry Hooker, a 69-year-old retiree shopping at Jewel-Osco store in Chicago on Thursday. 
GRAPHIC: Thanksgiving dinner price jump https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-THANKSGIVING/MEAL/akvezmyrxpr/chart.png 
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to predict consumer demand, which adds to high prices, the Farm Bureau said. Average prices for turkey, the centerpiece of many Thanksgiving dinners, are up 24% from 2020 at about $1.50 per pound, Farm Bureau said. 
Without turkey, the price for the overall meal is up 6.6%. That is in line with the 6.2% increase in the U.S. Consumer Price Index in October, when the index saw its biggest annual rise since November 1990, although it is a bit above the 5.4% year-over-year increase for the Labor Department's measure of costs for food consumed at home.
Adjusted for inflation, Thanksgiving costs are up for the first time since 2015 and 7% higher than last year, Farm Bureau data show.
In Chicago, Cinda Shaver, 62, said she now spends at least $120 a week shopping for two people at discount supermarket Aldi, up from $90 previously for the same items.
Cooks can still find deals as the holiday approaches, though. 
Visits by Reuters to two grocery stores on Thursday showed prices vary widely. The same basket of items the Farm Bureau checked cost just $40.01 at a Big Y store in Newtown, Connecticut, including frozen turkey for 99 cents a pound. 
At Jewel-Osco in Chicago, generic brand frozen turkeys were on sale for as little as 49 cents a pound. 
Farm Bureau said its shoppers checked prices about two weeks before most supermarket chains began featuring whole frozen turkeys at lower prices. The average per-pound sale price for whole frozen turkeys was $1.07 from Nov. 5-11 and dropped 18% to 88 cents from Nov. 12-18, Farm Bureau said.
""The good news is that the top turkey producers in the country are confident that everyone who wants a bird for their Thanksgiving dinner will be able to get one, and a large one will only cost $1 more than last year,"" U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that prices for Thanksgiving staples are up about 5% from last year, based on government data. It tracked prices of a 12-pound turkey, sweet potatoes, russet potatoes, cranberries and a gallon of milk.

Hooker, for one, will not cut back on her Thanksgiving feast because of high prices. Instead, she said she will ""bite the bullet and have tradition.""
""It's once a year,"" she said.

News earlier Friday that Austria will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full coronavirus lockdown to tackle a new wave of infections has hit sentiment on Wall Street amid worries this surge could shortly travel across the Atlantic.
Austria also stated Friday that it will require its whole population to be vaccinated as of February, something that would be difficult to mandate in America. 
Europe appears to be the epicenter of the new wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, with Germany, Europe’s largest economy, recording a record number of cases on Thursday, and also refusing to rule out a new lockdown. 
That said, the major indexes remain just below all-time highs, helped by a generally positive quarterly earnings season. More than 90% of the S&P 500 companies have reported in the third quarter, and over 80% of them reported earnings better than expectations, according to Refinitiv. 
Global corporate dividends are also set to reach a record high this year, with Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data for 3,394 global companies with market capitalization of at least $1 billion, suggesting total payouts to shareholders are estimated to be $1.37 trillion in 2021.
Elsewhere, the U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the Democratic Party's $2 trillion spending bill later Friday. 
There is little on the economic data agenda Friday, but Federal Reserve officials Christopher Waller and Richard Clarida are due to speak later in the session. 
Turning to the corporate sector, the number of companies releasing earnings has slowed, and the focus will likely be on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after Bloomberg News reported that the tech giant, known for its iPhone, is pushing to launch its electric car as early as 2025.
Crude prices slumped Friday, falling to seven-week lows, as the move by Austria to reimpose a full lockdown raised fears of another Covid-fueled hit to demand this winter.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.3% lower at $75.83 a barrel, on track to record a fall of almost 5% this week, while the Brent contract fell 3.5% to $78.38, down over 3% this week. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,864.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.6% lower at 1.1296.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Paytm's dismal stock market debut this week is likely to put a damper on future offerings after the IPO of the digital payments firm ranked among the worst-performing in Indian history, six analysts and bankers said on Friday. 
Indian companies have raised a staggering $9.7 billion through initial share sales in the first nine months of 2021, for the highest such tally in any of the corresponding periods of the last two decades, said accountants EY. 
But offerings planned for later this year, such as those by payments rival MobiKwik and hotel aggregator OYO, will face questions after Paytm's debut plunge of more than 27%, as investors turned queasy at its lack of profits and lofty value.
""This episode should hopefully bring some realism to valuations that promoters expect from the public markets,"" said Kristy Fong, a senior investment director at fund manager abrdn, based in Singapore.
Investors and analysts who expressed concern over the IPO valuation of the loss-making Paytm at about $18.7 billion had cautioned that ""frothy"" valuations with unclear business models might not end up well in the current market.
""It will take three to four months for people to forget Paytm and that it destroyed wealth,"" said Jimeet Modi, founder of Mumbai-based brokerage Samco Securities.
""Until that time, it's going to be tough for all super-expensive IPOs.""
But the debut of Paytm, which is backed by Ant Group and SoftBank, was in stark contrast to that of food delivery firm Zomato, which surged 66% in July after raising $1.2 billion.
Similarly, shares in FSN E-Commerce, which owns cosmetics-to-fashion platform Nykaa, jumped 80% on their debut this month.
Now analysts fear that even approaching IPOs which have seen huge demand may take a beating on listing.
""This will put spokes in the market ... even the ones that have seen huge subscriptions will see a drop in the premiums,"" Arun Kejriwal, founder of independent research firm KRIS, told Reuters.
BEHEMOTH LIC IN THE WINGS
All eyes are turning to plans for India's biggest-ever IPO, that of state-owned life insurance behemoth LIC, which is expected by the end of March 2022 and could raise more than $10 billion if the government offers a stake of 10%.
Some analysts see little risk from the Paytm fallout for LIC, however, as it is a household name in India, commanding more than 60% of the life insurance market, with assets exceeding $500 billion. 
""My sense is even if they price LIC a little higher, I think given what it is, and what it stands for, and what's been built over many years, I don't think it'll be a problem,"" said an executive at a boutique investment bank who sought anonymity.
""There's tremendous interest and there's money in the market.""
Some say concerns over LIC cannot be ruled out, though, despite a business model that is starkly different from that of Paytm. 
""Everybody will be in a bit of a learning mode after this (Paytm) listing,"" said one of the investment bankers working on LIC's IPO, adding that they remained confident about its chances.

The government has named Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), SBI Capital Market, JM Financial,  Axis Capital  (NYSE:AXS), Nomura, BofA Securities, J.P. Morgan India, ICICI Securities and Kotak Mahindra to handle the IPO.

DUBAI (Reuters) - German aerospace suppliers have given broad backing to plans by Airbus to increase jet production but warn that growing labour shortages are the chief risk to the industry's growth. 
European planemaker Airbus, which sets the pace for some 200 suppliers in Germany, has said it is committed to its target of lifting production of A320 jets by some 50% to 65 a month by the summer of 2023, while exploring output rates of up to 75. 
The planemaker unveiled more than 400 tentative or firm new orders at the Dubai Airshow this week. Bloomberg News reported that it could add to that with a new A350 freighter order as early as Friday.
""It is a good signal. We are not yet back to the good old times but it is starting back again,"" Volker Thum, managing director of German aerospace association BDLI, said after meeting Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury and others at the Dubai Airshow this week.
""We are still in a critical phase, there is no doubt about that, but the perspectives are there,"" he told Reuters.
Thum said ""only a handful"" of suppliers still had doubts about the target of 65 A320-family jets a month, which is only slightly above its pre-pandemic output of 60. Further increases beyond that are only at the investigation phase, he said. 
Airbus has asked suppliers to explore rates of 70 in early 2024 and 75 by 2025, but says it has not made a decision.
""60 to 72 is a 20% increase so it is not unimaginable. Suppliers had already planned to go to 60 or 65,"" Thum said.
Engine makers have voiced concerns, however, about the 70-75 threshold, fearing it would harm the repair business for older jets, while some small suppliers are worried it would only be short-lived, leaving them with bills for unused new machinery.
HIRING CHALLENGE
Asked whether the supply chain could handle rates as high as 75 a month, Thum said: ""It seems manageable if we keep the rates for a certain time. If Airbus goes up to 75 for five months, then you can forget it.""
Airbus's Faury told Reuters this week that its latest forecasts implied that such rates could be sustained for some time, but stressed no decision had been taken.
Germany's supply chain is one of Europe's largest. It was kept intact by furlough schemes and a decision to keep producing 40 A320-family jets a month during the crisis, Thum said.
""It showed that Airbus is reliable and kept a minimum of (parts) orders and production,"" he said, adding this had allowed many suppliers to absorb most of their fixed costs.
Hiring new workers may prove more of a headache, though, amid widespread labour shortages.
""The main concern is to get skilled people on board ... especially due to the demographic effect of baby-boomers retiring,"" Thum said.

Also vital for Germany's largely family-owned small suppliers are actual contracts, rather than provisional targets.
""More than visibility you need orders (for parts),"" Thum said. ""If you go to the banks with visibility, you get nothing.""

Investing.com – Shares of HelloFresh (DE:HFGG), Zalando (DE:ZALG) and  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) were trading higher in Europe Friday as Austria became the first country on the continent to reimpose a lockdown to contain a resurgent coronavirus.
Meal-kit provider HelloFresh was up 5.0% in Frankrurt trading while ecommerce platform Zalando was up 2.6%. Payment company Adyen gained 3.1% in Amsterdam.
Reports said Germany, Europe’s largest economy, too could be heading for a lockdown. The country’s Health Minister Jens Spahn today said the situation is more serious than a week ago. ""We are in a national emergency,"" Spahn said, according to Reuters.
Companies like HelloFresh and Zalando were big winners of the pandemic, profiting from the abrupt and accelerated shift to online commerce, but had all been drifting lower since the summer, when the pandemic appeared to be in retreat. Of the three, only HelloFresh hit a new all-time high in response to Friday's news. 
Austria will resume lockdowns Monday and will re-evaluate the scenario after 10 days. The Alpine nation also plans to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory from February 1, reports said, quoting Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg.
Thursday, outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional leaders agreed to bar the unvaccinated from restaurants, bars and public events. Austria too had initially tried such measures but found within days that they weren't enough to stop national case rates rising.

Flows to stocks funds over the past week had helped lift total inflows into equities to $1.0 trillion, BofA said, citing EPFR data. Meanwhile fixed income funds saw the smallest weekly inflows in four weeks at $6.2 billion, while cash funds raked in $7.8 billion.

""10-year U.S. real rates now -4.6% , a level in the past 200 years that has been associated with panics, inflations, wars & depression, and a level today increasingly responsible for froth in crypto, commodities, and U.S. stocks,"" said Michael Hartnett at BofA.
U.S. equity funds took in $3.3 billion while emerging equities almost matched the intake at $2.7 billion. However, emerging market debt, a lightning rod for higher global yields, suffered the first outflow in four weeks at $900 million, BofA found.

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>",Global companies set to deliver record dividends this year,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Global corporate dividends are set to reach a record high this year, as a rebound in business activity and a rise in consumer demand boosted profits for most sectors which were hit by the pandemic last year.
According to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data for 3,394 global companies with market capitalization of at least $1 billion, their total payouts to shareholders are estimated to be $1.37 trillion in 2021.
Dividends slumped last year against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and as regulatory constraints and government pressures to restrict payments weighed. 
""The robust growth in dividend payouts by global companies reflects the sharp snapback in earnings post the pandemic-driven weakness. Dividend payouts are normalizing alongside economic stability and corporate confidence,"" said Geoffry Dailey, 
senior portfolio manager at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management.
""Capital markets are accessible and corporate balance sheets are healthy further bolstering the ability of firms to increase dividends.""
The data showed European companies' payouts in 2021 are estimated at $252.4 billion, a 25% rise over last year. U.S. dividends are expected to grow to $562.3 billion, an 8.6% increase. 
Mining firms led the dividend payouts, boosted by a surge in commodity prices this year, according to the data. 
The financial sector is also expected to deliver higher dividends, as global central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank relaxed their restrictions on dividends and buybacks they imposed last year.
""Globally 90% of companies either raised their dividends or held them steady - a very strong reading,"" Janus Henderson said in a report this month.
The asset manager calculated that global companies delivered a record $403.5 billion in the third quarter, which was up 22% over the same period last year. 
According to the data, MSCI World index's forward dividend yield stood at 1.72, lower than a 10-year average of 2.45.
""The question investors always have to consider is whether these prospects are correctly priced into share prices,"" said Jonathan Spread, senior portfolio manager, global equities at Mondrian Investment Partners. 
""With U.S. dividend yields currently well below (their)historical average, a lot is already priced in,"" he added.

""We believe Japan has the best combination of future dividend growth and current yield, underpinned by the strength of the Japanese corporate balance sheets.""
Among major countries, UK companies offer a forward 12-month dividend yield of 3.4%, compared with Japanese firms' 2.2% and U.S. companies' 1.3%

Investing.com -- The sell-off in European stock markets accelerated mid-morning Friday as Covid-19-related lockdowns returned to the continent, setting the stage for another potential economic contraction over the winter.
Austria said it will reimpose a nationwide lockdown and will also introduce mandatory vaccination from February, in an effort to stem a spiralling infection rate. Germany's health minister Jens Spahn also refused to rule out similar measures, prompting fears that Europe's largest economy could be shut down for the third winter in a row.
At 5:08 AM ET (1008 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 traded 0.3% lower. The worst-hit markets were oil-sensitive Russia, which fell 1.8% and travel and tourism-heavy Spain, which fell 1.7% as the original pattern of pandemic trades reasserted itself.
Non-Covid news was also less than stellar on Friday:  German producer price inflation numbers for October showed prices rising another 3.8% on the month, taking the annual rate of factory gate inflation in Europe's largest economy up to 18.4%. 
French data also showed unemployment rising more sharply than expected to 8.1% of the workforce in the third quarter. 
By contrast, the latest GfK consumer confidence index in the U.K. unexpectedly rose to -14 from -17 in October, while the country’s retail sales rebounded more strongly than expected in the same month, by 0.8%. This further fleshed out a picture of an economy that is strong enough to withstand a modest increase in interest rates by the Bank of England with Covid cases in this country now falling. 
In corporate news,  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) stock fell 4% after the DIY giant reported a drop in sales year-on-year as consumer spending balanced out after the pandemic. 
Airline and airport stocks tumbled, with IAG (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways and Iberia, losing 4.9% and EasyJet (LON:EZJ) stock falling 5.3%. Online payments company  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) and meal kit deliverer HelloFresh (DE:HFGG) went in the other direction, gaining 2.0% and 6.8% respectively. Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) also rose 3.6% while Just Eat Takeaway (AS:TKWY) rose 4.6%.
Later Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the Democratic Party's $2 trillion spending bill after Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally appeared to have overcome internal divisions in her party. Wall Street is set to end the week on a calm note, with broad confidence in the U.S. economy only partly dimmed by pockets of uncertainty. 
In oil markets, U.S. crude futures continued to move lower, set to recover hefty weekly losses, as the U.S., China and India plot a coordinated release of strategic petroleum reserves. 
WTI was down 1.0% at $77.62 a barrel, while Brent was down 1.2% at $80.30.  Gold futures were up 0.3% at $1,866.10 an ounce.

LONDON (Reuters) - Dyson, best known for its revolutionary bagless vacuum cleaners, will enable customers to test its hairdryers, straighteners and stylers from the comfort of their home through virtual reality.
The Dyson Demo VR has been built with the same visualisation and simulation technology used by the British firm's engineers to prototype, test and develop new products and software.
James Dyson, company founder and chief engineer, said VR was a way to improve people's understanding of Dyson products.
""We have been harnessing powerful virtual reality technologies to engineer new products in our labs for many years, now we are applying those same technologies to re-invent how people explore our products,"" he said.
Consumer goods companies are testing new online and virtual ways to interact with customers in anticipation of the creation of the metaverse, a VR concept that entered the mainstream last month when Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) rebranded itself ""Meta"". 
Dyson said in a statement that its virtual-reality showroom was an extension of selling direct to consumers though its 318 stores and website and would be available through VR headset Oculus' headset store from Friday.

E-commerce director Sean Newmarch said demonstration was an important part of showing how products worked and the Dyson Demo VR would in the future incorporate a fully integrated e-commerce solution and the ability to talk to a real salesperson.
Newmarch said it would launch with Dyson's hair care products, with its floor care range set to follow.

The company has asked investors of the dollar bond tranches totalling $747 million to exchange them for new notes personally guaranteed by its chairman, as it seeks to avoid a default on debt payments.
Yango said in a filing on Thursday it will issue the new notes on or about Nov. 23, which will mature on Sept. 15, 2022, carrying an annual interest of 10.25%.
The extensions apply to the company's $200 million 5.3% January 2022, its $300 million 10.25% March 2022 and its $247 million 10% February 2023 bonds.
It is also seeking extensions from bondholders of five other bonds.

LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers have halved the amount of cyber cover they provide to customers after the pandemic and home-working drove a surge in ransomware attacks that left them smarting from hefty payouts.
Faced with increased demand, major European and U.S. insurers and syndicates operating in the Lloyd's of London market have been able to charge higher premium rates to cover ransoms, the repair of hacked networks, business interruption losses and even PR fees to mend reputational damage.
But the increase in ransomware attacks and the growing sophistication of attackers have made insurers wary. Insurers say some attackers may even check whether potential victims have policies that would make them more likely to pay out.
""Insurers are changing their appetites, limits, coverage and pricing,"" Caspar Stops, head of cyber at insurance firm Optio, said. ""Limits have halved – where people were offering 10 million pounds ($13.50 million), nearly everyone has reduced to five.""
Lloyd's of London, which has around a fifth of the global cyber market, has discouraged its 100-odd syndicate members from taking on cyber business next year, industry sources say on condition of anonymity. Lloyd's declined to comment.
U.S. insurer AIG (NYSE:AIG) also said in August it was cutting cyber limits.
Ransom software works by encrypting victims' data and typically hackers offer victims a passcode to retrieve it in return for cryptocurrency payments.
It has become the attack of choice for cyber criminals, who previously favoured stealing data and selling it to third parties.
Suspected ransomware payments totalling $590 million were made in the first six months of this year, compared with the $416 million reported for the whole of 2020, U.S. authorities said in October.
In one of the biggest heists, a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in May shut the largest fuel pipeline network in the United States for several days. 
U.S. cyber insurers' profits shrank in 2020, insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON) found. Combined ratio - a measure of profitability in which a level of more than 100% indicates a loss - climbed by more than 20 percentage points from 2019 to 95.4%.
While insurers struggle to cope, companies are under-insured.
""It's very unlikely people are getting the same limits - if they are, they are paying an extraordinary amount,"" David Dickson, head of enterprise at broker Superscript, said.
Dickson said one technology client had previously bought 130 million pounds of professional indemnity and cyber cover for 250,000 pounds. Now the client could only get 55 million pounds of cover and the price was 500,000 pounds.
Insurers who issued $5 million cyber liability policies last year have scaled back to limits of between $1 million and $3 million in 2021, a report last month by U.S. broker Risk Placement Services (RPS) found.
AS PROFITABLE AS COCAINE
A European Union report released in October said the COVID-19 pandemic and rise of home working had emabled cyber criminals to flourish.
Meanwhile, cyber security firm Coveware likened the 90%-plus profit margin from ransomware attacks in 2021 to the gains Colombian cocaine cartels made in 1992. 
Where hackers previously took a scattergun approach with methods such as sending out thousands of phishing emails, they have become more targeted, reading balance sheets and focusing on specific sectors.
Tom Quy, cyber practice leader at reinsurance broker Acrisure Re, said attacks were moving away from healthcare facilities and municipalities - which have weak IT controls but also little money - to manufacturing or logistics companies. 
Such firms have deep pockets and cannot afford extended outages to fix their systems, so would rather pay ransoms, especially if they have insurance to cover them.
""We advocate to everyone you don't disclose your insurance because that's crucial to your business,"" Scott Sayce, global head of cyber at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Corporate & Specialty, said.
Premium rates have almost doubled in the United States and jumped by 73% in Britain as a result of the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks, insurance broker Marsh said. RPS said rates for some policies had risen by as much as 300%.
Where ransom payments were typically $600 a few years ago, they now are as high as $50 million, said Michael Shen, head of cyber and technology at insurer Canopius, and insurers are sometimes asking policyholders to pay half of the ransom.
The United States and France are among countries particularly concerned about ransom payments, industry sources say.
The FBI says it does not support paying ransoms, while a few U.S. states are considering banning ransomware payments by municipalities.
But insurers, while less willing to provide large amounts of cover, say failing to pay ransoms could backfire.

""Of course no-one wants to pay criminals,"" Adrian Cox, CEO of insurer Beazley told the Reuters. ""At the same time, if you ban it ... you could cripple a lot of businesses whose systems have been disabled.""

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 03:01AM ET</span>","As dual listings fall out of favour, Rio Tinto set to hold the line","By Clara Denina and Melanie Burton
(Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Ltd has no plans to follow in the footsteps of peers BHP and Shell (LON:RDSa) to collapse its dual listing, people familiar with its thinking say, seeing it as a needless expense that would erode advantages for shareholders in London and Sydney. 
Executives at Rio routinely review the dual structure and have for years resisted any change, a direction unlikely to shift under the helm of new chief executive Jakob Stausholm, two sources familiar with the company told Reuters. 
Just last month, Stausholm defended the dual listing as an effective one-management, one-board structure set up 26 years ago to satisfy both the UK and Australian governments that he thought management should ""honour.""
Royal Dutch Shell's decision this week to scrap its dual structure and move its head office to London has renewed focus on dual listings, which are often criticised as both complex and expensive.
It followed a move by the world's biggest miner BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) in August to collapse its 20-year-old structure, quitting its London listing in favour of Sydney.
Any similar move by London-headquartered Rio would likely see it shift its primary listing to the UK, where it has most of its shareholders, although the majority of its profits come from Australia.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to quote their shares on multiple exchanges, a dual-listing is incorporated under two different legal regimes operating as a single business on two bourses, often designed to persuade governments to sign off on cross-border mergers.
The structure can bring some tax advantages but means increased costs and can make stock-based acquisitions and corporate restructurings more difficult, say analysts.
Despite pressure on big companies to simplify their structures, Australian investors would likely take a dim view of any move by Rio to unwind the dual listing.
""Any move would likely see major pushback from the Australian government and Australian shareholders,"" said Peter O'Connor of Shaw and Partners in Sydney.
The government would be unhappy that control of raw materials was moving offshore, particularly as the Western Australian iron ore business accounted for more than 80% of Rio's profits over the past two years.
""We are of the view that unless you can make a really strong case for why it needs to be done, it's better left alone,"" said Brenton Saunders, financial analyst at Pendal Group in Sydney.
Rio would need to demonstrate value to both sets of shareholders to cut the Australian listing, and any jurisdiction disadvantaged would have to be remunerated, he added. 
Australian shares tend to trade at a premium to London-listed stock due to tax rebates on dividends, and a collapsed structure would lead to a transfer of value from Australian shareholders to London shareholders, Saunders said.
""That has pretty much happened already for BHP and it will likely happen with Rio if they were to announce a dual-listed company unification,"" he said.

Still, as corporates come under pressure to be simpler, more integrated and innovative, O'Connor said pressure for a change in structure from investors, especially those in London, is likely to rise.
""The probability of Rio collapsing its dual share structure and moving it to a London listing is moving towards 100, having been at around 50 on the scale of probability for years,"" he said.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 02:40AM ET</span>","Binance U.S. may raise 'couple hundred million' in funding, CEO says","By Nikhil Nainan
(Reuters) - Binance's U.S. unit may raise a ""couple hundred million"" dollars in a funding round set to close in a month or two and the global cryptocurrency exchange has also decided on a new headquarters, its chief executive Changpeng Zhao said on Friday.
Speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, Zhao said the firm's U.S. affiliate has the option to go for an initial public offering (IPO) using rival Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) as an example, and that he was not ruling out listing the parent company in future. 
""I think it's a couple hundred million dollars,"" Zhao, who is also known as ""CZ"", said at the event, adding that he doesn't know the exact number of the proposed fresh funding. 
""For an IPO perspective, it's probably best to have a few rounds of financing before that,"" he added. 
Binance, one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volumes, has come under scrutiny from regulators, with some banning the platform and others warning it was unlicensed to operate. 
Its U.S. affiliate is also reportedly under investigation.
Binance, as well as other cryptocurrency exchanges, have seen trading volumes soar as prices of digital assets, such as bitcoin, ether and other smaller tokens, boom and find greater mainstream acceptance. 
According to UK researcher CryptoCompare, Binance's spot cryptocurrency trading volumes totalled $789 billion in September and $454 billion in July.
When asked whether his company was making billions of dollars of profit, Zhao replied, ""pretty much, yeah"" without providing a number. He also said that since Binance was profitable, it could potentially charge even lower fees than rivals and that is something Binance was thinking about.
Speaking on the issue of heightened regulatory scrutiny and concern around risks that retail traders were exposed to in cryptocurrency markets, Zhao reiterated his stance that his company was in regular talks with regulators.

""We want regulation, I am not a complete libertarian, I'm not an anarchist,"" he said. 
Zhao also said Binance will ""very shortly"" announce where the company has decided to locate its headquarters and was communicating its plan to regulators first.

The letters were sent just weeks ahead of a final investment decision by Woodside on the Scarborough project off the coast of Western Australia and an expansion of its Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, together expected to cost $12 billion. 
Writing on behalf of the Conservation Council of WA (CCWA), the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO) said in letters to Woodside Chief Executive Meg O'Neill and Environment Minister Sussan Ley that the Scarborough development needs to be reviewed under provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act that bar any harm to the Great Barrier Reef.
The green group says emissions from the gas produced at Scarborough will worsen global warming which is damaging the reef off Australia's east coast.
""In particular, CCWA is concerned that the Project, by way of its forecast Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, is likely to have a significant impact on the World Heritage and National Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef,"" EDO lawyer Brendan Dobbie said in the letter dated Nov. 17 to O'Neill.
Woodside did not comment on the issues raised in the letter, but said it already has primary environmental approvals from the federal government and the Western Australian state government to support a go-ahead decision for Scarborough.
""Woodside rejects the assertion by activists that there is significant environmental approvals risk of proceeding to an FID (final investment decision) for Scarborough at this time,"" Woodside said in an emailed statement.

The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) said on Friday that Woodside has an ""'in principle' approval for the project as a whole"" but still needs further approvals for any activity to begin, including an environment plan, well operations management plan and a safety case.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Saul Kavonic said the CCWA's request posed ""negligible risk"" to the project, adding that Woodside ""has a strong track record in gaining government and regulatory support"".

1673,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 02:03AM ET</span>",Europe Stocks Set to Open Mostly Higher Despite German PPI Shock,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- European stock markets are set to open higher on Friday, as the generally positive handover from the U.S. and Asia keeps growing concerns about the new winter wave of Covid-19 at bay. 
Germany's federal and state governments agreed on Thursday to introduce sharp new restrictions on unvaccinated people in response to the surge in cases that has taken the rate of new infections to 30% above its peak last winter. However, they set a threshold for generalized lockdowns at a rate considerably higher even than the current one. 
By 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), DAX futures were up 55 points, or 0.3%, as were French CAC 40 futures and Euro Stoxx 50 futures. 
German and Eurozone markets were set for a test of nerve after shocking producer price inflation numbers for October that showed prices rising another 3.8% on the month, taking the annual rate of factory gate inflation in Europe's largest economy up to 18.4%. The euro edged down to $1.1355 in response. French data also showed unemployment rising more sharply than expected to 8.1% of the workforce in October. 
In the U.K., FTSE 100 futures were up 0.4% after GfK's latest consumer confidence index unexpectedly rose to -14 from -17 in October. Analysts had expected it to inch down, but figures released earlier in the week had shown that there had been no major rise in unemployment in October after the end of the government's job-protecting furlough scheme.
U.K. retail sales also rebounded more strongly than expected in October, by 0.8%, further fleshing a picture of an economy that is strong enough to withstand a modest increase in interest rates by the Bank of England. Even excluding fuel, where sharp price rises and reports of shortages triggered panic buying in October, sales rose 1.6% on the month. 
In corporate news, retailer  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) heads a slimmed-down list of companies reporting. Late on Thursday,  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) announced that it will support the plans for a two-tier share structure at Italy's Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), effectively drawing a line under a five-year battle for control with the Fininvest holding company of Silvio Berlusconi.
Later Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the Democratic Party's $2 trillion spending bill after Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally appeared to have overcome internal divisions in her party. Wall Street is set to end the week on a mixed note, with broad confidence in the U.S. economy only partly dimmed by pockets of uncertainty.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) became the latest high-profile company to miss market expectations with its quarterly results on Thursday, but mainland Chinese stocks shrugged off the development on Friday, with all the major indices rising after the People's Bank of China warned against speculators putting bullish bets on the yuan. 
In oil markets, U.S. crude futures recovered overnight but are still on course to end the week lower as the U.S., China and India plot a coordinated release of strategic petroleum reserves. WTI was up 1.0% at $79.20 a barrel, while Brent was up 1.0% at $82.06.  Gold futures were down 0.1% at $1,859.75 an ounce.

Weibo not specify how much China's largest microblogging platform is looking to raise in the secondary listing, nor specify a timetable for the sale.
The filings were part of a post-committee hearing information pack published on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's website, indicating Weibo had been given approval to press on with the listing.
Sources have previously told Reuters the deal would be worth about $700 million https://www.reuters.com/article/us-weibo-listing-hongkong-idUKKBN2AN0QT.
The final size of the deal though has yet to be determined, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named as they were not permitted to speak to media.
Weibo declined to comment.
Its New York-listed stock is up 1.88% for 2021 to date, and it has a market capitalisation of $9.5 billion. In February, when Reuters reported the appointment of banks to work on the Hong Kong listing, Weibo was worth $13.2 billion.

Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group holds 7.14% of the New York stock.
In July Reuters reported that Weibo was in talks to go private with the help of a Shanghai-based state-owned company, in an effort to help Alibaba divest. After the report, Weibo's chairman, Charles Chao, said he had held no such discussions.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Singapore is hosting top executives of big global companies this week at a host of conferences, marking its gradual return to normalcy and underscoring the contrast with long-time rival Hong Kong, which is sticking with some of the toughest quarantine rules in the world.
The Milken Institute's annual Asia Summit, run by billionaire Michael Milken's think tank, the Bloomberg New Economy Forum, and an event by sovereign wealth fund GIC attracted hundreds of executives vaccinated against COVID-19.
Participants were allowed entry only after clearing swab tests and were required to wear masks and comply with strict safe distancing measures, though enjoyed relatively more freedom than the country's general population in terms of eating together.
The resumption of on-site events in the Southeast Asian hub comes as Singapore is allowing quarantine free travel to at least a dozen countries including Britain, France, Germany, Australia, Canada and the United States.
On Wednesday, UBS inaugurated the Swiss bank's largest office in Asia, an event attended by its chairman chief executive officer and others in the city-state.
""Things develop, things evolve but evolve fast here in Singapore. And even with the kind of semi lockdown situation that we are currently in, if you come here, you still feel the vibe,"" UBS CEO Ralf Hammers said.
Top officials from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC, NYSE Group, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), Paypal and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) spoke at the business events in Singapore, with many likely to be making their first trip to Singapore since authorities imposed restrictions early last year..
The two-day Milken event and an evening event by GIC was attended by about 550 people, including 150 overseas executives. The Bloomberg event had over 300 attendees, with 80% flying in.
Rooms at the plush 112-room Capella hotel in Sentosa island where a one-night stay costs at least $1,600 and which hosted the Bloomberg forum were sold out.
Later this month, Singapore singer JJ Lin performs at a two-day concert that organisers expect to be at near full capacity of about 2,000 people per night, the Straits Times daily said.
Over 100 exhibitors from 12 countries are participating in a food and beverages and supply chain event currently underway, with an international jewellery show and a martial arts event taking place in coming weeks.
Despite all this, compared to Europe, Britain and the United States, Singapore still has tight COVID-19 restrictions, with dining out largely limited to two people and mandatory mask-wearing in public.
TIGHTER RULES IN HONG KONG
By contrast, Hong Kong has followed Beijing's lead in retaining strict travel curbs to curb new COVID outbreaks, prompting warnings from international business lobby groups that the financial centre could lose talent and investment. 
""When you restrict travel in and out, when you restrict the ability for people to come and visit and engage, for people to leave to go engage around the world, over time, that has an impact on your economic activity,"" Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told the Bloomberg event in Singapore on Wednesday.
Singapore's daily COVID-19 cases are hovering at more than 2,000 and the city-state still has strict restrictions on social gatherings, but with 85% of its 5.45 million population vaccinated, the government wants to open more for business.
Hong Kong has barely recorded any local coronavirus cases in recent months but the government hopes that its tight rules, including up to three weeks' hotel quarantine for visitors, would convince China to gradually open its border with the city.

""There's only a few cities where people want to congregate where you have that gateway of bringing global finance together and redistribute it. Hong Kong is one of those,"" BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink told the Hong Kong FinTech Week earlier this month.
""I'm truly looking forward to physically being there in Hong Kong without a 21-day quarantine but that is a whole other story.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Automakers chasing electric vehicle leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc revealed new, more affordable and larger electric sport utility vehicles at the Los Angeles Auto Show, racing into one of the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. market. 
Kia Motors called out Tesla by name at the show, announcing that its upcoming electric crossover EV6 beat Tesla’s previous record for the shortest charging time, while driving across the United States, by more than five hours.
Kia and affiliate Hyundai Motor also unveiled large, three-row electric sport utility vehicle concepts, EV9 and SEVEN. These models are expected go into production around 2024, two persons familiar with the matter said. 
""They (Tesla) have strong sales and they have a very good public awareness. But not everything is for everybody. So there should also always be an alternative,"" said Michael McHale, Kia's brand experience director. 
The focus on electric SUVs reflects the strong preference among U.S. consumers for SUVs, which typically sell for higher prices than similar-sized sedans. Large SUVs account for the top-selling segment in the U.S. market, industry executives and analysts have said. 
""EVs are going from econo boxes to aspirational vehicles to the heart of the market,"" Brett Smith, technology director at Center for Automotive Research.
ROTATING DASHBOARD SCREENS 
Tesla challengers are also betting on novel features such as a rotating dashboard screen in Fisker Ocean SUV to differentiate themselves from the pack.
Henrik Fisker, chief executive of Fisker Inc, said the Ocean will be the first production car with a screen switching between its vertical and horizontal orientations. 
""We filed a patent on it,"" he told Reuters, adding the screen will be supplied by Foxconn Technology Co Ltd, which will also produce Fisker's electric SUVs in the United States.
""I think it's going to appeal to a lot of young people who would love to play around on the screen. Also when you're sitting charging."" 
Fisker and Vinfast also used the show to get on the radar with new models and bold claims that they say will have more affordable, and longer-range vehicles than Tesla's rival offerings. 
Tesla has become the world's most valuable automaker, with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, as it has redefined the electric vehicle market with sleek, high-tech cars and SUVs such as the Model Y that boasted longer driving ranges between charges than rival models.
Tesla has taken advantage of its perceived technology edge and strong demand to lift prices for its vehicles, especially as prices for raw materials and semiconductors have risen this year.
Rival EV makers see an opening.
Vinfast global Chief Executive Michael Lohscheller, said its vehicles will have ""reasonable pricing,"" which is key to making people switch from gasoline cars to electric cars. 
Fisker said outsourcing production of models to  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) has enabled the company to shorten development time and thus use the latest, long-range battery technology from supplier CATL. 
""The technology is very new. Most other car makers, they choose their technologies three years before the vehicle comes out,"" he said. 
But it would be challenging for legacy automakers and startups to take on Tesla, which is ""synonymous with electric vehicles,"" said Smith.
GM, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) have launched electric cars, but none of them have made a dent in Tesla's dominance, said Smith of Automotive Research. Scaling up EVs is another challenge, he added.

""The electric vehicle is opening the opportunity up to a lot of companies, regardless of where they come from,"" he said. 
""Because Tesla did it doesn't mean it's easy, or others are going to do it.""

Investing.com –  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.'s (HK:9988) Hong Kong shares tumbled after the Chinese e-commerce giant slashed its outlook for fiscal 2022 revenue.
Shares fell 10.13% to HK$140.20 ($18) by 9:46 PM ET (2:46 AM GMT).
Alibaba reported a less-than-expected 29% rise in revenue for the September quarter to CNY200.7 billion ($31.44 billion). The company forecast 20% to 23% growth in fiscal 2022 revenue, lower than the widely expected 27% growth. Net income also fell 81% to CNY5.4 billion, also missing estimates after Alibaba marked down the value of equity investments.
The company will share more details on its outlook at an annual investor forum starting Dec. 16, said Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang.
Weaker consumer spending and intensifying competition contributed to the lowered outlook. The slowdown is likely to continue into the December quarter inclusive of the Single’s Day shopping festival. Alibaba recorded sales of $84.5 billion for the event during the previous week, which was another record but a sharp slowdown compared to previous years.
Competitors such as JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. (HK:9618) and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. are also upping the competition for Alibaba users. Pinduoduo’s number of annual active shoppers hit 849.9 million in the 12 months to June 2021, surpassing Alibaba’s figure. JD.com is also attracting new brands like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) to join its platforms.
The latest COVID-19 outbreak in the country is also dampening consumer sentiment. “Looking ahead, we will continue to invest heavily into three growth engines of domestic consumption, globalization, cloud computing and data intelligence,” said Zhang."

SEATTLE (Reuters) -Norway took delivery on Thursday of the first of five Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, central to the NATO country's ability to expand its submarine-hunting capabilities in the strategic ""High North"" area inside the Arctic Circle.
The five aircraft will replace the Royal Norwegian Air Force's current fleet of six  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) P-3 Orions and two Dassault Aviation DA-20 Jet Falcons.
The fleet will expand Norway's maritime capabilities as it sees Russia ""fielding some incredibly capable maritime assets,"" Major General Odd-Harald Hagen, Norway's defense attache, said before a ribbon-cutting ceremony on a rain-slicked Boeing Field.
""With a much more assertive Russia in the High North, in the Atlantic, and with a more forward-leaning Russian posture, we are returning to near-peer competition also in the maritime domain,"" Hagen said. 
Norway will spend roughly 11 billion kroner ($1.25 billion) on the P-8 aircraft, including additional equipment and support, a Norwegian official said. They will be operated at Norway's Evenes Air Station inside the Arctic Circle
For Boeing, the delivery underscores the importance of its defense business as the U.S. planemaker works to recoup billions of dollars from the overlapping coronavirus and 737 MAX safety crises. 
The anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, surveillance and reconnaissance P-8 is based on Boeing's 737-800 next- generation commercial jetliner.
Boeing has plans to reduce its monthly production rate of 737-based military derivatives to one aircraft a month from 1.5 beginning in April, the company said on Thursday, citing demand and other factors.
Deliveries to New Zealand, South Korea and Germany will take place in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, Boeing said. 

The remaining four P-8 aircraft for Norway were in ""advanced stages of production"" and will be delivered in 2022, Boeing said. 
As ice caps recede and a broader swath of the Arctic Ocean is more navigable, Norway and other European nations have seen the need to improve sub-hunting and other capabilities to support the NATO mission.

Video-streaming platform operator  Bilibili  (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. (HK:9626) also saw its shares fall.
Moves in U.S. Treasuries were minimal. However, the latest Treasury bill auctions indicated that investors are starting to demand more yield to hold the shortest-maturity debt as the debate on whether to lift or suspend the U.S. debt ceiling returns.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A New York trial judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the New York Times from publishing some materials concerning the conservative activist group Project Veritas, a rare step that the newspaper said violated decades of First Amendment protections for the process.
The order by Justice Charles Wood of the Westchester County Supreme Court covers memos written by a Project Veritas lawyer and obtained by the Times.
Wood scheduled a hearing for next Tuesday to consider a longer prohibition against publication, and whether the Times should remove references to privileged attorney-client information in a Nov. 11 https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/us/politics/project-veritas-journalism-political-spying.html article about Project Veritas' journalism practices.
""This ruling is unconstitutional and sets a dangerous precedent,"" Dean Baquet, the Times' executive editor, said in an emailed statement.
""When a court silences journalism, it fails its citizens and undermines their right to know,"" he added. ""The Supreme Court made that clear in the Pentagon Papers case, a landmark ruling against prior restraint blocking the publication of newsworthy journalism. That principle clearly applies here. We are seeking an immediate review of this decision.""
Baquet's statement referred to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1971 rejection of the Nixon administration's bid to stop the Times and the Washington Post from publishing the Pentagon Papers, which detailed U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, called prior restraint ""among the most serious threats to press freedom,"" and said an appeals court should vacate Wood's order if the judge does not.
""This is the first prior restraint entered against the New York Times since the Pentagon Papers, and it is an outrageous affront to the First Amendment,"" Brown said in a statement.
Project Veritas has also been involved in a U.S. Department of Justice probe into its possible role in the reported theft https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/us/politics/project-veritas-investigation-ashley-biden-diary.html of a diary from President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley.
It said in court filings that the FBI this month seized cellphones, pursuant to search warrants, from the homes of founder James O'Keefe and two of the group's former members.
O'Keefe suggested in a statement after Wood issued his order that the Times applied different journalistic standards in covering those searches.
""The paper needs to decide if it is in favor of press freedom for all, or only itself, because it can't have it both ways,"" he said.
Lawyers for Project Veritas had urged Wood to intervene after ""references to, descriptions of, and verbatim quotations"" from memos by its lawyer Benjamin Barr appeared in the Times.
The group is also suing the Times for defamation over a September 2020 article https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/politics/project-veritas-ilhan-omar.html describing a video it released alleging voter fraud in Minnesota.
In a court filing, Project Veritas called the Nov. 11 article ""a bare and vindictive attempt to harm and embarrass a litigation adversary.""

Times lawyers told Wood he should not impose a ""draconian and disfavored restriction"" against publication, without giving the newspaper a chance to show that Project Veritas' request was ""factually and legally deficient.""

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 08:27PM ET</span>","No proof so far of abuse in EU carbon market, says watchdog","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A preliminary investigation has found no proof that the European Union's carbon emissions market was being abused as prices surged to record highs over the past year, the bloc's securities watchdog said on Thursday. 
The European Securities and Markets Authority was asked by the EU's executive, the European Commission, to study the Emissions Trading System (ETS) after accusations that hedge funds were speculating in a market that accounted for 8.1 billion tonnes or 90% of global carbon market value in 2020.
""The growing number of market participants appears in line with the observed expansion of the EU ETS market,"" ESMA said in its report, referring to the European trading scheme.
""The increase in the number of market participants by itself cannot be taken as proof for any patterns of disorderly trading or abusive behaviour present in the carbon market. ESMA will nonetheless further analyse these trends in its next report.""
A combination of faster than expected reduction in emission allowances and increased demand was behind the sharp increases in allowance prices, ESMA said. The price rise was comparable to that of coal and crude oil, it said. 
ESMA ETS Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxongwrpx/ESMA%20ETS%20Graphic.PNG 
ETS is a cornerstone of the bloc's policy to become carbon-neutral by 2050, operating as a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gases by forcing emitters to pay for each tonne of carbon dioxide they generate.
The market is traded on three exchanges: ICE (NYSE:ICE) Endex in the Netherlands, EEX in Germany and Nasdaq Oslo in Norway.
The bloc is negotiating new green policies, including launching a second EU carbon market for the buildings and transport sector to help cut planet-warming emissions faster.

Debate around carbon pricing has intensified, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen telling the United Nations COP26 climate summit https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/was-glasgow-pact-win-climate-time-will-tell-2021-11-14 this month that a robust framework of rules was needed to make global carbon markets a reality.
ESMA said it will produce a further report by early 2022 for the Commission to assess if certain trading behaviours would require further regulatory action.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canadian police on Thursday started arresting indigenous protesters at the site of TC Energy (NYSE:TRP) Corp's Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia, a First Nations group opposed to the project said.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police earlier said they would break up a blockade around the project in the remote northern part of the province, which has long been opposed by the Gidimt'en clan and others on environmental grounds.
""Arrests are being made at Gidimt'en checkpoint,"" said a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account representing the Gidimt'en blockade. At least four arrests had been made and police were using heavy trucks and bulldozers, it said.
The Gidimt'en said on Sunday they had ordered workers to leave the camp, which is on their traditional territory. Coastal says its 500 workers on site are allowed to be there.
The RCMP did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It said earlier that some demonstrators had vandalized equipment, destroyed a road and blocking essential supplies.
Hereditary chiefs from the Gidimt'en and the four other clans that make up the Wet'suwet'en people have been trying for more than a year to halt construction of the pipeline.
All of the 20 elected indigenous band councils along Coastal GasLink's 415 mile (670 km) route support the project. But Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs insist they have the final say.
Coastal, owned by private equity firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc, Alberta Investment Management Corp and TC, says the protests are illegal, citing an injunction granted by the British Columbia Supreme Court in 2019.

""It is unfortunate that the RCMP must take this step so that lawful access to our lodges and public forestry roads can  be restored,"" it said in a statement.
""The Province has chosen to send busloads of police to criminalize Wet'suwet'en water protectors and to work as a mercenary force for oil and gas,"" the Gidimt'en said before the arrests began.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Employees at a  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) cafe in Mesa, Arizona, have said they want to join a union, marking an expansion of efforts by organized labor to target more of the coffee chain's locations.
Six of the company's stores in Buffalo, New York have already said that they aim to join Starbucks Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union. 
Eligible employees at three of those locations are currently voting by mail on whether to join, with ballots due Dec. 8.
The union on Thursday tweeted a letter that it said was sent to Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson regarding the Arizona location.
In the letter, six employees of the store who are leading the organizing said they were forming a union ""because we believe that this is the best way to contribute meaningfully to our partnership with the company"" and ensure they have equal power.
Starbucks, which calls its employees partners, said in a statement, ""We support our partners' right to have their voices heard and we are committed to listening."" 
It said that its success ""has been built on the belief that by working directly together as partners, we can build a different kind of company.""

Bloomberg, which first reported the organizing in Arizona, said Workers United planned to petition the National Labor Relations Board on Thursday for an election there.
In Buffalo, Starbucks has pushed back against the union by challenging aspects of the election with the NLRB. It has also brought in more managers - and even ex-CEO Howard Schultz - to talk directly to employees, holding meetings and extolling the virtues of the company's wage hikes and benefits.

Palihapitiya, founder and chief executive officer of Social Capital, said the sale was to build up cash reserves and fund recent investments in companies such as battery materials firm Mitra Chem, fintech startup Spectral Finance and blockchain infrastructure company Syndica. 
Shares of SoFi were down 1% at $20.30.
He also expects to increase Social Capital's stake in Clover Health Investments Corp through a public offering of common stock.
SoFi went public earlier this year through a merger with a blank-check company, led by Palihapitiya, in a deal valued at about $8.65 billion. 

A blank-check company, also known as SPAC, uses capital raised through an IPO to buy a private company, usually within two years. The deal then takes the private company public.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Jon Tester on Thursday introduced legislation to halt the import of Brazilian beef into the United States and called for experts to review ""the commodity's safety"" after media reports that Brazil delayed reporting two cases of mad cow disease.
The bill by Tester, a Montana Democrat, follows political pressure from U.S. cattle producers who have been calling for a halt to imports of Brazilian fresh beef due to questions about what processes Brazil uses to detect animal disease and other potential foodborne threats to consumers. 
Brazil, the world's largest beef exporter, suspended beef exports to top customer China after the South American country in early September confirmed two cases of ""atypical"" mad cow disease - or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) - in two separate domestic meat plants. 
But the cases were originally detected in June, well before they were reported to trade partners and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), according to a Nov. 12 letter sent by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
USDA, which regulates beef imports into the United States, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
The United States imported $62.3 million of beef and beef products from Brazil in the first nine months of this year, a 36% increase over the same period a year earlier, according to U.S. Census Bureau trade data. In total volume, Brazil was the second-largest U.S. supplier of beef and beef product imports during that period, behind Mexico.

Political pressure on USDA has mounted in recent days, after two cases of a neurodegenerative disorder in patients in Rio de Janeiro state were reported earlier this month.
Officials with Brazil's Agriculture Ministry said the cases were not related to beef consumption, tamping down fears of possible bovine spongiform encephalopathy causing human illness.

""The individuals concerned are no longer employed by Cathay Pacific,"" the company said in a statement issued on Thursday.
The South China Morning Post, which first reported the firings, cited a source as saying the pilots were suspected of leaving their hotel rooms in Germany.
The discovery of the infections led to more than 150 other Cathay employees, including pilots and flight attendants, as well as many household members and community contacts being sent to a government quarantine facility for three weeks.
""As a result of these findings, we have requested the government to review the decision to place certain groups into government quarantine,"" Cathay said.
Hong Kong has recorded barely any local coronavirus cases in recent months but authorities in the global financial hub have tightened up quarantine rules.
Hong Kong is following Beijing's lead in retaining strict travel curbs, in contrast to a global trend of opening up and living with the coronavirus. The city government hopes the tighter rules would convince China, its main source of economic growth, to gradually open its border with Hong Kong.
After the pilot cases were reported last week, Cathay said it would step up compliance checks at overseas ports to ensure health and safety protocols were being strictly followed during layovers.
All of Cathay's crew have received COVID-19 vaccines and the airline said it would require a booster dose as well.
Hong Kong's strict rules, which include up to three weeks of hotel quarantine for arrivals, have led to a plunge in travel demand.

Cathay said this week it operated in October at only 10% of the pre-pandemic passenger capacity and posted a 97.2% decline in passenger numbers from 2019.
However, cargo demand has been far more robust and the airline achieved close to operating cash break-even for the period from July to October.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq eked out record closing highs after a topsy-turvy Thursday on Wall Street, as investors focused on upbeat retail and technology earnings which outshone hawkish inflation comments from a Federal Reserve policymaker. 
By contrast, the Dow continued to play the laggard, registering its third decline this week, as Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) weighed on the benchmark.
Inflation remains front and center for investors, and stock markets initially slipped after New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said inflation is becoming more broad-based and that expectations for future price increases are rising.
Both the S&P and Nasdaq had rebounded by late morning though, with the latter supported by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The chipmaker jumped 8.2% after beating quarterly estimates and forecasting strong fourth-quarter revenue.
The performance helped the Philadelphia semiconductor index advance 1.8% to hit its second record close in three sessions.
The S&P consumer discretionary sector led gains among its peers, ascending 1.5% as positive retail earnings from Macy's and Kohl's joined upbeat reports from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) earlier this week.
Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) surged 21.1%, its largest one-day percentage gain in decades, after it raised its annual earnings guidance and flagged plans for a potential spinoff of its ecommerce division. 
Peer Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) advanced 10.6% after raising its forecast.
The S&P 500 retailing index gained 2.8% to break its record peak for the third session this week, as investors viewed the earnings as a signal of robust consumer demand that has persevered through rising inflation, and that retailers were set for a strong holiday season.
""The consumer is stronger than expected; it's good news for the country as a whole. A stronger consumer is a reflection of a strong economic bounce,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of research and trading at Harvest Volatility Management in New York.
Still, concerns over further increases in price pressure, along with uncertainty over the Fed's plans for tightening have kept Wall Street muted this week.
""We definitely hit overbought territory and settling in is going to be healthy for us to take the next leg up,"" said Eric Metz, chief investment officer of Chicago-based SpiderRock Advisors.
""Outside of Fed policy or large earnings disappointments, I think there's some pretty stable footing underneath us, but markets can be fickle and so staying prudent is the name of the game right now.""

The Dow lagged its peers on steep losses in network gear maker Cisco, which tumbled 5.5% after it forecast current-quarter revenue below expectations due to supply chain shortages and delays.
 Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) declined for a second day, with its 0.8% fall taking it to its lowest close since Feb. 3, after news that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) may pare back its relationship with the payments company.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Communications Commission chair Jessica Rosenworcel said Thursday she is confident questions raised about the impact of planned use of spectrum for 5G wireless communications on aviation safety can be resolved.
""You asked if I have confidence in our ability to resolve these issues with mitigation. The answer to that is yes,"" Rosenworcel said, adding ""discussions are ongoing.""
Earlier this month, AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) agreed to delay commercial launch of C-band wireless service until Jan. 5 after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) raised safety concerns.
FAA chief Steve Dickson said Tuesday ""we will figure this out"" but said it is unclear what mitigations will be needed to address safety concerns.
The FAA issued a Nov. 2 bulletin warning action may be needed to address potential interference caused by the 5G deployment with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters.
People briefed on the matter told Reuters potential mitigation measures include small exclusion zones around airports, downward tilt of some antennas and reduced power levels to areas around airports to reduce the amount of skyward energy.
More meetings are scheduled Friday as the White House, FAA, FCC and other U.S. agencies try to resolve concerns. The goal is to reach agreement before Dec 5, officials said, which is roughly when the FAA would need to issue a formal directive to airlines on safety concerns without a new delay.
A coalition of wireless and other trade groups on Thursday told the White House ""further delays in launching C-Band could have serious consequences for our nation’s ability to leverage the economic growth associated with 5G"" and argue there have no been C-Band aviation safety issues in other countries using the spectrum.

RTCA, previously known as the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics, issued a 2020 report on the 5G aviation issue raising concerns. RTCA defended the report Tuesday, saying ""calls for dismissal have not been validated by hard science or engineering analysis.""
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and U.S. airlines have urged administration action to resolve concerns, saying 5G could ""cause harmful interference to radio altimeters, which are crucial systems used by every commercial aircraft and helicopter.""

MILAN (Reuters) -Italian fashion group Prada (OTC:PRDSY) expects to join talks between Cartier-owner Richemont and online retailer Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) about launching a joint e-commerce platform as it seeks to boost online sales and grow overall revenues by 40%.
Richemont said last week it was in advanced talks with Farfetch about selling it a minority stake in its online business Yoox Net-a-Porter (MI:YNAP). It added it would also invite other firms to participate in turning YNAP into an industry-wide platform with no overall controlling shareholder.
Farfetch chief executive Jose Neves said during the company's third-quarter earnings call that the luxury brands are still in negotiations. He could not provide timing on transaction as ""there is no guarantee any deal will be successfully completed.""
""I think...we will be invited to participate in the discussions,"" Lorenzo Bertelli, the group's 33-year-old marketing chief and son of CEO Patrizio Bertelli, told an investors' presentation in Milan.
""It's premature and the scenario is still not clear enough to answer, but we are not saying ""no"" a priori,"" he said when asked if Prada could invest in the venture.
Patrizio Bertelli, who with his wife and creative designer Miuccia Prada has transformed a family-owned brand into one of the world's top luxury groups and vowed to keep it independent, said he could hand over the reins to Lorenzo in the next three to four years. Bertelli senior is 75.
SALES TARGET 
Unveiling Prada's medium-term strategy, the pair said they aimed for sales to reach 4.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion), compared with 3.2 billion euros in 2019, before the pandemic struck, and record sales of 3.6 billion euros it posted in 2013. 
The focus will be on moving Prada upmarket and doubling the online share of retail sales to 15% - still below an industry average of around 20% but way above the 2% level prior to the global health emergency. 
The Hong Kong-listed group, known for its minimalist looks, was in the middle of a strategic revamp to revive sales when the crisis hit retailers across the globe by forcing them to temporarily shut stores and depriving them of tourist shopping. 
It said on Thursday that retail sales in the three months to September had grown by 18% compared to the same period in 2019, an acceleration from the 13% growth rate of the second quarter.
It expects revenues to grow above 2019 levels this year after falling to 2.4 billion euros in 2020. 
In the medium term it targets an operating profit of 20% of total sales, more than twice the 2019 level, a goal that some analysts said was underwhelming when compared with brands like Gucci or Louis Vuitton.

Executives said that Prada, less exposed to higher-margin leather goods and handbags than rivals, was planning to invest in those product categories to boost margins. ""We think those targets are not under-ambitious, but reasonable and realistic,"" said Alessandra Cozzani, the group's finance chief.

Turkey's lira shed another 2.83% after its central bank cut rates by 100 basis points to 15%, even in the face of inflation near 20%, sending the Turkish currency hurtling southward.
""The lira remains a punching bag, and further weakness has no end in sight,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.
The lira has lost around 11.5% of its value this month amid President Tayyip Erdogan's renewed criticism of interest rates and calls for stimulus despite the risks. It was last at 10.909, having earlier hit a record low of 11.30 per dollar.
The dollar edged back from a 16-month high as traders weighed whether the U.S. currency's recent surge had gone too far.
The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six rivals, was last down 0.3%.
In the U.S. Treasury market, yields fell after the relative success of a 20-year bond auction on Wednesday reduced fears about further rapid yield increases.
Benchmark 10-year notes were last at 1.587%. They have jumped from a low of 1.415% last week and are holding below five-month highs of 1.705% reached on Oct. 21.
Oil prices rose slightly after dropping to six-week lows.

Retailers have faced pressure this year from shipping logjams, shuttered factories in Asia and a scarcity of raw materials, leading companies like  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) to warn of product shortages during the holiday season.
But Macy's (NYSE:M) moves to expedite shipments and order products earlier in the year helped its inventory levels rise by 19.4% in the third quarter and were expected to ward off a hit from the supply crisis in the holiday period.
""I have the right inventory to do what I need to do in the holiday timeframe,"" Macy's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette told Reuters.
""We use our full muscle to ensure that we have enough inventory for our customers, which does restrict supply to some of our competitors.""
Macy's expects full-year net sales of $24.12 billion to $24.28 billion, compared with $23.55 billion to $23.95 billion previously.
A 1% rise in its gross margins on pre-pandemic 2019 levels, aided by more full-price selling, also comes as a relief at a time when larger retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) are struggling with higher supply costs, said Empire Financial Research analyst Berna Barshay. 

Kohl's, meanwhile, has increased spending to speed up shipments and prioritized new products tied to promotional events to prepare for the holiday period.
""We are well-positioned for the holiday season with fresh receipts (shipments) continuing to flow to support anticipated customer demand,"" Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass said.
