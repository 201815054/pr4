BOSTON (Reuters) - Investment manager Keith Meister said on Thursday the utilities sector is a sensible place to invest and pitched  Exelon Corp  (NASDAQ:EXC) as a favorite idea because it is cheap, well-positioned in its sector and because he expects change at the company.
""The whole space is cheap and Exelon trades at a deep discount,"" Meister, who runs Corvex Management, said at the 13D Monitor Conference. He added Exelon to his portfolio during the second quarter and said stock of the Chicago-based energy company could climb by 30%. 
Utilities, he said, are not impacted by uncertainty around the Nov. 3 U.S. election and offer defensive protection against factors that would slow growth. 
The company could also benefit as investors focus more on environmental issues and gravitate toward electric vehicles and away from coal generation.
Investors prefer pure-play regulated businesses and there is uncertainty around the company's Exelon Generation, a leading provider of zero-carbon nuclear energy whose profitability is weighing on the company, Meister said.
Exelon's stock closed at $39.32 on Thursday and climbed nearly 2% in after-hours trading, following Meister's talk. Corvex owned 2.2 million shares at the end of the second quarter.

(Reuters) - U.S. government-supported passenger railroad Amtrak said on Thursday that without a new government bailout it could be forced to cut more spending and train services which could lead to the loss of another 2,400 jobs.
Amtrak last month told Congress it needs up to $4.9 billion in government funding for the current budget year, up from the around $2 billion in annual support it usually receives.
The railroad, which said last month it was cutting 2,000 jobs, said on Thursday that without more support from Congress, reduced capital spending would result in the loss of 775 jobs and further reductions in train service by state partners would likely result in 1,625 job losses.
Without the new funding, Amtrak chief executive Bill Flynn said, ""we will be unable to avoid more drastic impacts that could have long lasting effects on our Northeast Corridor infrastructure and the national rail system.""
U.S. transit and airline demand has been devastated by a massive falloff in travel due to the coronavirus pandemic.
In April, Congress gave Amtrak a $1 billion bailout after daily ridership fell by 96%.
Amtrak said on Thursday demand remains at about 25% of pre-COVID levels. It forecasts ridership and revenue for the 2020-21 budget year that started Oct. 1 will improve to ""about 40% of pre-COVID levels, which is weaker than anticipated.""
U.S. passenger airlines are seeking a new $25 billion bailout to keep tens of thousands of workers on the job, while major U.S. public transit systems have sought $32 billion to keep municipal buses and trains running.
That's on top of a $25 billion bailout public transit received in April.
Last week, the U.S. private motorcoach, school bus and domestic passenger vessel industries said they collectively furloughed or laid off an estimated 308,000 employees over the last eight months. 

""Unlike other modes of transportation, such as airlines, rail and public transit, these transportation industries have not received direct economic relief to date, putting them in peril,"" several trade groups said in a joint statement.

Investing.com – The Dow climbed Thursday, led by strength in value stocks even as investors mulled the chances of further stimulus after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected the idea of passing standalone aid bills.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.43%, or 122 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.81%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.50%.
""There is not going to be any stand-alone bill unless there is a bigger bill and it can be part of that, or it could be in addition to it,"" Pelosi said, though added that talks were ongoing. Earlier this week, Trump said he was ready to sign off on standalone stimulus bills, including support for individuals, small businesses and airlines.  
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, reportedly said a big portion of Republican senators were wary of rolling out further stimulus.
Airlines initially dropped on the news, but pared some losses. 
Delta Air Line (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), and  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) ended higher. American Airlines told CNBC it would be forced to terminate service to additional U.S. markets without additional aid from Congress.
Stocks tied to the economy continued to trend above the flatline, with financials, industrials and energy higher. 
Energy led the broader market higher, underpinned by rising oil prices amid hurricane-related disruptions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and positive comments from OPEC on long-term oil demand.
OPEC forecasts global oil demand will surpass the pre-pandemic levels in 2022 and grow steadily until the late 2030s, when it will begin to plateau.
Big tech, meanwhile, gave up some gains to trade mixed.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed above the flatline, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended in the red.
Elsewhere in tech, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) jumped nearly 6% after saying it would spin off its managed infrastructure services business into a separate public company. The move comes as 'Big Blue' seeks to ramp-up its hybrid cloud growth.
"" IBM  is essentially getting rid of a shrinking, low margin operation given the cannibalizing impact of automation and cloud, masking stronger growth for the rest of the operation,"" Wedbush said, though added that IBM's medium-term growth forecasts appeared ""aggressive.""
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) cut gains into the close following a rally earlier after New Street upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, with a Street-high price target of $578.
On the economic front, the Labor Department said 840,000 people filed for unemployment support for the first time in the week ended October 3, down 9,000 from the prior week's upwardly revised 849,000, and above economists' estimate of 820,000.

The overhaul, which is expected to begin in the coming weeks, would result in thousands of layoffs across Warner Bros Studios and TV channels like HBO, TBS and TNT, according to the report.
""We shared with our employees recently that the organization will be restructured to respond to those changes and prioritize growth opportunities, with an emphasis on direct-to-consumer,"" the company said in a statement. 
Earlier in August, WarnerMedia said it would cut jobs as part of a broad restructuring focused around its HBO Max streaming business.

10,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 03:11PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing in talks with Alaska Airlines for potential 737 MAX order - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tracy Rucinski
SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is in discussions to sell 737 MAX jets to Alaska Airlines once the plane returns to service following a lengthy grounding, three people familiar with the matter said.
The talks are part of a series of negotiations between Boeing and several airlines over jet orders or compensation after the 737 MAX was banned worldwide following two fatal crashes.
Boeing and Alaska Airlines, which is part of  Alaska Air  Group Inc (N:ALK), declined to comment.
Any deal would be subject to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approval of proposed 737 MAX safety upgrades.
Boeing shares were up 1.6% at $167.22 on Thursday afternoon, while Alaska Air stock was up 4.1% at $38.54.
Alaska Airlines already had ordered 37 of the jets before the grounding. If confirmed, a new order from such a major carrier would give Boeing's 737 MAX a sorely needed commercial boost as the U.S. planemaker tries to move beyond a crisis that has hammered its finances.
It would also mark a post-crisis test of the balance of power between Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR). The European planemaker is battling to keep a foothold in Alaska Airlines, which had operated an all-Boeing fleet until it acquired Virgin America in 2016.
However, any new deal between Alaska Airlines and Boeing is expected to include significant discounts given the MAX's woes and plunging demand for airplanes during the coronavirus crisis, industry sources said.
It was not immediately clear how many jets it may buy.
The talks are among several discussions Boeing is having with airlines, hoping to stimulate demand for the jet when it returns to the air. Analysts caution cutting prices too far could rattle some existing customers.
After months of delays, and pending approval of design and operational changes, Boeing expects to resume 737 MAX deliveries to airlines before year-end in the United States. 
Seattle-based Alaska Airlines flies 166 older Boeing 737s and 71 Airbus A320-family aircraft.
It has one of the strongest balance sheets among U.S. airlines and analysts believe it could emerge from the pandemic crisis in a competitive position relative to its peers. 

Boeing is also negotiating with Irish budget carrier Ryanair (I:RYA), one of its largest customers, over compensation for delays in MAX deliveries and a potential new order.

IBM will spin off the unit that manages the IT infrastructure for clients, including support for data centers. That unit will have a new name by the end of next year.
Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, who also engineered IBM’s $34 acquisition of cloud company Red Hat last year, called the move a “significant shift” in the 109-year-old company’s business model.

PARIS (Reuters) - Google must open talks with publishers in France about paying to use their content, an appeals court confirmed on Thursday, paving the way for an industry-wide deal in the country. 
The ruling may reverberate outside France, as it compels Google to sit down with publishers and news agencies to find a way to remunerate them under the ""neighbouring right"" enshrined in revamped EU copyright rules, which allows publishers to demand a fee from online platforms for showing news snippets.
""It's a world first for such a case,"" France's antitrust chief Isabelle de Silva told Reuters, adding that the French court had essentially validated an earlier decision by the competition authority.
""Google's conduct amounted to saying: I'm offering you a contract under which you give me all your rights for no remuneration,"" de Silva said, with reference to the business relationship between news publishers and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google. 
The French court's decision differs from last week's pledge by Google to pay $1 billion to publishers globally over the next three years for their news, as the French arrangement involves finding a sustainable methodology to remunerate publishers and news agencies. 
Google's vehicle to remunerate news publishers, dubbed Google News Showcase, is set to launch in Germany, where it has signed up German newspapers including Der Spiegel, Stern, Die Zeit, and in Brazil with Folha de S.Paulo, Band and Infobae.
The French court's ruling comes hours after Google, the world's biggest search engine, said it was set to reach with a deal to pay French publishers for their news, the latest move to placate media groups and head off regulators siding with publishers.
""Our priority remains to reach an agreement with the French publishers and press agencies,"" Google said in a statement. 
""We appealed to get legal clarity on some parts of the order, and we will now review the decision of the Paris court of appeal."" 
The ruling confirms a decision in April by France's competition authority, which ordered Google to negotiate with publishers and news agencies ""the remuneration due to them for any re-use of protected content"".

Under the same decision, the antitrust regulator ordered Google to open talks within three months of being asked to do so by publishers.

Investing.com -- The television show may be history, but anything Kylie Jenner still excites investors. 
Coty (NYSE:COTY) popped 11% after the cosmetics company said Kylie Skin will sell directly to consumers in the U.K., France, Germany, and Australia. 
The direct-to-consumer websites will allow shoppers to buy products in local languages and currencies, avoiding additional customs fees and duties. The Kyle collection has been selling out quickly, Coty said. Case in point: the Lip Balm Set launched in August sold out in 18 minutes. That's enough to make even the most skeptical among us consider taking a stake in Coty. 
Coty says Kylie Jenner is one of the world’s most admired personalities with over 300 million followers across her personal and brand social media channels, and one of the most influential voices among beauty consumers globally. Admired for what, they do not say.
Kylie Skin, launched in May 2019, is reportedly a top-selling skin care brand in the U.S. In keeping with the times, all products are cruelty-free, vegan, gluten free, paraben and sulfate free and suitable for all skin types.
Among the offerings will be Coconut Body Scrub and Lotion, Vanilla Milk Toner, and Walnut Face Scrub.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 11:26AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Virgin Hyperloop picks West Virginia to test high-speed transport system,"By Eric M. Johnson and Joey Roulette
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Virgin Hyperloop has picked the U.S. state of West Virginia to host a $500 million certification center and test track for billionaire Richard Branson's super high-speed travel system, the company told Reuters.
The center will be the first U.S. regulatory proving ground for a hyperloop system designed to whisk floating pods packed with passengers and cargo through vacuum tubes at 600 miles (966 kmph) an hour or faster.
Later, Branson announced the decision in a press conference on Thursday, joined virtually by U.S. Transportation Department Secretary Elaine Chao, the state's Republican governor Jim Justice, and U.S. Senators from West Virginia Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, and Joe Manchin, a Democrat.
""Today we lay the foundation for commercial deployment and operations across the United States of America and beyond,"" the company's Chief Executive Jay Walder told reporters.
In a hyperloop system, which uses magnetic levitation to allow near-silent travel, a trip between New York and Washington would take just 30 minutes. That would be twice as fast as a commercial jet flight and four times faster than a high-speed train.
Construction is slated to begin in 2022 on the site of a former coal mine in Tucker and Grant Counties, West Virginia, with safety certification by 2025 and commercial operations by 2030, the company said.
Federal regulators will use the center, and accompanying six-mile test track, to establish regulatory and safety standards, while Virgin will test its product and infrastructure.
The announcement comes less than three months after the Transportation Department published guidance on a regulatory framework for U.S. hyperloop systems. On Thursday, Chao said the guidance will enable the company ""to spend less time on government paperwork and more time on making hyperloop systems fast, efficient, and above all, safe.""
Virgin Hyperloop, which has raised more than $400 million, largely from United Arab Emirates shipping company DP World and Branson, is among a number of firms racing to launch new high-speed travel systems.
Canada's Transpod and Spain's Zeleros also aim to upend traditional passenger and freight networks with similar technology they say will slash travel times, congestion and environmental harm linked with petroleum-fueled machines.
Elon Musk's Boring Company envisions commuters zipping along underground tracks in electric cars.
Virgin Hyperloop picked West Virginia after reviewing applications from 17 U.S. states to host the center. 
However, the company's most likely first route could be in India, linking Mumbai to Pune, though the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed procurement and construction, initially slated for 2020. 

Virgin Hyperloop also has a research and development test track near Las Vegas, Nevada.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 11:21AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley to buy Eaton Vance for $7 billion in investment-management push,"By Niket Nishant and Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) has agreed to buy   Eaton  Vance  Corp (N:EV) for about $7 billion in a cash-and-stock deal that can quickly expand its investment-management business and add more offerings for retail investors, the bank said on Thursday.
The transaction is the latest move by Chief Executive James Gorman to reshape Morgan Stanley into one of the biggest global money managers through a series of acquisitions that began just before he took over more than a decade ago.
Morgan Stanley's wealth and investment management businesses already account for 40-50% of the bank's revenue. Adding Eaton Vance would nearly double assets under management within the investment management division compared with June 30 and boost the business's annual revenue by about one-third. ""Eaton Vance is a perfect fit,"" Gorman said.
Eaton Vance shareholders will receive $28.25 per share in cash and 0.5833 Morgan Stanley shares for each share they hold, representing a 38% premium to Eaton (NYSE:ETN)'s closing price on Wednesday. They will also get a one-time $4.25 dividend paid by Eaton Vance before the deal closes.
Subject to regulatory approvals, the two companies expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2021.
The deal is good for Morgan Stanley because it will help the bank distribute funds to retail investors since Eaton Vance is the top U.S. distributor of individual separate accounts,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jason Goldberg said. It may also help grow revenue in an inexpensive way while growing assets, he said.
However, the deal still dilutes shareholders and involves ""execution risks"" for a bank that has bought a couple of other companies lately, including online retail brokerage E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC).
""Morgan Stanley is undertaking another acquisition so soon after E*Trade,"" Goldberg wrote in a note to clients.
DEALMAKER-IN-CHIEF
The Eaton Vance deal bolsters Gorman's reputation as a CEO who acquires his way to growth, then finds efficiencies to bolster profits.
The most emblematic deal of his tenure was Morgan Stanley's decision to buy Smith Barney, which was announced in 2009 when he ran the bank's wealth management business. Gorman was crucial in forging the massive deal, and combining the two companies became his chief task when he was elevated to CEO the next year.
During that time, Gorman boosted the wealth management's profit margins from single digits to 25-30% in more recent periods.
After a long pause in acquisitions, Morgan Stanley announced last year that it would purchase an employee stock-plan manager for $850 million, and in February said it would buy online stock brokerage E*Trade for $13 billion.
Although Gorman has turned around wealth management through deals, investment management has long been a sore point for the bank.
After the financial crisis, executives tried without much success in turning around performance. The crisis crushed values in some funds, especially real estate, while FrontPoint, a prominent hedge fund it owned, got entangled in insider trading charges.
By 2010, Morgan Stanley also had to comply with the Volcker rule, which limited its own financial commitment to private equity and hedge funds it managed.
Nonetheless, management set growth targets Morgan Stanley struggled to meet.
For instance, in 2014, Morgan Stanley set a goal for its investment management unit of $500 billion in assets under management and a 20% return-on-equity (ROE) by 2016, neither of which it reached in time. It is now surpassing both targets, partly due to soaring market values.
The Eaton Vance deal will certainly help with assets, boosting AUM to $1.2 trillion from $665 billion at June 30. The bank expects combined annual revenue of about $5 billion, compared with $3.8 billion last year.
Morgan Stanley has been looking at Eaton Vance for several years, Gorman said on a conference call with analysts to discuss the deal. He dismissed the idea that Morgan Stanley had overpaid, saying ""you pay quality for quality.""
After Eaton Vance, Morgan Stanley is done with deals for awhile, Gorman said. The bank will then focus on incorporating all the companies it has bought and finding ways to make them gel with one another.
Morgan Stanley expects to realize $150 million in annual savings through the transaction. It will have a break-even effect on earnings per share immediately and then become marginally beneficial to EPS, the bank said.
The deal also helps the bank use extra capital in a way that still leaves it about 300 basis points above what the Federal Reserve requires, Morgan Stanley said.

Morgan Stanley shares rose 1.2% to $49.29 in morning trading, while Eaton Vance shares jumped 47.7% to $60.45.

Clayton also said he has directed staff to actively consider the President's Working Group (PWG) Aug. 6 recommendations to strengthen protections for investors from the risks of investing in emerging markets, including China.

“I’m quite concerned that there could be considerable downside,” depending on “factors that we can’t fit easily into our models,” the senior investment strategist said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “This includes: What will the Congress do? What will the President say? And of course, the election outcome.”
Joseph Cohen, who in the 1990s was the most famous equity strategist in America, pointed to “wide gaps” in valuations within the stock market, with the recovery rally since March having been largely driven by a handful of mega-cap technology companies. This, she warned, can make the market more vulnerable to disappointments. Only this week, markets slid after President Donald Trump announced he was halting stimulus talks until after next month’s election.
“Those of us who have lived our professional lives really focusing in on the math, I think should feel very humble right now because what we recognize is that the models may not be able to properly reflect all of the volatility not just in the markets, but in the economy, in policy and of course in investor sentiment,” Joseph Cohen said.
Goldman’s house view is that the S&P 500 Index is currently “modestly” undervalued based on expectations of corporate profit growth and accommodative U.S. Federal Reserve policy actions, the strategist said. She cautioned that “intense” volatility has been rising ahead of the election and all eyes are currently on the fiscal stimulus negotiations.
A “blue wave” of wins for Joe Biden’s Democrats could bring more certainty to the government’s fiscal actions, according to Joseph Cohen. Investors are now viewing the possibility of a Democratic victory as positive for the longer-term outlook on corporate profits and economic growth in 2021 and beyond, she said.
‘Blue Wave’
“What we’re seeing from investors over the last several days is that a ‘blue wave’ might not be such a bad thing because it would give us more certainty with regard to policy, particularly with regard to the use of fiscal policy to help our economy at this point,” the strategist said.
She echoed the comments of Fed Chair Jerome Powell that more fiscal support is needed to sustain the economic recovery.
Joseph Cohen said that based on her conversations with investors, market participants are uncertain what Trump’s plans would be for the second term, adding that there’s “disappointment” on infrastructure policy and concern about possible environmental and healthcare actions.
U.S. stocks rose on Thursday after Trump advocated a piecemeal approach in a barrage of overnight tweets, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled openness to a standalone airline-relief bill.

While TikTok's advertising business is young it has attracted big names that aim to reach the millions of teenagers who use the app for dance challenges, makeup tutorials and lipsyncing videos.

But its days operating in the United States could be cut short if the U.S. government successfully bars domestic transactions - including advertising - with the app, owned by China's ByteDance. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have criticized the app's security and privacy rules, concerned that user information could be passed on to China's government. 
A U.S. court hearing on whether to allow the government to bar transactions with TikTok, which could effectively ban it, will be held on Nov. 4, the day after the presidential election.
FORGING AHEAD 
France's Danone last week announced a new TikTok campaign for its Oikos Triple Zero yogurt. 
""For us, it’s all about being where our consumers are and making sure we are executing our campaigns in a safe way,"" Danone's U.S. marketing head Linda Bethea told Reuters. 
The campaign features football player Saquon Barkley from the New York Giants carrying many overloaded grocery bags and invites users to post videos of themselves doing the same. The campaign runs through October, but Danone can switch it to a different platform if necessary. 
""Leading into this campaign, we were always proactively prepared for potential shifts in strategy,"" Bethea said. ""But for now we are committed to continuing the campaign on the platform."" 
Bethea declined to comment on legal or political matters beyond saying Danone was in constant contact with TikTok and agency partners to ensure its actions comply with U.S. regulations. 
""Our clients are concerned about any type of political conversation that might swirl around them, generally speaking,"" Petty said, without naming clients.
Fast-food chain Chipotle this week launched its third TikTok campaign of the year, challenging users to hit a 53-foot basketball shot - the same number of ingredients used on its menu. 
""We are monitoring the conversation taking place surrounding the future of the TikTok and working closely with their team,"" a spokeswoman said. 
""We are grateful to the advertising community for showing us tremendous support during this time,"" said Blake Chandlee, head of global business solutions at TikTok.
In August, ad buyers said TikTok was offering refunds for campaigns that are unable to run if the app was banned in the U.S.
Talks are ongoing to finalize a preliminary deal for Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations. U.S. President Donald Trump said last month the deal had his ""blessing."" 
When asked about the effect of a potential ban on its reputation, Danone said brand reputation was ""of the utmost importance,"" but that it also prioritizes engaging consumers on ""dynamic digital platforms that allow for interactive brand storytelling.""
Procter & Gamble - one of the world's top advertisers - said it, too, would continue to use TikTok where possible as it watches for the outcome of the U.S. litigation. 
""For the most part we’re advising clients to stay the course with their TikTok buys,"" said Allie Wassum, who heads social strategy for ad agency Digitas North America, adding that TikTok has shown a commitment to ""making it work"". 
But some companies are staying on the TikTok sidelines for now, according to Joe Gagliese, CEO of influencer marketing firm Viral Nation. 

""This is crunch time for brands preparing for Q4, and if they were going to activate now it would have needed to be planned during the time when there was a lot of uncertainty around the app,"" he said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) said on Thursday it will hire up to 9,000 workers to cover the holiday season in its stores, 1,000 more than last year, expecting a jump in online orders amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
Retailers have struggled this year, with mall traffic declining across the United States as stores in states such as California continue to operate under severe restrictions to combat the spread of COVID-19.
The number of people visiting Dick's outlets fell by nearly 54% in May, data firm Placer.ai showed, around when many of Dick's stores were temporarily shut closed. While this has since improved, traffic is still about 9% lower than last year, the data shows.
Pennsylvania-based Dick's expects in-store foot traffic to improve from earlier this year, with demand for products such as kayaks, golf clubs and bicycles up as many people turn to non-contact sports. 
Still, online sales are surging: second-quarter e-commerce sales nearly tripled, it said recently. 
Ship-from-store orders accounted for three-quarters of all online orders in the quarter, Dick's said.
The ""vast majority"" of new holiday season hires will work in stores, fulfilling curbside pick-up and ship-to-store orders or working at cash registers. 
Only about 250 of the new workers will be sent to distribution centers, Dick's Chief People Officer Julie Lodge-Jarrett told Reuters.
As part of its hiring pitch, Dick's plans to pay workers 15% more at least than the minimum wage of each state through the end of the year, also offering them discounts on Dicks's goods of up to 25%.
""In the vast majority of the states we already pay above minimum wage, even for our entry level position,"" Lodge-Jarrett said.

The company said it would kick off most of its hiring nationwide on Oct. 14.

34,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",Ant Group's $35 billion IPO unlikely to be hurt by possible U.S. curbs,"By Scott Murdoch and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ant Group's $35 billion initial public offering (IPO) is unlikely to suffer from any U.S. restrictions on the Chinese financial technology giant due to its very limited overseas presence, potential investors and analysts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump is considering curbs on Ant, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce firm  Alibaba  (N:BABA), and Tencent (HK:0700) over concerns their payment platforms threaten national security, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.
If implemented, the restrictions would illustrate how Trump's administration is seeking to prevent Chinese companies from embedding themselves in the U.S. financial system before they become a significant competitive threat.
Ant said it was not aware of any discussions within the administration about restrictions. Tencent and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Ant is working towards a dual-listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong possibly as soon as this month in what sources have said could be the world's largest IPO, surpassing oil giant  Saudi Aramco 's (SE:2222) $29.4 billion float in December.
Ant's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat payment platforms are used primarily by Chinese citizens with accounts in renminbi. Most of their U.S. interactions are with merchants accepting payments from Chinese travelers and businesses in the country.
""Basically the overseas revenue accounts for maybe 5% or less for Ant Group. That means for the U.S. revenue contribution it would be even less than that,"" said Morningstar senior equity analyst Chelsey Tam.
""I'm sure investors will ask about it during the roadshow but it's quite easy for investors to understand that if Alipay and Wechat Pay go overseas the U.S. is probably not the top priority,"" Tam said.
Ant, which makes 95% of its revenue in China, is seeking to raise about $35 billion in an IPO after assessing early investor interest and based on a valuation of about $250 billion or more, Reuters has reported.
The United States has increasingly scrutinized app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel. 
In 2018, the government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) forced Ant to scrap plans to buy https://www.reuters.com/article/us-moneygram-intl-m-a-ant-financial-idUSKBN1ER1R7 MoneyGram International Inc (O:MGI) over concerns about the safety of data that could identify U.S. citizens. 
It was one of the first high profile US-China deals to be blocked under the Trump administration. 
An official at a state-backed Chinese fund, a potential investor in an Ant IPO, said he was not worried about the planned U.S. restrictions as the market only accounted for a tiny portion of the company's overall business.
The official declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

""The ban is more about stopping Ant from expanding in the U.S. in the future, but that shouldn't have an immediate impact on the valuation as there is lot more growth left for Ant in China,"" said LightStream Research analyst Supun Walpola, who publishes on the Smartkarma platform.

LONDON (Reuters) - Demand for cigarettes has picked up in the COVID-19 pandemic, helped by a rise in home working that has given smokers more opportunities to light up, Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) said on Thursday.
The maker of Gauloises and West cigarettes nudged up its full-year revenue forecast.
A spokesman for the British firm said consumers appeared to be spending more on tobacco as they saved money in other areas, such as travel and holidays, while working from home meant many of them were not restricted by when they could smoke. 
The news came as  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and bwin owner GVC Holdings raised its annual earnings outlook, helped by a surge in online gaming, in another sign consumers are looking to escape the stresses of the pandemic.
Imperial said it expected full-year net revenue to be broadly flat, with a 1% increase in its tobacco business offsetting a 30% drop in its small ""next generation products"" business, which includes e-cigarettes. 
The company said at its half-year results that it would reduce investment in next generation products, once considered the next frontier for the tobacco industry.
The revenue forecast is slightly above guidance provided at the half year and the first indication of performance under CEO Stefan Bomhard, who joined in July.
It is also above analysts' estimates, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts, who said the consensus was for a decline of 1.6% overall and 0.4% for tobacco.
Imperial's shares were up less than 1% in morning trading. 
The company also noted shifts in demand between markets, with strength in key European countries and the United States, but weakness in traditional summer tourist destinations, as smokers stayed home.
Still, Imperial forecast earnings per share down around 6%, due to increasing its provisions as a result of COVID-19 uncertainties and pandemic-related manufacturing costs.
""We would suggest this is a positive print,"" Jefferies analysts said. ""Focus will now shift into next year and whether it can maintain this momentum when dynamics start to change again post COVID (recession, travel opening up)."" 

Imperial will report full-year results on Nov. 17, when it will announce the date of a capital markets event in the first quarter of 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) global sales improved in the third quarter versus the second quarter, down just 2.2% year over year, as drive-thru orders surged and special promotions lifted sales to double-digit percentage increases in September, the company said on Thursday.
Comparable sales had plunged nearly 24% the previous quarter as dining rooms shut and U.S. customers stayed home during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic.
Amid the uncertainty earlier this year about the outbreak and its impact on operations, the Chicago-based burger chain held back on advertising spending but has now begun to deploy that stash of cash in national campaigns.
In mid-September, it launched a limited-time promotional deal with rapper Travis Scott and quickly began to run out of ingredients to assemble its signature Quarter Pounder sandwich, which was featured in the meal.
It also added Spicy Chicken McNuggets and ran special offers for National Cheeseburger Day.
Global results were driven by positive momentum in the United States, where same-store sales rose 4.6% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to the financial filing.
However, sales lagged in France, Spain, Germany and the UK.
Internationally licensed markets also fell 10.1%, pulled lower by Latin America and China though partly offset by positive sales in Japan.

On Wednesday, McDonald's board approved a 3% quarterly dividend increase for shareholders to $1.29 per share of common stock, the filing said.

Shares of the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based company, which have risen about 47% this year, were down about 5% before the bell.
The world's largest pizza chain has thrived during the health crisis as diners staying at home craved more comfort food, but that came at a cost for the company, which spent millions on hiring more staff, bonuses, sick-pay policies and sanitary supplies. 
Still, sales at Domino's U.S. stores open for more than a year rose 17.5% in the third quarter ended Sept. 6, exceeding Wall Street estimates of 13.14%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The resumption of sports leagues such as the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League has also boosted demand for pies and chicken wings. 
Domino's has been focusing on tech innovations and has also broadened its menu with additions such as chicken tacos and cheeseburger pizzas in order to keep its customers from switching to rivals McDonald's (N:MCD), Papa John's (O:PZZA) and Pizza Hut (N:YUM), among others. 
The company reported net income of $99.1 million, or $2.49 per share, compared with $86.4 million, or $2.05 per share, a year earlier.
Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of $2.79 per share. 
General and administrative costs rose 9.5% to $91.7 million. The pizza chain spent $108.1 million, a 20.8% rise, on advertising in the United States in the quarter. 
Total revenue rose 17.9% to $967.7 million, beating expectations of about $953 million.

LONDON (Reuters) - Branch staff at some of Britain's biggest banks say rules that require them to store phones in lockers while at work are putting them at undue risk of COVID-19 from colleagues and customers, as they cannot use the country's tracing app. 
Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY), along with rival TSB, are among those advising employees to deactivate the NHS Track & Trace app during office hours, when they are not allowed to keep phones on their person. 
Some banks ask staff and cashiers to store phones away to prevent leaks of sensitive customer data, although this is not formally required by regulator the Financial Conduct Authority. 
Under current government guidelines, users of the NHS app are advised to disable bluetooth or pause the app when away from their phones to avoid false notifications.
Other companies have told staff to pause the app at work, including pharmaceuticals firm GSK (L:GSK), which said its other safety measures were sufficient, the Guardian newspaper reported.
The BTU union, which represents staff working for Lloyds but is not recognised by the bank, said it had been contacted by dozens of staff unable to use the app, which has been downloaded by more than 14 million people.
One unnamed Lloyds employee who contacted the BTU said: ""I live and work in a high-risk area so I am very concerned at being told that while I'm at work I have to suspend the NHS test and trace app... This defeats the object of track and trace."" 
Another said they were at risk as they had to conduct face-to-face meetings and due to the ""blatant transgression of the social distancing rules by many customers"".
""Customers and staff have a right to know if they have come into contact with someone who's been infected,"" said Mark Brown, general secretary of the BTU.
Although several European countries have launched Bluetooth-based apps to alert those at risk of catching COVID-19, there is little evidence to date that the technology has significantly curbed infections.
Both Lloyds and TSB have advised staff to pause the app's tracing function while at work, according to internal guidance issued by each lender seen by Reuters.
""Colleagues who have downloaded the app to their own smart phone should not use the app while you are at work,"" Lloyds told staff, adding it was to stop people receiving false alerts. 
A NatWest spokesman said the bank encouraged staff to use the app but said they should pause it when they are not with their phone. The bank discourages - though doesn't ban - the use of personal phones in branches and contact centres.
A spokesman for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said the bank had not advised staff to turn off the app.
The Department of Health and TSB were not immediately available for comment. Lloyds declined to comment. 
A second employee union, Accord, said rules prohibiting use of personal phones in the workplace were in place to protect employees from security risks. 

""If customers care about the health and well-being of the bank staff they rely on, they could help by wearing face coverings when visiting bank branches,"" Accord's General Secretary Ged Nichols said.

BMW has spent a low double-digit million euro amount this year to prepare for Brexit, Peter told journalists during a virtual roundtable discussion on Thursday.
""The auto industry association ACEA has estimated that it could cost carmakers and suppliers 10 to 11 billion euros,"" Peter said. 
""We need tariff-free trade. And even then, it needs to be seamless. We have a just-in-time manufacturing system so the administrative processing at customs needs to be efficient.""
Furthermore Britain should continue to keep pace with European Union emissions requirements so that carmakers can offer the same cars in all European markets, Peter said.

Strong demand for electric and hybrid cars has helped BMW stay ahead of projected fleet emissions reduction targets for 2020, Peter said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Mastercard Inc (N:MA) has made a strategic investment in fintech firm Marqeta Inc and extended an existing partnership with the card issuing start-up, the companies said on Thursday.
Mastercard and Marqeta will work together to expand into new markets, build new products and launch new card programs, they said.
The size of the investment was not disclosed.
""As Marqeta's global ambitions continue to grow we saw an opportunity to strengthen the partnership,"" Omri Dahan, Marqeta's chief revenue officer, said in an interview. He added that Marqeta had not been in need of a cash injection. 
The Oakland, California-based company has developed a platform that it says makes payment card issuing and processing simpler and more efficient for businesses. Its backers include  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V). 
Marqeta raised $150 million from an undisclosed U.S. institutional investor in late May at a valuation to $4.3 billion. 
The company's business has continued to grow at a rapid pace this year, as COVID-19 lockdowns have led to a surge in demand for digital payments.
Marqeta and Mastercard have been working together since 2014, with joint projects including the launch of  Square Inc 's (N:SQ) payment card for small businesses, they said. 
Their collaboration has mainly focused on North America and Europe, and their new partnership will see them expand in Asia Pacific, they said. 

Aside from Square, Marqeta's clients include other well-known technology start-ups such ride-hailing company  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) , shopping app Instacart and lending start-up Affirm.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday amid rising optimism that the world’s largest economy will indeed benefit from some stimulus, although probably not via a large, all-encompassing bill.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 13 points, or 0.4%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 127 points, or 0.5%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 64 points, or 0.4%.
Both President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have indicated support for a smaller bill to help the airline industry specifically, even after Trump terminated talks over a larger stimulus package earlier this week.
Even though stand-alone legislation for airlines would fall far short of a comprehensive relief package, investors have still been buoyed by the idea of some support for the U.S. economy.
The need for additional stimulus has been the key point of the plethora of Fed speakers who have lined up to comment this week. This continues later Thursday, with both Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and his Dallas Fed equivalent Robert Kaplan scheduled to speak.
Economic data are likely to back them up, with initial jobless claims expected to show 820,000 new filings from last week, fewer than the week before, but still indicative of a stagnating recovery. Continuing jobless claims are expected to come in around 11.4 million. Both numbers are due for release at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
In the corporate sector, the airline sector will likely benefit from hopes for potential stimulus, while Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) are higher premarket after both filed for emergency usage approval for their Covid-19 treatments. Additionally, Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Helen of Troy are due to report earnings. 
Oil prices gained Thursday as the approach of Hurricane Delta caused production in many of the rigs in the Gulf of Mexico to be halted. A strike by oil workers in Norway is also set to cut output from western Europe's biggest oil and gas producer. 
Gains are restrained though, as fuel demand concerns persist with crude oil supplies rising. The Energy Information Administration data on Wednesday showed crude inventories rose by 501,000 barrels last week, a little more than expected. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $40.63 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.9% to $42.77. Both contracts fell over 1.5% on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,896.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1756.

LONDON (Reuters) - The BT Pension Scheme said on Thursday it aimed to achieve net zero carbon emissions across its investment portfolio by 2035, aligning it with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate change agreement.
The 55 billion pounds ($71.08 billion) fund, Britain's biggest corporate pension scheme, invests on behalf of 300,000 current and former members of telecoms company BT Group (L:BT).
While many companies and other investors are committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, by aligning with the Paris timeline, the BTPS plan is more ambitious.
BTPS said over time all of the investment mandates it awards to asset managers would be aligned with the goal and they would need to report progress to the scheme against a net zero climate scorecard.
In turn, the asset managers will need to engage with the companies they invest in on behalf of the BTPS to set their own net zero emissions objectives, and if not enough progress is made, the scheme said it could sell its stake.
""As the global economy looks for ways to recover from the impact of the pandemic, we have an opportunity to do things differently,"" BTPS Management Chief Executive Morten Nilsson said in a statement.
""Over the next 15 years, the Scheme will be re-investing the majority of its assets and, as we look to deliver the best returns, we must not waste this opportunity to support a cleaner and greener future.""

LSE entered exclusive talks with Euronext last month, after the Paris bourse owner saw off competition from Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) and Swiss rival SIX for Borsa Italiana.
LSE is selling Borsa as part of regulatory remedies to see through its $27 billion purchase of data provider Refinitiv, which is 45% owned by Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI), parent company of Reuters News.
The sale of Borsa, which is contingent on the Refinitiv deal going through, is politically sensitive in Italy due to Borsa's ownership of MTS, the bond platform which handles trading of Italy's 2.1 trillion euro ($2.5 trillion) government bonds. 
To secure the backing of the Rome government, Euronext has teamed up with state agency Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Italy's biggest bank Intesa SanPaolo (MI:ISP).
In addition to Paris, Euronext runs also stock exchanges in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal.
Having long set its sights on Borsa Italiana, which Chief Executive Stephane Boujnah said was ""a natural fit"", Euronext used its federal model to draft a governance system that would grant Italy ample representation.
Milan would become the largest contributor to Euronext revenue, at roughly 35% of the combined group.
One of the sources said an announcement could come as early as Friday. Both LSE and Euronext declined to comment.
Sources have said the bids have valued the Milan stock exchange at up to nearly 4 billion euros.
Euronext, which has not disclosed the value of its offer, has said it will finance the purchase with existing cash and by raising new equity as well as debt.
It will launch a rights issue for current shareholders and a capital increase reserved for CDP Equity and Intesa.

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World shares headed for a one-month high and oil and metal markets rallied on Thursday, as hopes for more U.S. and global stimulus offset Europe's rising numbers of coronavirus cases and lockdowns. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.4% and Wall Street futures were up 0.5%.
Signs Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could still agree aid for airlines helped offset Trump's ending talks for a bigger plan. The dollar was in the doldrums after the minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting showed backing for more support if required.
""We are still basically tracking risk appetite"" said Ned Rumpeltin, the European head of currency strategy at TD Securities, pointing to the steady rise in stock markets as investors bide their time until the U.S. election. ""I wonder how long that can last.""
The euro was little changed. So were European government bond markets as the European Central Bank prepared to release later the minutes of its recent meeting. 
The dollar barely moved against the yen at 106.The New Zealand dollar was the liveliest among G10 currencies, dropping as much as half a percent after central bank officials again hinted they could introduce negative interest rates, though it had mostly recovered in Europe.

STORMY TIMES
In commodities, oil rose above $42 a barrel, supported by output shutdowns in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the prospect of more supply losses in Norway, as well as by hopes for some U.S. coronavirus relief aid.
Oil and gas workers have withdrawn from offshore U.S. Gulf production facilities as Hurricane Delta was forecast to intensify into a Category 3 storm. Nearly 1.5 million barrels of daily output was halted. 
Brent crude rose 59 cents, or 1.4%, to $42.58 a barrel, after falling 1.6% on Wednesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate added 45 cents, or 1.1%, to $40.40 after falling 1.8%.
""If Delta stays weak, the oil rally could quickly run out of steam,"" said Jeffrey Halley, analyst at brokerage OANDA.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>","Foreign-backed consortium in talks for Petrobras gas fields in Brazil, sources say","By Gram Slattery and Carolina Mandl
RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A consortium of Brazil's 3R Petroleum and Norway-linked DBO Energy is in bilateral talks with Brazil's Petrobras to purchase a cluster of offshore natural gas fields, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
The Peroa cluster, located off the coast of Espirito Santo state, would be among the first all-gas offshore fields sold by Petrobras amid a larger push to break the company's near-monopoly in Brazil's natural gas value chain.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4), as the state-controlled firm is formally known, has long dominated most segments of the Brazilian natural gas sector. But in recent years, it has begun selling off pipelines and assets in transport and distribution, in a move the company and the government hope will spur competition.
Several international firms already produce significant amounts of natural gas in Brazil, as they operate oilfields where so-called associated gas is removed during the production process. Much of that gas is simply reinjected into the ground, however, and few are producing at standalone gas fields.
Petrobras and 3R did not respond to a request for comment. DBO declined to comment.
In 2019, the Peroa cluster produced just short of 1 million cubic meters of gas per day, though it produced several times that amount in recent years. The cluster also includes the Malombe prospect, discovered in 2011, which studies indicate could produce up to 2.5 million cubic meters daily if developed.
Due in part to Peroa's mature profile, it is expected to be sold for a relatively low price compared with other production assets being offered by Petrobras in the area, said the sources, who requested anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
Rio de Janeiro-based DBO is composed of Brazilian and Norwegian executives, and it lists RWE Supply & Trading, an arm of Germany's RWE AG (DE:RWEG), as an investor.
3R, founded in part by former Petrobras executives, is backed by investment firm Starboard Restructuring Partners. In early September, it filed for an initial public offering to help pay for acquisitions it has made from Petrobras and to pursue new ones.pet

49,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 06:18AM ET</span>",Ant Group Faces U.S. Headwinds in Race to IPO Before Trump Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma’s Ant Group has a narrow window to make its much-anticipated market debut ahead of U.S. election turbulence. Now its bankers must grapple with any potential delays stemming from a debate in Washington over restrictions on the payments behemoth.
Ant is expected to raise about $35 billion from simultaneous initial public offerings in Shanghai and Hong Kong as early as this month. China’s biggest payments company already has approval for its mainland listing, but is waiting for a hearing with the Hong Kong stock exchange. That green light would need to come roughly by the middle of October if Ant aims to beat the U.S. presidential vote on Nov. 3.
The Hong Kong hearing before a 28-member panel of external professionals was expected last week but has yet to happen. If it’s delayed much further, the IPO risks straddling the U.S. election where some expect a surge in postal ballots to create a prolonged period of uncertainty. The one-week gap in Hong Kong between the pricing of an IPO and the start of trading means investors would be left exposed to an increase in market volatility.
Ant is said to be targeting a valuation of $250 billion, which would make it one of the world’s most valuable financial firms ahead of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). Its attraction rests on its reach into the pockets of more than 700 million monthly users, most of whom are in China where the ubiquitous Alipay app offers everything from loans and travel services to food delivery. Still, potential U.S. restrictions would raise questions about Ant’s overseas ambitions and could hurt its relationships with American firms.
“Ant’s business is mostly in China and is self-sufficient,” said Ram Parameswaran, founder of San Francisco-based Octahedron Capital Management, which owns shares in Ant’s affiliate  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and plans to invest in the IPO. “It is highly unlikely that U.S financial institutions will be banned from doing business with Ant.”
Ant declined to comment in an emailed statement.
A debate over how and whether to restrict Ant -- as well as Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s payments systems -- has accelerated among senior U.S. officials in recent weeks though a final decision isn’t imminent, Bloomberg reported. Potential options range from a U.S. ban to the far more damaging possibility of putting Ant on a specially designated national list, which would turn one of China’s crown jewels radioactive for any U.S. company.
The Trump administration’s guideline for Tencent’s instant-messaging app WeChat could offer clues to how the U.S. might handle the payment platforms. It has allowed U.S. companies to continue working with WeChat outside of the U.S.
Institutional investors in America will have less of an impact on the demand-supply equation with Ant as the listings are focused on Hong Kong and Shanghai, Parameswaran said.
Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte plans to invest more than $1 billion in Ant shares, according to people familiar with the matter. State investor Temasek Holdings Pte, China’s $318 billion National Council for Social Security Fund and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund are among those who’ve been reported to be weighing investments.
Substantial Majority
Early feedback prompted Ant to decide against locking in cornerstone investors for the Hong Kong leg, confident there would be plenty of takers, people familiar have said.
“There is great demand from clients and global asset managers,” said Joel Ng, an analyst at KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte. “Most of Ant’s business is in China and the rest of Asia so U.S. restrictions will not be a huge deal.”
According to Ant’s IPO prospectus, it gets less than 5% of its revenue from outside China. And only a tiny portion of that is from the U.S., a person familiar has said. Even so, a ban on Ant doing business in the U.S. could curb the potential for growth in the future.
With a dominant position in China, Ant has been spreading its reach into the rest of Asia, where it is working with digital payment providers in India and Thailand as well as peddling its expertise in wealth management and risk controls.
“The domestic market is quite penetrated already by Ant and WeChat Pay, so the future growth is going to have to come through international expansion,” said Martin Chorzempa, research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The key question for a Chinese fintech is whether it can expand internationally.”

50,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 06:16AM ET</span>",Canada's struggling hospitality businesses face 'perfect storm' as insurers flee,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian hospitality businesses, already reeling from the downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, are facing yet another existential threat as insurance companies spike premiums or exit the space, citing losses and the sector's risks. 
Even before COVID-19, insurers globally were scaling back from riskier businesses to improve performance. The pandemic's profit hits have accelerated the trend and led underwriters to exit from, or raise premiums in, select categories.
Hospitality businesses, particularly those needing coverage for accidents caused by alcohol-impaired clients, were already seen as higher risk, said Karen Ritchie, vice president at Baird MacGregor Insurance Brokers and president of the Toronto Insurance Council. The coronavirus exacerbated that.
""It's a perfect storm,"" she said.
Many hospitality companies were already operating on razor-thin margins before pandemic-driven lockdowns. An inability to access affordable insurance could spell the end for them, given they are barely managing to hang on amid distancing restrictions.
While these businesses carry the same risks as elsewhere, the Canadian hospitality industry has faced a bigger hit due to a much smaller insurance market dominated by Lloyd's syndicates, Ritchie said. Far more domestic insurers cover the space in countries like the United States, spreading out risk, she said.
Lloyd's is a marketplace that comprises various specialist insurers, or syndicates, who write policies.
Lloyd's business volumes fell 8.6% in the first half of 2020, reflecting an intentional reduction by several syndicates exposed to poorly performing business segments, the group said in a statement https://www.lloyds.com/investor-relations/financial-performance/financial-results/half-year-results-2020. 
The Lloyd's market lost 438 million pounds ($569 million), versus a 2.3 billion pound profit a year earlier, primarily driven by coronavirus-driven losses. 
'I WOULD CLOSE' 
Erik Joyal, co-owner of Ascari Hospitality Group in Toronto, was told last month that his Hi-Lo Bar's policy would not be renewed as his insurer, part of Lloyd's, was moving away from restaurants and bars.
His broker found a policy through another insurer at more than three times his current C$9,000 annual premium, even though the restaurant had never filed a claim. 
""I would close the business before I signed on to that,"" said Joyal, who is continuing to search for an affordable policy. 
Insurers, like other businesses, need profits, said Pete Karageorgos, director of consumer and industry relations at the Insurance Bureau of Canada. 
And there is still capacity and affordable coverage available for businesses that can show measures to minimize risks, he added.
Arron Barberian said his Harry's Steak House in Toronto was dropped by his insurance company, Groupone Insurance Services, although he paid premiums when the business was shut. 
Groupone declined to comment.
Barberian found a policy through Intact Financial Corp, which insures his other Toronto restaurant, Barberian's Steak House. While cheaper, it offers slim, possibly inadequate, coverage, he said.
Intact's underwriting criteria for restaurants haven't changed, and it continues to renew policies and write new ones, a spokeswoman said by email. 
A Nova Scotia hotel owner, who said he was quoted a 50% increase in premiums to renew his policy, also found more affordable coverage through Intact.
Even so, the owner, who declined to be identified as he is negotiating the return of some premiums paid during the shut-down, said he is bracing for thousands of dollars in additional expenses, as a change in insurers is accompanied by an inspection and, often, demands for changes.
His previous insurer, Wawanesa Insurance, attributed the premium increase to higher fire and storm-related losses even before the pandemic. 
Despite limited ability to operate, ""many bars and restaurants https://www.alignedinsurance.com/restaurant-insurance-overview still had contractual obligations and real risk that needed to be insured and insurance had to be maintained,"" said Andrew Clark, chief executive of mortgage broker ALIGNED Insurance. 
""The unfortunate reality is that the insurance companies aren’t willing to insure some businesses right now and they don’t really have many other options than to close,"" Clark said.

LSE, which is selling Borsa Italiana to get approval for its $27 billion Refinitiv deal, may announce the deal as early as Friday, said the people, who asked not to be named as the matter is confidential. LSE and Euronext declined to comment.
Adding Borsa Italiana would give Euronext about a quarter of all equity trading in Europe and mean that 28 of the Euro Stoxx 50 companies are listed on its markets.
Borsa Italiana is seen as a strategic asset in Italy because of its ownership of MTS SpA, a platform used to trade government bonds, and the Italian government has sought to engineer a deal for months. Euronext, the owner of the Paris and Amsterdam exchanges, is bidding with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA, a state-backed lender, and Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) SpA, Italy’s biggest bank -- those institutions would take stakes in Euronext.
The potential transaction would be financed through a mix of available cash, new debt and new equity in the form of a reserved capital increase to CDP and Intesa Sanpaolo and a rights issue to Euronext’s shareholders.
Originating in a merger between the Paris and Amsterdam exchanges, Euronext has grown under acquisitive Chief Executive Officer Stephane Boujnah’s federal model to absorb equity markets in six countries amid a wave of exchange consolidation globally.
The CEO said in an interview last month that owning Borsa Italiana would mean Euronext would get more than a third of its revenue in Italy, surpassing France. The deal gives the company a clearinghouse for the first time as well as a securities depository, stock exchange and bond platform.
Boujnah has eyed a transformational tie-up in recent years. He missed out on Spanish exchange BME earlier this year, losing to SIX. This time he’s beaten both the Swiss firm and Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn). The German exchange operator said in a statement that its offer focused on a “high degree of autonomy” for the Italian stock exchange, rather than the involvement of Italian partners at a group level.

53,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 05:44AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Buoyant GVC Puts Itself in the Shop Window,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Gambling has been one of the surprise winners of the pandemic, and the latest update from GVC (LON:GVC), the owner of U.K. bookmakers  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and Coral, suggests that it’s set to carry on that way.
GVC stock rose 4.0% to a new two-year high on Thursday, after delivering a thumping upgrade to its underlying profit forecast for the year. It now sees earnings before interest, taxes and amortization in a range around 780 million pounds ($1.00 billion) this year, up from around 730 million after its first-half results.
Overall net gaming revenue was up 14% from a year earlier in constant currencies in the third quarter, while its online business grew twice as fast. The company boasted “market share gains in all major territories and the nineteenth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.”
The figures are a fine illustration of how the pandemic has accelerated a shift away from physical venues to virtual ones. Being locked out of a betting shop closed due to Covid is no obstacle to anyone with a gambling itch to scratch. As a result, the only real question is whether a company has the technology and infrastructure to manage the shift. The performance of GVC and rival Flutter Entertainment  (LON:FLTRF) suggest the answer is a clear yes. GVC shares are up 24% this year, Flutter shares are up 40%.
True, GVC’s numbers are flattered by weak comparatives from a year earlier, when a U.K. crackdown on its highly-addictive fixed-odds betting terminals generated an acute, but ultimately short-term, hit to profits.  
GVC said that the reopening of its U.K. betting shops meant that they are now generating revenues within 10% of pre-lockdown levels, although whether that can be sustained given the rebound in new infections in the U.K. and the steady tightening of public health measures is questionable. The group said its short-term outlook remained ""cautious"" and noted that the increased guidance assumes ""no further material disruptions.""
But the shops are merely a legacy business. The excitement around the sector has come from growth in the deregulating U.S. market, where it provides bookmaking technology to MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM). Here too, GVC had upbeat news, raising its expectation of revenue this year to between $150 and $160 million. Shay Segev, GVC’s new CEO, said that “with a market share of approximately 17% across our live markets, we are making great progress towards being the leading operator in the U.S.”
Having witnessed  William Hill  (LON:WMH), another U.K. bookmaker, get snapped up earlier by its U.S. partner, Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR), shareholders will doubtless be looking for a similar offer for GVC from MGM in due course.
However, the path there might not be an easy one. The second wave of Covid-19 across Europe looks increasingly threatening to organized sport, the life blood of the company’s European operations that flowed more or less freely during the third quarter. Any interruption of Europe’s soccer and horse racing season would set the company back heavily in the short term. If it does, the onus will be on Segev and his team not to panic and sell out before the hoped-for vaccines against the coronavirus ride to the rescue next year."

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) shareholders face a future of paltry payouts when regulators restore its powers to pay dividends as the bank's bosses press on with a costly revamp against a backdrop of a global recession and the threat of negative interest rates.
One of the banking sector's most reliable dividends could be slashed by as much as 50%, analysts and investors say, with HSBC's management expected to use the economic uncertainty to downgrade shareholder expectations. 
Chief Executive Noel Quinn also faces pressure to keep lending to struggling households and businesses while keeping capital in reserve to pay for the bank's overhaul and cover any bad debts if non-performing loans spike.
In August, Europe's biggest bank by assets, warned that its bad debt charges for the year could hit $13 billion as the coronavirus pandemic hammered both its retail and corporate customers worldwide.
""Certainly in this climate it gives them a chance to reset,"" said Hugh Young, managing director, Asia Pacific, Aberdeen Standard Investments, one of HSBC's 10 largest shareholders. ""They can blame, with a degree of reason, both COVID and government."" 
HSBC declined to comment.
The bank, which derives the majority of its profits from Asia, has not paid an annual dividend below 35 cents since 2009. 
Between 2008 and 2018, it paid an average 47.2 cents but analyst forecasts supplied by Refinitiv suggest its annual dividend will plunge to 15 cents in 2020, before recovering to 29 cents in 2021 and 37 cents in 2022.
Will Howlett, equity research analyst at HSBC shareholder Quilter Cheviot, said earnings and cash flow for banks would remain under pressure until at least 2023, when the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled it might be ready to raise rates.
""We see this as a longer lasting headwind than elevated loan losses as a result of the recession caused by lockdowns to control the spread of the virus,"" he said. 
""In this context, we would expect a significant rebasing of (HSBC's) dividend ... based on consensus, we see risks to the downside particularly if HSBC wants to retain a larger budget for a more radical restructuring at full-year results.""

(Graphic: HSBC's dividend per share - https://graphics.reuters.com/HSBC-HLDG/DIVIDEND/bdwvkkbxlvm/chart.png) 
DIVIDEND DISCRETION?
On March 31, as lockdowns stalled economic activity globally, HSBC scrapped its fourth interim payout for 2019 after the Bank of England blocked all big lenders from paying dividends or buying back shares in 2020 to conserve capital.
The announcement came just after HSBC said it was targeting $4.5 billion in cost cuts in an overhaul that could see up to 35,000 jobs culled.
HSBC's dividend suspension infuriated its many small shareholders in Hong Kong, who have long benefited from its steady payouts. It left HSBC's total payout for 2019 after the first three payments at 30 cents.
Banks are largely expecting to resume dividends in 2021 but it is unclear whether they will have full discretion over the size of those distributions. 
HSBC has said it will review its dividend policy later this year. It is due to release third-quarter results on Oct. 27.
Net interest margins for British banks have plunged after a series of policy rate cuts and weaker demand for loans has more than offset the benefits of cheaper funding costs.
Rules forcing lenders to segregate their retail banks from other divisions also mean HSBC can only channel its large volume of British customer deposits into loans in the country, rather than in more profitable markets across Asia.
Jupiter Asset Management (L:JUP) head of strategy, UK Alpha, Richard Buxton, cited ""a rather underwhelming"" strategic review as a key reason behind his decision to sell HSBC shares in April after more than a decade of regular ownership.
He used some of the proceeds to top up holdings in rivals Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) and  Barclays  (L:BARC), which he said have better strategies to cope with future revenue challenges, and where dividend prospects are stronger. 

""Things have got tougher for all banks but turning HSBC around involves far more hard graft than I had anticipated, for a prize of a pretty modest return,"" Buxton said.

55,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Investors eye discounted U.S. healthcare sector as Biden's lead in polls grows,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are looking for bargains among healthcare stocks, even as prospect of a Democratic “Blue Sweep” in next month’s elections threatens more volatility for a sector already trading near a historical discount to the broader market.
A victory by former Vice President Joe Biden over President Donald Trump on Nov. 3 and a potential Democratic takeover of the Senate could clear the way for prescription drug price and healthcare coverage reforms, generally seen as potential negatives for companies in the sector.
Some investors are betting these factors have already been priced into healthcare shares or may not be as detrimental as feared, while the companies stand to benefit from relatively stable earnings prospects and their medical innovations. 
""For high-quality companies that are trading at reasonable valuations ... there is a strong argument to be made for adding some healthcare exposure to portfolios,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson.
Biden's improving election prospects have weighed on healthcare stocks for much of 2020, according to investors, with the S&P 500 healthcare sector (SPXHC) climbing just 7% since the end of April, against a 17% gain for the overall S&P 500 (SPX).
A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Sunday showed Biden opened his widest lead in a month after Trump contracted COVID-19.
The healthcare sector now trades at a 26% discount to the S&P 500 on a price-to-earnings basis, according to Refinitiv Datastream. The sector's 15.8 P/E ratio is well below the S&P 500's 21.3 ratio, which last month rose to its highest valuation since 2000.
The gap between the sector's P/E ratio and that of the S&P stood at its widest in at least 25 years last month, though it has narrowed in recent weeks. 
""As Biden started to do better in the polls, you saw healthcare start to underperform a bit as the rest of the market recovered,"" said Ashtyn Evans, a healthcare analyst with Edward Jones. 
While Biden may shake up insurance coverage by offering a ""public option"" government plan, he is also expected to seek to strengthen the Affordable Care Act - the signature healthcare law enacted when he was vice president - under which companies are used to operating. 
Any significant drug pricing legislation may need to wait until the pandemic is more contained, as the government relies on the pharmaceutical industry to develop COVID-19 therapies and vaccines. Trump has also vowed to lower drug prices, making the issue arguably less partisan. 
""We think there remains a reasonably good probability that the next Congress will institute moderate health policy changes that will create long-term clarity for the sector and investors,"" Eric Potoker, an analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note last month. 
Healthcare stocks have been prone to volatility around elections.
Ahead of the 2016 vote, which pitted Trump against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had campaigned against high prescription drug prices, the healthcare sector fell 6.6% in October compared to a 1.9% drop for the overall S&P 500 (SPX). 
So far this October, the sector has climbed 1.2% against a 1.7% rise for the S&P 500. The promise of a fiscal stimulus package has lifted groups such as financials and industrials that tend to be more sensitive to broad economic recovery.
Edward Jones' Evans sees opportunities in shares of drugmaker  Merck & Co  (N:MRK) and medical device company  Medtronic  Inc (N:MDT). Merck shares have fallen 12% so far in 2020, while Medtronic shares have dropped about 7%.
Melissa Chadwick-Dunn, portfolio manager at RS Investments, has long-term holdings in areas such as diabetes technology and biotech, where she sees strong potential for healthcare breakthroughs, and potentially would add if there is a pullback.

""The best antidote to all this uncertainty is a healthy dose of innovation,"" she said.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July ordered Huawei equipment to be purged from the nascent 5G network by the end of 2027. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed credit for the British decision.
""The West must urgently unite to advance a counterweight to China’s tech dominance,"" Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence committee, said. ""We must not surrender our national security for the sake of short-term technological development.""
The Committee did not go into detail about the exact nature of the ties but said it had seen clear evidence of Huawei collusion with ""the Chinese Communist Party apparatus"".
Huawei said the report lacked credibility.
""It is built on opinion rather than fact. We’re sure people will see through these groundless accusations of collusion and remember instead what Huawei has delivered for Britain over the past 20 years,"" a Huawei spokesman said.
Trump identifies China as the United States' main geopolitical rival, and has accused the Communist Party-ruled state of taking advantage over trade and not telling the truth over the novel coronavirus outbreak, which he calls the ""China plague"".
Washington and its allies say Huawei technology could be used to spy for China. Huawei has repeatedly denied this, and says the United States is simply jealous of its success. 
British ministers say the rise to global dominance of Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former People's Liberation Army engineer, has caught the West off-guard.

The defence committee said it supported Johnson's decision to eventually purge Huawei from 5G but noted that ""developments could necessitate this date being moved forward, potentially to 2025 which could be considered economically feasible.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co will voluntarily recall its Kona electric vehicles as a possible short circuit due to what may be faulty manufacturing of its high-voltage battery cells could pose a fire risk, South Korea's transport ministry said on Thursday. 
Starting on Oct. 16, the recall, which includes software updates and battery replacements after inspections, involves 25,564 Kona electric vehicles (EVs) built between September 2017 and March 2020, the ministry said in a statement. 
The safety recall ""is a proactive response to a suspected defective production of high-voltage batteries used in the vehicles, which may have contributed to the reported fires"", Hyundai said, adding that it will deploy all necessary measures to identify the cause of the fire and address customers' needs. 
Some 13 incidents of fire involving the Kona EV, including one each in Canada and Austria, have been documented, the office of ruling party lawmaker Jang Kyung-tae said in a statement.
Kona EVs use batteries made by LG Chem Ltd. 
LG Chem said the exact cause of the fire had not been determined and a reenactment experiment conducted jointly with Hyundai had not led to a fire, so the fires could not be attributed to faulty battery cells. 
It would actively participate in future investigation with Hyundai to find the cause, LG Chem added in a statement.
Hyundai's shares fell 1.4%, reflecting investor concern that the recall and battery replacements could be costly, as the battery accounts for about 30% of an EV's price, analysts said.
In contrast, LG Chem shares rose 1.8%. 
The Kona Electric is the South Korean automaker's first long-range subcompact SUV EV. 
In July, Hyundai Motor Group leader Euisun Chung said Hyundai Motor and sister company Kia Motors aim to sell 1 million battery-driven electric vehicles in 2025, targeting more than 10% of the global market share for such vehicles.

Denmark's biggest bank is trying to get costs and compliance under control and had already warned of further layoffs in June. At least 1,000 employees have already left the bank since June last year. 
""We need to adapt to the structural changes that the financial sector is experiencing, and to remain competitive in a low-margin and highly competitive market, we simply have to reduce our costs,"" Chief Executive Chris Vogelzang said in a statement. 
Some of the cuts, which will affect most departments across Denmark, would be achieved through voluntary redundancy agreements and natural attrition, Danske said. 
Danske employs more than 22,000 people, of which 11,000 are in Denmark. 
""Together with the existing hiring freeze, we hope that it can help reduce the number of actual layoffs at a later time,"" Head of Group HR Karsten Breum said.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Thursday, helped by renewed confidence of a stimulus package in the U.S. as well as some upbeat corporate updates.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.5% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.2%.
Wall Street posted strong gains Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 1.9%, or 530 points, higher, on renewed hopes for a new coronavirus relief package after President Donald Trump rowed back on comments from just a day earlier and said he was in favor of targeted coronavirus aid.
This helped the overall tone early Thursday, before news of a series of potential M&A deals boosted the market.
GVC Holdings (LON:GVC) stock climbed 6.9% after the sports betting and gaming group announced plans to buy Portuguese gambling company Bet.pt, while raising earnings expectations for 2020.

However, the corporate news wasn’t universally positive, as low-cost carrier easyJet (LON:EZJ) said it expects a swing to a pretax loss for fiscal 2020 and that it was canceling dividend payments.
Eyes will turn later in the session to the release of the European Central Bank’s minutes from its last rate-setting meeting.
A second-wave of coronavirus infections, hitting Europe in particular, has resulted in the imposition of more restrictions, prompting fears of a further economic slowdown. With the euro zone’s 750 billion euro recovery fund not expected to yield results until next year, the pressure on the ECB to keep reflating the economy is not going away any time soon.
The weekly U.S. employment data will also garner attention. It’s likely to show the recovery in the world's largest economy losing steam, especially after Friday’s disappointing nonfarm payrolls release.
Economists predict a decline in jobless claims, however, continued claims are expected to remain firmly above 11 million.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday as the approach of Hurricane Delta caused production in many of the rigs in the Gulf of Mexico to be halted. Gains are restrained though, as fuel demand concerns persist with crude oil supplies rising.
The Energy Information Administration data on Wednesday showed crude inventories rose by 501,000 barrels last week, a little larger than expected. Earlier in the week, the private body, the American Petroleum Institute, reported a build in U.S. oil stocks of 951,000 barrels last week.

62,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",EasyJet warns first ever annual loss could top $1 billion,"By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - British airline easyJet (L:EZJ) warned on Thursday its first ever annual loss could be as much as 845 million pounds ($1.1 billion) as the pandemic meant it was flying just 25% of planned capacity.
The airline has signalled to the government it may need more financial support, according to media reports.
The headline loss before tax forecast for the year ended Sept. 30 of 815-845 million pounds was worse than the loss of 794 million expected by analysts, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. 
That is the first time easyJet, which was founded in 1995, has ever made a full-year loss. 
With travel at very low levels, most European airlines are bleeding cash. EasyJet's larger low-cost rival Ryanair (I:RYA) has called this winter a ""write-off"".
EasyJet said ongoing travel restrictions meant it would fly just 25% of planned capacity for the rest of 2020, behind Ryanair which is aiming for 40% in October. 
At such levels and with no recovery in sight, easyJet's finances will continue to remain under pressure. CEO Johan Lundgren called on Thursday for Britain to ""step up with a bespoke package of measures"" to help airlines.
To survive the pandemic so far, easyJet has taken a 600 million pound loan from the government, cut 4,500 jobs, raised 608 million pounds from selling aircraft and tapped shareholders for 419 million pounds. It said it might have to do more. 
""EasyJet will continue to review its liquidity position on a regular basis and will continue to assess further funding opportunities, including sale and lease backs, should the need arise,"" the airline said in a statement.
Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said easyJet was managing the downturn well, but like all airlines needed a recovery to come in 2021 as ""absent this, the industry will face an existential threat."" 
On easyJet specifically, he said: ""On current liquidity, the company needs air travel to start recovering for Easter or summer 2021 at the latest; failing that, we would be wary of a further capital raise."" 
In the UK, airlines have called for tax breaks and other measures to help them through the crisis as well as an airport testing regime for COVID-19 to shorten Britain's 14-day quarantine rule, which now applies to most European countries.
The government said it was looking at ways to reduce the quarantine with a report due in early November.
EasyJet, whose net debt soared to 1.1 billion pounds from 326 million pounds this time last year, said it was focused on flying profitably to conserve cash and that had helped it reduce cash burn in its fourth quarter compared with the third.
Its shares were down 0.9% at 517 pence at 0722 GMT. The stock has lost 62% of its value so far in 2020. 
The airline will formally report annual results on Nov. 17.

63,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 03:18AM ET</span>","Danske Bank to Cut 1,600 Jobs to Reduce Costs","(Bloomberg) -- Danske Bank A/S will cut 1,600 jobs as part of its ongoing effort to save money amid spiraling compliance costs and long-term negative interest rates.
“It is never easy to reduce the number of colleagues, and we will do our best to ensure that we do this in the most decent and respectful way,” Chief Executive Officer Chris Vogelzang said in a statement on Thursday. “However, we need to adapt to the structural changes that the financial sector is experiencing.”
Danske is still being investigated for a vast money laundering scandal, which triggered a jump in the lender’s compliance costs. More recently, Denmark’s biggest bank admitted it overcharged retail customers for years due to errors in its debt collection system.
The bank, which has lived with eight years of negative rates in its home market of Denmark, is under growing political pressure to improve its business as the regulator and parliament lose patience with the string of scandals.
Vogelzang said the cuts are needed “to remain competitive in a low-margin and highly competitive market.” The measures are part of Danske’s so-called 2023 plan, which targets becoming “even more efficient and competitive,” it said.
The bank currently employs about 22,000 people, which is up from 20,000 in 2017. Roughly 11,000 work in Denmark, where Danske is based. Staff will have the option of applying for voluntary redundancy agreements until Oct. 25, the bank said.
“We simply have to reduce our costs,” Vogelzang said.

65,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 02:11AM ET</span>",Britain's banks turn cyber sleuths to crack $100 billion mortgage mystery,"By Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Does a cancelled gym membership spell financial disaster?
That is the type of question British banks are asking as they try to work out whether borrowers owing some 75 billion pounds ($96 billion) in home loans will be good for it when a payment holiday, introduced when the coronavirus crisis first hit, ends.
Lenders are scouring current account transactions, credit card spending and trends in Internet searches for clues about customer finances as part of a wider effort to understand the damage to their portfolios from the pandemic.
The once-in-a-lifetime mix of economic shutdowns, unprecedented government support and an uncertain path to recovery have upended old risk models, based on historical data, necessitating a more dynamic, forward-looking way of analysing lending risk. The searches involve pouring over anonymised data and are a way of surveying overall risk rather than individual customer habits.
The stakes are high: underestimate the risks and bank bosses and shareholders could be in for a nasty jump in losses, overestimate them and banks could rein in lending when it is needed most.
Executives at Britain's top banks say calculating the hit to loans, from mortgages to corporate debt, is the biggest risk management challenge they have seen since the 2008 crisis.
""This time there is economic volatility beyond what we have ever seen, there is unprecedented government support, and to try and model it all with 100% accuracy is impossible,"" said Matt Waymark, director of finance at NatWest Group (L:NWG).
Some 300 billion pounds in payment breaks were granted on British mortgages, part of a series of measures aimed at propping up households hit by the virus, and around 70-80% of those have resumed payments, bankers and analysts told Reuters.
That leaves nearly $100 billion outstanding at a time when banks also face wider defaults on their corporate loans and plunging income due to near-zero interest rates.
That is a small proportion of the £1.5 trillion in mortgages outstanding in Britain, but a big default on that stock of home loans coupled with an expected rise in defaults on corporate loans could see bad debts rise from 1.4% of their books to 4.1% by 2022, analysts at ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said.
That would be higher than the peak rate recorded after the 2008 crisis, of 3.96% in 2011.
The first real test is expected to be in the fourth quarter of this year, when the government's furlough job support ends along with various business loan schemes. 
UNPREDICTABLE THREATS
Government supports have so far meant there hasn't been much of an increase in bad debts. The challenge in working out whether that will suddenly change is exacerbated by the fact that some customers not in financial difficulty took out payment holidays to pay down more expensive debt such as credit cards, leading to record levels of consumer debt repayment in Britain.
""We've seen very little so far in terms of actual defaults, whereas the models would've predicted a big hit following the recent economic dip, so the question is whether government support schemes are merely delaying the problem or actually mitigating it,"" Waymark said.
The question is particularly pressing for British banks because of the speed and scale with which the scheme was put in place in Britain and then taken up.
Some 30% of British mortgages repackaged into bonds were in a holiday payment scheme, compared to 5% of French mortgages and 10% of Spanish home loans, according to data from S&P Global.
The pressure to understand the risks has meant banks in Britain are using data and technology in new ways and at a greater level of intensity than before, something that could be useful for modelling other unpredictable threats, such as climate change, according to Rishi Khosla, Chief Executive of OakNorth bank, which markets its portfolio diagnostics technology to other lenders.
It is accelerating a trend already apparent https://de.reuters.com/article/banks-data/corrected-dollars-in-the-detail-banks-pan-for-gold-in-data-lakes-idUKL4N23I2WT before the pandemic of large banks mining customer data to boost revenue. 
To check on the health of corporate borrowers, for example, banks have started using algorithms to scan news headlines for negative stories about particular companies and sectors so they can anticipate credit downgrades. 

""I think there is a rising awareness that some level of forward look is important to complement standard risk rating approach,"" Khosla said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening marginally higher Thursday, helped by strong gains on Wall street overnight after President Donald Trump revived hopes of a fiscal stimulus package in the U.S.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.9%, or 530 points, higher Wednesday, to hit a new one-month high, while the S&P 500 index climbed 1.7%, and the NASDAQ Composite index added 1.9%. These indexes jumped on renewed hopes for stimulus after Trump rowed back on comments from just a day earlier and said he was in favor of targeted coronavirus aid.
This should help the overall tone early Thursday, but there will still be an element of caution with the ECB scheduled to release the minutes from its last rate-setting meeting later in the session.
Globally, risk assets have rallied since mid-March on a flood of central bank and government support for economies reeling from coronavirus-induced lockdowns world over. 
A second-wave of coronavirus infections, hitting Europe in particular, has resulted in the imposition of more restrictions, prompting fears of a further economic slowdown. ECB President Christine Lagarde said earlier this week that the 'second leg' of what policymakers had hoped would be a V-shaped recovery looked 'shaky', a comment that many took as preparing the ground for an increase to its main bond-buying program at its December meeting.
With the euro zone’s 750 billion euro recovery fund not expected to yield results until next year, the pressure on the ECB to keep reflating the economy is not going away any time soon.
“Euro-area core inflation has surprised to the downside lately and hit a record-low in September,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. “The ECB’s staff forecast horizon will cover 2023 for the first time in December, and a staff forecast showing inflation still clearly below target in 2023 will be hard to ignore.”
Later in the session, attention will turn to the weekly U.S. employment data, which will likely show the recovery in the world's largest economy losing steam, especially after Friday’s disappointing nonfarm payrolls release.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd's (KS:005930) third-quarter profit likely jumped 58% to its highest in two years, beating analyst estimates as U.S. restrictions on China's Huawei boosted the South Korean tech giant's phone and chip sales. 
U.S. action against Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] has dampened demand for its phones outside of China, giving a leg up to Samsung, analysts said, while the Chinese firm also hurried to order more chips from Samsung after Washington moved to choke its access to commercially available chips from mid-September. 
Samsung said on Thursday operating profit was likely 12.3 trillion won ($10.6 billion) for the three months ended September, well above a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 10.5 trillion won. It would be the strongest result since 17.57 trillion won in the third quarter of 2018.
Revenue likely rose 6% from the same period a year earlier to 66 trillion won, the company said.
Samsung released only limited data in Thursday's regulatory filing ahead of the release of detailed earnings figures later this month.
""It seems Huawei's impact on Samsung's chip business was bigger than the market expected, and there was a big surprise in the smartphone and home appliance businesses,"" said CW Chung, head of research at Nomura in Korea.
MOBILE PROFIT BOOST
Samsung was expected to post its biggest smartphone profit in at least four years, analysts said, as it gained market share from Chinese rivals and the coronavirus pandemic helped cut marketing costs. 
Washington, which says Huawei is a vehicle for Chinese state espionage, has tightened restrictions on the firm, hurting demand for Huawei phones in Europe and other countries and boosting Samsung's sales at a time when markets outside China are recovering from COVID-19 lockdowns, analysts said. 
""Many consumers were reluctant to buy Huawei phones because they thought that Huawei may discontinue phone sales and services because of U.S. restrictions,"" Tom Kang, an analyst at Counterpoint said, adding that Samsung has boosted sales of mid- and low-end phones. 
A surge in anti-China sentiment in India following a border clash in June is also seen as providing a boost to Samsung, which competes with  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) and other Chinese rivals there. 
Samsung's home appliance business also got a lift from the pandemic lockdowns, which spurred consumers to spend more on appliances such as air purifiers. 
CHIP PRICES BOTTOMING OUT 
Samsung shares were trading up 0.2% in afternoon trade in a slightly firmer overall market (KS11), with analysts pointing to memory chip prices and the uncertain Q4 outlook for the muted response.
Analysts doubted whether Samsung's fourth-quarter profit could beat the third, as memory chip prices are seen bottoming out and a new Apple (O:AAPL) iPhone model is expected on the market.
U.S. rival Micron Technology Inc (O:MU), which posted a market-beating quarterly profit last month, forecast lower-than-expected sales in the following quarter, as it had not yet obtained new licenses needed to sell its memory chips to Huawei. 
Market researcher Trendforce expected DRAM chip prices to decline by about 10% in the year-end quarter, as demand from the server industry has yet to make a noticeable recovery. 
This comes even as Huawei rivals like Xiaomi, OPPO, and Vivo are all urgently stocking up on key components, in turn providing some support for the mobile DRAM chip market, Trendforce said.

In March, the company announced that it agreed to merge with FaceBank Group Inc, a virtual entertainment firm, a deal that valued fuboTV at $700 million, sources told Reuters. FuboTV has raised over $250 million from media companies including AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX), Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co and Viacom Inc.
In 2019, fuboTV said revenues reached $146.5 million, up 96% from the previous year, although the company's net loss were $129.3 million. In the first six months of 2020, fuboTV said it earned $51.5 million in revenue, with net losses reaching $129.9 million.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up in morning trade after U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to alter his stance on COVID-19 stimulus talks, tweeting new proposals overnight. Markets are also factoring in a Democrat win in U.S. presidential elections.
Once again, President Trump has set the tone of opening trade in the APAC region, with most markets up in early trade. Multiple overnight tweets from the president pushed Congress to pass various individual stimulus packages, for industry, consumers, and small business. This reversal encouraged investors looking for positive moves to prop up the COVID-19-ravaged U.S. economy.

(Reuters) - Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel wants to build his startup Redwood (NYSE:RWT) Materials into the world's top battery recycling company and one of the largest battery materials companies, he said at a technology conference Wednesday.
Straubel aims to leverage two partnerships, one with Panasonic Corp (T:6752), the Japanese battery manufacturer that is teamed with Tesla (O:TSLA) at the Nevada gigafactory, and one announced weeks ago with e-commerce giant Amazon (O:AMZN).
With production of electric vehicles and batteries about to explode, Straubel says his ultimate goal is to ""make a material impact on sustainability, at an industrial scale.""
Established in early 2017, Redwood this year will recycle more than 1 gigawatt-hours' worth of battery scrap materials from the gigafactory — enough to power more than 100 Tesla cars.
That is a fraction of the half-million vehicles Tesla expects to build this year. At the company's Battery Day in late September, Chief Executive Elon Musk said he was looking at recycling batteries to supplement the supply of raw materials from mining as Tesla escalates vehicle production.
Redwood's partnership with Panasonic started late last year with a pilot operation to recover materials at Redwood's recycling facilities in nearby Carson City, according to Celina Mikolajczak, vice president of battery technology at Panasonic Energy of North America.
Mikolajczak, who spent six years at Tesla as a battery technology leader, said: ""People underestimate what recycling can do for the electric vehicles industry. This could have a huge impact on raw material prices and output in the future.”
Straubel's broader plan is to dramatically reduce mining of raw materials such as nickel, copper and cobalt over several decades by building out a circular or “closed loop” supply chain that recycles and recirculates materials retrieved from end-of-life vehicle and grid storage batteries and from cells scrapped during manufacturing.
In September, Redwood said it received funding from Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, following an investment by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates.
“I’m excited about the work we can do together,” Straubel said of Amazon. “They have batteries in many devices,” from consumer electronics to data centers, as well as future electric delivery vehicles and drones.
This story corrects paragraph 4 to say gigawatt-hours, not terawatt-hours, and more than 100 cars, not 10,000 cars

72,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 10:05PM ET</span>","Regeneron antibodies in demand after Trump treatment, doctors seek more data","By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Patients are asking to join clinical trials of antibody-based COVID-19 drugs after U.S. President Donald Trump was treated last week with an experimental therapy from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN), and on Wednesday he promised to make it free to Americans while touting its benefits.
Medical experts said more data is needed to assess the treatment's efficacy before wider use should be allowed.
Trump was discharged from the hospital late on Monday, just a few days after being diagnosed with COVID-19 that caused enough lung inflammation for blood oxygen levels to fall.
According to his doctor, blood tests on Monday detected infection-fighting antibodies, which a Regeneron spokesperson said were probably from the treatment.
The company said on Wednesday that it has submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization (EUA) for its antibody combination.
In a video shot outside the White House, Trump credited the Regeneron therapy for his feeling much better than when he was first diagnosed and said he would push for EUAs of that treatment and others like it. He mistakenly said the drug was called Regeneron.
Regeneron's drug is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies - manufactured copies of antibodies that are one of the main weapons the immune system generates to fight infections.
The company so far has released some early data pointing to the promise of its therapy for COVID-19, and doctors were concerned Trump's treatment and subsequent promotion could put pressure on regulators
Dr. Gary Kleiner, a pediatric immunologist at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and investigator in a trial designed to see if Regeneron's antibodies can prevent coronavirus infection, said he has been approached by patients seeking the drug since last week.
Dr. Dirk Sostman, head of the research network at Houston Methodist Hospital, a trial site for Regeneron and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) & Co antibody programs, said more patients are asking to participate in an antibody trial.
He was cautious about broader use without more data.
""All we have seen are very brief press releases ... so there is not much to go on,"" he said.
""The politics of the situation would suggest to me that the story could be Trump gets COVID ... then American technology fostered by the Trump Administration cures COVID,"" Sostman added. ""I would think there would be pressure on regulators."" 
Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, speaking on Monday on CNN, said he was ""strongly suspicious"" that Regeneron's drug has contributed to Trump's progress. ""Obviously you can't prove that until you do a number of studies to show that it actually works,"" he said.
Doctors emphasized that the timeline for Trump's illness was not entirely clear. ""If he is responding at a pace where he is truly much better, it is going to be due to the antibodies,"" said Dr. Edward Jones-Lopez, infectious disease specialist at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles. 
Giving the treatment to the president seems ""a tacit endorsement by the federal medical bureaucracy for Regeneron's medicine, and we expect an EUA for the treatment of COVID in a matter of days,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note. 
""Patients most likely to benefit from this treatment have a similar profile to President Trump, in that they had undetectable antibodies at baseline and were early in the course of disease,"" Regeneron spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie said in an emailed statement.
Regeneron has received $450 million from the U.S. government for up to 300,000 doses of the dual-antibody cocktail, and the company has said those supplies would be distributed free of charge.
Eli Lilly on Wednesday said a mid-stage trial testing its combination antibody therapy showed that it helped cut hospitalization and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients and that it also planned to seek an EUA. 

Shares of Regeneron, up nearly 6% so far this month, closed at $591.69 on Wednesday. Lilly's shares rose 3.4% on Wednesday to close at $148.96.

The U.S. electric carmaker plans to manufacture a new version of its Model Y crossover vehicle, and possibly even battery cells at the site. Last month, Musk said that Tesla will use its Germany-based plant to demonstrate a radical overhaul of how its cars are built.
The company plans to start the production of Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin during the second half of 2021.
Tesla's new battery cell - a larger cylindrical format called 4680 that can store more energy and is easier to make - is key to achieving the goal of cutting battery costs in half and ramping up battery production nearly 100-fold by 2030. 
The company's new structural battery pack requires the new 4680 battery cells in order to work. 
Musk said on Wednesday that it will take about two years for Tesla factories in Fremont and Shanghai to embrace the new technology.
""Fremont and Shanghai will transition in 2 years when new tech is proven,"" Musk said in a tweet https:// The company said last week that it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, a quarterly record for the electric carmaker. Tesla's delivery push has been supported by its new Shanghai factory, the only plant currently producing vehicles outside California, as it is also building a new vehicle and battery manufacturing facility near Berlin.

 Chevron 's market cap ended the day around $142 billion, topping Exxon Mobil's $141.65 billion market value at the end of trade, according to Refinitiv data and Chevron SEC filings pertaining to the Nobel deal. 
Shares in Chevron closed up 2.047% on Wednesday and Exxon Mobile rose just 0.3%. 
Chevron’s finances are stronger and its shares have performed better than its larger rival. It has shifted away from costly megaprojects favored by oil majors, and moved sooner this year to cut costs amid the coronavirus-induced sharp drop in oil and gas prices.
Investors have shunned fossil fuel companies and the energy sector is the worst performing on the S&P 500 year to date. Chevron’s stock is down a lesser 38% year to date compared to a 52% decline at Exxon, which this year was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a position it held since the index was created. 
Exxon’s weak earnings have forced it to borrow to finance its nearly $15 billion a year shareholder dividend and cover spending on new projects. 

In part, Chevron’s finances have benefited from its faster divesting of unwanted assets. Exxon has struggled to unload unwanted oilfields despite promising to accelerate the sales in early 2019. Exxon officials have said they are reviewing all its operations for cuts, but have signaled that major savings will not come this year.

75,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 08:32PM ET</span>","U.S. airlines await new shot at federal aid as Pelosi, Mnuchin talk","By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. airlines were again holding out hope for another $25 billion in payroll aid after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed the possibility of standalone legislation for the struggling sector on Wednesday.
Their conversation was the latest in a series of turbulent developments on relief prospects in recent weeks for airlines, which last week began the furlough of tens of thousands of employees.
Airline shares jumped on Wednesday after sinking abruptly a day earlier on remarks by President Donald Trump that his administration would abandon talks with congressional Democrats over a major stimulus package until after the Nov. 3 election.
But an immediate path forward remains unclear.
Airlines' relief request enjoys wide bipartisan backing, but House of Representatives Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio failed last week to win approval of a standalone bipartisan measure for airlines by unanimous consent after some Republicans objected.
Pelosi asked Mnuchin by phone on Wednesday to review DeFazio's bill ""so that they could have an informed conversation,"" her spokesman, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter.
They spoke again on Wednesday evening for 20 minutes and agreed to continue discussions on Thursday, Hammill said.
A separate Republican-led attempt to pass standalone legislation in the Senate also failed after opposition from three Republican senators including Rick Scott of Florida.
A spokesman for Scott told Reuters on Wednesday he was waiting to hear whether an amendment to that proposal would get a vote.
The Republican bill proposes taking unspent money from a first COVID-19 relief package, while the House Democrats' proposal does not include any cuts to existing spending to fund the program.
Without unanimous consent, any standalone bill would have to go to both chambers for a vote, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Senate, battling some COVID-19 cases, would be out until Oct. 19.
Pelosi's conversation with Mnuchin came as the Trump administration signaled possible piecemeal legislation for airlines a day after abandoning talks over at least $1.6 trillion in additional coronavirus relief funds.
A key component of fresh airline relief is to keep workers on the job for another six months. A prior $25 billion airline payroll support program expired on Sept. 30.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines began the furlough of 32,000 workers last week, and tens of thousands more at those airlines and others have agreed to voluntary leaves or reduced hours. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has warned it will have to carry out the first furlough in its history if workers do not agree to pay cuts in the absence of federal aid.
U.S. airlines urged top House and Senate leaders to advance a standalone bill in a letter on Wednesday, warning that many more job losses are expected across the industry in the weeks ahead if aid is not extended.

The letter was signed by the main industry lobby, Airlines for America, and a dozen unions.

78,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",BA to bid farewell to 'Queen of the Skies' with rare dual take off,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways will bid farewell to its final London-based Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747s on Thursday with a rare synchronised dual take off for the ""Queen of the Skies"", the jet which brought long-haul flights to the masses. 
Once the world's largest operator of the 747, BA has now retired its entire jumbo jet fleet after the COVID-19 pandemic curtailed most air travel, accelerating the move to more fuel-efficient planes.
""Tomorrow will be a difficult day for everybody at British Airways as the aircraft leaves our home at Heathrow for the very last time,"" Chief Executive Alex Cruz said.
For over 50 years, the 747 has been the world's most easily recognised jetliner with its humped fuselage, four engines and 16 main wheels. 
It took its maiden flight in 1969 and soon secured its place in history as the jet which allowed more affordable air travel due its size and range. 
Passengers have included John Paul II, who arrived for the first visit to Ireland by a pope on an Aer Lingus 747 in 1979. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Iran from exile on an Air France jumbo during the same year's Islamic Revolution.
BA's predecessor airline BOAC first introduced the 747 on the London-New York route in 1971, and at its peak BA had a fleet of 57 747-400s. 
Former pilots have relayed how the jet initially took some getting used to, from a cockpit positioned almost 30 feet above the ground and more when angling the nose higher just before touching the runway. 
""It was like landing a block of flats from the 2nd floor,"" Hugh Dibley, a former BOAC captain, told Reuters.
On Thursday the final two 747s will take off from Heathrow at 0730 GMT with a rarely seen synchronised dual take off on parallel runways before one conducts a fly-past along the southerly runway, weather permitting. 
The owner of British Airways, IAG (L:ICAG), is battling to survive after the pandemic wiped out much of the global flying market.

79,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 06:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chevron workers face demands to reapply for jobs under global restructuring - sources,"By Jennifer Hiller and Devika Krishna Kumar
HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) employees worldwide are being asked to reapply for positions as part of a cost-cutting program expected to eliminate up to 15% of its workforce, people familiar with the matter said.
The No. 2 U.S. oil producer has begun taking steps to streamline its organization this year to reduce costs and revive declining profits. Oil companies have posted huge losses on asset writedowns and slashed spending as economic downturns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic undercut fuel demand.
Employees who are not chosen for jobs should know within weeks, Chief Executive Michael Wirth said in an interview on Monday. He did not discuss how cuts would be decided nor how many employees were asked to reapply for positions.
The company took a $1 billion charge to earnings earlier this year to cover severance pay for employees affected by the restructuring. Workers not chosen for new assignments would lose their jobs.
Chevron recently expanded its 45,000-person workforce by acquiring smaller oil and gas producer  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL), which has about 2,200 workers. That $4.1 billion all-stock deal closed this week.
In Houston, about 700 employees will lose jobs starting Oct. 23, according to a notice Chevron sent to the state of Texas. Employees will receive enhanced severance benefits and two-months to leave the company, the letter said. Most of the people not chosen for new posts will depart by the end of the year, a spokeswoman said.
Decisions about Noble (OTC:NEBLQ) employees are likely in several weeks, Wirth said. Reductions are more likely where the two companies overlap, such as west Texas shale and administrative areas, Wirth said.
""Some areas like the Middle East or like Colorado where we don't have much of an operating footprint, it's unlikely there's significant changes there in the near term,"" Wirth said. ""We're working through the details on that.""

Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) last month said it plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs, or over 10% of its workforce.  BP  Plc (L:BP) this year also announced plans to cut around 10,000 jobs, as the two shift from oil and gas to lower-carbon energy sources.

80,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",White House Curbs on Chinese Apps Seen Posing Risk to Ant IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration’s potential restrictions on two Chinese payments giants would reverberate far beyond politics, potentially affecting multibillion-dollar deals, shaking up international commerce and even shaping the evolution of the global financial system.
U.S. officials have stepped up behind-the-scenes talks in recent weeks about possibly restricting the expansion of Ant Group’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s WeChat Pay over concerns that the digital payment platforms threaten national security, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.
If the administration proceeds, the most immediate hit would be to Ant Group’s plan for a stock listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong, a deal that could rank as the world’s largest initial public offering. Some international companies have been working with the payment apps and could see those strategies hurt or derailed. And while restrictions may ultimately head off potent competitors to U.S. and European banks, it could also -- depending on how China responds -- thwart their own planned expansion into the world’s second-largest economy.
Here’s a breakdown of the many companies with business at stake as President Donald Trump’s administration weighs its decision:
Ant’s IPO
Investors have been eager to pile into Jack Ma’s Ant Group. After gauging early interest, the company is seeking to raise at least $35 billion in its IPO, people familiar with the matter have said, potentially topping Saudi Aramco’s record $29 billion sale. Ant lifted the target based on an increased valuation of about $250 billion, which would exceed the market capitalization of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., the second-largest U.S. lender.
Restricting Alipay would cast a pall over the sale. It’s unclear whether U.S. investors would be allowed to buy shares. American funds including Silver Lake Management LLC, Warburg Pincus LLC, and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc. already put at least $500 million in the fintech giant in 2018. The sanction also could give pause to non-U.S. funds such as Singapore state investors Temasek Holdings Pte and GIC Pte. -- existing backers that could boost their stakes in the IPO.
Ant Group generates the vast majority of its revenue in China. But the Trump administration’s deliberations may at least prompt investors to recalibrate expectations for the payment apps’ international growth.
The prospect of someday offering services to U.S. consumers “is a huge shot of adrenaline to the heart of the business,” said David Menlow, president and founder of IPOFinancial.com. Now, investors “will be thinking twice.”
U.S. banks  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are working as sponsors for the IPO in Hong Kong -- which alone could raise about $17.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. It’s unclear how U.S. restrictions would affect the investment banks’ hard-fought relationship with Ant.
 Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN)
For U.S. officials, the concern is that the growing popularity of Alipay and WeChat Pay internationally gives China unprecedented access to banking and transaction data that could ultimately include personal information on hundreds of millions of Americans. The question is whether authorities in China might raise similar concerns about U.S. firms.
Initially, Alipay’s foray into the U.S. focused on places where Chinese consumers visit and shop, such as luxury stores in New York or tourist destinations in California. But last year, things began accelerating as Alipay inked deals with retailers like drug store chain Walgreens, placing the app’s logo in front of millions more U.S. consumers.
At the same time, U.S. payment networks have been pushing into China. In November,  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V). and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). announced deals letting their cards be added to the WeChat Pay and Alipay wallets -- making it easier for cardholders from outside China to shop on the mainland, where the apps already dominate all forms of commerce.
The card networks have longed to expand into that market. “I couldn’t be more excited,” Visa Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly told investors in May. There was more progress recently, with  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP). getting approval in June to start bank card clearing services in China.
Now, any actions against Alipay or WeChat Pay could spell trouble for the U.S. networks’ ambitions.
Investment Banks
For U.S. banks, the news comes with upsides and downsides. American bankers have long feared domestic consumers would one day embrace Chinese-style payment apps, which seamlessly allow people to shop, order takeout, pay bills and manage brokerage accounts using mobile phones. A variety of banks and technology companies have tried and failed to gain the kind of dominance allowing them to head off outside competition.
On the other hand, U.S. banks have been eyeing China as fertile ground for revenue growth.
Wall Street giants such as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan have waited for decades to move into the nation’s $45 trillion financial market. Five top U.S. banks had roughly $70 billion of combined exposure to China in 2019. But even that’s small compared to their ambitions for expansion there.
JPMorgan’s joint venture in the region has begun offering brokerage services, investment advisory and underwriting businesses. Goldman has said it wants to take full ownership of its joint venture in China. It hopes to double its workforce in the country as it ramps up asset and wealth management offerings.
If financial services firms are dragged into a tit-for-tat between the two countries, it could complicate such strategies and threaten the relationships they have spent years trying to build with giant Chinese companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., which owns a one-third stake in Ant.
U.S. Partnerships
Brands including Marriott hotels and KFC restaurants in China use Ant’s Alipay superapp, building their own lite apps that can help users book rooms and order food. Asset manager Vanguard Group set up a joint venture with Ant to provide automated financial advisory services in China. The robo adviser lured more than 100,000 people in the country as of June. Ant is also working with the joint ventures of mutual fund operators such as Invesco Ltd.
Still, the Trump administration’s guideline for Tencent’s instant-messaging app WeChat could offers clues to how the U.S. might handle payment platforms. It has allowed U.S. companies to continue working with WeChat outside of the U.S.

After abruptly calling off negotiations on a comprehensive bill on Tuesday, President Donald Trump later that day urged Congress to pass a series of smaller, standalone bills that would include a bailout package for the airline industry battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Airline shares jumped.
Indexes held gains after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its last policy meeting. The minutes showed U.S. central bankers, having agreed unanimously in August on a broad new approach to monetary policy, were divided in September over how to apply their new principles in practice.
""The only reason we were down yesterday was the tweet from President Trump, which he walked back last night. That's why the market started off stronger and continued stronger. I think there's full-blown expectations that some form of stimulus agreement is going to occur sooner than later,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. 
Top White House officials downplayed the possibility of more coronavirus relief, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi disparaged Trump for backing away from talks on a comprehensive deal.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 529.45 points, or 1.91%, to 28,302.21, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 58.38 points, or 1.74%, to 3,419.33 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 210.00 points, or 1.88%, to 11,364.60.
Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) rose after saying it had submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use of its experimental COVID-19 antibody treatment. 
With the presidential election just weeks away, focus later Wednesday may turn to a debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic opponent Kamala Harris.
Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls released on Tuesday showed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden expanding his lead over Trump in battleground Michigan and the two candidates locked in a toss-up race in North Carolina ahead of the Nov. 3 election.

Investors also are preparing to hear soon from companies on the third quarter. Analysts expect earnings at S&P 500 companies to have dropped about 21% in the quarter from a year ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investing.com – The Dow rallied on Wednesday as value stocks like consumer discretionary and industrials caught a bid on renewed hopes for stimulus after President Donald Trump said he was in favor of targeted coronavirus aid.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.91%, or 530 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.67%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.88%.
President Trump said he was ready to sign off on piecemeal measures, including support for individuals, small businesses and airlines.  
Delta Air Line (NYSE:DAL) rose more than 3%, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) ended up more than 4%.
The call for targeted stimulus comes a day after Trump halted the talks and claimed U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was negotiating in bad faith. 
Tech, meanwhile, pared its losses from a day earlier, despite coming under increased scrutiny after Congress released a report condemning big tech's monopoly power and called for a break up.   
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which together make up a quarter weighting of the S&P 500, ending higher. 
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), meanwhile, closed 6% higher after Pivotal Research upgraded its price target on the stock to $650 from $600, citing a ramp-up in cord-cutting trends.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) climbed 3% after CEO Elon Musk said the company had a shot at delivering 500,000 vehicles by year-end, Reuters reported, citing a company memo.
Energy lagged the broader move higher, weighed down by falling oil prices on renewed demand concerns after data showed U.S. weekly crude supplies rose by more than expected.
In earnings news, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) reported quarterly earnings of 8 cents per share, topping estimates for a loss of 22 cents per share, sending the stock more than 6% higher.
On the health care front, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) jumped 4% after filing a Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization for its experimental Covid-19 antibody therapy. The company said early results from a study of the antibody therapy suggested the drug reduced symptoms and hospitalizations for patients with mild or moderate Covid-19."

(Reuters) - If  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) buys Arm Ltd from SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), Arm will keep ""firewalls"" in place to ensure the data center chip company does not access confidential information from Arm's customers or get early access to Arm's products, a top Arm executive told Reuters on Tuesday.
The $40 billion deal announced last month would reshape the global semiconductor sector because Arm has long acted as a neutral player, supplying intellectual property to Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) and many others that goes into chips for most of the world's smart phones and many other kinds of chips.
Nvidia has displaced  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) as the biggest U.S. chip company by market capitalization on the strength of its data center chips for artificial intelligence. It has said it will keep Arm's business model of openly licensing the company's technology throughout the chip industry. 
But because chips take years to go from an idea to silicon, Arm's customers often disclose information about future plans during licensing discussions with Arm. Arm customers also share sales forecasts and figures to calculate royalty payments.
""We are going to keep the firewalls up between the two companies relative to confidentiality, and we’re not going to give any early access to Nvidia,” Rene Haas, president of Arm’s IP Products Group, told Reuters in an interview.
But Haas said some information would still need to be conveyed to Nvidia, such as if major customers disclosed plans to move to RISC-V, an open source competitor to Arm, setting the stage for a downturn in sales that might in turn affect Nvidia's financial results. Haas said the two firms were in discussions on ""how to minimize the access to that information.""
The deal is widely expected to generate scrutiny from Nvidia rivals who use Arm technology, such as Intel and Qualcomm Inc (O:QCOM).
""We'll evaluate this every step of the way, as we do with all combinations in the industry, to make sure that Intel and the industry have access to critical technologies on a fair and level playing field,"" Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan told Reuters in an interview last week.

In statement on Wednesday, Nvidia said that it would ""make sure that the confidential information of Arm’s customers will be fully protected, just as it is today.""

86,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 03:46PM ET</span>","Fed Speeches, Jobs Data, Pizza Profit: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Washington's on-again, off-again stimulus talks are whipsawing the markets.
Stocks surged on Wednesday after lawmakers restored hopes that at least some of the stimulus ideas – such as aid for airlines and checks to households – will make progress a day after President Donald Trump took the wind out of stocks by telling Republican negotiators to abandon efforts.
Airline stocks rose strongly on Wednesday, including Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL),  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL)
Federal Reserve officials hit the speech circuit this week, mostly to hammer home the idea that the economy needs support to recover from the Covid-induced lockdowns.
More Fed speakers are expected on Thursday, alongside new jobs data and earnings from Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp., a pandemic winner and loser, respectively.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. More Fed speakers
Federal Open Market Committee member and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin is slated to speak at 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT). Later, at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT) Robert Kaplan, head of the Dallas Fed and another FOMC member, will speak.
Both are likely to emphasize the central bank's message of the week: More stimulus is needed to support the economic recovery. On Wednesday the Fed's minutes said the ""recovery was forecast to be far from complete by year-end. The staff's forecast assumed the enactment of some additional fiscal policy support this year; without that additional policy action, the pace of the economic recovery would likely be slower.""
2. More jobs data
Initial jobless claims are reported at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and expectations are for 820,000 new filings. Continuing jobless claims, reported at the same time, are expected to come in around 11.4 million.
Though the claims have come down since the worst of the Covid meltdown, the sustained elevated level of new jobless claims – coming in just under 1 million a week for several weeks, now -- is more evidence that the economic fallout will continue. Major corporations like Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) and American Airlines have already laid off workers, and more are expected to do so going into the end of the year.
3. Earnings reports from pandemic have and a pandemic have-not
People chowed down on delivery and comfort food during the last few months, benefiting companies like Domino’s Pizza Inc (NYSE:DPZ). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect earnings per share of $2.76 on revenue of $949 million. That would be a 35% gain in EPS from the same period a year ago.
People are not booking vacations on cruises, which have been banned from sailing until the coronavirus can be contained. Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) is expected to report a loss per share of $2.18 on revenue of $77 million.

88,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>",U.S. indicts six more chicken executives over alleged price fixing,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. government has indicted six more chicken-industry executives over alleged price-fixing, expanding antitrust prosecutions in its probe of the $65 billion poultry sector, according to court documents.
In June, the Justice Department indicted Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Chief Executive Jayson Penn and three others in its first charges in the criminal probe involving broiler birds, which account for most U.S. chicken meat.
Court documents filed on Tuesday show that former Pilgrim's Pride CEO William Lovette has also been indicted. Lovette could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday, and a company spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Pilgrim's Pride, mostly owned by Brazil-based meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), last month said Penn was exiting the company and would be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Fabio Sandri. Penn succeeded Lovette as CEO in 2019.
The documents allege that industry executives conspired to fix prices from 2012 through 2019.
Also indicted was a sales executive named Timothy Mulrenin, court documents show. 
Mulrenin's LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page says he is Perdue Farms' director of national account sales and was formerly  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN)' director of sales. He did not immediately respond to a message sent through LinkedIn.
A Perdue spokeswoman had no immediate comment. A Tyson spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tyson in June said it was cooperating with the Justice Department's investigation under a program that could protect the company from criminal prosecution.
The indictments come after grocers, retailers and consumers filed a lawsuit accusing Pilgrim's Pride, Tyson and other poultry processors of conspiring to inflate prices for broiler chickens. The companies have denied the allegations.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has a chance at producing 500,000 cars this year, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told employees, according to an internal email seen by Reuters.
The company's shares were up 3.6% at $428.86.
Tesla said in January that 2020 vehicle deliveries should comfortably exceed 500,000 units, a forecast the company has left unchanged despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
""This all comes down to Q4. Please take whatever steps you can think of to improve output (while increasing quality)"", Musk wrote to employees on Wednesday.
Such emails are traditional at Tesla, with Musk sending them out every quarter to hint at targets and potential new records.
Industry blog Tesmanian first reported the news earlier in the day. (https:// Last week, Tesla said it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, an all-time record for the electric-car maker, yet shares fell as some analysts questioned whether Tesla could hit its ambitious year-end target. The company will have to increase deliveries to nearly 182,000 in the fourth quarter to reach the half-million target. Tesla's delivery push has been supported by its new Shanghai factory, the only plant currently producing vehicles outside California. The company began delivering Model 3s from its Shanghai factory in December and has said it aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans in the factory this year. 
Reuters could not immediately reach Tesla for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the U.S. government this month begins allowing small businesses to not repay their loans from a $525 billion pandemic relief plan, shifting the cost to American taxpayers, the process and the agency overseeing it have come under blunt criticism by the Congressional watchdog agency. 
The loan forgiveness process has drawn complaints from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that the Small Business Administration has been plagued by a lack of transparency and, also, failed to demonstrate sufficient ability in the program to prevent fraud and abuse. 
Last month, the Department of Justice said that it had charged 57 defendants for attempting to steal more than $175 million from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).
A Small Business Administration (SBA) spokesperson said on Tuesday that the initial loan payoffs, in which the government sends money to banks to forgive loans taken by small businesses under the PPP, started last Friday.
“What was clear to us with PPP...is that the controls were very weak,” said William Shear, a director of Financial Markets and Community Investment at GAO, a non-partisan watchdog that works for the U.S. Congress. The GAO has issued two lengthy reports since June that were critical of the efficacy of the PPP and other U.S. government responses to the pandemic. 
The SBA, which oversees the Paycheck Protection Program and has defended its performance while stressing the challenges of overseeing hundreds of billions of dollars in loans in a short space of time, said it is working with the GAO.
“I reject the sudden claim that SBA is not cooperating with GAO or that we are dragging our feet in responding,” Jovita Carranza, the Administrator of the SBA, said in a statement. 
The Department of Treasury, which is working with the SBA on the loan forgiveness process, did not respond to a request for comment.
Introduced in April to help companies weather the economic shutdown brought on by COVID-19, the PPP in four months was responsible for 5.21 million loans ranging from less than $50,000 each to more than $5 million. The rules stipulated that businesses with limited financing options could seek a loan that would later be fully forgiven. The loans would ultimately be paid by taxpayer money, not the businesses that received them from banks, if at least 60 percent was spent on payroll - with the rest going to meeting expenses such as rent, interest on mortgage or utilities.
Tensions between the GAO and the SBA were aired this month at a hearing organized by the U.S. House Small Business Committee, which examines policies for small businesses for the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Shear, the GAO official, told Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez that there were “obstructions” when his office tried to get details on PPP loans and other pandemic programs from the SBA. The information was needed, he said, to evaluate how well the SBA was managing the program.
Velazquez, who chairs the committee, said she had called the SBA to expedite the agency’s response. “Probably the obstruction coming out of the SBA is because they knew they did not take or implement the kind of controls to prevent fraud and abuse,” Velazquez said at the hearing.
According to a report published in September by the GAO, plans to safeguard the loan forgiveness process remained incomplete. For instance, the GAO said, banks that issued the loans are the initial deciders of how much of a loan should be forgiven. 
But it is unclear to what extent they are responsible for verifying the information provided on applications versus relying on borrowers’ versions of their finances. 
Also unclear is the extent to which the SBA intends to review the banks’ decisions, the report said, noting it is a conflict of interest for banks to be heavily involved in loan forgiveness since it is in their interest for loans to be forgiven. 
Furthermore, oversight plans to scrutinise loans worth $2 million or less for fraud - which the GAO had recommended in June that the SBA develop - were still being finalized, according to GAO’s September report.
William Manger, an associate administrator at the Office of Capital Access at the SBA, told another hearing organized last month by the Small Business Committee, that the agency was working with the U.S. Department of Treasury and its contractors to finalise a way to review and forgive loans. 

“We just want to make sure that whatever we do, we are being responsible to the taxpayer,"" he said. ""These are taxpayer dollars that we will be paying out.”

A dearth of exploration has seen average mine life across the gold mining sector fall from 20 years to closer to 10 years, he added, speaking at the Joburg Indaba mining conference.
""The prospect of a serious reserve crisis is looming,"" said Bristow. Gold production across the industry has only increased by 1.6% every year for the past two decades, he said. 
Bristow said this week's deal between  Northern Star Resources  (AX:NST) and  Saracen Mineral Holdings  (AX:SAR) was a ""great example"" of industry consolidation that should be celebrated.
On Mali, where Barrick is among the biggest investors and operates the Loulo-Gounkoto gold mine, Bristow said the transition after an August military coup has been ""very well"" run.
""Everyone agrees that 18 months for transition back to full civilian rule is doable, and that's ambitious,"" Bristow said, adding that ""none of the organs of state has stopped functioning.""
Bristow again signalled his appetite for acquiring Freeport-McMoran's (N:FCX) Grasberg mine in Indonesia, the world's biggest gold mine and second-biggest copper mine.
""There are not a lot around, and so by deduction of course we remain interested in being able to add to our portfolio any tier 1 asset out there,"" he said. 
Bristow said he has no doubt the company will be able to repatriate $500 million which belongs to its Kibali joint venture in the Congo. 
""That paperwork is far down the road,"" he said. At the start of July, Bristow had said the money would be cleared to leave the country ""very soon"". 
""There's a fundamental recognition that to continue to attract investors into the DRC, you have to give them the right to repatriate their profits,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A plan being considered by U.S. stock exchanges to leave New Jersey, where the bourses' main electronic trading systems are located, to avoid a potential state tax on trading, could harm the industry, a senior U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official said on Wednesday.
A sudden exit by the exchanges from northern New Jersey, where billions of dollars of trades are processed daily in three main data centers for all 16 U.S. stock exchanges, could be very costly and disruptive to market participants, said SEC Director of Trading and Markets, Brett Redfearn. 
""We are watching it very closely. We are going to continue to talk to stakeholders about this, but needless to say, we certainly do have concerns,"" he said at a virtual conference held by the Security Traders Association. 
New Jersey is considering a tax of a quarter of a cent per financial transaction for firms that make more than 10,000 such transactions per year.
Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) New York Stock Exchange unit ran the smallest of its five exchanges out of its Chicago backup site last week, in part to show it is prepared to quickly leave New Jersey if a transaction tax is enacted. Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) also plans to run one of its exchanges from Chicago for a week at the end of the month. 
If all the exchanges relocated to the same place, such as the Chicago data center where they all have their backup sites, it could benefit the market by neutralizing the speed advantages some firms have in sending and receiving data, Redfearn said.
""But if in the meantime, you have half of the people in Chicago, 25% in Texas and 25% in New Jersey, that then introduces a whole lot of dynamics that I'm not particularly thrilled about,"" he said.

The new strategy confirmed policymakers would revisit expanding into Sub-Saharan Africa, which was originally expected to begin this year, to 2022 and focus on its existing countries of operation for now.
""The COVID pandemic has hit all our countries of operations hard,"" EBRD governor for Spain Nadia Calvino said in a recorded video message at the opening of the meeting. 
""Our priority now is on crisis response, on recovery, and on building back better to accelerate transition.""
The EBRD was set up in 1991 to invest in the ex-communist economies of eastern Europe. It now operates in 38 economies, chiefly in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and central Asia.
Meanwhile French Treasury head Renaud-Basso was on track to take on the top job at the bank, according to sources, after Italy's former economy minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, had pulled out of the race for president.
Padoan and Renaud-Basso were seen as the front runners for the position, with Polish Finance Minister Tadeusz Koscinski also in the race. 
The EBRD confirmed that the vote was now between Renaud-Basso and Koscinski.
Renaud-Basso is set to succeed Britain's Suma Chakrabarti, who finished his second four-year term earlier in the year. If confirmed, she would become the fourth French president of the EBRD. 
To be elected, a candidate has to receive the votes of a majority of governors, representing a majority of the total voting power of members.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Sachem Head Capital Management said on Wednesday that it owns a $1.2 billion stake in  Elanco Animal Health  (NYSE:ELAN) Inc and plans to push for changes at the company that makes medicines and vaccinations for pets and livestock.
The New York-based hedge fund, run by Scott Ferguson, said in a regulatory filing the Greenfield, Indiana headquartered company's stock is ""undervalued"" and an ""attractive investment.""
Ferguson raised cash for the position through a so-called special purpose vehicle over the last months and his hedge fund now owns a 9.1% stake through stock and options.
The hedge fund intends to speak with Elanco management and sees opportunities to boost sales and improve margins, a person familiar with Sachem Head's plan said.
Elanco's stock price jumped 12.04% to $31.63 on news of Sachem Head's involvement. A company spokeswoman said management is focused on ""enhancing value for all shareholders and will continue to take actions to achieve that objective.""
Sachem Head has experience with animal health companies having invested with Elanco competitor Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) in 2014.
Elanco, valued at $14 billion, has lagged its rival with its shares up only 5.4% from a year ago, while Zoetis' stock has climbed 27% during the same time.
Bloomberg first reported the stake in Elanco.
Sachem Head was founded in 2012. Previously it called on  Whitbread  (LON:WTB) PLC to sell its Costa Coffee business before it was spun off to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and it pushed Eagle Materials (NYSE:EXP) Inc to split its core businesses, before the company's board agreed to spin off its heavy materials and light materials businesses into two publicly traded entities.

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian police on Wednesday expanded the Car Wash corruption investigation to alleged kickbacks valued at $8 million on contracts for bunker fuel bought by state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) for its fleet of tankers.
A police statement said searches were carried out in Rio de Janeiro as part of the investigation, which is targeting unnamed Petrobras officials for their role in the transactions, which were allegedly carried out between 2009 and 2018.
The head of Brazil's ""Car Wash"" prosecution unit, Alessandro Oliveira, said authorities were looking into transactions in Brazil and Singapore. 
The statement indicates that a long-running probe into Petrobras' dealings with some of the world's largest commodity trading firms - including Vitol, Glencore (OTC:GLNCY), and Trafigura - is expanding geographically. Until now, the probe has been largely focused on Petrobras' Houston operations.
In a statement to Reuters, Petrobras said it is the victim of corruption, rather than its perpetrator, and that it has assisted authorities with dozens of criminal investigations, as well as 21 administrative probes.
The Car Wash probe, known in Portuguese as Lava Jato, began in 2014 with the arrest of a currency dealer and mushroomed into Brazil's biggest ever graft scandal, mainly involving Petrobras contracts in which some 200 businessmen, officials and politicians have been convicted.
In the Wednesday statement, prosecutors said there were indications Petrobras employees arranged a system with corrupt traders so that sweetheart contracts would be awarded on a rotating basis. They said they were investigating executives of trading companies.
In 2019, Reuters reported that Petrobras detected suspicious transactions in its Singapore trading division as early as 2012 but failed to stop them.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is overhauling its newly formed ""Enterprise Operations"" organization after just six months as it looks to cut costs and repair a crisis-weakened supply chain, according to internal memos and a person familiar with the strategy.
The restructuring, which took effect on Friday, and other linked efforts like moving 787 assembly outside Washington state, are key pieces of Boeing's broader strategy for surviving an industry-wide crisis fueled by the coronavirus downturn.
Taken overall, Boeing's steps to cut costs, while making factories more efficient in preparation for a rebound in the global jet market, are among the largest changes to operations at the U.S. planemaker since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
Boeing is slicing Enterprise Operations - an overarching quality-control watchdog formed in April to shepherd the company through its worst-ever crisis - into four new ""councils"", according to a memo seen by Reuters. 
The councils will oversee Supply Chain, Quality, Program Management and Manufacturing - all key areas where Boeing is facing daunting challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""These moves will help to make us leaner, sharper and more resilient for the long term so we can emerge a stronger company,"" Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said in a September memo seen by Reuters. 
Smith will continue to oversee the councils' work.
A Boeing spokesman confirmed the memos and pointed to past statements on challenges Boeing faces.
Boeing faces a depressed market for twin-aisle jets like its brand-new 777X, and sees its Commercial Airplanes and Defense divisions as too siloed, one senior Boeing executive said.
For example, on manufacturing and quality, Boeing is working through three separate 787 Dreamliner production flaws, just as it looks to shift production exclusively to South Carolina from 2021.
Boeing is also worried any production recovery after the crisis may be threatened by parts shortages and bottlenecks. The shake-up aims to avoid separate aircraft programs buying parts without talking to each other.
Boeing also needs to rein in a previously announced job-shedding program that has gone too far in some cases, including a wave of commercial executives. Part of the councils' function is managing Boeing's operations workforce.
""You can't have a brain drain in one area just in the spirit of meeting reduction targets,"" the executive said. 
Boeing is also using the crisis to inject new blood into its defense and space unit. It is moving veteran Commercial Airplanes executive Bill Osborne, who was also the top executive in Enterprise Operations, into a newly created Total Quality and Operations role at the Defense division, Smith's memo said. 
Osborne is seen by insiders as a turnaround expert after leading manufacturing quality at truck maker Navistar International (N:NAV).
The move comes as Boeing gears up for a test mission with its Starliner astronaut capsule after setbacks this year. It is also grappling with cost overruns, quality issues like ""foreign-object debris"" and fresh delays on its KC-46 tanker for the U.S. Air Force.

""Now, more than ever, we need to double-down on our core operations,"" Boeing Defense Chief Executive Leanne Caret said in another September memo seen by Reuters, with a special focus on ""first-time quality and operational excellence.""

A number of Chinese companies, which have debuted in U.S. stock markets this year, have also attracted strong investor interest. Earlier this year, SoftBank-backed KE Holdings (N:BEKE), which owns real estate brokerage brand Lianjia and housing transactions platform Beike, sold over $2 billion worth of shares after its IPO was priced above range.

“The secretary inquired about a standalone airlines bill. The speaker reminded him that Republicans blocked that bill on Friday & asked him to review the DeFazio bill so that they could have an informed conversation,” Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill tweeted.
Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio on Friday attempted to pass an extension of expiring aid for carriers on the House floor by unanimous consent, but Republicans objected, saying they hadn’t been consulted.
The DeFazio legislation would provide more than $28 billion for airlines and contractors if they held off on layoffs until March 31, 2021.
The renewed interest in the bill comes after President Donald Trump on Tuesday tweeted that he was ending talks on a comprehensive stimulus deal until after the November election. Later Tuesday, Trump called on Democrats to pass standalone bills, such as for airlines relief and for $1,200 stimulus checks.
Job Losses
U.S. carriers have furloughed about 38,000 since Oct. 1, including major layoffs at American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. Those cuts followed the departure of 150,000 who left airlines voluntarily or accepted leave. Pelosi last week urged carriers to postpone layoffs, promising that relief was imminent.
“We will either enact Chairman DeFazio’s bipartisan standalone legislation or achieve this as part of a comprehensive negotiated relief bill, extending for another six months the Payroll Support Program,” she said in a statement.

152,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>",Quant Giant Rebuts Buzzy Idea on How to Save Value Investing,"(Bloomberg) -- Value investing has trailed growth for a decade, and one popular theory why is that it fails to capture things like patents or brand reputation when deciding a company’s worth. The latest research by quant house Dimensional Fund Advisors pours cold water on this explanation.
Items like the importance of a brand or a proprietary design -- for instance, for a microchip -- are so-called intangibles that are harder to appraise than physical assets like factories.
On one view, value investing fails to get a handle on what firms are worth because it stumbles over intangibles, leaving it struggling to achieve the goal of identifying cheap shares set to rally. Adjusting for intangibles can improve the factor’s performance, so the argument goes.
Dimensional, which manages about $514 billion, analyzed intangibles that U.S. companies developed internally as well as those they acquired. It concluded that value investors should refrain from trying to adjust for them as doing so doesn’t deliver a consistent boost for returns.
“Adjusting for intangibles would not have tangible benefits for investors based on our historical research,” Savina Rizova, head of research, said in an interview. Such an approach fails to deliver a “consistent performance benefit” for value investors, she said.
Over about five decades, the so-called average value premium adjusted for internally developed intangibles and controlling for sectors is 3.6%, versus 3.2% without, according to Dimensional’s analysis. The value premium is the degree to which value stocks outpace growth counterparts. The paper argues the difference identified by the research isn’t a reliable one.
The Russell 1000 Value Index of firms with lower price-to-book ratios has doubled in the past decade, lagging the 300%-plus surge in its growth counterpart. The debate about whether value investing’s foundations are solid continues to rage, with some analysts predicting a revival for beaten-down stocks as economies recover from the pandemic.
Dimensional plans to do more work on the topic of intangibles by covering more countries. A preliminary analysis suggests the takeaways are fairly similar, Rizova said.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Head of EU Parliament fisheries committee takes tough line on Brexit deal,"By Michel Rose and Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - A French EU lawmaker who chairs the European Parliament's fisheries committee told Reuters there could be no annual quota negotiation in a trade deal with Britain, sticking to a tough line from Paris that could make a Brexit deal more difficult. 
The EU and Britain are locked in crunch negotiations to get a deal on a post-Brexit trade ties in place before an end-year deadline. Agreement on fish is one of three stumbling blocks.
The EU wants to secure consistent rights to fish in British waters, an issue important for France where coastal fishing communities are politically influential. Britain wants a deal more like that of non-EU member Norway, under which quotas are set each year.
Two EU diplomatic sources said other member states in the bloc are trying to get France to compromise. But, speaking to Reuters, the EU Parliament's fisheries committee's chairman, Pierre Karleskind, said avoiding annual negotiations over access and quotas was one of ""our red lines"".
""Who will invest in a fishing boat worth 3 million euros if they don't know whether they have the right to fish in two years time?"" said Karleskind, a member of French President Emmanuel Macron's liberal bloc. The EU parliament must approve any deal.
The bloc has long said annual fishing quota negotiations are unacceptable, but sources have signalled a possible compromise.
Germany, which wants a trade deal to prevent tariffs hurting its automakers, is seen as pushing for a deal on fish. Britain and Norway reached a separate fishing agreement, which German Chancellor Angela Merkel said proves ""agreements can be found"".
Some diplomats in the bloc told Reuters France would need to budge if there is to be a deal.
""The French realise full well that their demands on fisheries were unrealistic. We need them to climb down at some point,"" said an EU diplomat who follows Brexit and spoke under condition of anonymity.
Karleskind said some countries at last week's EU summit had initially voiced a ""vague"" willingness to compromise on fishing, but that even those with no claims in the North Sea understood unity was important.
""They quickly get back into line as soon as we start talking about it,"" he said. ""You could ask 'why should Greece care about fishing in the North Sea?'. But if we show weakness in the face of claims in the North Sea, what signal are we sending to Turkey in the Mediterranean?""
EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier met Merkel on Monday and is also due to meet French President Emmanuel Macron. EU sources said one purpose of the meetings is to ease French reluctance to compromise. Barnier is also due to call EU fisheries ministers including in Denmark, Ireland, Germany and Poland.
Britain and the EU made considerable progress in talks last week, including on aligning social benefits, according to sources in the EU who were left believing an agreement was getting closer. 

But there was no breakthrough on fisheries or the other two most contentious issues - fair competition and ways to settle disputes. The two sides have given until mid-October to assess if a deal is in the making, but sources told Reuters the EU is gearing up to keep negotiating until as late as mid-November.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The parent of Malaysia Airlines has warned leasing companies that state fund Khazanah will stop funding the group and force it into a winding down process if restructuring talks with lessors are unsuccessful, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The warning from Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), the holding company for the carrier, raises the stakes in negotiations for a financial shake-up known as ""Plan A"" and sets out an alternative plan to divert funds to a sister airline unit called Firefly.
""In the event Plan A fails, shareholder (Khazanah) will cease funding for MAG and will trigger winding down/liquidation process for MAG,"" according to the document, the contents of which were confirmed by six people familiar with the matter.
Khazanah, MAG's sole shareholder, declined to comment. MAG did not respond to a request for comment.
The warning comes days after the airline group asked lessors in a letter for steep discounts on aircraft rentals as part of a broad restructuring plan, some of the people said.
According to the latest document, under a ""Plan B"" scenario, Khazanah would ""inject funds into Firefly directly to start new jet operations at Kuala Lumpur on a much smaller scale, focusing first on domestic services.""
Low cost carrier Firefly, which operates a fleet of 12 twin turboprops, mainly within the country, is currently a fully-owned subsidiary of MAG.
According to the document, Firefly would obtain narrow-body planes and subsequently wide-body aircraft from the market.
Malaysia's national airline has struggled to recover from two tragedies in 2014 - the mysterious disappearance of flight MH370 and the shooting down of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine.
Khazanah took it private that year as part of a $1.5 billion restructuring, but efforts to turn around its business have been further upended by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Reuters reported last week that MAG had told lessors it was unlikely to be able to make payments owed after November unless it received more funding from Khazanah.
Khazanah told Reuters last week it was supportive of Malaysia Airlines' restructuring efforts but that if they proved unsuccessful, it would need to evaluate options on how to maintain connectivity for Malaysia.

MAG said last week the airline had reached out to lessors, creditors and key suppliers recently as it embarks on an urgent restructuring due to the impact of the pandemic.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - In spite of the rally in risk markets this year, Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) expects low returns across asset classes in the coming three to five years as the global economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.
Published on Wednesday, the investment giant's outlook argues that given the current high valuations in credit and equity markets, and the likelihood that interest rates will be kept near zero, investors should expect a stagnation or decline in profit as a percentage of gross domestic product.
Credit and equity markets have been bolstered this year by investors' hunt for yield. With interest rates near zero, share prices have risen and borrowing costs have fallen for riskier companies. But the pandemic's economic realities still mean that revenue - especially in sectors like travel, entertainment and hospitality - won't quickly recover, and central banks are unlikely to intervene to prevent defaults from rising.
""Given historically low yields and high equity valuations, it makes sense for portfolio managers and asset allocators alike to lower their return expectations rather than stretch too far and extend too far down the quality spectrum in hope of maintaining historical levels of returns,"" PIMCO said. 
A fresh wave of coronavirus infections or the development of a vaccine could change the outlook for financial markets dramatically. So could the passage of further fiscal stimulus.
The European Union's recovery package, which will distribute funds throughout 2021, has put the bloc on better footing economically. More fiscal stimulus could improve the outlook for the United States, but the chances of that are unlikely to be determined until after the Nov. 3 U.S. election. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the White House would withdraw from stimulus negotiations until after the election. He later pulled back, saying he would support a few stand-alone bills.
Fiscal policy will also play a key role in whether the Federal Reserve will hit its inflation target in the near term. The central bank earlier this year said it planned to allow inflation to run above target for a period of time in order to average 2%.

""While central banks including the Fed have the means to provide a backstop for asset markets in times of crisis, credibly achieving their inflation targets requires a tool they cannot control: fiscal policy.""

The bank resumed job cuts in early August after it paused layoffs in March because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Wells Fargo said in July it would launch a broad cost-cutting initiative this year as the bank braces for massive loan losses caused by the pandemic and continues to work through expensive regulatory and operational problems tied to a long-running sales scandal.

Wells Fargo has cut 700 jobs as part of workforce reductions that could ultimately impact ""tens of thousands"" of staff, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday citing people with knowledge of the matter.
At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic last spring, the heads of large U.S. banks including  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and others had pledged not to cut any jobs in 2020. 
However, as executives prepare for an extended recession and loan losses that come with it, layoffs are back on the table.

Ruminant livestock such as cattle and sheep produce methane as a byproduct while digesting fibrous plant material. Methane accounts for 20% of global emissions and scientists have been working for years to reduce the amount of the gas released by cattle.
Chevron U.S.A. and Brightmark LLC said their investments in the new venture, Brightmark RNG Holdings LLC, will fund the construction of required infrastructure and commercial operation of dairy biomethane projects across multiple U.S. states.
Chevron will purchase the renewable natural gas produced from the JV's projects and market it for use in vehicles that run on compressed natural gas, the companies said.
The latest move underscores a shift in investor demand, with increased pressure in recent years on fossil fuel companies, including Chevron, to reduce emissions, spend more on low-carbon energy and make disclosures on the impact of fossil fuel production on climate change.
""We are increasing renewables in support of our business, making targeted investments and establishing partnerships as we evaluate emerging sources of energy and the role they will play in our portfolio,"" said Andy Walz, president of Americas products for Chevron.

Chevron is also part of another renewable natural gas JV, CalBioGas LLC, that last month announced its first successful production from dairy farms in Kern County.

The cash burn depleted more than a third of the company's cash reserves as of March 2019, after the COVID-19 pandemic-led plunge in global travel hurt Airbnb's balance sheet that had already been weakened by huge spending on hiring and marketing, according to the report.

With millions of tourists canceling plans for vacations, work trips and family visits, Airbnb had earlier said it was allocating $250 million to help offset losses incurred by hosts.
In late March, it suspended its marketing activities to save $800 million in 2020 and informed workers that its founders would take no salary for the next six months, while top executives would take a 50% cut.

Airbnb declined to comment.

Fighting between ethnic Armenian and Azeri forces over the Nagorno-Karabakh region erupted on Sept. 27 and has since escalated to its deadliest level since the 1990s.
The clashes have not affected energy supplies from the region but have put energy markets on edge.
Azerbaijan said late on Tuesday that it thwarted missile attacks in the vicinity of the oil pipelines including the BTC, which accounts for about 80% of Azeri oil pipeline exports, carrying more than 500,000 barrels of oil per day.
Armenia has denied it targeted the energy infrastructure.
""We are especially worried about yesterday's reports of a missile attack, which was intercepted and destroyed by Azerbaijan's air defence systems in the vicinity of BTC and SCP (South Caucasus Pipeline) export pipelines,"" BP said in a statement.

""While the security of all assets which BP operates on behalf of the Azerbaijan government and our partners is provided by the Azerbaijani government, we continue to work closely with the relevant authorities in an effort to take necessary measures to provide the protection of our personnel, operations and assets.""

162,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>","Who's afraid of Big Oil? Not us, says German renewables firm wpd","By Christoph Steitz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Wpd, which owns Germany's second-largest pipeline of renewable energy projects, says its manageable scale and decades of experience make it well-placed to fend off looming competition from oil majors entering the sector.
Facing pressure from shareholders worried about the climate impact of fossil fuel and from a fall in oil and gas markets linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, oil majors, including  BP  (L:BP) and Shell (L:RDSa), are seeking to accelerate a portfolio shift towards greener fuel.
Hartmut Broesamle, wpd's chief operating officer, said that is easier said than done.
""Onshore wind is a small-scale and labour-intensive business. You can't do that out of a large corporate headquarters,"" he told Reuters.
""You need people on the ground who believe in the cause or experts with a lot of experience in the area of wildlife conservation,"" he said, adding it took decades to build these teams.
Founded in 1996, wpd has grown its pipeline of onshore, offshore and solar projects to 19.85 gigawatts, making it Germany's second-biggest after that of RWE (DE:RWEG).
The group, which is co-owned by its two founders, is active in 25 countries, with France, Germany, Sweden and Taiwan among the largest markets.
""The oil majors' market entry is driving the sector. I'm happy about every additional euro that flows into renewables and not into developing new oil fields,"" Broesamle said.
But in financial terms, interest from the sector has not grown materially, he said, adding it was the established players - pension funds, insurers, municipal utilities and mid-sized energy firms - looking to invest more.
Wpd runs and owns most of its projects, with the exception of offshore wind, where co-investors are needed for expenditure of usually more than 1 billion euros ($1.18 billion) per farm.
Wpd, which financial sources say is worth 4-5 billion euros, is selling assets in Canada, Finland and Sweden to fund growth, Broesamle said, adding the U.S. offshore market was not attractive due to very high prices for wind territory.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>",Hedge funds make pandemic bet on insurance,"By Maiya Keidan and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Five years after London-based hedge fund Toscafund ditched the shares it held in insurance companies, the $3.5 billion firm and its peers are flocking back, drawn by sharp premium increases which are lifting the sector's post-coronavirus prospects. 
Insurers faced a surge in claims spanning trade credit to event cancellations as a result of the pandemic. Some have pulled out of unprofitable lines of business but for those who remain, the crisis has led to a steep rise in premiums, or a so-called ""hardening"" of the market, typical after a period of heavy losses. 
Commercial insurance rates https://tmsnrt.rs/3nuB046 rose 19% year-on-year in the April-June quarter, says Marsh, the world's largest insurance broker, the most since the firm started compiling data in 2012.
(Graphic: Global commercial insurance premiums (% change) - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONVIRUS/INSURANCE/xegpbjdeypq/chart.png)
Insurance was a successful part of Toscafund's portfolios after 2012 as companies shelved expansion plans and started returning capital to shareholders, but that trade had faded by 2015, said Nigel Gliksten, a partner at the fund.
Now though, the sector looks more attractive.
""We've gone back into insurance this year. We've got (about) 15% weighting in the sector from stocks that we think will benefit from a significant hardening,"" Gliksten said, adding that the pandemic had changed pricing levels ""meaningfully"". 
Share prices have yet to reflect a shift in prospects. A European insurance sub-index is down 25% this year, its worst performance since 2009. Lancashire and RenaissanceRe, two major holdings in Toscafund's long-short equity fund, still trade at end-May lows, with year-to-date losses of more than 10%.
Funds such as Copper Street Capital are also betting that will change. Its founding partner and chief investment officer, Jerry Del Missier told Reuters he had recently hired an insurance analyst to start at the end of the year.
The recent shocks would throw up ""challenges and opportunities"" in insurance, he predicted.
NEW PRODUCTS FOR THE NEW NORMAL
Investors reckon that in a world where virus outbreaks and climate disasters may be the new normal, innovative new insurance products such as those providing relief during future lockdowns or when staff sickness hinders business, will prove lucrative. [nL4N2E73C3]
Even while share prices remain subdued, insurers' debt sales for the most part have been oversubscribed this year, thanks to strong credit quality, typically in the single-A category. 
Alex Eventon, portfolio manager at London-based Resco Asset Management said he also saw higher-yielding restricted tier 1 (RT1) subordinated debt as ""an interesting asset class for macro guys like ourselves"", though he declined to provide details.
Issuers of RT1 debt this year include Ageas, Legal & General and Phoenix.
Meanwhile, hedge funds are also said by insurance industry sources to be piling into catastrophe bonds -- securities issued by insurers, sovereigns and others to insure against climate risk or natural disasters. 
While bondholders don't get paid in the event of a natural catastrophe, hedge funds are attracted to the high-yielding debt, according to one insurance official whose firm issued such a bond. 
Global catastrophe bond issuance hit $6.5 billion in the first half of 2020, surpassing 2019 full-year issuance by 20%, according to insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON). 
RISKS TURNING 
Hedge fund managers say insurance markets started to turn in late spring but it's only now that COVID-19 risks are clearing. 
U.S. courts have begun ruling on business interruption cases -- brought by those whose insurers declined to compensate for pandemic disruption -- and a British test case, though headed for appeal courts, could provide more clarity. [nL8N2GT4DC]
""Maybe people are feeling more comfortable now with those risks, while also getting the pricing,"" one hedge fund manager said.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>",Emerging market bond recovery masks post-Covid challenges ahead,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - A rebound in emerging market credit spreads to near pre-coronavirus crisis levels belies a bumpy pace of economic recovery ahead as the hangover from the virus threatens to linger into next year for many countries.
Even as many economies hope to claw back lost momentum, investors are wary of the outlook in the coming months amid uncertainty over the U.S. presidential election and further waves of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Everything has really tightened by a lot, not fully indiscriminately but almost, and we see that that's not reflecting enough the very diverse situation we have in EM markets,"" said Jean-Baptiste Berthon, senior strategist at Lyxor Asset Management.
After widening to around 700 basis points in the wake of the market hit caused by the virus, spreads of emerging market hard currency debt, as measured by the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) EM USD Aggregate Total Return Index, have narrowed to about 30 basis points from pre-crisis levels. The JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) EMBI Global Diversified index <.JPMEGDR> has also retraced most its losses.
The trajectory for bond spreads has been less severe and with a faster recovery than during the global financial crisis, Berthon said. Spreads were around 30-40 basis points above their relative value, he added.
(Graphic: Emerging dollar bond revival - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwjnkdpw/Capture.PNG)
That partly reflects optimism afforded by an economic recovery led by China and other countries in Asia, which mostly got to grips with the ravages of the virus earlier and faster.
Some of that hopefulness may be misplaced, with the IIF warning that the absence this time of the huge stimulus China unleashed in 2009 was weighing on the global outlook and capital flows to emerging markets.
At a time when bond buying by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other developed central banks should be supportive of riskier assets, outflows from emerging markets towards the end of September were almost as big as during risk-off episodes like the 2013 ""taper tantrum"" or the 2015 Chinese yuan devaluation.
GRIM READINGS
But investors are worried about bumps in the road.
BofA said that it remains tactically cautious on EM near-term due to the U.S. elections and the second wave of Covid-19.
The post-summer correction in the asset class could lead to the benchmark sovereign hard-currency index widening by another 30-50 basis points, BofA's David Hauner told Reuters.
Recent data has further underlined the uneven pace of economic performance since the pandemic.
While third-quarter GDP shrank about 1% to 2% for Turkey and Poland, close to a V-shaped recovery, Hungary and South Africa could record GDP dips of around 9%, UBS noted in a recent report.
South America's latest readings are even worse, with the economy contracting 11.3% in Chile in August and 13.2% in Argentina in July.
""South Africa, Turkey and Hungary have fairly little fiscal space left to stimulate the economy in case of an adverse shock,"" Gyorgy Kovacs, UBS economist, wrote of emerging EMEA.
Even as growth returns, governments will face dilemmas about how to finance budget deficits that have swollen from pre-pandemic levels. Moody's (NYSE:MCO) expects government debt in the largest economies will rise by almost 10 percentage points of GDP on average by the end of 2021 from 2019 levels, driven mainly by wider deficits.
Indonesia's central bank has snapped up around 183.48 trillion rupiah ($12.5 billion) of government bonds and could buy more next year.
Investors are wondering how generous other central banks might be. 
""Yes, there will be help from the Fed with their very loose monetary policy, but whether or not central banks will need to help out a little bit more will be a question for next year that could cause some divergence,"" said a fund manager who asked to remain anonymous.
Investors will remain on the lookout for progress or setbacks in fighting the virus and for the outcome of the U.S. election.
""If there is a vaccine at some point, and the U.S. elections will ultimately pass, it is high-yield credit as well as FX which has room to perform,"" said Hauner.

165,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>","For an Economic Crisis, This Is Not Such a Bad IPO Market","(Bloomberg) -- Europe may be staring down the barrel of its worst recession in living memory, but its market for initial public offerings has held up well thus far, all things considered.
“This is a very healthy IPO market given that we are in an economic recession,” said Manuel Esteve,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc’s head of equity capital markets for continental Europe.
IPOs worth about $21.3 billion have been announced across Europe this year, which is only a 9% drop from the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In contrast, past financial shocks such as the aftermath of the dot-com bubble in early 2000s, the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the European debt crisis that followed saw yearly proceeds drop by more than 60%, the data show.
Still, beneath the surface, the picture is uneven. Offerings with a touch of technology or sustainability have been particularly sought after by investors, while companies in more traditional sectors have been a tougher sell, with some recent listings falling flat.
Military supplier Hensoldt AG, Russia’s state-owned tanker operator Sovcomflot OAO and Lithuania’s state-owned electric utility AB Ignitis Grupe have all priced their offerings at the bottom end of marketed ranges. Camper-van maker Knaus Tabbert AG, China Yangtze Power Co. and Czech firearms producer Ceska Zbrojovka Group SE scaled back the size of their offerings amid lackluster demand. None of these stocks rose in their debuts.
And Europe still trails far behind the booming IPO markets in the U.S. and Asia, which are seeing a rush of blockbuster deals like Snowflake Inc. and Ant Financial’s record-breaking planned float.
Small Window
More than half of this year’s IPO proceeds in Europe have been raised over the past month alone, with Poland’s Allegro.eu SA and Britain’s THG Holdings Ltd. selling shares worth billions of dollars as consumers, largely stuck indoors while the pandemic rages on, turn to online shopping. Allegro priced its share sale at the top of a marketed range and increased the deal size, while THG’s fixed-price offering led to one of London’s best IPO pops in two years.
Yet, just as listings began to gather steam in Europe after months of inactivity, spiking coronavirus infections roiled equity markets, creating a trickier environment to pitch IPOs and for new stocks to start trading.
“Investors are gravitating toward big, liquid situations whereas the smaller transactions, in less mainstream sectors are more uncertain,” Esteve said, adding that the IPO market is “very much alive” with a strong pipeline of candidates.
For companies looking to float this year only a tight gap remains, with the hotly-contested U.S. presidential election in November curtailing the listing window. There will likely be a few IPOs in Europe before that, with uncertainty in the broader market prompting companies to accelerate processes, said Edward Sankey, HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) Plc’s global head of equity capital markets.
There are unlikely to be a large number of listings, according to Sankey, who said that a number will “drift” into 2021, as others have due to the pandemic.
Academic publisher Springer Nature is said to have postponed what would have been Germany’s biggest IPO in more than a year, Bloomberg reported. And it’s not the only one to cite market conditions in calling off listings. Commercial real estate firm Epic Suisse AG said last week it’s shelved a planned float in Zurich, while serial dealmaker Martin Franklin is not going ahead with a London share sale for a new blank-check company.

167,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 08:41AM ET</span>",UAE-Israel accord could bring new sparkle to Dubai diamond trade,"By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - The week that Israel and the United Arab Emirates normalised ties, Israeli diamond trader Zvi Shimshi headed to the United Arab Emirates to open a company in Dubai, a regional trade hub that is a major centre for the precious stones.
He is among 38 Israelis whom the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), home to Dubai Diamond Exchange, said have recently contacted it to set up a presence, in a sign of how shifting regional politics could alter global trade dynamics.
Traders in Dubai say they have been inundated with enquiries from Israelis, who traditionally trade in Belgium's Antwerp -- the world's biggest centre for traders of rough and polished diamonds.
South African company Trans Atlantic Gems Sales (TAGS), which auctions and tenders diamonds in Dubai, had close to 50 Israeli firms interested in participating in tenders register with the company in just a few weeks, said owner Anthony Peters.
""It's a massive game changer,"" Peters told Reuters.
Dubai, with $21.2 billion in diamonds traded last year according to DMCC, and Israel, with around $12 billion according to its exchange, are the Middle East's main diamond centres.
Before last month's U.S.-brokered accords that saw the UAE and Bahrain become the first Arab states in a quarter century to establish formal ties with Israel, trade between the centres was small and discreet due to regional political sensitivities.
Transactions were processed through third countries or risked being stopped by UAE banks if Israeli links were spotted. 
""This is a big opportunity for any young Israeli that wants to start any business in Dubai, not only the diamond business,"" Shimshi, 41, told Reuters.
Like in past visits over the last decade, Shimshi entered the Gulf Arab state on a German passport but has filed company registration documents using his Israeli passport and said he plans to move his business activity to Dubai.
The UAE has scrapped a law banning trade with Israel and Emirati and Israeli officials have touted significant economic opportunities created by the opening, which will also allow direct flights between the two countries.
""You will see traders from Israel coming to Dubai to buy diamonds in droves,"" said David Zabinsky, chief executive of Dubai diamond services company TRIGEM, who said the firm has been fielding ""countless"" calls from Israelis.
MISSING LINK
Dubai, mainly a centre for rough diamonds, has grown its industry from some $3 million in 2000 by leveraging its proximity to Africa, where many diamonds are mined, and India, where 90% of the world's diamonds are polished. 
""The missing link here in Dubai was the Israeli presence,"" said Alex Peterfreund, the Dubai managing director of Antwerp-headquartered diamond trader Espeka.
""I don’t see a reason (now) why people will organise tenders in Antwerp rather than Dubai,"" he added.
Tenders have in the past been organised in Antwerp in part so Israelis could participate. 
Antwerp, which saw total diamond trade of $37.1 billion last year according to the Antwerp World Diamond Centre (AWDC), has kept its share of the rough diamond market steady since 2017, Kimberley Process figures show, while Dubai's share has risen. 
The UAE is the third biggest trading hub for rough diamonds after Belgium and India. Israel and China round out the top five.
""Dubai and India are taking market share from other places like China and Israel – but they're not taking it away from Antwerp,"" said Karen Rentmeesters, head of communications and industry relations at the AWDC. ""Antwerp's expertise is still unrivalled.""
Rentmeesters said Dubai is a rival in terms of rough diamond trade, and looser regulations and the ease of setting up a company could be a draw, but she did not see Dubai overtaking Antwerp.
In terms of polished diamonds, Rentmeesters said the value of polished trade through Dubai has been falling since 2012.
(Graphic: https://graphics.reuters.com/ISRAEL-GULF/EMIRATES-DIAMONDS/nmopawabapa/ )
GOLDEN GATE
DMCC figures show Dubai imported $4.2 billion of polished diamonds in 2018, down from $7.3 billion in 2012 – and exported $3.96 billion in 2018 compared to $5.35 billion in 2012.
""Dubai has an opportunity to develop as a global diamond trading network for polished, and open up channels to the rest of the Arab world for diamonds and jewellery,"" said Martin Rapaport, the chairman of Rapaport Group. 
For Israel, in which there is a substantial market for polished stones, Dubai offers closer links to India and connects it to the Arab world, where most countries still do not have formal ties with the Jewish state.
""We see Dubai as a golden gate,"" Israel Diamond Exchange President Yoram Dvash told Reuters.
Ezra Boaron, who owns Israeli manufacturing factory Rising Star Diamonds, agreed: ""The entire Arab world passes through Dubai. It's a giant market.""
It could take time for a visible shift, especially due to COVID-19 which had slammed the industry with closures of mines, offices and retailers around the world.
In Dubai, coronavirus restrictions have largely been lifted and activity in the diamond exchange is back, but another wave of infections has taken Israel into a second lockdown.
Dubai Diamond Exchange Chairman Ahmed bin Sulayem is optimistic: ""We will see the business grow a bit more and more in the coming months.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday but Wall Street looked set to recover some of its losses from the previous session, with confusion over U.S. stimulus plans and uncertainty about the Nov. 3 presidential election dominating markets.
Trump broke off talks with Democrats in a tweet on Tuesday, saying that negotiations will stop until after the election, when he promised a major stimulus bill if he wins.
The news quickly rattled Wall Street but Asian investors became less concerned overnight on the grounds that whoever wins the election will still introduce a fiscal stimulus bill.
European indexes fell, with the STOXX 600 down 0.2% at 1117 GMT (STOXX), Germany's DAX down 0.4% and London's FTSE 100 broadly flat on the day (FTSE).
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries and had climbed to a three-week high before the stimulus talks were cancelled, was down 0.1%.
But U.S. stock futures pointed to Wall Street recovering some losses, with S&P 500 futures up 0.6% (ESc1) and Nasdaq futures up 0.5% , helped by later tweets by Trump where he called for more fiscal support.
""Even if a pre-election deal cannot be reached, Biden's widening lead in the election polls is making it likelier that more substantial stimulus can eventually be agreed on,"" UBS strategists wrote in a note to clients.
A poll on Monday showed Democrat Joe Biden with his widest lead in a month, as a majority of Americans said Trump could have avoided coronavirus.
Trump's tweets came shortly after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated warnings about the economic recovery, saying that the U.S. economy could slip into a downward spiral if the coronavirus is not controlled and growth sustained.
German industrial output fell unexpectedly in August, indicating that the recovery from the coronavirus recession in Europe's largest economy could be less powerful than hoped.
""Ultimately, we’re still in this situation that’s been really running for some time. UK and European markets have gone nowhere since May/June and the U.S. isn’t making an enormous amount of progress now,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
""You’ve got the irresistible force on one side of fiscal and monetary stimulus and on the other side you’ve got the pandemic, the recession and uncertainty over what the shape of the recovery’s going to be,"" he added.
The dollar - which initially rose when the talks in Washington were cancelled - fell on Wednesday, down 0.1% against a basket of currencies at 93.732 at 1122 GMT (=USD). [nL8N2GY1E5]
Minutes from the Fed's September meeting will be published at 1800 GMT. 
The pound was down 0.1% at $1.2859, buffeted by headlines about Brexit negotiations. Ireland's foreign minister said he still believed a trade deal between Britain and the European Union can be reached but that fishing rights remain a big obstacle.
U.S. Treasury yields rose and the yield curve, which had flattened after Trump's tweet cancelling stimulus talks, steepened again.
The spread between two and ten-year U.S. treasuries edged back towards recent four-month peaks .
""I would put the recent yield curve steepening down to the perceived increased likelihood of a Democratic ‘clean sweep’ and this resulting in a more significant fiscal stimulus bill being approved,"" said Mark Holman, CEO and portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management.
""The upshot of this is an injection into the economy, which of course is good news for the markets and positive for risk assets in general,"" he added.
Oil prices extended their decline. With West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures down 3% cents at $39.47 a barrel by 1132 GMT (CLc1).
Gold was up 0.4% at 1133 GMT, at $1,884.58 per ounce .
The benchmark 10-year Bund yield was up around 2 basis points at -0.489% (DE10YT=RR).

170,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: OxyContin maker Purdue nears guilty plea agreement in U.S. criminal probe - sources,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Purdue Pharma LP, the OxyContin maker controlled by members of the wealthy Sackler family, is nearing an agreement to plead guilty to criminal charges as part of a broader deal to resolve U.S. Justice Department probes into its alleged role in fueling the nation’s opioid crisis, six people familiar with the matter said.
Purdue lawyers and federal prosecutors are brokering a plea deal that could be unveiled as soon as within the next two weeks and include billions of dollars of financial penalties, four of the people said. They stressed that talks are fluid and that some of the terms could change as discussions continue.
In addition to the criminal case, U.S. prosecutors are negotiating a settlement of civil claims also carrying a financial penalty that allege unlawful conduct in Purdue's handling of prescription painkillers, they said.
The Stamford, Connecticut-based company is expected to face penalties exceeding $8 billion. They consist of a roughly $3.54 billion criminal fine, $2 billion criminal forfeiture and $2.8 billion civil penalty, some of the people familiar with the negotiations said. 
They are unlikely to be paid in the near term as the criminal fine and civil penalty are expected to be considered alongside other claims in Purdue's bankruptcy proceedings and the company lacks necessary funds to fully repay all creditors.
The tentative agreement would draw a line under Purdue's criminal exposure for what prosecutors and state attorneys general have described as aggressive marketing of a highly-addictive painkiller that minimized the drug's potential for abuse and overdosing.
Over the years, Purdue reaped billions of dollars in profits from its opioids, enriching Sackler family members and funneling illegal kickbacks to doctors and pharmacies, federal prosecutors and state attorneys general have alleged. The company now faces thousands of lawsuits seeking damages to address a public health crisis that has ravaged U.S. communities.
Purdue said it is cooperating with the investigations and in discussions to resolve them, but declined further comment. Representatives of Sackler family members controlling Purdue had no immediate comment or did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They have denied allegations that they contributed to the opioid crisis.
A Justice Department spokeswoman said it does not generally comment on investigations or settlement discussions, but added that Reuters’ understanding of the situation ""contains inaccuracies and is highly misleading"" without elaborating further. 
The Justice Department is prepared to waive a large portion of its $2 billion forfeiture claim as long as Purdue meets certain conditions. The first is that Purdue steer significant financial sums for combating the opioid epidemic to U.S. communities suing it over the crisis, two people said. The other is that it receive court approval for a reorganization plan transforming it into a ""public benefit company"" run on behalf of those communities and no longer controlled by the Sacklers.
Purdue, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year facing an onslaught of litigation, is in discussions to plead guilty to charges that include conspiracy, violations of an anti-kickback law and misbranding under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, two of the people said. A plea agreement would require approval of Purdue's bankruptcy judge. One of the negotiated terms of Purdue's proposal to settle thousands of other opioid lawsuits is that it resolve the Justice Department probes.
SACKLERS UNLIKELY TO FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES
Members of the Sackler family, many of whom previously served on Purdue’s board and also face lawsuits, will avoid criminal charges in the looming settlement, the two people said. 
Certain family members are in discussions to pay a roughly $225 million civil penalty for allegedly causing false claims regarding Purdue's prescription painkillers to be filed with government healthcare  programs, three people said. That would be on top of $3 billion the Sacklers have offered to settle other lawsuits.
The current settlement under discussion does not resolve any future criminal liability the Sacklers or other individuals may face.
The Justice Department is continuing a criminal probe of some Sackler family members and other individuals associated with Purdue, though it remains unclear whether charges will materialize, one person said.
Details of the Justice Department settlement, including when it will be unveiled and the financial penalties, also remain in flux. They hinge in part on the outcome of separate negotiations among Purdue, the Sacklers, state attorneys general and others to resolve widespread litigation as part of mediation in the company’s bankruptcy proceedings, individuals familiar with the talks said. 
Some state attorneys general, including those in Massachusetts and New York, have demanded the Sacklers disclose additional details of their finances and pay more than the $3 billion they offered to settle lawsuits. 
They are likely to scrutinize the size of the family's Justice Department penalty. The Sacklers are poised to receive a legal release should a bankruptcy judge approve a broader settlement, shielding them from future civil, though not criminal, claims. 
Purdue's bankruptcy has shielded, through an injunction, the company and Sackler family members until at least March 2021 from thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities, counties and others seeking to hold them responsible for allegedly flooding communities with opioid painkillers that contributed to widespread addiction and fatal overdoses. The company and family deny the allegations.
The Sacklers controlling Purdue themselves have not filed for bankruptcy. That has drawn criticism from states arguing litigation against family members should proceed to hold them accountable for the opioid crisis. 
The outcome of settlement talks among Purdue, its owners and litigants will help determine how much money U.S. communities receive to address the toll from opioids.
In earlier filings made as part of Purdue's bankruptcy case, federal prosecutors alleged the company at times paid doctors and pharmacies illegal kickbacks between 2010 and 2018 to encourage medically unnecessary opioid prescriptions, resulting in fraudulent claims to government healthcare programs, such as Medicare.

Purdue has offered to settle widespread litigation in a deal it values at more than $10 billion, much of it linked to drugs under development to treat addiction and combat overdoses. One contentious aspect of the proposal is that some of the funds would come from continued OxyContin sales.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's  AirAsia X Bhd  (KL:AIRX), the long-haul arm of AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA), said it wanted to restructure $15.3 billion of debt and slash its share capital by 90% to continue as a going concern.
Hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic as closed borders have grounded most of its planes, the budget airline said it had severe liquidity constraints and, with no return to normalcy in sight, added, ""Imminent default of contractual commitments will precipitate a potential liquidation.""
Its statement late on Tuesday came just days after Malaysia Airlines, the other major carrier, said it was very low on cash and had reached out to lessors, creditors and suppliers for urgent restructuring.
AirAsia X is seeking to reconstitute 63.5 billion ringgit ($15.3 billion) of debt into a principal amount of 200 million ringgit and waiver of the rest.
That debt restructuring as well as a revamp of its business model would be needed to raise fresh equity and debt, which in turn would be required to restart the airline, it said.
The statement did not break down the liabilities or name the airline's creditors.
AirAsia X declined to respond to a Reuters' query regarding its debt.
The hefty debt could include aircraft orders, potentially spelling cancellations, said an aviation analyst who declined to be identified as he no longer covers the company.
""A lot of that may be aircraft orders,"" he said. ""The real haircut may not be that huge if it's purely on actual debt and lease commitments.""
AirAsia X finalised orders with Airbus SE (PA:AIR) for 78 A330neo and 30 A321XLR planes last year, but said in February it would defer delivery of the A330neo planes and consider other changes to trim its fleet.
The airline is Airbus' biggest customer for the A330neo.
It also proposed reducing issued share capital by 90% and consolidating every 10 existing ordinary shares into one share. Long a penny stock, its shares fell 10% to 4.5 Malaysian cents on Wednesday.
The airline, which reported a record net loss of 650.3 million ringgit in the 2019 financial year, said unaudited records as of June 30 showed it had a shareholder equity deficit of 960 million.
Liabilities of 3.38 billion ringgit exceeded assets of 1.39 billion.
It has appointed board member Lim Kian Onn, a chartered accountant and former banker, as deputy chairman to lead the restructuring, which will involve overhauling its route network, fleet size, cost base and workforce.

As part of the deal, Momentus will get $172.5 million from Stable Road and $175.0 million from other private equity investors.
The California-based startup sells in-space shuttle services that help move satellites between orbits. The combined company will be listed on Nasdaq under the symbol ""MNTS"" after the deal closes.
A blank-check firm, also known as a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), is a shell company which raises cash in an IPO with the goal of buying an unidentified private company, usually within two years, in a deal which would then take the acquired company public.
This year, a number of companies have preferred to go public through the SPAC route, as opposed to a traditional IPO.
Once confined to the backwaters of capital markets, SPACs emerged this year as a major driver of IPOs, led by splashy deals for the likes of space tourism company Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc and fantasy sports and gambling company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - French oil group  Total  (PA:TOTF) is launching the sale of its resins business as it streamlines activities to free up cash to invest in renewable energy, people close to the matter said. 
The company is working with  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) as its adviser for the sale of operations featuring the Cray Valley brand, they said, adding the unit could be valued at 500-600 million euros ($588-705 million), including debt, in a deal. 
Total is expected to send out information packages on the unit in the coming weeks to prospective buyers, mainly private equity firms, the people said. 
Total and Credit Suisse declined to comment. 
Total said last week it was planning to hike annual investments in renewable energy and electricity by 50% and cut its reliance on oil, emulating European rivals in a bid to become a major low-carbon power producer.
Faced with gloomy long-term prospects for oil demand, Total has been accelerating a push into alternative sources of revenue, with a particular focus on providing electricity and expanding its renewable energy business.
Total, on track for $1 billion in savings this year, is focussing on cost cuts at its operations rather than layoffs.
Cray Valley makes speciality chemical additives, hydrocarbon speciality chemicals, and liquid and powder tackifying resins used as ingredients in adhesives, rubbers, polymers, coatings, and other materials. 
The products are used in the energy, printing, packaging, construction, tyre manufacturing and electronics industries.

174,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 07:27AM ET</span>",Arabtec collapse shakes foundations of Gulf construction business,"By Hadeel Al Sayegh and Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Just over six years ago, Dubai-listed  Arabtec  Holding (DU:ARTC) had investors eating out of its hands. 
At a lavish shareholder meeting at Abu Dhabi's St. Regis (NYSE:RGS) Hotel, the contractor that helped build the world's tallest skyscraper, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, outlined plans for listings in London, Hong Kong and New York. 
Those plans never materialised. After capital injections between 2013 and 2017, management changes, layoffs and rounds of restructurings, Arabtec's shareholders, which include Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala, decided last week that the Gulf's largest listed contractor should file for insolvency.
Arabtec had around $2.75 billion in total liabilities at the end of June, including almost $500 million in bank borrowing.
The liquidation, likely to lead to further layoffs in a company which had a 40,000 strong workforce at the end of last year, marks the end of an era of plentiful construction for local contractors. 
""A great company that is 45 years old disappeared off the face of the earth. I find it extremely sad that an iconic company like that disappeared,"" Ziad Makhzoumi, chief financial officer of Arabtec from September 2008 to March 2013, told Reuters.
The coronavirus, low oil prices and production cuts have battered the Gulf economies this year, but the collapse of construction giants like Arabtec and engineering group Drake & Scull International in the United Arab Emirates has deeper roots.
Industry sources, analysts, and bankers point to an unsustainable business model used by some contracting firms in the region.
They undercut competitors on pricing and sometimes cost a project at a discount to win a tender in the hopes of making a profit through additional work when it starts running.
STATE-BACKED CLIENTS
It's a model that works on the premise that supply from mostly state-backed clients will continue indefinitely, but that breaks down quickly when the money stops flowing.
""You have a client who can fill you with work, make you become 'galactic' and then in one minute for technical or even political reasons, if the state decides to, or is forced to, for economic reasons, to suspend or delay projects, there's no longer support. The whole house collapses, without foundations,"" said an industry source, who didn't wish to be named.
Arabtec did not respond to requests for comment. Drake & Scull International declined to comment.
In neighbouring Saudi Arabia, the Binladin group also struggled in recent years to collect payments from the government for projects, particularly during the last oil price crash in 2015. The country's biggest construction firm is now restructuring tens of billions of dollars of debt after the state took a 35% stake from Bin Laden family members that were swept up in an anti-graft campaign launched by Riyadh in late 2017.
There was no immediate reply from Binladin to a request for comment.
When the business model falters, the consequences are far reaching. Despite banks taking a more conservative approach to lending to contracting firms recently, their exposure to the sector remains problematic, analysts say.
""Contractors and companies in their supply chain are one of the main contributors to non-performing loans formation - since the 2015 drop in oil price and not just now - and we expect this trend to continue,"" said Mohamed Damak, senior director and global head of Islamic finance at S&P Global Ratings. 
'NOT A DIFFICULT BUSINESS'
""Contracting is not a difficult business, if you design, execute and manage on time, then you're in good shape,"" Makhzoumi said. ""If the customer doesn't pay on time ... then you have a problem."" 
Arabtec's decision to dissolve came after a first half loss of $216.18 million and total accumulated losses of nearly $400 million. The company said the pandemic hit projects and led to additional costs.
""Despite efforts to pursue legal and commercial entitlements and a restructuring of the company’s finances and operations, the situation in which Arabtec finds itself today is untenable,"" said Arabtec's chairman Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi, who is also deputy group chief executive at Mubadala.
Frequent payment delays by clients in the region have often put pressure on contracting firms, already bruised by Dubai’s 2008-2009 property market crash.
But cash flow issues were often overcome by running several projects at a time, assuming supply would continue indefinitely.
For Sachin Kerur, Middle East office managing partner at law firm Reed Smith, part of the problem is in the way contracts are awarded.
""The key is to provide contractors a proper and profitable playing field. Developers and procurers must learn to avoid awarding projects simply on a lowest price model. They must understand the life cycle costs and award projects to contractors on that basis.""
MARGINS
The collapse of Arabtec, which was hired to work on Dubai's Expo 2020 site, is poised to add further strain to the real estate sector and to local banks. 
Even before Arabtec had imploded, S&P Global Ratings had already downgraded two of the emirate’s biggest property firms to 'junk' status amid expectations that coronavirus containment measures would shrink Dubai's economy 11% this year.
Banks this year have been reluctant to give fresh credit to contractors amid the downturn, but Arabtec's liquidation could mean more losses ahead, said a Dubai-based banker.
Dubai's Mashreqbank (DU:MASB) is the most exposed lender, with a 353 million dirhams ($96.11 million) loan, Arqaam Capital said, estimating other banks could recover only 37% of their loan book. Mashreqbank declined to comment.
Large developers in the UAE will also be impacted, Arqaam said in a research note.
""Developer’s margins will likely be squeezed in new projects as we expect repricing of construction contracts in favor of contractors, as the existing business model of local contractors ... has proven unviable/insolvent,"" it said.

Parkin stepped down as HR head after a group of employees called for an investigation over her handling of racism at the company which she had described last year as ""noise"" only discussed in America.
Rajkumar, a 48-year-old British national, was most recently head of human resources for the Americas for BNP Paribas. She previously worked for JP Morgan for almost a decade. She will take up her new job at Adidas in 2021.
Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted said he hoped Rajkumar would help to strengthen diversity at the company and entrench its position as one of the most popular employers worldwide.
""We want to ... make Adidas a truly diverse, inclusive, people driven and equitable company,"" he said.
After the death of George Floyd in May prompted many brands to pledge action over racial inequality, Adidas promised to promote more Black and Latino staff and invest in Black communities.
The company also admitted it has not given enough credit in the past to the many prominent Black athletes and celebrities - like James Harden and Kanye West - as well as Black employees and consumers who have helped to make it successful.

Adidas said in August it had seen no impact on sales from the race row and expects a recovery in the third quarter assuming there are no new major lockdowns as it benefits from more people exercising and dressing down as they work from home.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday, recouping some of Tuesday’s sharp losses, helped by President Donald Trump seemingly shifting his stance on Federal support.
At 07:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 22 points, or 0.7%, higher, the Dow futures contract rose 198 points, or 0.7%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 65 points, or 0.6%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.3%, or 375 points, lower Tuesday, the S&P 500 was down 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%, after President Trump announced via a tweet that he had halted talks over a new coronavirus relief bill until after the election.
Trump terminated the stimulus talks less than 24 hours after he returned home after three nights in hospital suffering from Covid-19, with questions still being asked about his health.
However, in a series of tweets later Tuesday, the president rowed back on the idea of no stimulus, suggesting that Congress work on separate deals for $25 billion to help the airlines and another $135 billion for small businesses, as well as $1,200 direct stimulus checks.
This change in stance has helped investors recover some of their confidence after the sharp selloff. However, this piecemeal approach has been largely rejected by Democrats in the past, and given the heated political climate it’s unlikely they will look too favorably upon it now.
Sen. Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence are set to debate Wednesday evening, with the coronavirus pandemic likely to be front and center given the events of the last few days. This is expected to be the only debate between the two.
On the data front, the minutes from the last Federal Reserve rate-setting meeting are due to be published at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT). These are likely to be studied carefully, especially after Fed Chair Jerome Powell called for additional fiscal support during a speech Tuesday, saying too little stimulus is far worse than too much.
In the corporate sector, eyes will be on the tech sector after a report from the Democrat-led House panel called out the tech giants for their monopolistic powers, suggesting they should be forced to separate their dominant online platforms from other business lines.
Oil prices slumped Wednesday, weighed by a larger-than-expected build in crude oil supplies after the American Petroleum Institute reported a surge in U.S. oil inventories of 951,000 barrels last week.
Investors now await data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later Wednesday, while the path of Hurricane Delta in the Gulf of Mexico will also be carefully scrutinized.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.9% lower at $39.50 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.5% to $41.58.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1.1% to $1,887.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1760.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will scrap its exclusivity deals with TV and modem makers in a deal with EU antitrust regulators aimed at ending a year-long investigation without a finding of wrongdoing, the European Commission said on Wednesday.
The European Commission launched an investigation into the company in June last year and even threatened to issue an interim order, its first in almost two decades, to stop such practices while the probe was ongoing.
Broadcom, which makes chips to power smartphones, computers and networking equipment and is a major supplier to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), subsequently offered to end its exclusivity deals.
""Broadcom will suspend all existing agreements containing exclusivity or quasi-exclusivity arrangements and/or leveraging provisions concerning Systems-on-a-Chip (SoCs) for TV set-top boxes and Internet modems, and has committed not to enter into new agreements comprising such terms,"" the EU competition regulator said in a statement.
In Europe, Broadcom will not offer price or non-price incentives to TV and modem makers to buy a minimum number of its products nor tie such purchases to sales of other products.
On a worldwide level excluding China, it also pledged not to offer price or non-price incentives to TV and modem makers to buy more than 50% of its products nor tie such purchases to sales of other products for more than 50% of their products.

The concessions are valid for seven years.

179,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",StockBeat: BMW and Co. Rev up in Pursuit of Tesla,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Like many automakers, Bayerische Motorenwerke, or BMW, has had a rocky year. Sales figures out on Wednesday suggest however that not only is the worst past, but that it’s making vital progress in meeting the biggest challenge facing it.
BMW Group’s third-quarter sales report showed that it sold 47% more electric vehicles in the three months through September than it did a year earlier.  Momentum increased sharply in the summer, as the group sold 54,719 electrified BMWs and Minis, almost as much as it had done in the first two quarters combined. While the first-half numbers are obviously distorted by Covid-related shutdowns, the accelerating trend is still clear.
That number still leaves it producing less than half of what Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) produces in pure electric vehicles: Elon Musk’s company rattled off 139,000 units in the last quarter and its first-mover advantage in the fastest-growing segments of the automotive market seems secure for the foreseeable future.
All the same, BMW’s growth profile in EVs underlines a fact often overlooked by the stock market -  that Tesla doesn’t have the EV space to itself: all the big three German groups have accelerated their schedules for ramping up output of EVs in the last 12 months, and market pressure is likely to force them to be even more ambitious going forward. Only yesterday, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) put out new targets for EVs as a share of total output, and now expects them to be more than half of total sales by 2030.
While this is largely making a virtue out of necessity – new EU regulations mean that there are heavy fines for carmakers who fail to meet groupwide standards on emissions – there is little reason to think that a country with Germany’s academic and industrial capital will not be able to compete with Tesla in the long term.
But even in the short term, Tesla does not have the monopoly that its stock market valuation implies. Norway, for example, is Europe’s most mature EV market, and there, the Model 3 is outsold by Volkswagen’s new ID.3.  
Europe’s best-selling electric car is, in fact, the  Renault  (PA:RENA) Zoe, a fine example of what happens when generous cash-for-clunkers schemes are tailored to local manufacturers with strong local brands. Even in Germany, where disposable incomes are high and Musk’s reputation still higher, the Zoe outsold the Model 3 by some 60% in the first two months of the third quarter.
Tesla’s sales in Europe will naturally look very different when its new factory outside Berlin comes online, something that should happen in the second half of next year.  Tesla aims to produce 500,000 cars a year there ultimately, although it will have to sort out issue with water supply first.
But European – and Japanese and Korean – automakers are hardly rolling over for it. The more progress they make, the less they will pay Tesla for the credits that allow them to escape EU and U.S. emissions fines. At which point, investors will be able to get a truer picture of the underlying profitability of Tesla and its rivals."

For long haul, proponents say hydrogen-powered trucks have an advantage over electric rivals as they have a greater range and require less charging times but their uptake and mass production has been slow because they are expensive. 
However, a McKinsey study in January said that once relative efficiencies of the power sources and lifetime costs of a truck are factored in, green hydrogen could reach cost parity with diesel by 2030.
Hyundai has been partnering with Swiss companies to build a value chain covering the production of green hydrogen from hydropower, hydrogen charging stations and the service and maintenance of the trucks.
The customers, which include supermarket chain Migros, will be leasing the trucks from Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility (HHM) to transport goods around the country, backed by the new hydrogen infrastructure.
Leases are on a pay-per-use basis that does not require an initial investment. Hyundai plans to put 1,600 trucks on Swiss roads by 2025.
Its H2 Xcient trucks have a 190 kilowatt fuel cell stack and seven high-pressure tanks holding 32 kgs of hydrogen, giving them a range far further than comparable vehicles powered by electric batteries on the market now.
HHM was set up by Hyundai and Swiss startup H2 energy last year to partner with Hydrospider, a joint venture of H2 Energy, industrial gas maker Linde (NYSE:LIN) and Swiss power utility Alpiq.
Hyundai plans for production capacity of 2,000 units of Xcient fuel cells per year by 2021 to support its expansion plans as demand for clean transport grows.
It views Switzerland as a test case for hydrogen fuel cells in heavy goods transport, said In Cheol Lee, executive vice president and head of the commercial vehicle division at Hyundai Motor Company (OTC:HYMLF).
""With successful delivery of the first H2 Xcient fuel cell trucks, we proudly announce our plan to expand beyond Europe to North America and China, where we are already making great progress,"" he said.

In a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware court document, the company listed both assets and liabilities in the range of $100 million to 500 million.
Ruby Tuesday said it has reached an understanding with its lenders to support the restructuring, during which its restaurants will continue to operate, while it works to preserve the jobs of thousands of its employees.
""This announcement does not mean 'Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday,' Chief Executive Officer Shawn Lederman said in a statement.
""Today's actions will allow us an opportunity to reposition the company for long-term stability as we recover from the unprecedented impact of COVID-19."" 
Social distancing and other pandemic-related curbs have put pressure on the restaurant industry, pushing companies like CEC Entertainment, the parent of once-popular children-themed restaurant chain Chuck E. Cheese, and California Pizza Kitchen to file for bankruptcies.
Founded nearly half a century ago, Ruby Tuesday was a public company till 2017 when it was sold to private equity firm NRD Capital.
In the recent years, it has struggled amid an industry-wide decline in customer visits, particularly at full-service restaurants. 
It closed at least 118 stores from 2017 through 2019 and the chain's U.S. sales dropped by 13% to $721 million in 2018, according to consulting and research firm Technomic Inc.

Delta's winds reached 145 miles per hour (235 kph) as the storm sped toward Mexico's Yucatan peninsula and eventual entry into the Gulf of Mexico, whose warm waters will restore it to a Category 4 storm, the National Hurricane Center said. 
Oil producers had evacuated 57 production facilities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico by Tuesday and halted 540,000 barrels per day of oil and 232 million cubic feet per day of natural gas production. The region accounts for about 17% of U.S. oil output.
Delta is expected to strike the U.S. Gulf Coast on the weekend as the 10th named storm to make a U.S. landfall this year, eclipsing a record that has held since 1916. 
After weakening over the Yucatan, Delta is expected to restrengthen and grow into a massive storm. The ""significant increase in the size of Delta's wind field while it is over the Gulf of Mexico"" will drive a broad storm surge and wind threats to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the NHC said. 
Oil companies have had to evacuate workers repeatedly during this storm season. The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated the departures and returns, with some workers required to quarantine ashore and be tested for the virus before returning. 
Delta's evacuations are at least sixth time that some companies have had to remove staff and curtail production since June. 
W&T Offshore (N:WTI), one of the smaller Gulf of Mexico producers, estimated the storms cost it 9,000 barrels of oil and gas per day in the latest quarter, more than a fifth of its targeted output. 
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), the largest Gulf of Mexico offshore oil producer by volume, evacuated staff from nine facilities and is preparing to shut production at several.  Chevron  (N:CVX) was evacuating and shutting production on all its Gulf of Mexico platforms, and BP (NYSE:BP), BHP and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) also withdrew.

AccorInvest owns and operates hotels managed by the  Accor  group (PA:ACCP) and is present in 31 countries with 904 hotels, for brands including Ibis, Novotel and Mercure. In 2018, Accor opened AccorInvest's capital to sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors and kept a 30% minority stake. 
As hotels worlwide run at reduced capacity because of coronavirus-related travel limits, AccorInvest has proposed a financial restructuring to its banks and requested a 450 million euro state-guaranteed loan, Les Echos reported. 
Accor shares, which are down about 40% since the start of the year, fell another 1.3% on Wednesday.
Les Echos said AccorInvest has started talks with its 19 French banks and a mandate has been given to two court-appointed administrators.
The paper said that the banks are reluctant to agree to the company's request because it still has a comfortable cash position and because they want its deep-pocketed investors to take part in the restructuring effort.

""Aviation won't return to what it was before and business travel demand could even shrink further. One of our targets is tourism,"" Yuji Akasaka told a media briefing.
Japan Airlines' three low-cost regional carriers include Jetstar, which it operates with Qantas Airlines, (AX:QAN), Spring Airlines Japan, a joint venture with China's Spring Airlines (SS:601021), and its wholly owned ZIPAIR unit.
Akasaka did not say whether Japan would seek to formally merge their operations through acquisitions.
Japan Airlines, like other carriers, has been hammered by a collapse in international air travel to about a tenth of what it was before the coronavirus outbreak, but has seen domestic flight demand rebound helped by a government campaign to promote tourism. 
""The impact of that campaign has been significant and in late September going into October we are seeing traveler numbers increase to about 50% of what they were a year ago,"" Akasaka said.
To survive the downturn in demand, which Japan Airlines expects to last until at least 2024 on international routes, Akasaka said the carrier would look to boost revenue from non-airline businesses such as drone parcel deliveries.

Japan Airlines last month announced a tie-up with Matternet, to launch the U.S. company's urban drone logistics business in Japan. This year, it also invested in a German start up, Volocopter, that is developing air taxis.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Wednesday, as upbeat corporate earnings just outweighed the news that U.S. President Donald Trump ended negotiations over a new coronavirus aid package.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.1%.
President Donald Trump ended talks on Tuesday with Democrats on a new stimulus package, tweeting that after he wins the presidential election in November “we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business.” 
While this news hit Wall Street hard late Tuesday, European markets took the news more in their stride, taking in that Trump is still looking for a stimulus package if he wins next month (or pricing in the possibility of a 'Democratic sweep' that would make it easier to pass a new package).
""There are a couple of ways we still get stimulus,""  since both contenders are promising it, said ING's chief economist in Asia, Rob Carnell. ""But none of them occur before the election now."" 
""One way or another we're going to get some stimulus, it's just we're not going to get it now - so we'll tread water for a bit.""
Helping the tone in Europe have been some strong earnings. 
Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) stock climbed 2.4% after Britain's biggest supermarket chain reported a jump in its first-half profits by more than a quarter as online sales doubled during the pandemic.
Additionally, Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) jumped 3.5% after it forecast better-than-expected revenue in its third quarter.
Meanwhile, the total coronavirus cases approaches 39 million globally, with parts of Europe still suffering badly from a second wave of the virus, despite signs of the infection curve flattening again in countries such as Spain and Italy.
This fresh bout of Covid-19  risks delaying the euro zone's economic recovery, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Tuesday, and investors will be tuning in as she speaks again later Wednesday as the pressure rises on central bankers to act if fiscal stimulus is slow arriving.
The latest German industrial production release disappointed, falling 0.2% in August compared with the expected 1.5% gain. 
Oil prices slumped Wednesday, weighed by the reduced likelihood of a new coronavirus relief package as well as a larger-than-expected build in crude oil supplies.
The American Petroleum Institute reported a build in U.S. oil inventories of 951,000 barrels last week, compared with the 831,000-barrel draw expected, raising doubts about the recovery of demand in the country, the largest consumer of oil in the world.
Investors now await data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% lower at $40.15 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.9% to $42.25.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian billionaire James Packer said on Wednesday he ""forgot"" his casino firm  Crown  Resorts Ltd (AX:CWN) was banned from dealing with associates of Hong Kong's Stanley Ho when he orchestrated a part-buyout by a firm controlled by Ho's son.
Packer's actions as Crown's largest shareholder are being scrutinised as the New South Wales state government holds an inquiry to decide if the company should be allowed to go ahead with its A$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) casino tower in Sydney just months before its scheduled opening.
Under questioning, Packer acknowledged the company he founded agreed not to give Hong Kong casino magnate Ho or his associates any beneficial interest in Crown Resorts when it obtained clearance in 2014 to build the 75-floor tower.
However, Packer announced a sale last year of one-fifth of Crown to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd (O:MLCO), a company run by Ho's son Lawrence. On Wednesday, Packer said he assumed his lawyers would pick up any legal issues.
""I forgot, Mr Bell,"" Packer told the lawyer leading the inquiry, Adam Bell. ""I thought the legal work that the CPH team ... were preparing would cover all eventualities,"" he said, referring to his private company Consolidated Press Holdings.
Ho, who died in May aged 98, was banned from any involvement in Australian casinos amid widespread reports alleging links to organised crime, which he denied.
Melco ultimately bought half of the 20% Crown stake Packer had put up for sale - and subsequently sold it - and cancelled plans to buy the other half.
TURMOIL
Packer's evidence also covered a period when 16 staff were jailed in China in 2016 for violating anti-gambling laws, prompting an exit from foreign markets, while Packer himself stepped back from public view for personal reasons.
Testifying via videolink, Packer acknowledged requesting frequent trading updates at least from November 2018 through February 2019 and giving orders about the running of Crown despite holding no board or operational role since March 2018.
In a 2019 email read out by the inquiry, in the months before the Melco sale announcement, Packer wrote to then chief financial officer Ken Barton, ""you have had your heads in the sands this year. Make sure, for your own sake, we achieve the financial year 2020 plan"".
Packer denied the email was a threat and said, as a large shareholder, ""I was under the impression that I could communicate the way I was communicating.""
""I believed that I was fully aligned with Crown Resorts shareholders and that my requests were in all shareholders' best interests.""
In a November 2018 email to Crown's then chairman John Alexander read out to the inquiry, Packer gave permission for Alexander to cut costs and wrote, ""I'm over being Captain Good Guy to everyone. Go hard, you have my blessing.""

Packer continues giving evidence on Thursday.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), is in early discussions to buy a stake in supermarket chain Lulu Group International, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
It is in talks with Indian-born businessman Yusuff Ali, who founded Abu Dhabi-based Lulu, one of the largest chains in the Gulf region, the sources said.
Discussions between PIF and Lulu began four to six weeks ago, one of the sources said.
It was not immediately clear how big a stake PIF is seeking to buy as discussions are at an early stage, or whether the talks would lead to a final transaction.
Lulu operates shopping centres, hypermarkets and other businesses with an annual turnover of $7.4 billion, according to its website.
It has operations in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states as well as in Egypt, India, Indonesia and Malaysia.
PIF, which manages $360 billion in assets, declined to comment. Lulu's director of marketing & communications, V. Nandakumar, said in an emailed response that ""as a policy we never comment on market speculations and media rumours.""
Abu Dhabi state-owned holding company ADQ invested $1 billion in Lulu earlier this year, two sources familiar with the talks said. ADQ did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
PIF is seen as a driver of the kingdom's Vision 2030 plan to diversify the economy, with the authorities aiming to turn it into the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.
The Saudi government wants to expand the kingdom's retail sector as part of a drive to create one million jobs by 2020.
PIF invested $500 million in e-commerce venture Noon, which shortly afterwards began operations in Saudi Arabia. It also invested indirectly in the IPO of Saudi mall operator Arabian Centres (SE:4321) .
PIF was also approached by Reliance to buy a stake in the retail arm of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd.
The fund, whose board is chaired by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has become a more active investor since 2015, taking a $3.5 billion stake in Uber Technologies (N:UBER) and invested $45 billion in Softbank (OTC:SFTBY)'s inaugural technology fund.

(Reuters) - Foreigners turned net sellers of Asian equities after three consecutive months of buying as concerns over a resurgence of the coronavirus and a firmer U.S. dollar dimmed demand for riskier assets. 
Cross-border investors sold a combined net total of $6.5 billion worth of equities in Indian, Indonesian, Philippine, South Korean, Taiwanese, Thai and Vietnamese stocks in September, data from stock exchanges showed, marking their first monthly net selling since May. 
Equity flows into Asia have not really reverted since March, said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Socite Generale, adding that a correction in U.S. tech stocks and rising concerns over a resurgence of the virus in Europe affected flows last month.

""We need some catalysts, such as a breakthrough in terms of treatment/vaccine for COVID-19, dollar peaking, or some clear signs that the V-shape recovery of 3Q can be sustained into 4Q and beyond,"" he said.
Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management, said Asia's better handling of COVID-19 compared with developed markets could lure inflows in coming months. 
Tech-reliant South Korea and Taiwanese stocks saw bigger margin of regional outflows, which was triggered by a heavy sell-off in tech stocks in the United States.
Taiwan faced $2.5 billon worth of outflows, while South Korea saw $1 billion.
Indian and Indonesian equities faced outflows of $1 billion each due to worries over higher number of COVID-19 cases.
India's tally of cases stood at 6.76 million, as of Wednesday, which was second only to the United States, while Indonesia had at least 0.3 million infections.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Barclays  (L:BARC) plans to enter four new European private banking markets in 2021, its regional manager for the business told Reuters.
Gerald Mathieu, who in September became Barclays' private banking head for Europe outside Britain, said the British bank was looking to start up the business in France, Italy, Spain and Germany next year.
""These are the countries where we see a lot of opportunities, also because we have a very strong footprint of corporate and investment banking locally,"" Mathieu said in an interview. 
""The idea is to have a capital-light approach and work in very close collaboration with the investment bank locally, targeting family offices, ultra high net worth individuals, and some qausi-corporate or institutional clients.""
The bank said it was too early to disclose hiring plans.
Barclays, which does not separately report revenues or profits for private banking, maintains hubs for managing wealth in Europe in Monaco, Switzerland, and Ireland. 
It will grow activities in new European markets via its European Union-licensed platform in Dublin, Mathieu said, working together with local corporate and investment banking teams. 
Previously Barclays' country head for Switzerland, Mathieu said the bank had seen an inflow of clients into Switzerland as the market gained appeal amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Both the Swiss and broader European private banking business were seeing growth in managed assets, he said. But the COVID-19 pandemic and negative interest rates presented particular challenges to the business and industry as a whole.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 02:06AM ET</span>",Risk haunts Societe Generale's Oudea in elusive hunt for growth,"By Maya Nikolaeva
PARIS (Reuters) - Frederic Oudea promised Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) investors ""growth with lower risk"" after he became chief executive in 2008, the year a rogue trader lost billions in equity derivatives and brought the French bank close to collapse.
Fast forward a decade and SocGen's share price is at a record low and the bank's market capitalisation 78% lower than where it was when Oudea took over, after losses on complex investment products wiped out equity trading revenue in the first and second quarters of 2020.
""The current valuation of SocGen makes no sense,"" Oudea, whose term expires in 2023, told Reuters. 
The bank's share price, which closed up 6.7% at 12.2 euros on Tuesday, gives it a market capitalisation of about 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion), around a quarter of that of rival  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and half that of  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).
Oudea has responded to the latest set-back by overhauling the top management at France's third-largest largest bank and is once again focused on delivering lower risk growth.
The 57-year-old Parisian says that a revamped markets unit, coupled with an end to the European Central Bank's ban on dividend payments, which limits how banks can reward their shareholders, and a restructuring of SocGen's retail business can reverse the situation.
""The situation should be very different in three or four quarters,"" Oudea, who is the longest-serving current CEO of a major European bank, said during a meeting at SocGen's modernist twin tower offices in the La Defense district of Paris. 
""We have recently confirmed our guidance to deliver improved performances in the second half, in particular regarding our equity business, and have launched a promising study to create a new leading retail bank in France,"" he said.
In 2010, Oudea said lowering risk meant ""significantly reducing market risk"" and strengthening its risk department. He has since succeeded in bringing down SocGen's Value at Risk (VaR), a measure of its trading exposures or a maximum amount of daily losses that could happen with a 99% probability.
But while SocGen filings show its quarterly VaR fell to 23 million euros on average in 2019, from 25 million in 2013 and 35 million in 2010, this year's blow-out has left some investors and analysts uncertain whether Oudea is near to finishing the job.
""The two recent quarters were a vivid example that their business model is probably not as balanced or stable as they wanted it to be,"" Olivier Panis, credit rating analyst at Moody's (NYSE:MCO), said of SocGen's recent results.
Oudea has spent much of his tenure trying to make earnings at the investment bank and group levels less reliant on selling investors complex structured products linked to equities.
But tighter capital rules made growth in other areas like fixed income difficult, with equity derivatives remaining the one niche it commanded a sizeable market share in.
""They had a problem with structured products in Q2, but it was not compensated by the rest of the investment bank. That made a big contrast with other French banks' results,"" Guillaume Brisset, a partner and a fund manager at Clartan Associés which holds SocGen shares, said.
Equity trading accounted for 29% of SocGen's investment bank revenue in 2019, and for 10% of the group's overall revenue. This compared with 17% of investment bank revenue and for 5% of group revenue at French rival BNP for the same year.
SocGen's equity trading revenue fell by 80% in the second quarter and was almost completely wiped out in the first, while JP Morgan (N:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS), the only two banks with bigger equity derivatives franchises according to Coalition data, both saw equity earnings surge.
But UBS analysts expect SocGen's equity trading revenue to rise by 20% in the third quarter, outperforming all of its peers, including BNP, JP Morgan and Goldman.
""Volatility remained elevated but without major spikes, typically a constructive environment for derivatives trading"" UBS said in a note, adding that its top picks are  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and BNP, with SocGen its ""least preferred"" bank for European CIB (corporate and investment banking).
LOWER RISK REWARD?
With limited chances of making traction in other areas of trading, Oudea is not planning to scale back equity derivatives. Instead he wants to sell the same amount of products in terms of billions of euros, but to focus on ones which carry less risk. 
This means fewer of the products bearing exotic names that lost SocGen millions when companies cancelled dividends and stock prices tanked during the market sell-off in March.
SocGen will now offer alternative products where risks are easier to manage, but yields for investors will be lower.
""So we have already designed new products where ... we don't have this dividend risk,"" Oudea said during a banking conference last month, adding: ""We will go probably for more single-asset products than products with correlation."" 
De-risking will only address part of the challenge which Oudea faces in his remaining years as CEO. 
Oudea, who has been at the bank for 25 years, is credited with shoring up the capital base, its Achilles' heel after the 2008 crisis, and selling some non-core businesses. 
Sources have also told Reuters that SocGen is gearing up for a sale of its asset management business Lyxor in a bid to cut costs. SocGen declined to comment on this.
While further asset sales and French retail restructuring will help on costs, they will do less to improve profit growth and scale and Oudea has said he would only take part in major deals as a buyer as European banking prepares for expected consolidation. 
However, some investors say SocGen's options look limited. 
""It is somewhat stuck because it is too small and has therefore no room for manoeuvre. Many of its activities are of a sub-optimal size,"" Brisset at Clartan Associés said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's NatWest Group (L:NWG) has kicked off a campaign encouraging customers to dump the discredited Libor lending rate, as the coronavirus pandemic slows the pace at which borrowers are shifting to alternatives. 
The lender is writing to 3,500 companies to explain how delays in switching could increase the volatility of their borrowing costs and how to choose the most suitable new benchmark before Libor disappears at the end of 2021.
The campaign coincides with the banking sector's third quarter deadline on offering alternative risk-free rates on new loans, and comes six months before new lending referencing Libor is banned.
Authorities decided to phase out Libor after finding it had been rigged for profit, but Reuters reported in April that some businesses and banks were struggling to make the switch in the midst of a global pandemic. [nL5N2BW06G]. 
Global regulators are sticking to the current end-2021 deadline for scrapping Libor, which is embedded in up to $340 trillion worth of financial contracts worldwide. 
But some borrowers remain slow to adopt rates such as Sonia, the sterling overnight index average, as they only show the interest due on a loan just before a payment is due. 
Some companies are still structuring Libor loans that include clauses to switch to another rate at the end of 2021, while others are choosing base rate products, said Jamie Thrower, Libor transition lead for NatWest customers with more than 6.5 million pounds ($8.4 million) in revenues.
""We're starting to see a very small handful of blue chips at the top of the pyramid going straight into a Sonia facility but it's taken quite some time to get there,"" Thrower said. 
""The base of the pyramid comprises the majority of corporates for whom Libor transition has not grabbed their attention in the same way as other challenges they face."" 
Thousands of British businesses are fighting for survival as a resurgent COVID-19 virus triggers new lockdown restrictions across the country.
The imminent end of the Brexit transition period is adding to worries, with future supply chains, access to EU customers and Britain's overall economic resilience still uncertain.
Sarah Boyce, policy specialist at the Association of Corporate Treasurers, said fewer than 50% of respondents to its latest member poll in July said migration to new benchmarks was one of their top two priorities. 
""Many corporates have needed to put Libor transition on the back burner whilst they focused on more immediate liquidity needs,"" she said.
NatWest, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old) before changing its name earlier this year, is the UK's largest corporate lender by market share. 
It said failure to address the changes could cost vulnerable companies even more, with forward-looking Libor subject to more volatility than Sonia, which is based on actual rates banks have paid to borrow from each other over a specific period. 
""Our aim is to help customers understand and embrace what this new rate offers ... it is a slight trade-off between certainty on price and lower volatility,"" Thrower said.

198,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 11:30PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, Recovering from Surprise Trump Stimulus Talks Cancellation","By Adam Claringbull
Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, recovering after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to end his administration’s COVID-19 stimulus talks until after the U.S. election.
President Trump’s decision came as a surprise to the markets, with U.S. stocks sharply down on the news. The U.S. fall spread to Asian markets on opening, with most major indices down on the previous close. Markets had risen yesterday on news that the president was out of hospital, and that House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi was in discussions with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over the shape of the relief package.
President Trump delivered his news by tweet, saying: “I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business.”
Trump’s decision came as a shock to many, especially as the president’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic is considered a major drag on his reelection chances. His news also comes at a time when many of his inner circle have also contracted the virus, along with several federal Republican senators and representatives.
Markets globally reacted poorly to the president’s unilateral decision: “The market rally thus far had really been driven by this unprecedented stimulus from both central banks and governments globally and a large part of that was from the U.S.,” said Emily Weis, a macro strategist at  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT)., to Bloomberg TV. The timeline on more American fiscal stimulus “has now been pushed further back.”
Just hours before the president’s tweet cancelling the stimulus discussions, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had been speaking at the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) conference, where he addressed the need for government support:
“Too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses - Over time, household insolvencies and business bankruptcies would rise, harming the productive capacity of the economy and holding back wage growth, by contrast, the risks of overdoing it seem, for now, to be smaller.”
China’s markets are closed for a holiday.
The Australian ASX 200 was up 0.87% by 11:28 PM ET (3:28 AM GMT). This was brought about by the previous day’s release of the government’s budget. The new budget contains billions of dollars in domestic tax cuts and spending initiatives, leading to the consumer sector driving the rise in stocks this morning.
Japan’s Nikkei was down 0.33%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.47%  and South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.09%.
Investors are waiting on European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde and Powell, who are both due to deliver speeches later in the day. Both institutions will release the minutes from their respective September meetings."
199,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>",Trump urges Congress to provide $25 billion bailout for U.S. airlines,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said late on Tuesday Congress should quickly extend $25 billion in new payroll assistance to U.S. passenger airlines furloughing thousands of workers as air travel remains down sharply amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump's new demand came hours after he announced his administration would abandon talks with congressional Democrats over proposals to spend at least $1.6 trillion in additional coronavirus relief funds, a move that appeared to scuttle a new $25 billion bailout for U.S. passenger airlines to keep tens of thousands of workers on the job for another six months.
But Trump later issued a call on Twitter, urging Congress to ""IMMEDIATELY Approve 25 Billion Dollars for Airline Payroll Support.... I will sign now!"" he wrote, saying Congress could tap unused funds from prior coronavirus relief to fund airlines and a separate program for small business. 
American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) last week began laying off 32,000 workers, but had said they would reverse course if lawmakers reach a deal on a new government program to fund payroll costs.
A prior $25 billion airline payroll support program of mostly cash grants approved by Congress in March expired on Sept. 30.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last Friday expressed support for a standalone bill to keep airline workers on the job if a broader package could not be reached.
A Pelosi spokesman did not respond to a request for comment late Tuesday.
Congress is expected to return to session on Oct. 19 and lawmakers may make a new attempt to pass a standalone measure to provide the $25 billion sought by airlines but the prospects are uncertain, even though the airline relief enjoys strong support in both the House and Senate.
One remaining issue is how Congress would pay for the new funding, a senior congressional aide told Reuters Tuesday.American Airlines closed about 4.5% lower after Trump's tweet on ending talks, while shares of United Airlines (O:UAL) closed 3.6% lower. Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) stock fell 2.4% and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) shares closed 2.9% lower.
Airlines for America, the trade group representing major U.S. airlines, noted ""thousands of airline workers across the country have already lost their jobs – and more furloughs are expected in the coming weeks."" But the group added ""there is a glimmer of hope that our leaders in Washington will act and save these jobs before it’s too late.""
The U.S. Travel Association said ""with millions of Americans suffering, it is woefully shortsighted to end relief negotiations"" and added that ""without immediate aid, 50% of all travel-supported jobs will be lost by December — an additional loss of 1.3 million jobs.""
U.S. airlines are collectively burning about $5 billion of cash a month as passenger traffic has stalled at around 30% of 2019 levels. After tapping capital markets, they say they have enough liquidity to last them at least 12 months at that rate.
Between voluntary and involuntary furloughs, major U.S. airlines' workforce will shrink by at least 25% in October.
Industry experts expect a slight improvement in domestic demand over the winter holidays from current levels, but it will remain far below last year's volumes. Meanwhile, higher-margin business and international travel remain severely depressed.
Chief executives acknowledge that pre-pandemic air travel demand is unlikely to return for years, and still unknown is how the pandemic, which has forced drastic changes in habits, will impact travel behavior.
American Airlines will end service to 11 smaller airports on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve additional aid.

201,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 09:35PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers detail Big Tech's market abuses and press for strict reform,"By Nandita Bose and Diane Bartz
(Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel looking into abuses of market power by four big technology companies found they used ""killer acquisitions"" to smite rivals, charged exorbitant fees and forced small businesses into ""oppressive"" contracts in the name of profit.
The antitrust subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee recommended that Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Facebook (O:FB) - with a combined market value of over $5 trillion - should not both control and compete in related businesses. 
The panel's report broadly recommended structural separations but stopped short of saying a specific company should be broken up. 
The scathing 449-page report - the result of the first such congressional review of the tech industry - suggested expansive changes to antitrust law and described dozens of instances where the companies misused their power.
""To put it simply, companies that once were scrappy, underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons,"" the report said.
In anticipation of the report, Amazon warned in a blog post Tuesday against ""fringe notions of antitrust"" and market interventions that ""would kill off independent retailers and punish consumers by forcing small businesses out of popular online stores, raising prices and reducing consumer choice.""
Google said in a statement that it competes ""fairly in a fast-moving and highly competitive industry. We disagree with today’s reports, which feature outdated and inaccurate allegations from commercial rivals about Search and other services."" 
Facebook said, ""We compete with a wide variety of services with millions, even billions, of people using them. Acquisitions are part of every industry, and just one way we innovate new technologies to deliver more value to people."" 
Apple said, ""Scrutiny is reasonable and appropriate but we vehemently disagree with the conclusions."" The company also defended its commission rates and said it would issue a more extensive response in the coming days.
After more than a year of investigation involving 1.3 million documents and more than 300 interviews, the committee led by Democratic Congressman David Cicilline found companies were running marketplaces where they also competed, enabling ""them to write one set of rules for others, while they play by another.""
Coming just weeks before the Nov. 3 presidential election, the report became an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to boost their credibility in the fight against market domination by big tech companies.
That said, Congress is unlikely to act on the findings this year. Since the report reflects the views of the Democratic majority in the House, it signals that if Joe Biden wins the White House, the pressure on the companies could well continue.
Also, the report is likely to inform existing antitrust probes against the companies by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. 
Separately, the U.S. Justice Department is investigating large technology companies and is expected to bring a lawsuit against Google soon. 
But the report was split along party lines. Republicans on the committee released two short reports, one authored by Representative Ken Buck and supported by three fellow Republicans, which bashed the companies but said that he would not support any call to break them up. 
The other was a letter authored by Representative Jim Jordan who criticized Democrats for not probing Big Tech companies for alleged conservative bias and failing to show that existing antitrust law was inadequate.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The panel recommended companies be prohibited from operating in closely aligned businesses. While they did not name any one company, this recommendation would suggest that Google, which runs the auctions for online ad space and participates in those auctions, should potentially be required to separate clearly, or not even operate, the two businesses. For a factbox, click
Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012 is another example of this. Instagram at the time was small and insignificant, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw its potential and noted that it was ""building networks that are competitive with our own"" and ""could be very disruptive to us,"" the report said.
An email received by the committee on Sunday from an unnamed former Instagram employee disputed Facebook's contention that the two apps could not easily be pulled apart at this stage.
""They can just roll back the changes they've been making over the past year and you'd have two different apps again,"" the person wrote. ""It's turning something on and off.""
As part of the report, the committee staff drew up a menu of potential changes in antitrust law.
The suggestions ranged from the aggressive, such as potentially barring companies like Amazon.com from operating the markets in which they also compete, to the less controversial, like increasing the budgets of the agencies that enforce antitrust law: the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission.
The report also urged Congress to allow antitrust enforcers more leeway in stopping companies from purchasing potential rivals, something that is now difficult.

The antitrust panel will take up the majority report after the October recess for formal adoption and will have a vote on it, the counsels for the committee said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday issued a draft report on revised training procedures for the Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX, a key milestone to the plane's eventual ungrounding.
The FAA said the draft Flight Standardization Board report would be open for public comment through Nov. 2 before the procedures are finalized. The proposal adds new training requirements to deal with a key safety system called MCAS tied to two fatal crashes that killed 346 people and led to the plane's grounding in March 2019.
Boeing did not immediately comment.
MCAS, which was designed to help counter a tendency of the MAX to pitch up, could be activated after data from only a single Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor.
Faulty data that erroneously triggered MCAS to repeatedly activate played critical roles in fatal 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, a U.S. House report released last month said.
The FAA is requiring new safeguards to MCAS, including requiring it receive data from two sensors, before it allows the 737 MAX to return to service.
Pilots must undergo new simulator training before they can resume flights, including training on multiple flight deck alerts during unusual conditions along with how to respond to a runaway stabilizer with timely pilot actions required.
Pilots must also get training for erroneous, high AOA malfunctions.

The FAA must finalize the software upgrade requirements and other changes to the 737 MAX before it can issue an ungrounding order, which is expected at some point in November. That could allow the MAX to begin resuming commercial flights before the end of 2020.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 08:50PM ET</span>",Samsung likely to post 35% surge in third-quarter profit as smartphone sales recover,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd's (KS:005930) September-quarter profit likely surged more than a third, fuelled by strong smartphone sales and a rush order of memory chips from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, analysts said.
Samsung, the world's biggest memory chip supplier, is scheduled to announce preliminary July-September operating profit and revenue on Thursday. 
Profit likely rose 35% to 10.5 trillion won ($9.07 billion) from the same period a year earlier, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, derived from analyst estimates weighted toward those more consistently accurate. Revenue likely rose 3%.
While Samsung's overall chip business was muted, analysts said orders from Chinese smartphone maker Huawei likely propped up sales. Huawei is likely to have built stockpiles before U.S. sanctions from mid-September prevented it from buying chips made using U.S. technology without a license, analysts said.
Last year Samsung's chip business accounted for roughly half of its profit.
U.S. rival Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) posted market-beating profit last month, likely helped by Huawei's rush to secure inventory, analysts said.
""Huawei's emergency orders from late August drove up Samsung's DRAM and NAND chip shipments, offsetting the effect of weak prices and limiting the drop in semiconductor profits for the quarter,"" said analyst Song Myung-sup at HI Investment & Securities. 
Prices of DRAM chips, which allow devices to multi-task, and of NAND chips, which store data, fell in July-September, showed DRAMeXchange data.
Samsung's smartphone profit, which accounted for one-third of earnings last year, likely jumped as handset demand rebounded after the COVID-19 pandemic curbed sales in the first half of 2020. Third-quarter smartphone shipments likely rose 48% to 80 million from the second quarter, according to analysts and data from Counterpoint Research.
Profit at Samsung's display business likely fell, hurt by a later-than-expected launch of customer Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) new iPhone. However, earnings from television sets and home appliances likely rose as Samsung sold more gadgets online and cut operating costs, analysts said.
Samsung is scheduled to release detailed earnings figures later this month.

The Trump administration is preparing to pull the United States - one of the world's biggest emitters of planet-warming greenhouse gases - out of the Paris accord adopted by nearly 200 nations with the aim of limiting global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius and ideally to 1.5 degrees.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - An attempt by one of Brazil's largest retailers to target racial disparities in its management ranks sparked a backlash by the country's federal public defender's office, which accused Magazine Luiza SA (SA:MGLU3) of discrimination.
The public defender, Jovino Bento Junior, said the retailer was basing its recruitment ""exclusively on skin color"" and that would be discriminatory, according to a document, dated Sept 28, in which he proposes a lawsuit against the company.
A group of 11 other public defenders who focus on ethnic and racial issues publicly repudiated Bento's complaint.
Last month, the department store chain and Internet retailer launched a trainee program exclusively focused on recruiting Black people, saying the move was aimed at increasing diversity in its executive ranks.
Civil rights issues in Brazil have rarely provoked mass protests as in the United States, but social statistics show widespread signs of racial discrimination. Its large Black population is underrepresented in professional jobs, earning roughly 56% of what white people make, according to government statistics agency IBGE.
Magazine Luiza is offering a monthly salary of 6,600 reais, about six times the country's minimum wage, plus benefits such as health and dental insurance, to a maximum of 20 applicants who graduated from college between 2017 and 2020.
""All workers should have access to the job market in equal opportunities,"" Bento wrote, adding that while some form of affirmative action could be warranted, only some of those positions should be reserved to minorities.
Bento expressed concern that other companies could follow Magazine Luiza's lead, limiting ""access to job and income"" for non-minority applicants, he added. He accused the company of focusing on ""corporate marketing.""
Magazine Luiza declined to comment.
On Monday, the chain's founder and chairman Luiza Trajano said in a TV interview she launched the trainee program after realizing the company's leadership was composed entirely of white Brazilians.
""Slavery was in Brazil for 350 years, the majority (of its population) is black, the majority lives on the outskirts. This is the truth, so they don't apply (for trainee programs),"" she said. ""When I realized what structural racism is, I even cried.""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's energy sector is bracing for more mergers, initial public offerings and the creation of new energy trading units in the next few years, analysts told Reuters, as historically low interest rates send banks looking for growth segments, such as energy. 
While there are already 380 companies dedicated to energy trading in Brazil, there is still much room to grow. 
""There is no other large market like Brazil's to invest in energy,"" said Alexandre Viana, who heads Thymos Energia, a consultancy. ""China is closed off and India is too complicated."" 
Brazil is Latin America's largest energy consumer and it is a particularly strong player in hydroelectricity.
President Jair Bolsonaro has also pushed to liberalize rules in the sector to attract more private investment, although those have yet to be formalized. 
Brazil has had historically low interest rates under Bolsonaro, as a way for the right-wing government to stimulate private investment. The coronavirus pandemic has pushed those rates even further down, which sit at 2% since August.
Banks are also surveying existing energy companies to see if there is interest in new initial public offerings. Two sources said banks had approached Focus Energia, which generates and sells energy in Brazil.
Focus declined to comment. 
While three major energy companies in Brazil have announced IPO plans this year, two of them have run into roadblocks. 
Energy company  Cosan  (NYSE:CZZ) canceled its IPO due to market turbulence created by the coronavirus, while 2W Energia's CEO, Claudio Ribeiro, told Reuters that they have postponed their plans until they can find the right timing.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended down more than 1% on Tuesday after President Donald Trump said he was calling off negotiations with Democratic lawmakers on coronavirus relief legislation until after the election.
Stocks were higher before the remarks, but reversed course after Trump made the comments on Twitter. 
The S&P 500 fell to a session low shortly after the tweet, taking the index down more than 2% from its session high. Airline shares also tumbled, with United Airlines (N:UAL) ending down 3.6% on the day, and the Cboe Volatility index (VIX) climbed to a session high.
""Much of the rally we've seen in the last week in particular was based on hopes for an additional stimulus package,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. ""There's now a whole lot less reason to put money to work before the election.""
Cases of the virus are still on the rise across much of the country, and hopes that a stimulus deal was still possible had helped stocks to recoup recent losses sparked by the news that Trump had contracted COVID-19.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 375.88 points, or 1.34%, to 27,772.76, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 47.66 points, or 1.40%, to 3,360.97 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 177.88 points, or 1.57%, to 11,154.60.
""Clearly the markets were pricing in some possibility of stimulus,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
But, he said, it was probably unlikely lawmakers would have reached a compromise with their current proposals.
Earlier in the session, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the U.S. economic recovery remained far from complete.
Powell said the domestic rebound could still slip into a downward spiral if the coronavirus is not effectively controlled and growth sustained.
Consumer discretionary shares (SPLRCD) were among the biggest weights on the S&P 500, with the sector falling 2.1% on the day, but most of the major sectors were down at least 1%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 114 new highs and 17 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.55 billion shares, compared with the 9.79 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) on Tuesday classified the QAnon conspiracy theory movement as dangerous and began removing Facebook groups and pages as well as Instagram accounts that hold themselves out as representatives.
The step escalates an August policy that banned a third of QAnon groups https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN25F2HY for promoting violence while allowing most to stay, albeit with content appearing less often in news feeds. Instead of relying on user reports, Facebook staff now will treat QAnon like other militarized bodies, seeking out and deleting groups and pages, the company said in a blog post https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/addressing-movements-and-organizations-tied-to-violence. 
Since the August restrictions, some QAnon groups have added members, and others used coded language to evade detection, for example referring to ""cue"" instead of Q. Meanwhile, adherents have worked to integrate themselves in other groups, such as those concerned with child safety and those critical of restrictions on gatherings due to the coronavirus, according to researchers at Facebook and elsewhere.
“While we’ve removed QAnon content that celebrates and supports violence, we’ve seen other QAnon content tied to different forms of real world harm, including recent claims that the west coast wildfires were started by certain groups,” Facebook wrote. 
“QAnon messaging changes very quickly and we see networks of supporters build an audience with one message and then quickly pivot to another.”
Recent QAnon posts have spread false information about voting and about COVID-19, researchers said, even claiming that President Donald Trump faked his diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to orchestrate secret arrests. 
Classed as a potential source of domestic terrorism by the FBI, QAnon is driven by an anonymous internet poster nicknamed Q who claims to be a Trump administration insider. The core, nonsensical claim is that Trump is secretly leading a crackdown against an enormous pedophile ring that includes prominent Democrats and the Hollywood elite. 
There has been no surge in arrests, and the fictitious Satanic rituals that the group cites echo longstanding legends used to anger people for political reasons, often against minorities.

Trump has praised the group as patriotic, and more than a dozen Republican congressional candidates have promoted it.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 05:05PM ET</span>",U.S. bond yields whipsawed by stimulus halt,"By David Randall and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rising expectations that a Biden victory and a Democratic sweep of Congress would result in broad fiscal stimulus roused U.S. bond yields out of a months-long stupor - only to get whipsawed by an abrupt halt to talks.
Range-bound U.S. Treasuries popped higher on Monday as the yield curve continued to steepen, dropping bond prices further away from record highs. The spread between 10- and 30-year Treasuries, a closely-watched indicator of future inflation expectations, on Monday grew to its widest since November 2016, according to Refinitiv data.
That trend continued early on Tuesday until U.S. President Donald Trump called off negotiations until after the election - sending yields into reverse from four-month peaks.
A large fiscal stimulus would likely help shore up the economy and push inflation higher while also increasing supply through expanded borrowing, fund managers and analysts said.
Optimism toward a stimulus deal had increased in recent days as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's lead over President Donald Trump has widened.
Analysts said that made it more likely that Democrats could pass a bill similar to the $2.2 trillion Democratic stimulus package now stalled in Congress.
Indeed, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on Tuesday of the risk in not enough policy support.

(Graphic: The 10/30-year spread is at its widest since November 2016 link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovawanmva/Pasted%20image%201601931358623.png)
""The idea that you could get a big fiscal package next year is what's underlying the moves here,"" said John Briggs, head of strategy, Americas, at NatWest Markets.
""The 30-year is where the maximum pressure lies,"" Briggs said, as it is most exposed to inflation and borrowing costs long term. The 30-year was at a four-month high on Tuesday.
Investors say the Fed is expected to stomach higher yields - but up to a point.
""The Fed wants to see inflation pick up, and a steeper curve helps the banks while still allowing corporate America to refinance an expansion at incredibly low levels,"" said Gary Cloud, portfolio manager at the Hennessy Equity and Income fund.
Yields had been kept lower by the Federal Reserve's slashing rates and injecting liquidity into the market, which has pumped up risk assets but left bonds range-bound.
The rapid expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet seen earlier this year - from $4.21 trillion in early March to $7.22 trillion by mid-June - has stalled in recent months, and currently stands at $7.10 trillion.
(Graphic: The Fed's Treasury holdings by maturity link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwjddgpw/Pasted%20image%201601991334481.png)
Still, the Fed will likely not step in with any actions to attempt to compress yields if the benchmark 10-year Treasury remains below 1.20%, or roughly its level in March before much of the U.S. economy closed in response to coronavirus, Cloud said.
The move upwards this week also comes in anticipation of the U.S. Treasury selling $110 billion in notes and bonds, launching a $52 billion auction of three-year notes later on Tuesday.
Previous breakouts in yields have not stuck, with the benchmark 10-year last reaching a mini-peak of around 0.9% in June.
The moves have also been seen in traders' short position in bond futures which is the biggest ever on record, according to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
""What you saw in the last week is the market really positioning for even more upside rates just by taking out more short positions,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities, who said the market might be expressing a view that in the event of a so-called ""blue wave"" the Democrats will actually spend more than Republicans.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>","Southwest flight attendants reject call for pay cuts, urge federal aid","By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The union representing Southwest Airlines' (N:LUV) flight attendants on Tuesday rejected management's call for negotiated pay cuts to avoid furloughs and renewed calls for more airline aid from Washington.
On Monday, Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said he was asking unions to agree to pay cuts in order to prevent furloughs and layoffs through 2021 as the industry struggles to stem losses from the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. airlines had pleaded for another $25 billion in federal payroll support before a ban on job and pay cuts under a first package expired on Sept. 30.
Lawmakers have so far failed to agree on a second COVID-19 stimulus plan and some airlines have started furloughing thousands of employees, a move Southwest has so far sought to avoid.
But TWU Local 556 President Lyn Montgomery said that before ""cracking open the contracts that took us decades to obtain,"" the union wants to ensure that no stone has been left unturned, noting that flight attendant concessions may not have a large material impact on Southwest's daily cash burn.
About 32% of Southwest's flight attendants have already agreed to voluntary departure or leave packages to help reduce the company's payroll costs, she said.
U.S. airlines are burning through millions of dollars every day as demand hovers around 30% of 2019 levels and revenues remain sharply depressed.
The union representing Southwest's pilots said on Tuesday it had tentatively agreed to meet and discuss cost savings if a second COVID-19 relief package does not pass in Washington.

Airline workers in general have been reluctant to accept pay cuts given wage losses in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and 2009 economic downturn.

Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Let's agree to disagree
Sen. Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence pick up where Donald Trump and Joe Biden left off when they meet to debate tomorrow night. The presidential face-off wasn't pretty, with insults thrown around and the men talking over each other. Here's hoping Harris and Pence show a tad more decorum and respect.
This is expected to be the only debate between Harris and Pence.
2. The Fed

Speaking at a symposium conducted by the Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington, Slaoui said data readouts from leading vaccine developers are expected to come in three waves over the next several months.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.34%, or 375 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.57%.
Trump accused the Pelosi of ""not negotiating in good faith"" and said her stimulus proposal was ""in no way related to Covid-19.""


The move dealt a blow to hopes of further stimulus, which Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said was needed to ensure a robust recovery.

217,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 03:55PM ET</span>",Tesla's quarterly report could land Musk another $3 billion,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Tesla's (O:TSLA) upcoming quarterly report could put another $3 billion in Chief Executive Elon Musk's pocket. 
The electric car maker on Tuesday saw the six-month average of its stock market value hit $250 billion, a milestone toward triggering the fourth of 12 tranches of options to buy Tesla stock at a discount, granted to the billionaire in his 2018 pay package. 
Musk's compensation is exclusively made up of a series of potential stock options rewards based on market capitalization and operational goals. To secure Musk's fourth tranche, Tesla still must hit a goal related to revenue or profitability, and that could happen in the company's third-quarter report, the date of which has yet to be announced. 
Elon Musk's expanding payout: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzklzopw/Pasted%20image%201602009124093.png
Tesla’s stock was down 0.8% at mid-day on Tuesday, but the company's six-month average market capitalization rose, thanks to a strong rally in recent months.
Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 8.44 million Tesla shares at $70 each, about a sixth of their current price. 
At Tesla’s current stock price of $420, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the upcoming tranche, plus three other tranches that vested in recent months, for a combined profit of $11.8 billion, or almost $3 billion per tranche.
Musk’s first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has increased along with Tesla’s stock price. 
The Silicon Valley billionaire's pay package, which surpasses anything previously granted to top U.S. executives, was controversial when it was approved by shareholders. The median compensation for Tesla employees last year was about $58,000, according to a company filing.
Tesla’s stock has surged 400% in 2020 as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan, giving it stock market value of almost $400 billion. After Tesla last week said it delivered a record 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, investors are now awaiting the company's quarterly financial report.
While investors focus on gross margins, free cash flow and earnings per share in that report, adjusted EBITDA will be key to Musk's personal finances. EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a non-GAAP operating metric that Tesla further customizes by excluding the cost of stock-based compensation, including Musk's.
In the four quarters through June, Tesla's adjusted EBITDA reached $4.42 billion, just short of a $4.5 billion milestone that would open the way for Musk's next options tranche. 

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimated in a recent client note that Tesla will report adjusted EBITDA of $1.183 billion for the September quarter, which would raise Tesla's rolling four quarters of adjusted EBITDA to $4.52 billion. That, along with Tuesday's increase in the company's six-month average market capitalization, would qualify Musk for his next options payout.

218,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>",U.S. judge to hold November 4 hearing on Commerce Dept TikTok ban,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Tuesday he would hold a Nov. 4 hearing on whether to allow the U.S. government to bar transactions with TikTok, a move that the Chinese-owned short video-sharing app has warned would effectively ban its use in the United States.
U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued a preliminary injunction on Sept. 27 that barred the U.S. Commerce Department from ordering Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google app stores to remove TikTok for download by new users.
Nichols must now decide whether to block the other aspects of the Commerce Department order set to take effect on Nov. 12. Nichols' new hearing is scheduled for one day after the presidential election.
Talks are ongoing to finalize a preliminary deal for Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations. U.S. President Donald Trump said last month the deal had his ""blessing.""
Key terms of the deal, including who will have majority ownership, are in dispute. TikTok owner ByteDance has also said any deal will need China's approval, and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal.
The Trump administration contends TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China's government.
Any deal is subject to review by the U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). That panel could also decide to block the app's use in the United States. 
Separately the Justice Department appealed the Sept. 19 preliminary junction issued by U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The injunction blocked the U.S. Commerce Department order, which would also bar other U.S. transactions with Tencent Holding's WeChat, potentially making the app unusable in the United States.

A schedule released by the court suggested no ruling on request is likely until late November at the earliest.

219,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>",Torn U.S. tech investors debate buy or sell in wake of shakeout,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are grappling with how to play heavyweight U.S. technology shares, which are trading well above long-term valuations despite a sell-off last month that took some air out of the stocks.
After leading the rally back from the market's March lows, the S&P 500 information technology sector has underperformed recently and was among the weakest within the S&P 500 in September.
The tech sector remains down about 8% since peaking on Sept. 2, compared with about a 5% decline in the S&P 500. 
Even with the sell-off, the S&P 500 technology sector is trading at about 25 times forward earnings and at a nearly 55% premium to its 10-year average, IBES data shows, according to Refinitiv analysts. The sector's P/E hit 28.4 on Sept. 3, its highest since 2004. 
The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio is now at 21.8. 
While tech valuations remain high, investors still see it as the place to be if coronavirus cases continue to grow and the economy falters further.
""The technology sector has its own issues, which is whether or not it's gone too far, too fast,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""But if the virus is going to be a continued weight on the fabric of the country for the rest of the year and into next year, technology still seems to be the best place in terms of protecting your money.""
Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York, said in recent commentary that its September U.S. equity investor survey suggested there was no clear consensus on what to do with big-cap tech and internet names.
""While 38% believe investors should be buying these names on weakness (the most popular choice), another 36% believe that investors should be taking profits,"" she wrote.
Tech has by far the biggest influence on the S&P 500, with a weighting of 28%, based on S&P Dow Jones Indices data. The next-biggest sector is health care, with a weighting of 14%.
The two biggest companies by market capitalization in the tech sector - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) - also have valuations well above their long-term averages. 
Apple is trading at 30.1 times forward earnings, or a 116% premium versus its 10-year average, while Microsoft is trading at 31.4 times, or a 79% premium, according to Refinitiv's data.
Still, the sector may not be as overvalued as it was in 2000, during the dot-com bubble.
""Our current valuation composite is 60% below that of the dotcom era; and overall profitability, dividends, and balance sheet strength are simply in a much stronger position now versus 20 years ago,"" Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note Tuesday. He thinks investors should view weakness in the sector as a buying opportunity.
In 2000, the tech sector's weighting in the S&P 500 was 21%, S&P-Dow Jones data shows.
The next test for the tech group may be the upcoming earnings season.
Many technology companies have benefitted from the quick shift to working from home because of the pandemic, and strategists say that trend is likely to continue. 
Analysts expect earnings from S&P 500 technology companies to decline just 0.6% from year ago in the third quarter, the smallest decline among all sectors. They expect earnings for the entire S&P 500 to fall 21.3%, IBES data from Refinitiv shows.
Tech will likely continue to be the dominant player in the market, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.

""It will always be,"" she said.

Lexus, which hasn’t won the annual U.S. luxury sales race in a decade, grew 2% on the year to 75,285 vehicles in the third quarter. Deliveries at Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) AG’s premium line declined 9.4% to 69,631 units, and BMW AG suffered a 16% decline to 69,570. Mercedes is still leading the other two carmakers year-to-date by a wide margin.
Lexus has weathered the pandemic better than its German rivals, with the brand’s best-selling RX SUV seeing strong demand in the quarter. Both Mercedes and BMW have been hamstrung by tight inventory as the pandemic idled plants in Europe and the U.S. for weeks. Lexus saw a 31% jump in September alone, led by its RX, NX crossover and ES sedan. That pared declines this year to 13%.
“BMW used sales have been very strong -- I think it’s eating the new car demand because of the inventory shortage,” said Marc Cohen, vice president at Priority 1 Automotive Group in Maryland, which operates two BMW stores.
BMW dealers adapted by selling customers on vehicles that hadn’t yet arrived on the lot and with soaring sales of off-lease cars. After making do with tight inventory in July and August, BMW had a record month in September as its supply of vehicles was replenished, said Bernhard Kuhnt, president of BMW’s North America business.
“In September we had for the first time what I’d call better inventory levels,”’ Kuhnt said by phone. “For the rest of the year I’m cautiously optimistic, but definitely much more optimistic than I was in March.”
Lexus has edged out BMW for the number two spot in year-to-date sales by 2,105 units, but Mercedes has sold a total of 196,838, a lead of nearly 15,000 vehicles over Lexus.
While BMW’s ratio of sports utility vehicles to sedans climbed to 62.5% in the third quarter, led by the X3 crossover, Mercedes has a new compact SUV, the GLB, and other refreshed SUVs to tap Americans’ shift away from sedans to light trucks.
BMW has had to contend with other headwinds as well. Last month, the compnay agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $18 million to settle allegations it gave investors misleading information about retail sales. In August, the automaker trimmed its white-collar workforce in the U.S. to align costs with the plunge in sales.
The collapse of the rental-car market has also hurt results this year, so BMW has turned its focus to growing retail sales, Kuhnt said. “You will see in Q4, whatever that result will be, we grew our customer business,” he said.
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) unit Audi’s U.S. deliveries are down 22% in 2020, following a 16% drop from July to September. Its top-selling Q5 SUV suffered a 34% decline in the quarter.

SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) cut its rolling 20-year forecast for airplane demand on Tuesday, sending its shares lower as the COVID-19 pandemic lays waste to deliveries over the next few years.
The U.S. planemaker, which dominates jet sales together with Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), forecast 43,110 commercial aircraft deliveries over the next 20 years, down 2% from 44,040 projected a year ago and worth an unchanged $6.8 trillion at list prices.
While fleets are still expected to almost double, it is the first time since the 2009 financial crisis that Boeing has cut the 20-year demand forecast in terms of the number of deliveries.
Boeing, also for the first time, lifted the lid on the first half of the 20-year period, showing steep declines for the coming decade on the heels of the COVID-19 crisis. It predicted 18,350 deliveries for 2020-2029, down 10.7% from an unpublished forecast of 20,550 embedded in the last report. 
""The industry clearly has been dramatically impacted ... by the pandemic,"" Commercial Marketing Vice-President Darren Hulst said.
Boeing shares fell as much as 3.3% after the report.
A key forecast for passenger traffic growth - once a reliable 5% a year - has been edging lower since 2015 as a record aviation boom peaked. But it took a sharp knock lower in the latest report, falling to 4% from 4.6% a year ago.
Boeing, America's largest exporter, lowered its assumption for average global economic growth over 20 years to 2.5% from 2.7% after the pandemic plunged key markets into recession.
Even so, Boeing expressed confidence that demand would return towards previous trends in the 2030s, just as it did after earlier economic shocks. Environmentalist critics say the crisis is an opportunity for the industry to get smaller.
WEAK DEMAND FOR BIG JETS
""It will take longer from this crisis but ... the industry will prove resilient again; the fundamentals aren't changing,"" Hulst said.
Demand will be buoyed in part by a rise in the number of replacements as airlines accelerate the retirement of older jets to save running costs and meet environmental goals.
Thousands of jets have been parked during the crisis, especially long-haul twin-aisle models, owing to the widespread border restrictions choking international air travel.
Boeing cut its 20-year forecast for twin-aisle models such as its 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 by more than 10%. At 7,480 jets, down from 8,340 a year ago, that part of the 20-year forecast is now lower than 8,000 for the first time since 2010. 
Twin-aisle demand will be especially slow in the next 10 years with deliveries of only 3,060 aircraft, Boeing said.
The 20-year forecast for smaller single-aisle jets, such as the grounded 737 MAX, dipped 0.5% from the last survey. Previously Boeing had been revising it up by about 3.5-4% year in, year out.
Boeing now sees 32,270 deliveries in the medium-haul single-aisle category, traditionally the cash cow of large planemakers. That includes 13,570 deliveries between now and 2029.
Although medium-haul travel is showing signs of revival, particularly in the booming China market, airlines there continue to sit on the sidelines amid U.S. trade tensions.
While global passenger demand has been mauled by COVID-19, demand for freighters has gone up as shippers seek alternatives to the cargo space being left empty in unused passenger jets.

Despite that near-term bump, Boeing cut its 20-year forecast for freighters by 10.6% to 930 jets on weaker trade and a move by carriers to group shipments into bigger jets to reduce costs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rich countries could be back to close to normal by late 2021 if a COVID-19 vaccine works, is ready soon and distributed properly at scale, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates said on Tuesday. 
""By late next year you can have things going back pretty close to normal - that's the best case,"" Gates, 64, told The Wall Street Journal CEO Council.
""We still don't know whether these vaccines will succeed,"" Gates said. ""Now the capacity will take time to ramp up. And so the allocation within the U.S., and between the U.S. and other countries will be a very top point of contention.""
COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford University are two of the leading candidates in the race to be first to get regulatory approval in the West.
The head of the World Health Organization said on Tuesday that a vaccine against COVID-19 may be ready by the end of the year.
Gates, who made a fortune from Microsoft, has since given $36 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which aims to tackle extreme poverty and poor healthcare.
Last month the foundation signed an agreement with 16 pharmaceutical companies, which Gates said committed them to scaling up manufacturing at an unprecedented speed, and making sure that approved vaccines reach broad distribution as early as possible.
VACCINE RACE
Russia has pushed ahead with its COVID-19 vaccine with mass public vaccinations alongside the main human trial, raising concerns among some observers that it was prioritising national prestige over solid science and safety.
""We're also talking with Russia and China,"" Gates said. ""None of their vaccines are in a Phase III trial with a highly regarded regulator overseeing that trial.""
Gates said that from a scientific point of view the Russian and Chinese vaccines were perfectly valid projects but the absence of a well-respected Phase III study could limit their attractiveness outside their respective countries.
""The Western companies are further ahead on doing these Phase III studies and so if those come out well and they're offered at low cost, I doubt there'll be a lot of Russian or Chinese vaccines going outside of those countries,"" he said.
Gates added that in the United States people should be thinking about ways to reduce hesitancy about having a COVID-19 vaccine when one is ready.
""You know, here in the U.S., we should already be thinking about which voices will help reduce the hesitancy. And so we can get a level of vaccination that really has a chance of stopping (it).""
Asked who did best at balancing the competing health and economic needs, Gates said:

""South Korea, Australia - because this is an exponential event, a little bit of intelligence early on makes a huge difference,"" he said.

225,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 01:54PM ET</span>",Pelosi Cites Fed Chair’s Warning to Prod GOP on Bigger Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin resume plodding negotiations Tuesday on another stimulus with a fresh warning from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that the U.S. economy will suffer if policy makers fail to step up.
Pelosi called on Republicans to get on board with a version of the stimulus bill the House passed last week with only Democratic votes. But significant gaps remain between the Democrats’ $2.2 trillion proposal and a $1.6 trillion offer backed by the White House.
“Chairman Powell’s warning could not be more clear: robust action is immediately needed to avert economic catastrophe from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic,” Pelosi said in a statement Tuesday. “It is long overdue for Republicans to join us in passing a bill that meets the needs of the American people.”
Speaking in a virtual conference hosted by the National Association for Business Economics Tuesday, Powell said that the nation faces a weak recovery without sufficient government aid.
“Even if policy actions ultimately prove to be greater than needed, they will not go to waste,” Powell said.
Yet there are few signs that negotiators can reach an agreement before Election Day, even with President Donald Trump telling lawmakers to “get it done.” Congress would have just four weeks to finalize and pass any legislation before the Nov. 3 vote.
Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke by phone for one hour on Monday to discuss spending amounts and exchange written proposals, according to Drew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesman. Hamill said they will continue the conversation on Tuesday.
Pelosi, speaking to reporters on Monday, put the onus on Republicans.
“It depends on if they really want to crush the virus, honor our heroes and put money in the pockets of the American people,” she said.
If the two sides could agree on an outline in the coming days, it would likely take Congress two weeks to write the bill, return from recess, overcome Senate delays and pass the legislation. That would mean weeks more until benefits like the $1,200 direct payments both sides agree on for most Americans hit individuals’ bank accounts.
The S&P 500 swung between gains and losses Tuesday as Powell was speaking at the virtual conference.
“I think the two important messages we’ve been getting from Fed speakers are -- we are not out of ammunition, but it’s more important now for fiscal authorities to step up,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) & Co.
‘Significant Disagreement’
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows -- referred to even in the administration as the “bad cop” operative in the stimulus talks -- on Monday indicated the administration may still resist a further move toward Pelosi’s bigger proposal.
“There are a lot of people that continue to hurt, are waiting on stimulus, and the president’s committed to getting a deal done,” Meadows said. “He wants to make sure we move expeditiously -- but also in a fiscally responsible manner.”
Pelosi has outlined five areas of “significant disagreement.” They are mostly the same issues that have stood in the way of a deal for weeks: funding for unemployment insurance; money for schools and state and local governments; amounts for the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit; restrictions on the use of money for testing; and a $44 billion gap on appropriated discretionary funding.
“None of those issues seem intractable,” Representative Ted Lieu of California, who is part of Pelosi’s House leadership, said. Democrats would consider a deal “somewhat less” than $2.2 trillion, but not “dramatically less,” he said.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>",Daimler to cut fixed costs and take Mercedes more upmarket,"By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German automaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) will cut fixed costs, capex and R&D spending at Mercedes-Benz by more than 20% by 2025 as part of a strategy overhaul to take the brand further upmarket.
The move will see Mercedes-Benz, currently the world's top selling premium car brand, turn its back on a decades-old strategy of chasing sales volume to focus on the industry's most profitable segments: limousines and sport-utility vehicles. 
Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius told investors that compact vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz A and B-Class had helped rejuvenate the brand, but this would not be where Daimler would prioritise resources going forward. 
""This is not where the main thrust should go, we should not become a competitor of the volume makers,"" Kaellenius said during a virtual strategy presentation on Tuesday. ""The premium luxury segment usually has above average growth.""
Instead of chasing volume for its own sake, Mercedes-Benz will aim to double sales of high-end Maybach branded cars, which retail for 150,000 euros ($177,000) or more, and ramp up sales of AMG and G-Wagon derivatives, including electric variants.
Thanks to more efficient manufacturing techniques and lower fixed costs, Mercedes-Benz will aim for a double-digit return on sales margin by 2025 in good market conditions, or a mid to high single-digit margin when markets are weak, Daimler said.
Cost cutting and efficiency measures include eliminating manual gearboxes, and slashing the variety of combustion engines on offer by 70% by 2030. Around 5,000 staff have agreed to accept buyouts or early retirement, the company added. 
New vehicle platforms, including a second electric vehicle architecture known as MMA, will take less time to build, just like the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class, which takes 25% less time to assemble than its predecessor. 
For its electric cars, Daimler is seeking to cut the cost of battery systems to below 100 euros per kilowatt hour by mid decade and an electric limousine, the EQS, is on track to hit showrooms next year. 
Daimler also aims to release a new software vehicle operating system, known as MB.OS, by 2024 and to use over-the-air updates to generate an operating profit of 1 billion euros by 2025 from digital services, including parking and charging.
The COVID-19 pandemic led to a slump in sales, pushing the company to operating losses in the first and second quarters. 
To counter losses, Mercedes-Benz has stopped building sedans in the United States to focus on more profitable SUVs, combined its fuel cell development with Volvo Trucks, and halted an automated development alliance with BMW (DE:BMWG).

Some 53% of larger organizations plan to reduce the size of their office space and more than three quarters will increase work flexibility. Almost all of the respondents were uncomfortable returning to work because they fear contracting the virus, the poll found.
Cisco, the largest maker of networking equipment, recently surveyed 1,569 executives, knowledge workers and others who are responsible for employee environments in the post-Covid era. The findings suggest many of this year’s radical changes to work life will remain long after the pandemic subsides.
The poll, conducted for Cisco by Dimensional Research, concluded that working from home is the “new normal.” More than 90% of respondents said they won’t return to the office full time. 12% plan to work from home all the time, 24% will work remotely more than 15 days of each month, while 22% will do that eight to 15 days every month.
Cisco’s Webex video conferencing service has benefited from lockdowns that have kept millions of people working and studying from home. It’s also faces rising competition from  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc.
For employees who do return to the office, Webex is adding environmental sensors that plug into its current video-conferencing gear. That will help companies identify over-used and under-utilized spaces, while complying with room capacity limits and checking if workers are wearing masks.

232,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 12:31PM ET</span>","Twitter is testing how its misinformation labels can be more obvious, direct","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Twitter is rethinking how the labels it applies to misinformation look and work, its head of site integrity told Reuters in an interview, as the social media company tries to make these interventions more obvious and cut its reaction times.
Twitter's Yoel Roth said the company is exploring changes to the small blue notices that it attaches to certain false or misleading tweets, to make these signals more 'overt' and be more 'direct' in giving users information. But he did not say whether any new versions would be ready before the U.S. election in the next four weeks, a period that experts say could be rife with false and misleading online content.
Roth said the new efforts at Twitter include testing a more visible reddish-magenta color, and working out whether to flag users who consistently post false information.
""We've definitely heard the feedback that it would be useful to see if an account is a repeat offender or has been repeatedly labeled, and we're thinking about the options there,"" said Roth.
Twitter started labeling manipulated or fabricated media in early 2020, after a public feedback period. It expanded its labels to coronavirus misinformation and then to misleading tweets about elections and civic processes. Twitter says it has now labeled thousands of posts, though most attention has been on the labels applied to tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
In September, Twitter announced it would label or remove posts claiming election victory before results were certified.
Roth said research undermining the idea that corrections can strengthen people's beliefs in misinformation - known as the 'backfire effect' - had contributed to Twitter rethinking how its labels could be more obvious. The risk is that label 
""becomes a badge of honor"" that users actively pursue for attention, said Roth. Though Twitter's labels have been praised by some misinformation experts as a long-overdue intervention, their execution has triggered criticisms from researchers as too slow.
""Mostly things take off so fast that if you wait 20 or 30 minutes... most of the spread for someone with a big audience has already happened,"" said Kate Starbird, an associate professor at the University of Washington who has been analyzing Twitter's labeling responses.
It took Twitter about eight hours to add labels to Trump tweets about mail-in voting the first time it labeled him in May, though Starbird said Twitter was getting quicker. Two Trump tweets in September appeared to have been labeled within two hours. On Tuesday, it took about three hours to place an overlay and disable retweets on a Trump tweet that violated its rules on ""misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19.""
Roth said Twitter reduces the reach of all tweets labeled for misinformation, by limiting their visibility and not recommending them in places like search results. The company declined to share any data about the effectiveness of these steps.
In August, Election Integrity Partnership researchers said Twitter's disabling retweets on a Trump tweet that violated its rules had a clear effect on its spread but was ""too little, too late."" Roth said Twitter takes into account the number of retweets, engagement and views to prioritize viral content for review to give ""the most bang for our buck."" But he said Twitter was exploring how to predict which tweets would go viral and conducting exercises on likely new 2020 election claims to get faster. 
Multiple researchers told Reuters it was difficult to assess effectiveness of Twitter's interventions without knowing which actions it was taking and when.
The company does not keep public lists of when it has applied labels and has not shared data to allow outsiders to assess how its labels affect a tweet's spread or how users interact with them. ""The platforms need to explain what hypothesis they're testing, how they're testing it, what the results are and be transparent,"" said Tommy Shane, head of policy and impact at anti-misinformation non-profit First Draft. ""Because these are public experiments.""
TRUMP TWEETS 
Twitter has labeled or put gray warning overlays over ten @realDonaldTrump tweets for reasons related to civic integrity rules since it first labeled him in May.
Roth said Twitter consults with partners, including election officials, on its labeling. But it has chosen to link to a page of tweets from multiple sources rather than follow Facebook's lead of paying third-party fact-checkers - including Reuters - to assess content as they could be 'easy to dismiss if you disagree with them.'
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB), which exempts politicians from its fact-checking program and faced backlash for not acting on misleading Trump posts, has started adding labels with voting information to all related posts. This strategy has been criticized by researchers for not quickly and obviously differentiating between true and false.
Trump spokeswoman Samantha Zager said in a statement that ""across social media platforms, it's clear the Silicon Valley Mafia creates arbitrary rules that do not apply equally to every account and instead are used to silence any views in opposition to those held by the liberal Big Tech coastal elites,"" pointing to a manipulated version of an August Trump ad that Twitter did not label or remove.

Asked how Twitter is monitoring high-profile users like Trump or his Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden, Roth said Twitter does not ""specifically focus in on individual accounts or individual account holders.""

233,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",Blackstone offers sweetener as tries to sell $1.2 billion of Spanish properties,"By Clara-Laeila Laudette
MADRID (Reuters) - Investment giant Blackstone (N:BX) is offering a sweetener to buyers as it tries to speed up the sale of 8,400 properties in Spain in the teeth of the country's deepest recession on record.
Two Blackstone units, Aliseda and Anticipa, said on Tuesday they would reimburse buyers up to one tenth of the sale price if their property dropped more than a tenth in value in the three months after a deal is sealed. 
""We detected the current context was generating uncertainty for buyers, and wanted to provide them with security and send a message of confidence in the Spanish real estate market,"" said Aliseda communications director Jaime Navarro.
Blackstone bought the real estate portfolio, known as ""Quasar"", in 2017 from Santander (MC:SAN), Spain's biggest lender, which had acquired it for 1 euro in 2016 following the collapse of its previous owner Banco Popular.
Aliseda took control of the portfolio and placed it on sale in 2018, but many properties remain on the market as the COVID-19 pandemic plunges Spain into a deep recession.
The portfolio being advertised is valued at 1.035 billion euros ($1.22 billion), with 640 million being handled by Aliseda, which is selling 5,700 properties. 
Hola Pisos - Anticipa's commercial outfit - is selling 2,700 properties, valued at 395 million.
To decide whether a buyer qualifies for the 10% reimbursement, Blackstone will consult the price index compiled by Spain's infrastructure ministry for each province.
Navarro said the offer did not imply a prediction prices would fall in coming months, and that his company did not make forecasts.
There are, however, signs that Spain's economic paralysis has hurt real estate.
The presence of funds as major property owners in Spain is politically controversial, with the current administration decreeing in March a four-month moratorium on rent for tenants whose landlords owned eight or more properties.

Virgin Money said on Tuesday the cuts were part of a forecast 16% reduction in headcount planned after its takeover by Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group in 2018.
The lender restarted axing jobs in July, making 300 redundancies, which it said at the time was 200 fewer redundancies than it had previously planned. It also closed 52 branches.
Firms across the UK financial sector have ramped up cost-cutting in recent weeks, with rival lender TSB - part of Spain's Sabadell (MC:SABE) - shutting 164 branches and laying off 900 roles last week. 
Banking giant HSBC (L:HSBA) and insurer LV are also making deep cuts. 
Virgin Money said it would look to avoid compulsory redundancies where possible. 
""We are committed to bringing our operations together under the Virgin Money brand to offer customers a sustainable business which is fit for the future,"" Lucy Dimes, chief strategy and transformation officer, said in a statement.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 11:06AM ET</span>",'Work from work:' How a U.S. energy firm’s office return left some employees bruised,"By Liz Hampton and Erwin Seba
HOUSTON (Reuters) - As the world experimented with working from home, U.S. energy firm Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) Co went the other way: it imposed a “work-from-work” policy for staff at its Houston headquarters in May even as the city became a hot spot for the pandemic.
After a brief spike in COVID-19 cases in July, Phillips 66 avoided a major outbreak while remaining nearly fully staffed at its 1.1 million-square-foot Houston campus. The policy also put the company’s white-collar workers on the same footing as refinery staff who were unable to work from home due to the nature of their jobs. Phillips 66 told its employees it hoped to pioneer a safe return to the office that would encourage others to do the same and drive a recovery in demand for gasoline, the company’s main product. 
But the decision by the fourth-largest U.S. oil refiner has left some workers feeling bruised and has damaged their views of the company, according to five current and former employees. Those workers said they felt the company put them at risk by filling offices while the virus had yet to be contained and expressed concern that safety measures weren’t sufficiently enforced early on. They also expressed frustration that senior managers were kept safer through private elevators and offices, while many employees worked in open-plan spaces.
Cases of COVID-19 did increase among the company’s office workers and at one point the rate of recorded infections was almost twice that of the per capita rate of Harris County where the headquarters is based. On July 8, 24 headquarters employees were listed as active COVID-19 cases, or 1.04% of the building’s roughly 2,300 workers, according to internal company data reviewed by Reuters. The number of active COVID-19 cases that day in Harris County was at 0.55% of the population, according to state health data and a Reuters calculation.
""They've always said employees' health and welfare came first. Pre-COVID, I would say that was true... Now the attitude is we don't care about you. We just care about our company, our stock price and our dividend,"" said one of the current employees, who asked not to be identified. By early September, the percentage of employees with the virus was in line with that of Harris County, according to the internal and state data. 
Phillips 66 spokesman Dennis Nuss said in a statement that the company is “committed to the safety of everyone who works in our operating facilities and offices.” He said the coronavirus data that the company monitors “supports our decision that our dedicated employees can and have safely returned,” without specifying what that data showed. 
Nuss also said the company revised its policies based on feedback provided by employees, including implementing flexible guidelines for families. “Our intent is to not address employees’ feedback through public channels,” he added in the statement.
The experience of Phillips 66 illustrates the challenges companies face in assuring employees that workplaces can be made safe before a vaccine becomes available. The United States, which accounts for the bulk of Phillips 66’s revenue, has seen the death toll from COVID-19 surpass 209,000 and cases are rising in about half the U.S. states.
Phillips 66’s policy contrasts to many other companies that allowed office workers to do their jobs from home, including in the energy sector.  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX)'s Houston campus has remained at less than 25% occupancy. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) until last week allowed staff at its Houston headquarters to remain at home.
Scott Packard, chief communications officer for Houston's health department, said with Harris County's current COVID-19 threat level, ""people should minimize contact with others whenever possible and avoid leaving home except for essential needs."" He added that to mitigate risk, ""employers should provide telecommuting options to the extent possible and follow public health guidelines,"" including measures such as providing for social distancing, requiring masks and temperature screenings for essential employees.
One former Phillips 66 employee, a financial professional, said the push by management to bring workers back to the office while rival oil and gas companies allowed employees the option of continuing to work from home contributed to the former employee’s decision to leave the company.
Texas let stay-at-home orders expire in late April and began reopening businesses in phases from May 1.
Phillips 66 employee Bryan Kaus wrote in a May blog post on professional networking website LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) that returning to the office had ""been good in many ways"" as it created a sense of normalcy and optimism. ""It was surprising to see a packed elevator, people shaking hands, and eating together,"" he wrote while encouraging colleagues to wear face masks and follow Phillips' safety measures.
When contacted by Reuters, Kaus said that was his personal opinion and he wasn’t authorized to speak on behalf of the company.
BUSINESS IMPERATIVE 
Phillips 66 announced its plan to return to the office in an April 21 email from a human resources executive to its Houston and Oklahoma office campuses. The email came about three weeks after the company’s chief executive, Greg Garland, met with President Donald Trump at the White House.
Garland told employees he viewed their return as key to stemming losses in its oil processing business following an unprecedented drop in demand for gasoline. In a May video to staff, Garland said the company ""bled $1.6 billion in cash"" in the first quarter and could lose at least as much in the second. It was important for the business to get all workers, not just those at Phillips 66, back to work again, he said. “If people don’t commute, we don’t have a viable business model.”
The company also had very few COVID-19 cases and no workplace transmission that it knew of, Garland added in the video.
When Phillips 66 started returning office workers to its campus on the west side of Houston in early May, there had been 22 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the company, with 17 of those recovered and back at work, according to a company email reviewed by Reuters. The company has about 14,500 staff globally. 
Garland was unavailable to comment, said Nuss.
Phillips 66 said the CEO's meeting with Trump had no relation to its return-to-office planning and that Garland attended in his capacity as the American Petroleum Institute chairman.
The White House, which on April 16 outlined guidelines for a phased reopening of the country, declined to comment on whether the President urged the energy executives to bring back their white-collar employees.
SAFETY MEASURES
By June, Phillips had recalled most of the staff at its headquarters.
Phillips 66's senior vice president of health and safety, Jay Churchill, notified employees in a June 15 email of four cases among headquarters staff. ""None of these cases were from contact while in the office,"" he said, acknowledging one illness stemmed from a business trip where adherence to its COVID-19 protocols were not followed.
The company took steps aimed at keeping employees safe, including issuing guidelines about working safely and requiring training for workers, according to Nuss. It also had daily employee temperature checks, performed contact tracing, required exposed workers to quarantine and internally shared information about the number of COVID-19 cases, the spokesman said.
    The internal data reviewed by Reuters shows the company shared with employees a case breakdown by location and at the headquarters by floor.
However, the company’s approach to mask wearing was initially lax and confusing, three of the five current and former employees said.
On June 22, Harris County required face coverings be worn “in a commercial entity or working in areas in a commercial entity that involve close proximity with others,” according to a judge-issued order. That same day, Phillips 66 in an internal notice to headquarters’ employees reiterated its policy, requiring masks on elevators, in food service areas and where employees felt they could not maintain physical distance. ""Phillips 66 does not provide goods or services directly to the public at our headquarters office and therefore we will continue with our current guidance,"" it said in the internal notice, adding staff could don masks where they felt a need for added precaution. One employee said mask wearing was not strictly enforced and that they believed they contracted COVID-19 from a colleague who did not wear a mask in their shared office. ""They had a mandatory mask policy, yet my co-worker wouldn’t wear a mask. There was no accountability,” said the person.
Phillips 66 spokesman Nuss said the company spent $400,000 on protective equipment at the headquarters to combat the spread and that the changes to where employees were required to wear face masks reflected evolving guidance from public authorities.
Prior to late June, employees were required to wear face covering in certain areas of the headquarters building and when social distancing wasn’t possible, said Nuss. Currently, the company requires employees to wear a face mask in all public areas with the exception of when at their workspace or in a socially-distanced meeting, he added.
“The change in protocols did not impact the relatively low number of cases in the office, although we believe the more frequent use of face coverings made it easier for employees to remember to utilize them both inside the office and away from the workplace,” Nuss said.
“There have been no cases, before or after we instituted additional face covering use requirements, that resulted from a lack of face coverings,” Nuss said. He also said that in response to employee feedback and changes in public health guidelines the company tightened measures and conducted small-group meetings to “analyze safety controls.” 
RISE IN CASES
Cases of COVID-19 among headquarters' staff rose during July as Churchill and other executives maintained there was no evidence the illnesses were spread from colleagues, according to internal emails.
By July 31, there had been 238 confirmed cases across the company since it started keeping track, with 16 active cases at its headquarters, according to the data reviewed by Reuters. 
As of September 9, the percentage of cases to staff at the headquarters was 0.26%, with 37 active cases across the company, the data showed. On that day, the rate for the county was 0.27% of the population, state health data showed. There had been 318 cases across the company since its first cases in March, according to the data. 
Fuel use remains well below pre-pandemic levels across the globe. 
Phillips 66, in its responses to Reuters, said that each company must take the right decision for them and that it “strongly believes that a work-from-work model benefits our company and our employees and, most importantly, can be done safely.”

Investing.com --  Cruise lines are back in the green, again, with  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) saying it will test all crew and passengers, and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp. saying the companies are collaborating with the White House and CDC.
Royal Caribbean rose 6.3% on Tuesday, Carnival and  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (NYSE:NCLH)n were up 6%.
When Royal Caribbean resumes sailing, it intends to test every passenger and crew member. Royal Caribbean Chief Executive Officer Richard Fain said no other section of the travel industry has 100% testing.
""In fact, no other industry in the world requires 100 percent testing. The closest anyone comes is the bubble that was organized to the NBA teams and that's been so very successful,"" Fain said on the Royal Caribbean blog.
Carnival Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said that there is constant dialogue ongoing in the U.S. for a potential cruise restart, according to Cruise Industry News.
Donald did not comment on a meeting with the White House, which has been delayed. He is optimistic the industry is in a position to collaborate with the CDC and current White House administration to resume cruising in the United States this year, Donald said.
Separately, Norwegian announced it is suspending global cruise voyages between Nov. 1 through Nov. 30 for its three cruise brands.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Airlines warn of more bankruptcies as wage support ends,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - Global airlines warned on Tuesday that the coronavirus-stricken industry was on course to burn through another $77 billion in cash in the second half of 2020, calling on governments to renew expiring wage support programmes.
""The issue now is that aid, particularly the wage subsidies, is starting to be withdrawn,"" Brian Pearce, chief economist at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), told reporters.
Airlines consumed $51 billion in cash in the second quarter as the pandemic brought global travel to a near-standstill, the industry body said.
The call for increased support came as U.S. airlines begin furloughs of more than 32,000 workers amid fading hopes for a new federal bailout package. Wage support programmes are also tapering off in Europe and elsewhere.
Whereas the withdrawal of subsidies makes sense for sectors in recovery, IATA warned of further airline bankruptcies in the northern hemisphere winter as the collapse in revenue continues to dwarf cost savings. The average carrier now has cash for 8.5 months of operations, Pearce said.
""We're facing some tough winter months for airlines when cash flows are always seasonally weak,"" he said. ""We're looking (at) airlines getting into trouble if not failing without either further government support or (being) able to access capital markets for more cash.""
Airlines are pushing for a global system of pre-flight COVID-19 tests to replace quarantines and travel restrictions they blame for worsening the travel collapse.

Investing.com --  Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) rose 5% on Tuesday after an analyst upgraded it for its appeal to teenagers.
Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) raised its price target to $178 from $130, and maintained a neutral rating after the firm conducted a ""Teen Survey,"" which showed strong interest in plant-based ""meat."" 
A survey showed that Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are the early leaders in brand awareness for plant-based meat, the firm said. 
The firm surveyed nearly 10,000 adolescents, which suggested plant-based eating is more on-trend with younger consumers, which could drive growth over time as consumers age. Some 47% of teens surveyed said they either consume or are open to consuming plant-based meat, Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery said in a note, according to StreetInsider.
And then there's the rumor that McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) may start selling a vegan cheeseburger in the U.K. using Beyond Meat patties. 
""We estimate distribution expansion with McDonald's is a ~$150M global revenue opportunity for Beyond, assuming it sources 5% of burger sales,"" the analyst said.
Shares of Beyond are up 143% this year as the company expands its presence in groceries stores and moves into the Chinese market.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, pausing for breath after strong gains on Monday in anticipation of a deal on a fresh package of stimulus measures for the economy.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are due to resume negotiations this morning after an hour-long conversation by telephone on Monday. The two sides are still around $600 billion apart in terms of the package's scale, due largely to Democratic pressure for an extension of the $600 weekly unemployment benefit check. 
Pelosi was quoted by newswires early on Tuesday as saying that talks were ""progressing slowly"".
Speculation has risen that President Donald Trump will move further to get a deal to bolster re-election chances that seem to be slipping. A CNN poll published earlier Tuesday put his challenger Joe Biden nearly 16 points ahead of Trump after their first 'debate' last week.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 81 points, or 0.3%, at 28 229 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, which posted the biggest gains on Monday, were both effectively unchanged..
In addition to news on the fiscal policy front, there is also a speech at 10:40 AM ET (1440 GMT) by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at an economic conference, which will be scanned for hints as to how near (or far) any further help from the central bank could be. The so-called JOLTS job opening survey showed the number of vacancies falling slightly more than expected in September from August, corroborating a picture of a labor market recovery that is starting to lose momentum.
Among individual stocks, a bit of mean-reversion was the order of the day on a light day for news flow. Zoom Video was down 1.6% while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was down 1.5% amid reports that it is dropping Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) products from its stores. Sonos stock was down 4.1%.
By contrast,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 0.8% and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stock rose 0.4%, correcting upwards on the perception that the sell-off of oil and gas stocks over recent weeks has now gone too far. GasBuddy data showed U.S. gasoline consumption at its highest level since Labor Day on Monday.
President Donald Trump's upbeat address on his return to the White House on Monday, in which he promised that vaccines to treat the Covid-19 virus would be arriving ""momentarily"", has put a spotlight back on the companies developing those drugs. Biontech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock soared 8,2% but  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock fell 0.8% after the EU fast tracked the review process for their experimental drug.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose 2.5%,shrugging off a Reuters report suggesting that the phase 3 trial of its experimental drug could be slowed down by the fact that not enough patients from ethnic minorities had enrolled in it.

The bank's new class of partners, to be promoted next month, is likely to be its smallest since the mid-1990s, according to the report.
Goldman's partners own a stake in the firm and are the bank's most elite employees. The bank currently has nearly 500 partners in its ranks.
Under Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, Goldman's partnership ranks have been shrinking, as part of his broader efforts to make the Wall Street bank less top-heavy and also to raise the bar for employees seeking to become partners.
Partners will receive carried interest, a portion of future profits taxed at low rates, in four of Goldman's private investment funds starting this year, according to the report.

The move comes a day after rival Cineworld (L:CINE), the world's second-biggest cinema operator, said it would close all its screens in the U.S. and Britain after studios delayed major releases such as the latest James Bond film.
Warner Bros said late on Monday it was delaying the release of ""Dune"" and ""The Batman"" movies.
Movie theaters across the world have been shuttered since mid-March when several countries imposed lockdowns and social distancing measures to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The delay in releases was an added setback for the entertainment industry.
The reluctance of studios to go ahead with major releases led Cineworld to close all 536 Regal theaters in the U.S. and its 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse theaters in the UK from Oct. 8.
AMC said more than 80% of its theaters in the United States, more than 90% of Odeon Cinemas Group theaters across Europe and all AMC Cinemas in the Middle East would remain open.
The announcement follows news reports that other movie circuits may temporarily close, AMC said.
""Some of our best partners like Disney, with its much anticipated ""Soul"", and Universal with ""The Croods: A New Age"", have new movies scheduled for theatrical release over the next month and a half,"" AMC Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said. 
Other upcoming releases include ""The War With Grandpa"" starring Robert De Niro and ""Yellow Rose"" this weekend and ""Let Him Go"", ""Freaky"" and ""The Comeback Trail"" lined up for November.

AMC's shares, which closed down about 11% on Monday following Cineworld's news, were up more than 3% in pre-market trading.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 09:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU exploring using bond auctions for pandemic-linked debt sales,"By Yoruk Bahceli
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The European Commission is exploring using auctions to sell bonds as it prepares to ramp up debt issuance to finance the European Union's post-pandemic recovery programmes, the EU Commissioner for Budget and Administration said on Tuesday. 
Details on the tools the EU, currently a small borrower with a modest debt pile of just over 50 billion euros, will use to take on huge additional liabilities have been eagerly awaited.
""The Commission's immediate focus is the issuance of the SURE bonds, due later this month,"" commissioner Johannes Hahn said, referring to the EU's unemployment scheme which will be backed by around 100 billion euros of debt. A first bond sale to fund the scheme is expected in the second half of October.
""Beyond that, the Commission is exploring all options for a scaled-up issuance volume, including using auctions for its issuances,"" Hahn told Reuters in emailed comments. 
SURE issuance will mostly use syndicates of banks to market bonds directly to investors -- the format supranational borrowers like the European Union usually use. 
But after that programme, the EU will need to finance a 750 billion euro recovery fund that forms the lion's share of its post-pandemic support for member states. 
Most government debt is issued at auction, with banks acting as dealers for the borrower purchasing bonds which they then sell on to investors. 
The same banks are usually responsible for ensuring orderly trading in the secondary market, so that government debt remains highly liquid and appealing to investors.
Hahn said the Commission was looking into ""all options"" the market could offer to ensure the liquidity of its debt in secondary markets. 
He added that while the Commission already has teams and partners who run its existing borrowing programmes, it would build on these when needed, given the higher future issuance volumes.

Member states still have to agree conditions for the distribution of the recovery fund, with the bloc's 27 countries divided over a scheme that ties access to the money to respecting the rule of law.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets climbed to more than two-week highs on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump's return to the White House from COVID-19 treatment and on hopes of a giant new U.S. stimulus package. 
Despite a subdued London FTSE (FTSE), Europe benefited from near 2% jumps in battered banks (SX7P) and travel stocks (SXTP), along with what Germany called a ""remarkable"" leap in export orders, to join Asia and Wall Street's overnight rallies. 
MSCI's main world stocks benchmark was up 0.2% at a two-week high too after Trump's return from the Walter Reed Medical Center military hospital outside Washington on Monday eased nerves about possible disruption to next month's election.
Gold , bonds and the dollar all dipped amid the modestly improved risk appetite, though Wall Street futures had slipped into the red.
""The market is slightly short of oomph,"" said Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s Kit Juckes, pointing to Europe's subdued morning. 
""It has not managed to get a meaningful lift from it (Trump leaving hospital) and I think it is threatening to take a time out and wait for what comes next.""
Trump said he felt ""real good"" after a three-night hospital stay, although one of his doctors cautioned he may not be out of the woods until later in the week.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares had risen 0.7% to a two-and-a-half-week high, with Hong Kong (HSI) climbing 0.8% and Japan's Nikkei (N225) adding 0.5%. China's markets remained closed for a public holiday. 
U.S. stimulus hopes were still bubbling in the background after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke by phone for about an hour on Monday and said they were preparing to talk again on Tuesday.
""If we do see some form of stimulus coming through, I think the market will take it in a positive light,"" said J.P. Morgan Asset Management's Chief Asia Market Strategist Tai Hui.
RECOVERY CONCERNS
S&P 500 futures (ESc1) were a touch weaker after the best daily gain on the S&P (SPX) in a month overnight, while the optimism left safe-haven asset demand mixed.
Gold  recovered from an overnight wobble to perch at $1,917 per ounce, after hitting a two-week peak on Monday.
Bond markets also joined in, as a sharp selloff in U.S. bonds on Monday carried over into Asia and Europe. 
Benchmark 10-year German government bond yields, which move inverse to price, hit their highest in over a week. Japanese government bond futures <2JGBv1> fell to a one-month low in the steepest drop in more than five weeks and South Korean yields jumped. However, analysts said selling in other markets was more subdued than in the U.S. market because regional investors are beginning to price in a victory for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 election.
U.S. Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell was also scheduled to speak later in the day, giving traders extra reason for patience, though caution from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde was already setting the tone.
""We now fear that the containment measures that have to be taken by authorities will have an impact on this (economic) recovery,"" Lagarde said, adding that it might prevent a long-hoped for V-shaped rebound.
U.S. 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) were steady at 0.77% while in the currency markets, the dollar was under minor pressure from most other majors with the exception of the safe-haven Japanese yen and Brexit-bound sterling . 
The dollar firmed on the yen to reach 105.62 yen , not far short of its highest levels in three weeks.
The Australian dollar gained briefly after the Reserve Bank of Australia left rates on hold, as expected, but later fell back, and the potential for further monetary easing capped gains. 
Oil jumped more than 5% overnight and edged higher still in Europe, supported by the Trump news and a supply squeeze as a strike shut six Norwegian offshore oil and gas fields. 
Brent crude climbed 1.7% at $42.03 a barrel while U.S. crude last stood at $39.85 a barrel, up 1.6%.

Retail sales, of products and services at all 445 IKEA stores and online, came in at 39.6 billion euros ($46.7 billion).
E-commerce jumped 45% to account for 21% of total retail sales, and Inter IKEA said online sales remained high even after stores, most of which closed temporarily for an average of four weeks in the early stages of the pandemic, re-opened. 
Jon Abrahamsson Ring, chief executive since March, told Reuters sales at stores open for a year or more shrank around 10%, against a 1% rise the year before. 
Adjusted for the temporary closures, however, comparable sales were roughly unchanged as the coronavirus crisis boosted people's interest in their homes, he said, adding that he expected sales to return to growth this year.
IKEA is shifting from large out-of-town stores towards online and smaller inner-city stores as it adapts to digitalisation and new shopping habits. 
Ingka Group, the main IKEA franchisee, said separately that sales at its 378 stores shrank 4% in the fiscal year to 35.2 billion euros, with online sales soaring 60% to make up 18% of its total turnover.

248,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",NextEra's Duke Energy bid faces plethora of regulatory hurdles,"By David French
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  NextEra Energy Inc  (NYSE:NEE) Chief Executive James Robo joked last week he does not pursue small acquisitions because the reward is not worth the ""brain damage"" of getting them past regulators.
Yet his $65 billion-plus pursuit of  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK) will only pay off if he can overcome major regulatory hurdles in putting together the biggest ever U.S. utility deal, industry experts said.
Duke rebuffed a takeover approach from NextEra, the world's largest producer of renewable energy from wind and sun, as inadequate, Reuters reported last Wednesday. The deal would help accelerate Duke's transition away from coal- and gas-fired power plants.
NextEra, already the largest U.S. utility with a home base in Florida, would need approval from regulators in all six states where Duke operates: Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would also need to assent, and the Department of Justice has authority to review the deal for potential antitrust issues.
""This kind of deal would raise significant regulatory considerations,"" said Jane Rueger, a partner at law firm Perkins Coie.
Florida would be the area of most regulatory concern, according to industry experts. Of the 8.1 million customers served by privately owned electric utilities in 2019, 7.3 million got their power from Duke or NextEra units Florida Power & Light and Gulf Power, according to the Florida Public Service Commission.
Utilities typically pledge to sell assets or build extra transmission lines to assuage anti-monopoly concerns. Duke Energy made such concessions to regulators in the Carolinas and Florida when it bought Progress Energy for $13.7 billion in 2012. 
NextEra, however, would have to give up significant business in Florida and risk upsetting its relationship with regulators ahead of negotiations on new caps being agreed on the electricity rates it can charge, Guggenheim Securities analysts said.
""They could dilute their constructive Florida footprint, chasing after synergies and earnings accretion in less perceived quality states,"" the analysts wrote.
NextEra did not respond to a comment request. Duke declined to comment.
LOST ACQUISITIONS
NextEra has previously lost out on acquisitions by not acquiescing to regulatory demands.
When it sought to buy Texan power utility Oncor for $18.4 billion four years ago, NextEra was asked by the state regulator to operate Oncor at arm's length. NextEra declined, arguing it needed board control and the ability to extract cash to fund its dividend. It lost the deal as a result, with Oncor subsequently acquired by  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE).
NextEra had previously spent two years trying to buy Hawaiian Electric Co for $4.3 billion. It abandoned that deal in 2016, amid regulatory concerns the benefits promised by NextEra to local consumers were insufficient.
To be sure, NextEra has clinched an acquisition in Florida in the past. It paid $5.1 billion for Gulf Power from  Southern Co  (NYSE:SO) in 2018, pledging to cap transmission rates for five years, according to a FERC statement at the time. 
NextEra could also be called upon to make investments in local communities as part of the deal, industry experts said. Utilities are major employers in their state, and regulators often look for commitments that go beyond their standard demands for investment in their grids and restrictions on electricity rate hikes.
Duke has a foundation that contributes around $30 million annually to projects across its coverage area, including offering grants to local organizations and struggling customers, according to its website. The company also sponsors the center for performing arts in Raleigh, North Carolina.
NextEra also promotes its work in local communities on its website, including volunteering, education programs and sponsorship. The company raised $5.2 million for such projects in 2019.

""You would have to explain to each state regulator how a deal would impact their jurisdiction, from the perspective of ratepayers, jobs created or lost, where headquarters will be maintained, and how investment would flow there in the future,"" Rueger, the Perkins Coie lawyer, said.

250,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Moderna vaccine trial contractors fail to enroll enough minorities, prompting slowdown","By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Private contractors hired by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc to recruit volunteers for its coronavirus vaccine trial failed to enroll enough Black, Latino and Native American participants to determine how well the vaccine works in these populations, company executives and vaccine researchers told Reuters.
To make up for the shortfall, Moderna slowed enrollment of its late-stage trial and instructed research centers to focus on increasing participation among minority volunteers, the company said. The effort is being bolstered by academic researchers who have longstanding relationships with organizations in Black and other minority communities.
Five investigators working on the Moderna trial said in interviews that commercial site investigators quickly filled a large portion of the 30,000-person study with mostly white volunteers.
But COVID-19 infects Blacks in the United States at nearly three times the rate of white Americans, and they are twice as likely to die from the virus, according to a report by the National Urban League and other studies.
And communities of color count prominently among healthcare workers and populations at high risk of COVID-19 complications, making them among the first likely to be eligible for a new vaccine, experts said.
Dr. Paul Evans, chief executive of Velocity Clinical Research in Durham, North Carolina, whose company was hired to test the Moderna vaccine at five sites, said efforts to enroll volunteers from diverse backgrounds to provide proper population balance is “notoriously difficult” in any clinical trial.
""If there's a problem with recruiting minorities, and there is, you can't fix that overnight,"" he said.
Black Americans made up only about 7% of the trial as of Sept. 17. That should be closer to 13% to reflect the actual U.S. population.
During the last two weeks of September, Moderna said it increased the proportion of Black enrollment, but declined to provide details.
Increased trial participation could help address distrust between communities of color and the medical industry after years of underrepresentation in pharmaceutical research, historical horror stories of medical experimentation without consent, and socioeconomic and health access inequities, vaccine experts and public health officials say.
One-fourth of Moderna’s 100 trial sites are run by academic centers that are part of the National Institute of Health’s (NIH) COVID-19 Prevention Trials Network (CoVPN), while the rest are largely commercial subcontractors. A contract research organization called PPD (NASDAQ:PPD) was hired by Moderna to oversee the trial sites.
""We are essentially making up"" for the commercial sites, said one CoVPN investigator not authorized to speak publicly.
Dr. Larry Corey, co-leader of CoVPN, said the NIH has invested in clinical trial sites with outreach programs staffed by doctors and nurses with ties to minority communities.
""That's not something that is part of the business model of commercial research organizations,"" Corey said.
Moderna is one of the furthest along in the U.S. race for a vaccine seen as essential to ending a pandemic that has claimed over a million lives worldwide. It received more than $1 billion in government funding to develop and produce its candidate, and another $1.5 billion to supply it to the American public.
ENTRENCHED BARRIERS, VACCINE HESITANCY
PPD referred requests for comment to Moderna. But two of the commercial firms said they had received overwhelming trial participation interest from white volunteers. Several researchers said they struggled to overcome the entrenched barriers that traditionally limit minority enrollment.
Moderna planned from the start to recruit a racially diverse group of volunteers, Chief Executive Stephane Bancel told Reuters. The results were decidedly mixed, and recruitment at some underperforming sites was halted, he said.
On Moderna’s website, as many as 17 of the 100 participating trial sites are listed as active but not recruiting, without listing a reason.
Bancel said the enrollment slowdown, announced in early September, will not keep the company from seeking emergency use authorization (EUA) for its vaccine in the United States, provided initial results show it to be safe and effective.
Moderna could seek an EUA for inoculating high-risk groups such as healthcare workers as early as November. 
The company said it will provide complete data on the more diverse trial group in its formal application seeking commercial approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next year.
Even with that approval, there are likely to be hurdles to convincing Black Americans to take the vaccine.
According to a Pew Research Center survey released in September, only 32% of Black adults said they would definitely or probably get a COVID-19 vaccine, compared with 52% of white adults, 56% of Hispanics and 72% of Asian Americans.
Some trial investigators attributed the minority recruitment shortfall in part to the demands of testing a coronavirus vaccine at unprecedented speed. 
""It essentially was becoming first-come, first-served, and it was skewing towards not getting enough minorities,” said Dr. Rambod Rouhbakhsh, a lead researcher at the MediSync Clinical Research Hattiesburg Clinic in Petal, Mississippi, a commercial site hired by PPD for the Moderna trial.
Dr. Moncef Slaoui, who runs the U.S. Operation Warp Speed program that has funded Moderna’s vaccine and others, joined a virtual town hall last week organized by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Push coalition in Atlanta.
He told Black leaders that minority enrollment in Moderna’s trial had fallen short and appealed for help in encouraging volunteers from the community.
“Developing a vaccine that is not used in a fraction of the population is the same as having no vaccine,"" Slaoui said. ""It is absolutely useless.”

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Macy's (N:M), the largest U.S. department store operator, has signed a deal to invest in Swedish payments group Klarna, joining investors including rapper Snoop Dogg and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in betting on the ""buy now, pay later"" online payments market.
The deal includes a five-year partnership between the two companies under which Macy's customers could choose to make payments in four equal, interest-free installments at the online checkout.
Macy's would be one of the first department store companies to offer Klarna's ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL) service. Klarna has a similar tie-up already with H&M (ST:HMb), the world's second-biggest fashion retailer.
""We are in discussions with some global retailers on exclusive deals,"" Klarna Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Siemiatkowski told Reuters.
""We at Klarna take a very long-term approach and this investment demonstrates a shared commitment and vision to the continual development of retail over the next years to meet customers changing expectations and preferences.""
The value of Macy's investment was not disclosed.
Klarna allows shoppers to buy online through its merchant partners and settle the dues in four installments. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in online shopping.
""We're excited to embark on a long-term relationship with Klarna that will help us reach wider audiences looking for seamless alternative payment solutions,"" Macy's Chief Digital Officer Matt Baer said in a statement.
The United States is one of the largest markets for BNPL services, with intense competition between the likes of PayPal (O:PYPL), Afterpay (AX:APT), Affirm and other fintech companies.
Klarna alone recorded 550% growth in the U.S. market in the first half of this year. That helped it raise $650 million last month, valuing the company at $10.65 billion - nearly double the valuation at a funding round in August last year. 

Klarna's investors include Silver Lake, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, and Sequoia, among others.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open slightly lower Tuesday, giving back some of Monday’s outsized gains, as investors turn their attention back to the impact on the economy from the Covid-19 virus after President Donald Trump returned to the White House.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, lower, the Dow Futures contract traded flat, while Nasdaq 100 Futures were down 42 points, or 0.4%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.7% on Monday to hit a new one-month high, while the S&P 500 index gained 1.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite index added 2.3%.
President Trump returned to the White House on Monday after a three-night hospital stay following treatment for Covid-19, and while he’s still on medication, the risk that he might be forced to withdraw from the presidential election appears to have receded..
As a result, investors are now turning their attention back to the economic outlook with the coronavirus continuing to cause havoc. States in the U.S. Northeast are now seeing infections accelerate, after appearing to bring the virus under control in the spring and summer, with New York reporting nearly 10,000 new cases last week.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak about the economic outlook around 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT) at a meeting of the National Association for Business Economics.
Last week saw nonfarm payrolls rising just 661,000 in September, way below expectations, suggesting that the recovery in the labor market was slowing.
With that in mind, the Fed’s favourite employment release is due out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT), with the latest Jolts number expected to see 6.68 million job openings during August, largely unchanged from 6.618 million in July.
A lot will depend on whether U.S. lawmakers can agree on a new coronavirus relief fund. There is some optimism on that front after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held lengthy discussions on Monday. They are set to talk again Tuesday. 
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday as another storm formed in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with tropical storm Delta forcing a number of oil platforms to be evacuated as it heads toward Louisiana and Florida.
The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly assessment of U.S. oil inventories at 4:30 PM ET (2030 GMT), while the U.S. government also releases its regular Short-Term Energy Outlook.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $39.61 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1% to $41.70.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean retail investors ponied up over $50 billion as they sought to lay their hands on shares in Big Hit Entertainment, the management label of K-pop sensation BTS - more than 600 times the value of shares on offer.
The combined 58.4 trillion won ($50.3 billion) in orders fell just shy of a record 58.55 trillion won in bids for the retail portion of Kakao Games' listing in September.
Most of the bids for Big Hit's stock, priced at 135,000 won per share, came late on the second of two days of orders from individual investors.
""I waited until 2 p.m. this afternoon to subscribe because I wanted to choose the arranger with less competition for bidding,"" said Oh Sang-min, a 32-year old retail worker who placed bids worth 100 million won after taking out a loan.
He was told by his money manager that he would be able to pick up just two shares. 
There has been some concern that funds pouring in from retail investors could affect short-term money markets as the funds would be at brokerages' disposal for three days before investors who are not allocated shares get their money back.
But the total amount of retail bids did not match some heady forecasts of 100 trillion won, and market sources said on Tuesday they were monitoring the situation but were not overly concerned about the impact.
Some analysts said talk that the band's members may have to complete mandatory military service could have prevented retail demand from reaching such lofty heights.
By law, all able-bodied men in South Korea aged between 18 and 28 must serve in the military for roughly two years as part of the country's defences against North Korea.
But there have also been growing calls for BTS members to be granted alternatives or delays to the service, with some lawmakers and fans arguing they are doing plenty for their country without wearing a soldier's uniform.
The band, supported by a massive global fan base, has just notched up the first No.1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart by a South Korean group with the song ""Dynamite"".
Offering about 20% of the company in its IPO, Big Hit Entertainment, led by CEO Bang Si-hyuk, has raised some 962.6 billion won ($830 million). In the institutional portion of the offer, investors expressed interest in more than 1,000 times the number of shares on offer.
The label is due to make its market debut on Oct. 15.

255,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 05:51AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Johnson's Wind Pledge Pushes Renewable Stocks to New Highs,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Renewable energy stocks outperformed again on Tuesday, as the latest announcements from the U.K. government illustrated the momentum behind the vast shift to lceaner energy sources.
Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN) hit a 12-year high while Vestas Wind Systems, its biggest rival in the wind turbine business touched an all-time high after news that the U.K. will commit extra funding to ensure that it reaches its target of 40 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030 – enough (theoretically) to power every home in the country.
Wind farm operators Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) and Encavis  (DE:HWAG) also hit all-time highs, while  Nordex  (DE:NDXG) stock also rose over 8%, although the German turbine company’s reaction was more to news of a big order in the U.S. which raised hopes that it can finally crack that market open.
The commitment to accelerate Britain’s green transition was one of the less noticed parts of a Conservative election manifesto last December that was more focused on pushing Brexit through. It’s being wheeled out again now, as the centerpiece of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s speech to the Conservative Party’s (virtual) annual conference, as a welcome distraction from a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic that is once again testing the government’s administrative capacity to the limit.
However, it is more than just a distraction. Covid-19 will, with luck, be tamed next year as vaccines finally reach the general population. The energy transition is the longer game, backed by a wall of institutional money that has fled fossil fuel stocks this year. The U.K.’s plan foresees the country reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, some 10 years before China under its new plan.
We’ve written here before that the renewables sector is now – like any other with a credible growth narrative - extremely expensive. Orsted now trades at 79 times trailing earnings, while its admittedly smaller and faster-growing peer Encavis trades at over 110 times. Vestas trades at 56x.
Such value as is left in the sector is largely buried deep within the balance sheets of the old integrated utilities, which have the power to release it through spinning off renewables businesses that should instantly command higher valuations. Italy’s  Enel  (MI:ENEI), Germany’s RWE (DE:RWEG) and even Electricite de France (PA:EDF) fall into this category (for all that EDF remains a play on the treatment of its nuclear business, as the last week’s price action has shown). Engie SA (PA:ENGIE) may well join the ranks now that it has money from the sale of its Suez stake to throw at new projects.
But even with such caveats, every further hard commitment by governments to push the green agenda make the current multiples less demanding. The growing hints from the European Central Bank that it will actively intervene in credit markets to ensure easier access for renewable companies than for fossil fuel ones do likewise.  
Then there is the ultimate glittering prize for investors in the sector: the chance that the U.S. elections in November will finally remove Climate Change deniers and the oil and gas lobby from the levers of power at federal level, restoring at least some of the federal tax advantages that the industry had before 2016 and putting the U.S. irrevocably back into the Paris Climate Accord, with all that that implies for green mandates. The best may still be yet to come, even allowing for all the things that need to go right over the next decade."

Kering has increasingly focused on its high-margin luxury brands like Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga in recent years, spinning off 70% of Puma to its shareholders in 2018.
Puma struggled after it was bought by Kering for 5.3 billion euros in 2007, but it has enjoyed a revival in the last few years, helped by sponsorships of top soccer teams and partnerships with celebrities like Rihanna and Selena Gomez.
The sale reduces Kering's stake in Puma to 9.8% from a previous 15.7%. Kering, which had announced its plan to sell the stake on Tuesday, said the transaction corresponded to a selling price of 74.50 euros per share.
Puma's shares traded down 3.1% at 75.7 euros at 0728 GMT. 
In July, Puma reported second-quarter sales fell a currency-adjusted 30.7% to 831 million euros and earnings before interest and taxes slumped to a loss of 114.8 million euros as coronavirus lockdowns closed most global sports stores.
However, sales have rebounded as stores have reopened and the pandemic has encouraged more people to take up exercising, with rival  Nike  (N:NKE) posting better-than-expected results in September and giving a strong sales forecast.
The Nike results had helped Puma shares to return to levels last seen before coronavirus hit in March.

Investing.com - European stock markets have edged lower Tuesday as coronavirus concerns tempered any enthusiasm generated by signs of recovery in the dominant German manufacturing sector and reduced U.S. political uncertainty.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.5%.
German factory orders rose for a fourth month, climbing 4.5% in August, in the latest sign that Europe’s largest economy, with its concentration on heavy industry, is faring better than its services-focused peers in recovering from the pandemic.
Yet coronavirus cases continue to mount, with over 35 million affected globally, more than a million dead and many countries imposing new economic restrictions as daily case growth accelerates.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) has downgraded its investment stance on Continental European stocks to underweight, saying it's worried about “a second Covid-19 wave, more EPS downgrades, extended valuations and a chaotic U.S. election.” Adding, ""the region’s cyclical tilt will leave it vulnerable if economic recovery stalls. A strong euro will also weigh on corporate performance.” The bank kept its view on U.K. stocks at neutral and U.S. equities at overweight. 
The world's top central bankers have offered up unparalleled levels of monetary largesse during the global pandemic, but markets will be looking for hints of more when top officials from the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan speak Tuesday at a virtual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics.
Late Monday, President Donald Trump returned to the White House on Monday after a three-night hospital stay following treatment for Covid-19, likely removing an area of uncertainty ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election, while confidence is also growing that U.S. lawmakers can agree to a new stimulus package.
In corporate news, Suez (PA:SEVI) stock rose 5% after rival Veolia (PA:VIE), up 1.4%, bought 29.9% of the French waste and water firm and launched a tender offer on the rest of the capital. Suez has pledged to fight the takeover attempt.
Puma (DE:PUMG) dropped 2.8% after French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP)completed the sale of a 5.9% stake in the German sports gear maker for approximately 656 million euros ($772 million).
 Premier Oil  (LON:PMO)stock jumped 12% after announcing plans to merge with Chrysaor, bringing together two of the largest U.K. North Sea oil and gas producers.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday as hopes grow over a new U.S. economic stimulus package. Data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday and the U.S. government on Wednesday will be studied to see whether demand is picking up.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $39.23 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $41.33. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,914.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1780.

The comment is a reiteration of his long-held position but the first time he has spoken at length on the topic since speculation of European bank mergers heated up in recent weeks.
""Consolidation needs to happen in Europe,"" Sewing was quoted as saying. ""It's important that we're not a junior partner.""
Last year, Deutsche Bank called off merger talks with its smaller domestic rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). It also briefly explored a tie-up with Swiss lender UBS (S:UBSG).
Sewing told Bloomberg TV that he was ""laser-focused"" on his current strategy but that if the bank's share price were to recover ""we then have a different position, a better position"" in considering big deals.
Deutsche Bank shares hit a record low earlier this year but have since bounced back to gain 6.4% so far this year.

Last month, Deutsche Bank's finance chief James von Moltke underscored the logic behind big bank mergers and said the bank was preparing to ""engage in merger activity when the time comes and the right opportunities arise"".

The deal will be a relief to London-based Premier, which has spent most of the year laboring to restructure its debt, during which time its shares have tumbled 85%. The deal includes an agreement on the reorganization of Premier’s existing debt and cross-currency swaps.
“The transaction will create the largest independent oil and gas company listed on the London Stock Exchange with combined production of over 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent day,” Premier said Tuesday in a statement. The combined group will have “significant international growth opportunities.”
Chrysaor shareholders will get at least 77% of the combined company. Premier’s stakeholders will get the rest, with the exact amount depending on the conversion of some of its debt into equity.
Premier’s $2.7 billion of total gross debt and certain hedging liabilities will be repaid and cancelled on completion, according to the statement. A cash payment of $1.23 billion will be made to Premier’s creditors, who will also receive shares in the combined group. Premier’s $400 million of letters of credit will be refinanced.
Chrysaor, a North Sea-focused business founded in 2007, made a big splash in the region in 2017 when it paid $3 billion for a package of assets from Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc. The company, backed by private equity firm Harbour Energy Ltd., has since become the No. 1 oil and gas producer in Britain, having bought assets from Spirit Energy in 2018, as well as ConocoPhillips’s U.K. division.

""Suez takes note of the purchase by Veolia of 29.9% of its capital in a hostile manner and under unprecedented and irregular conditions"", Suez said in a statement.
""The group confirms that it will use all the means at its disposal to protect the interests of its employees, its clients and all its stakeholders, in particular to ensure equal and fair treatment of all its shareholders and avoid a creeping takeover or de facto control"", it added.
Veolia said on Monday it would launch its tender offer at 18 euros a share, the same price it offered power group Engie (PA:ENGIE) for the 29.9% stake, in a deal that would value Suez at 11.2 billion euros ($13.20 billion).
The group also said it wanted to resume discussions with Suez, after pledging not to launch its tender offer until it got approval from its target's board.
The French state, a major shareholder in Engie, voted against selling the 29.9% stake to Veolia, given the hostile nature of the takeover.
Veolia has argued the deal will create a ""world super champion"" in waste and water management, better-equipped to take on rivals emerging from China, while the takeover would also lead to cost savings of 500 million euros from the first year.

265,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 02:50AM ET</span>","Hit by commodity defaults, banks in Singapore develop digital trade registry","By Anshuman Daga and Jessica Jaganathan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest banks in commodity trade finance are creating a digital trade finance registry in Singapore to reduce risk of trade fraud and boost transparency after losing billions of dollars due to a spate of defaults.
Banks have pared their commodities business this year following collapses, including that of Singapore oil trader Hin Leong Trading (Pte) Ltd, which shocked lenders after instances of financial wrongdoing were laid bare by the coronavirus crisis.
According to a joint statement issued on Tuesday, DBS Group (SI:DBSM) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) are leading a group of 12 other banks in Singapore to create and conduct a central database to access trade transactions financed across banks.
""A digital trade registry strengthens trade financing banks' ability to avoid duplicate financing, and facilitates more sustained credit flow in trade financing,"" said Ho Hern Shin, an assistant managing director at the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
The move comes after investigations into commodity trading firms revealed that multiple layers of financing from different lenders were obtained for the same inventory.
Eugene Tarzimanov, a senior credit officer at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service, said the latest move was ""credit positive"" for banks as it will reduce the risk of fraud seen in recent years.
""Moreover, the registry will make it easier for smaller commodity traders to access bank credit in Singapore, as their lenders will be more confident that the collateral is really there,"" he told Reuters.
Reuters first reported in July that commodity trade financiers are teaming up in the city-state to strengthen lending practices and improve transparency. 
Developed on a blockchain network supported by technology provider dltledgers, DBS and StanChart said they developed the trial project in three months with banks including ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd), ANZ (AX:ANZ),  Deutsche Bank  (NDE:DBKGn), OCBC (SI:OCBC) and Rabobank.
After the pilot project is completed, it will be implemented as ""an industry utility to enhance trade financing practices within Singapore, before expanding it globally to cover major trade corridors at a later stage,"" according to the statement.

The registry's proof of concept is supported by Enterprise Singapore (ESG), a government agency that promotes trade, and endorsed by the main representative body of banks.

Chairman Bob Dench has begun the process to find Bester's successor, the bank said.
Bester - who joined the bank in July 2018 - has committed to remain in place until that process is complete to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. The effective date of his departure will be confirmed in due course.
In August, the bank said it would cut around 350 jobs and close 18 branches as the coronavirus crisis forced it to reduce costs.
The Co-Operative Bank is one of several British challenger lenders attempting to challenge the dominance of the Big Four high-street banks including Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY), HSBC (L:HSBA), NatWest Group (L:NWG) and  Barclays  (L:BARC).
But like others, it has found its progress hampered by low interest rates, blistering mortgage competition and erratic consumer demand for loans as Britain's economy is rocked by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It now joins larger rival Lloyds in the search for a new leader after its CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio said earlier this year that he would be leaving the bank once a successor was found.
Bester's achievements during his short tenure include a transformation of the bank's IT systems and its separation from The Co-Op Group as well as improvements in customer satisfaction levels, the bank said.
""My ambition was to complete the major transformation phase of the turnaround and for our franchise to show resilience,"" Bester said in the statement.

268,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 06, 2020 02:36AM ET</span>",Nintendo Bulls Betting Switch Can Provide Gaming’s iPhone Moment,"(Bloomberg) -- With  Nintendo Co  (OTC:NTDOY). stock approaching its all-time high, there are some who see the creator of the Super Mario franchise as approaching a pivotal moment that could turn its flagship  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) into a perpetual gaming platform and break free of the industry’s traditional boom-bust cycle.
While many longtime Nintendo watchers wonder if the high watermark is near, others say strap in: like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., they say, Nintendo’s stock is poised to head to the moon, with some expecting the stock to double, triple or even rise five times. Shares are up 30% this year, with Switch sales up 95% in the first half.
Some Nintendo bulls believe the company can transform into one that’s able to roll out incremental new platforms while retaining its user base. Hit products such as the Wii were often followed by much less successful ones, such as the disastrous Wii U. With each new console, the Kyoto-based gaming company rolled the dice on making the new machine a success, and while it got things right this generation with the Switch, a successor console would have no guarantee of similar sales.
“With every console generation, the install base resets to zero and their earnings power essentially resets to zero,” said Toan Tran of investment manager 10 West Advisors. He says Nintendo can break free by releasing a new and more powerful iteration of the Switch every few years. “They can continuously have an install base of say 100 million consoles out there, that just moves along over time.”
That kind of perpetual platform model already exists: Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s iPhone. Like the smartphone, new versions of the Switch could be backwards-compatible with all games released so far while becoming more powerful and feature-rich. That would keep customers locked into Nintendo’s entertainment ecosystem — on top of its exclusive first-party titles — while making profits and sales more predictable.
Multibagger Potential
While Nintendo has frequently made reference to extending the Switch’s lifetime compared to previous consoles, it has not said it is pursuing an Apple-like business model. And whether it could or would even want to pursue this model remains up for debate. One factor for skeptics is that sticking to the Switch could limit the bold hardware innovation Nintendo has relentlessly pursued in its devices — from the Wii’s motion controller to glasses-free 3D technology of the 3DS to the portable console innovation of the Switch.
Buoyed by growing demand for its consoles that Nintendo still can’t match, shares recently broke through the psychologically important 50,000 yen barrier with the all-time high of 73,200 yen in sight. Nintendo forecasts revenue will decline slightly this year to 1.2 trillion yen, despite a pandemic-fueled record first quarter. Conservative to the point of parody, the outlook is all-but-certain to be upgraded. Analysts predict, on average, that Nintendo will report sales of 1.42 trillion yen for the fiscal year to March.
Retail investors in the U.S., whose influence on the market has been surging, have also started to take notice of the stock, with Nintendo one of the most-held Japanese stocks by users of the Robinhood app. Shares rose as much as 1.4% in Tokyo trading on Tuesday.
“Its valuation continues to be inexplicably low,” said Aaron Edelheit, chief executive officer of Mindset Capital. “The company is innovating at a level that no one is giving them credit for.”
Nintendo is in the same position facing  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). in 2013, according to Edelheit: unloved by investors, misunderstood and facing a crossroads for its business model. Eventually, Nintendo will turn into a “multibagger” with the potential for shares to rise fivefold, he said.
Nintendo trades at around 20 times estimated 12-month earnings compared with an average of around 38 times for the so-called FAANG group of U.S. tech giants.
Yet many long-time Nintendo watchers have heard this before and remain skeptical. Investors are still scarred by the stock’s dramatic plunge at the peak of the Wii’s success, and the company’s failure to capitalize on what was at one point one of the world’s most recognizable brands when it bungled the rollout of the Wii U.
“The peak is higher than what I was forecasting before, because of Covid — but the peak is still next year,” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Group, who predicts that earnings will peak in the next fiscal year, which ends March 2022. “The bulls themselves don’t have proper growth beyond next year.”
Goyal upgraded the stock to a buy in September with a price target of 69,500 yen and is positive on the company’s near-term prospects, but said that “based on what we know today, the upside is very limited beyond 70,000 yen.” Goyal wrote in September that the pandemic had given Nintendo “one more year to fix its long-term strategy before the market starts worrying about Switch cycle earnings peak.”
At a recent briefing, management dropped hints of using its Nintendo Account to lock users in, something it couldn’t do with Super Nintendo or Wii users, and gave a sly reference to its next gaming system launching in “20XX” (not, as many noted, “202X”).
“We can’t simply follow what other companies are doing or chase the latest technology trends,” Nintendo said in the presentation — perhaps a nudge at critics who for years have said it should abandon developing its own hardware and shift to mobile games.
The briefing also frustrated many investors who have called on Nintendo to give more clarity on its future plans. It was also notable for what it didn’t announce — no change to its earnings forecasts, and no mention of a rumored more powerful iteration of the Switch. Bloomberg News has reported that Nintendo plans to debut the new model next year.
“The million dollar question here is, is Nintendo the hits-driven cyclical that defined its history pre-2017?” says Ryan O’Connor, the portfolio manager of Kansas City-based investment firm Crossroads Capital. He says no, and is convinced Nintendo has dropped enough hints to justify his long-held belief that the Switch will be a perpetual platform and not the latest cycle.
Roblox, Fortnite
Matthew Ball (NYSE:BLL), a former head of strategy at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Studios and the managing partner at Epyllion Industries, warned in an essay that Nintendo risks getting left behind as users’ habits shift in the age of online gaming.
“Nintendo’s games are more popular than they’ve ever been and they’re also as creatively inspired as ever. There is no foreseeable future without millions of die-hard Nintendo fans,” he told Bloomberg News. “But in the first ten days of the month, more time will be spent playing Roblox or Minecraft or Fortnite or Grand Theft Auto than the lifetime playtime of the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.”
Bulls and bears alike can point to evidence backing up their case. Nintendo’s paid online accounts are booming, with more than 26 million members, up 73% since January. Yet its mobile efforts continue to languish, with the gamemaker seemingly content to retreat from the sector while concentrating on the Switch.
But perhaps the factor that most limits the upside is the company’s management itself. Nintendo has long been conservative in its approach to investors, and has become increasingly reluctant to share even its pipeline of forthcoming games, much less grand ideas that could inform investors of its long-term prospects. That reluctance is seen in a longtime refusal to countenance a stock split — a method Apple and Tesla have both employed this year.
A split could be transformational for potential Japanese retail traders — at 56,920 yen a share with a round lot of 100 shares, an investor needs a minimum of almost 6 million yen, more than the national average salary. Pleas for a split have met with deaf ears, even though it would likely also smooth Nintendo’s entry into the benchmark Nikkei 225 index.
“I think Western investors get frustrated with the company’s anti-promotional style in a time when companies like Tesla are dominating the market with over-the-top promotional styles,” Edelheit said.
But management’s reluctance to engage with the market doesn’t put off the most bullish, who say the market will get there in time itself.
“I don’t think there’s any reasonable future outcome that’s not a multiple of the current price — even if management stays impossibly insular and trollish when it comes to investors,” O’Connor said. He started adding to his Nintendo position in March when he realized the effect the pandemic would have.
“Results over the next few years will force the market to recognize Nintendo’s true value.”

Industrial conglomerate Senaat, owned by ADQ, has submitted a non-binding offer to the board of  Agthia Group  (AD:AGTHIA), an Abu Dhabi-listed food company, to transfer the majority of Al Foah Company into Agthia, ADQ said on Tuesday.
Al Foah, owned by Senaat, is the world's largest date processing and packaging company.
""The proposed transaction would combine two leaders in their complementary food and beverage product categories to create one of the top 10 consumer F&B players in the MENA region,"" ADQ said in a statement.
The combined entity would become a ""domestic champion"" in water, dates, flour, and animal feed, it said.
According to the proposal, Senaat would transfer the entire issued share capital of Al Foah to Agthia in exchange of a convertible instrument issued by Agthia to Senaat and convertible into 120 million ordinary shares of Agthia after the transaction is closed.
The price at which the convertible instrument will convert would be 3.75 dirhams per share, implying an equity value of 450 million dirhams ($122.52 million) for Al Foah, ADQ said.
After the transaction, Senaat would own 59.17% of the entire issued share capital of Agthia, up from the 51% it currently owns.
ADQ, which was established in 2018, owns strategic assets such as Abu Dhabi Ports, Abu Dhabi Airport and bourse operator ADX. It has also built up a portfolio of food and agriculture businesses and recently took a 22% stake in Dubai-based courier Aramex.
Abu Dhabi has seen some of its largest firms merge in the last few years in response to an earlier oil price slump.
Efforts have intensified this year, with deals including the consolidation of two Abu Dhabi utilities under ADQ and the combination of national contracting firms in the oil and gas services sector.

271,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 11:20PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, With Trump Discharged from Hospital","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, following the U.S. market’s lead after U.S. President Donald Trump was discharged from hospital and with the country’s lawmakers moving closer to passing the latest stimulus measures.
Trump, who tested positive for the COVID-19 during the previous week alongside wife Melania Trump, returned to the White House on Monday after a three-night stay at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
However, White House physician Sean Conley warned that Trump may “not be out of the woods yet” and he will remain under medical surveillance.
It remains to be seen how Trump’s brush with COVID-19 will impact the Nov. 3 presidential election. Meanwhile, the vice-presidential debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris will take place on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed new COVID-19 relief package, among other topics, during a phone call on Tuesday. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also said that potential for an agreement between the Republicans and Democrats on more economic relief measures is still there, and Trump is also committed to seeing the measures passed. However, with COVID-19 spreading among key policy maker figures, including Trump, investors’ optimism is also tinged with caution.
But some investors stressed the need for additional stimulus measures to be passed as the number of COVID-19 cases, in both the U.S. and globally, continues to tick upwards.
“Investors are likely running with the idea that recent data and President Trump’s firsthand experience with the virus increases the odds of another fiscal package … it is becoming harder to deny the need for additional fiscal support,” EP Wealth Advisors director of portfolio strategy Adam Phillips told Bloomberg.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched down 0.06% by 11:15 PM ET (3:15 AM GMT), reversing some earlier gains. The Reserve Bank of Australia will hand down its policy decisions later in the day, and the government will also table its latest budget.
Although the central bank is expected to keep its benchmark interest rates unchanged at 0.25%, there are expectations of a cut to 0.10% in some corners.

The German software group, which has 440,000 clients, appealed on Tuesday to other companies to join it in supporting small businesses owned and run by women or minorities.
SAP's procurement initiative follows its launch in June of a product to help firms track greenhouse gas emissions in supply chains, backing a view that being transparent about their carbon footprint will be good for business.
The new initiative relates to so-called addressable spend, the share of a company's procurement budget that can be allocated to social or diverse enterprises, which in SAP's case equated to up to $60 million a year.
""We all need soap in our washrooms, landscaping for our offices, food and drink in our cafeterias, marketing services and office supplies. These and many more are all products and services provided by social enterprises and diverse businesses,"" SAP board member Adaire Fox-Martin said. 

""This is money we are spending anyway. Why not spend it with suppliers who are delivering social impact as well?""

273,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>","Northern Star Agrees to Acquire Saracen, Reviving Gold M&A Spree","(Bloomberg) -- Northern Star Resources Ltd. agreed to buy smaller Australian rival Saracen Mineral Holdings Ltd. to boost gold output amid surging prices and create a new top 10 global producer with a market valuation of about A$16 billion ($11.5 billion).
Adding Saracen’s assets in Australia will put the company on track to produce 2 million ounces a year from fiscal 2027 and deliver as much as A$2 billion in operational savings, Perth-based Northern Star, the country’s second-largest gold miner, said Tuesday in a statement.
The combination of the producers, which already jointly run Australia’s giant KCGM operation -- commonly known as the Super Pit -- may mark a revival of major deal-making in the gold sector, which has ebbed since a two-year long spree through last year that included Newmont Corp.’s mega-merger with Goldcorp Inc.
Deals in the sector worth about $9.8 billion have been completed, or agreed, so far this year, compared to about $26 billion in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Northern Star has added more than $1 billion of acquisitions since August 2018, the data show.
“This is significant value-creating M&A,” Northern Star Executive Chairman Bill Beament said in the statement. “Our position as joint venture partners at KCGM, the close proximity of the majority of the combined company’s assets and a host of other synergies makes this a unique opportunity.”
A combined producer will operate three clusters of assets, in the Kalgoorlie and Yandal regions of Western Australia and around the Pogo mine in Alaska, and be in a position to accelerate growth opportunities, according to the statement.
Spot gold prices touched a record in August, surging above $2,000 an ounce on increased geopolitical risks and as sliding U.S. real yields enhanced the metal’s haven status. Bullion was little changed Tuesday, trading at $1,912.76 an ounce as of 10:25 a.m. in Sydney.
Under the deal, Northern Star offered 0.3763 of its shares for every Saracen share, equivalent to A$5.20 a share, according to Bloomberg calculations. Saracen holders will also receive a special dividend of 3.8 Australian cents a share, according to the statement. Northern Star will own 64% of the new entity.
The boards of both companies have recommended the transaction, which is expected to be completed in February.
Northern Star’s Chief Executive Officer Stuart Tonkin will remain in his post, with Saracen’s Raleigh Finlayson to act as managing director for 12-to-18 months before taking on a corporate development role. Beament will remain in his position until July, when he’ll become non-executive chairman.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",Southwest seeks pay cuts from unions to avoid layoffs through 2021,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) said on Monday it is asking unions to agree to pay cuts in order to prevent furloughs and layoffs through 2021 as the industry struggles to stem losses from the coronavirus pandemic in the absence of more federal aid.
Unions represent about 83% of roughly 61,000 Southwest employees. Non-union staff salaries will be cut by 10% until Jan. 1, 2022, when they will return to the current level.
""Our objectives are to make this quick and simple and avoid furloughs,"" Chief Executive Gary Kelly said in an interview.
The union representing Southwest pilots said it had tentatively agreed to meet and discuss cost savings if a second COVID-19 relief package does not pass in Washington. The flight attendants and mechanics unions did not immediately comment.
Rivals American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) began furloughing 32,000 employees last week when a ban on job cuts expired without another $25 billion in federal payroll support that airlines have been seeking.
Southwest, which has never furloughed any workers, has said it may have to follow suit as air travel remains down 70%.
""We would have to wipe out a large swath of salaries, wages and benefits to match the low traffic levels, to have any hope of just breaking even,"" Kelly told employees, warning that quarterly losses could be in the billions until a effective vaccine is widely available.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday said an airline deal was ""imminent,"" and talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for a broad economic stimulus package were continuing this week.
If federal aid passes, Southwest would reverse any pay cuts. Without it, cost savings must be in place for all employee groups by Jan. 1, 2021, said Kelly, who is reducing his base salary to zero through the end of 2021 and continuing a 20% cut in senior executives' pay through next year.
Airlines including Southwest have parked jets and scaled back their flight schedules in an attempt to match 1970s levels of demand.
But with a stronger balance sheet than most rivals, Southwest is playing offense as it tries to open new routes and pick up clients in a market he expects will see ""brutal low fare competition."" 

""We don't need furloughs, but we need some cost reductions,"" Kelly said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration aid on Monday it would extend temporary waivers of minimum flight requirements at some major U.S. airports through late March 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Airlines can lose their slots at congested airports if they do not use them at least 80% of the time. The FAA said it would extend the waivers at New York's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that were set to expire in October.
At four other U.S. airports where the FAA has a formal schedule-review process - Chicago O’Hare, Newark, New Jersey, Los Angeles and San Francisco - the agency proposes to extend credits to airlines for flights that were canceled due to the coronavirus as though those flights were operated through Dec. 31.
Major airline groups cited ""historically low levels of bookings, with overall bookings down 82% year-on-year for 2020 compared to the outlook for 2019; consumer demand that continues to fall ... and the need for schedule flexibility to support sustainable loads.""
The FAA, which first proposed the extensions on Sept. 11, said on Monday it ""seeks to ensure the efficient use of valuable aviation infrastructure and maximize the benefits to both airport users and the traveling public.""
United Airlines (O:UAL) praised the FAA decision ""to harmonize procedures and timelines for all airports, which will help provide more stability and certainty during this historic pandemic.""
 Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) said it opposed the FAA’s proposal in its entirety as ""unacceptably protective of dominant

incumbent carriers at the expense of the traveling public and of low-cost carriers ready and willing to serve.""

(Reuters) - AppLovin Corp, the U.S. mobile app and gaming company backed by private equity firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR), has hired  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) to lead preparations for an initial public offering (IPO) which could come early in 2021, according to people familiar with the matter.
The company has flirted with the idea of an IPO for years, but had never taken a concrete preparatory step. It is the latest mobile gaming startup to eye a stock market listing, as demand for video games surges among consumers staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The sources requested anonymity because the IPO preparations are confidential and cautioned that the plans are subject to market conditions. 
""Today gaming is a fractured, fragmented market. I think the market will consolidate, and I think AppLovin will be one of those consolidators,"" Ted Oberwager, a managing director in KKR's technology, media and telecommunications team and an AppLovin board member, said in an interview. He declined to comment on the IPO plans. 
AppLovin and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
AppLovin has been profitable since it was founded in 2012 as a mobile games advertising platform. It expects to generate roughly $1.5 billion in revenue for 2020, according to one of the sources, who is familiar with the company's finances. 
By comparison, gaming platform  Unity Software Inc  (N:U) went public last month at a valuation of $13.7 billion after reporting revenue for the first six months of 2020 of $351 million. Its shares have risen more than 60% since the IPO. 
In 2018, KKR acquired a minority stake in AppLovin for $400 million, valuing the company at $2 billion. AppLovin now expects to command a substantially higher valuation, the sources said. 
In 2018, AppLovin also began a media division, Lion Studios, to work with developers to promote and publish apps.
It has expanded further into gaming through a string of acquisitions and investments, including Machine Zone, Belarusian game studio Belka Games, PeopleFun and Firecraft Studios. 
In the last 12 months, AppLovin has also hired Herald Chen as chief financial officer. He joined from KKR, where he was head of technology, media and telecom in the Americas and led the firm's investment in AppLovin.
U.S. consumer spending on video gaming hit a record $11.6 billion in the second quarter, up 30% on the year-ago period, according to research firm NPD Group. 
Gaming giant Roblox Corporation is also working with investment banks to prepare for a U.S. stock market listing that could come early next year and which the online gaming platform expects could double its recent $4 billion valuation, Reuters reported last week.

Filings by individuals, however, are lower so far this year courtesy of government relief efforts.
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings totaled 747 last month, up from 420 a year earlier and from 525 in August, legal services firm Epiq said in a monthly report. Year-to-date filings total 5,529, a third higher than in the first three quarters of 2019.
""These commercial filings are primarily small businesses that do not have access to capital or stimulus,"" Deirdre O’Connor, managing director of corporate restructuring at Epiq, said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, those bankruptcies will continue to rise in the current economic environment.""
By contrast, noncommercial bankruptcies are lower year-to-date, largely as government relief programs such as the CARES Act helped to forestall a wave of individual insolvencies. 
Chapter 13 non-commercial filings are down 43% in 2020, with 118,306 filings versus 206,933 filings in the first nine months of 2019.

Investing.com -- Stocks surged Monday as the odds of agreement on another round of stimulus improved and a jump in oil prices carried the energy sector.
As usual, tech contributed to a broad gain in stocks, including gains by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Stocks were already trading higher for much of the day when President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that he would be leaving the hospital at 6:30 PM ET, boosting shares even more.
The chance for more fiscal stimulus, which broadly speaking would include payments to households under a certain income and support for businesses, put some fire under value stocks like financials.
There are a bunch of speeches by officials from the Federal Reserve this week. The morning will also see new data on business hiring activities. Big declines in movie theater stocks on Monday could suggest a grim outlook for entertainment stocks.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Data on hiring trends
The monthly Jolts job opening August is due out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect to see 6.68 million job openings compared to 6.618 million in July.
The Bureau of Labor statistics compiles the data based on input from from employers about their recruitment and hiring activities. Last week, the monthly report on jobs showed hiring slowed. Nonfarm payrolls rose 661,000 in September, below expectations. 
2. Fed Chairman speaks again
Fed Chairman Jay Powell is scheduled to speak around 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT) at a meeting of the National Association for Business Economics.
Powell is expected to talk about the economic outlook. Last month the Fed changed its forecasts. Gross domestic product now reflects a smaller decline than previously estimated and a lower year-end unemployment rate.  
3. Movie stocks could be bad sign 
Entertainment stocks could get attention after a 36% plunge by Cineworld Group (LON:CINE) on Monday. The second-largest theater chain said it was closing all U.K. and U.S. locations, leaving 45,000 jobs hanging. That includes 536 Regal theaters in the U.S. The move reflects the reluctance of studios to release new films, including the already delayed James Bond film, now moved to April.
Cineworld touched a 52-week low on Monday and shares of rival theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) fell 11%. Casino operator MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) dipped 0.4%, while Caesars Entertainment Corporation (NASDAQ:CZR) rose 0.3%.

In other tech news, DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) jumped 3.5% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight, citing strong fundamentals.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) said on Monday it is rolling out a digital financial planning tool, wading into a space that has so far been dominated by fintech companies.
Life Plan, a new functionality on Bank of America's website and app, allows customers to set multiple goals like buying a home, improving credit or saving for retirement, and uses its existing trove of client data to serve them recommendations.
Such personalized advice used to be reserved for high-net worth customers who had enough cash to retain a financial advisor to help manage their wealth, but a host of digital budgeting tools, like  Intuit  Inc (NASDAQ:INTU)'s Mint app, have used artificial intelligence to bring planning to the masses.
""Planning is no longer an activity that's born out of how much money you have,"" said digital planning executive Evelyn Varner. 
Bank of America, which operates one of the largest wirehouses catering to America's richest households, has been building out its product set to capture customers lower on the wealth spectrum.
The tool, which launched nationally on Monday, has already helped the bank better target customers, executives said. During the eight-month long pilot period, Life Plan led to over 3,800 referrals for conversations with bankers.
It could also give the megabank more control over its customers' data as they use the bank's tools over third-party applications, executives said. Since Life Plan is linked to customers' bank accounts, the bank can provide a fuller picture of someone's financial situation without requiring multiple sign-ins or verifications.
""We're not necessarily targeting and replacing something that clients may be using or comfortable with,"" said Teron Douglas, chief digital executive. ""But it's certainly something that we feel is going to naturally happen as the clients continue to engage.""

288,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 03:27PM ET</span>",Apple Cements Status as the Only Stock That Matters for Managers,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s unprecedented market weight creates headaches for stock managers when it rallies: They never own enough of it. That dynamic played out vividly in the third quarter.
Only 27% of large-cap mutual funds beat their benchmarks in the span, the poorest showing for any third quarter since Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). began tracking the data in 1991. While other factors contributed to the dismal performance, strategists including Savita Subramanian highlighted underexposure to Apple as a key culprit.
Shares of the iPhone maker gained 27% in the period, a return that almost tripled the S&P 500 and exceeded all but 33 members in the index. The outsize return, along with its growing market weight as the company’s value topped $2 trillion, created a too high hurdle to clear.
Either by choice or regulatory strictures, not many active funds are positioned to maximize Apple’s gains. Among some 200 equity funds that are benchmarked to the S&P 500 and have at least $500 million in assets, four-fifths held fewer Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) than the company’s 6.6% representation in the benchmark, data compiled by Bloomberg show. These funds returned 7.1% over the past three months, trailing the market by 1.3 percentage points.
Missing out was particularly painful for funds whose mandate steers them toward companies with faster profit expansion. Only 20% of growth funds beat their benchmark last quarter, with an underweight Apple ownership detracting 1.5 percentage points from their relative performance, BofA data showed.
Several reasons explain the aversion. Some see the stock as expensive, trading at 30 times forecast earnings. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has launched relatively few blockbuster products in the past decade despite forays into areas such as watches and television. Others suggest it may be due to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule limiting a fund’s ownership in a single stock.
Apple,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). are the three most underweight stocks by large-cap growth funds. Many of those managers are subject to SEC diversification rules that limit their very biggest holdings to no more than a quarter of their portfolios,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note last month.
Interestingly, when Apple’s hegemony eases, fund managers do better. When the shares reversed ground and fell 10% last month, the percentage of fund managers beating their benchmark surged to 60%, BofA data showed. As the economy recovers, market participation is likely to broaden, boding well for stock pickers, according to Subramanian.

“Despite the weak performance in 3Q, the rotation in September showed a silver-lining for active managers,” she said. “The recent rotation has more room to run in the coming months, which in turn could boost performance for active managers.”

Investing.com – The Dow rallied Monday, led by energy on surging oil prices and confirmation that President Trump will be discharged from hospital later today.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.45%, 397 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.56%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2%.
Investor sentiment on stocks was also helped by news that President Donald Trump will be leaving Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at 6:30 p.m. ET on Monday.


Energy rose more than 2% to lead the broader market higher as oil prices rose on fears of supply disruptions amid a strike in Norway's energy industry and a tropical storm forecast on a path toward the U.S. gulf coast.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) and TechnipFMC PLC (NYSE:FTI) were among the biggest gainers in energy.
Tech also led the move higher as as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) rose more than 1% while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was up 2%. Together these five stocks make up a quarter weighting of the S&P 500.
In other tech news, DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) jumped 3% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight, citing strong fundamentals.
Financials, mostly banks - ahead of their quarterly earnings expected next week - were pushed higher by rising bond yields as the United States 10-Year rose to its highest levels since August.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rose more than 1%, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) surged 3%.
The move higher in value stocks like financials was also supported increasing hopes that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be able to progress their weekend talks to a deal.
The economy has appeared resilient despite the lack of stimulus as data showed services activity last month topped economists' estimates.
""The headline PMI improved in September to 57.8 from 56.9. The index remains off the July high of 58.1 (strongest since February 2018), but the details of the data are the most encouraging that we have seen since the recovery began,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note."

293,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Day-Trader Fever Was Boiling Over Just Before October Surprise,"(Bloomberg) -- Retail investors, who have grown into a stock-market force this year, recently boosted their optimism to the highest level of 2020 -- just in time for an October surprise.
Clients at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) Holding Corp. increased their market exposure for a fifth straight month in September, pushing the firm’s measure of client positioning to the most bullish reading in two years, well before Covid-19 began roiling financial markets.
That backdrop may help explain why markets held up last week amid the turmoil of a presidential debate that raised concerns over a contested election outcome and then news that President Donald Trump and others in the highest ranks of U.S. government had contracted coronavirus. Through it all, the S&P 500 staged a 1.5% gain over five days, and by Monday afternoon the stock gauge had added another 1.4%.
The resilience of both equities and retail investors themselves is testament to the slightly-tongue-in-cheek saying in 2020 that stocks only go up. Conditioned to buy the dip, individual day traders are sticking to the strategy. With the Federal Reserve acting as a backstop with extremely supportive monetary policy, retail investors have been unbowed by everything from election uncertainty to a lack of new fiscal stimulus from Congress.
“Every time we’ve had a selloff, it’s been a nice opportunity,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “It’s like in football: You keep running the play until they stop you.”
A  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). basket of stocks favored by retail investors is up more than 40% this year, and has just about doubled since the March bottom. In September, when the S&P 500 posted its first monthly decline since March and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 tumbled into a correction, the index of retail favorites was virtually flat.
According to Kinahan, TD Ameritrade’s clients used the volatility to boost stock exposure. The most popular equity purchases at the brokerage in September included Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., all companies that saw their shares drop at least 16% in the September selloff. So far in October they’ve remained buyers, scooping up shares of tech stocks including Apple, Kinahan said.
Clients at E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) weren’t rattled by a choppy September either. Retail traders at the brokerage, comforted by economic reopenings, loaded up on shares of materials stocks and undervalued energy firms, according to Chris Larkin, the firm’s managing director of trading and investment product. They also picked up tech giants like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)., which have fared well during the pandemic. All told, the brokerage saw net buying in 10 of 11 sectors, with utilities being the sole holdout.
“They’re taking a little bit of a longer-term view and seeing that the economy is starting to open,” Larkin said. “For most people, they feel a lot better about where things are going and that’s why they’re starting to pick up some stock now.”
The presence of retail investors has exploded in 2020, encouraged by zero trading fees and, presumably, boredom during Covid-19 lockdowns. Calculations of their market share vary. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates they now account for 20% of equity trading, making them the second-largest group of investors in the market. At the higher end of the spectrum, strategists at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) LLC including Steven DeSanctis estimate about 40% of all trading volume comes from retail investors.
The pickup in retail activity has led some Wall Street professionals to decry euphoria in markets, warning of a situation similar to the dot-com era when individual investors were heavily involved. Others see the increase as a trend that’s here to stay.
“I don’t necessarily think it’s a bad omen,” said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. “If you did see a broadening of participation in the market, that could provide a tailwind into year-end.”

297,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Wild Market Swings Drive Record $1.8 Billion Into Treasury Fund,"(Bloomberg) -- Before Monday’s rebound in risk assets, investors rushed into the biggest long-dated Treasury ETF at a record pace.
Traders poured almost $1.8 billion into BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) exchange-traded fund (TLT) last week -- the most since it began trading in 2002, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
After a wild week for markets, equities pushed higher on optimism over economic stimulus and speculation that President Donald Trump may soon leave the hospital. Still, a volatile election season combined with fears of a second wave of coronavirus hindering the economic rebound are motivating some traders to shift toward safety.
“Looking at longer-dated Treasury bonds has traditionally been the place to hedge equity risk,” said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. “Around the election, you’ve got all these different types of positions to hedge.”
A large portion of the TLT inflow -- more than $1 billion -- came Friday on news the president had fallen ill with Covid-19, prompting a selloff in stocks and a surge in volatility.
Still, with bond yields at historic lows, the traditional portfolio of 60% in equities and 40% in fixed income has been called into question as traders search for more lucrative ways to invest. According to Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group, the case for long-dated Treasuries is “terrible.”
“I get that there’s fears, which is probably the explanation, but I don’t quite understand it,” he said.
Although the long end of the yield curve has given buyers better yield, a reopening economy could lead to the curve steepening even more, turning such positions into losing trades, said James Pillow, managing director at Moors & Cabot (NYSE:CBT) Inc.
“The only thing that makes sense is that the fear of a global second wave drove some investors into the long bond,” he said.

299,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 12:06PM ET</span>","Uber, Lyft spend big in California to oppose even costlier gig-worker law","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) together are spending nearly $100 million on a November California ballot initiative to overturn a state law that would compel them to classify drivers as employees. 
That sum looks less huge, however, than the potential costs of complying with the existing law, according to a Reuters analysis.
The two ride-hailing companies would each face more than $392 million in annual payroll taxes and workers' compensation costs even if they drastically cut the number of drivers on their platforms, a Reuters calculation showed.
(Graphic on potential price hikes - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjbwamvr/rLQlH-uber-s-california-price-hikes-if-drivers-are-employees.png)
Using a recently published Cornell University driver pay study in Seattle as a basis, Reuters calculated that each full-time driver would cost the company, on average, an additional $7,700. That includes roughly $4,560 in annual employer-based California and federal payroll taxes and some $3,140 in annual workers' compensation insurance, which is mandated in California. 
The companies say they would need to significantly hike prices to offset at least some of those additional costs, which in turn would likely cause a decrease in consumer demand, but cushion the blow of the added costs to the bottom line. 
Uber and Lyft have also said they could abandon the California market - an economy that would rank fifth in the world if the state were a sovereign nation. Other U.S. states have said they plan to follow California's lead and pass similar laws.
A ""yes"" vote on California's Proposition 22 gives Uber and Lyft what they seek, which is to overturn the state's gig-worker law, known as AB5, which took effect in January. Uber and Lyft have insisted the law does not apply to them, sparking a legal battle.
The tussle over classification of workers highlights the political and business risks facing Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and other companies that have built businesses on workers who are not classified as employees eligible for health coverage, unemployment insurance or other benefits.
Under the company-sponsored ballot measure, so-called gig workers would receive some benefits, including minimum pay, healthcare subsidies and accident insurance, but remain independent contractors not entitled to more substantial employee benefits.
POLITICAL FIGHT 
The question of whether gig workers should be treated as employees has become a national issue in U.S. politics. 
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, have both voiced their strong support for California's labor law and directly called on voters to reject the companies' ballot proposal that would weaken it. 
The campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump has not directly weighed in on the ballot measure, but the administration's Labor Department in September published proposed rules that would standardize legal definitions across the country and provide more room for companies to maintain independent contractors. U.S. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia criticized AB5 in an opinion piece published on Sept. 22.
California represents 9% - or roughly $1.63 billion in all of 2019 - of Uber's global rides and food delivery gross bookings. However, California generates a negligible amount of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Uber said in November 2019. 
Lyft, which operates only in the United States and Canada and does not have a food delivery business, in August said California makes up some 16% of the company's total rides. Lyft does not break out ride-hailing revenue, but California contributed $576 million as a share of total 2019 revenue.
FEWER DRIVERS
California sued Uber and Lyft in May for not complying with AB5. The ride-hailing companies said their workers are properly classified as independent contractors, because they can set their own schedules.
The companies say the majority of their drivers do not want to be employees, and work fewer than 25 hours a week. Many drivers use the service to supplement income from other jobs.
While no legal requirements would prevent the companies from classifying part-time drivers as employees, Uber said administrative fixed costs per employee would make it more expensive to allow part-time employment. Uber said it would therefore be forced to reduce its California driver base by 76% to 51,000 full-time driver employees. 
Uber also said it could reduce cash wages to offset higher benefit costs, thereby lowering the potential tax burden.
Lyft executives in court filings have said the company would have to ""substantially reduce"" its California driver base to a smaller number of driver employees, but has not provided a figure. The company did not respond to detailed requests for comment.

Ten of the 11 major S&P indexes were up, with energy (SPNY), the worst performing sector this year, rising 1.7%. Materials (SPLRCM) and financials (SPSY) were also among the biggest gainers in morning trading.
Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN) jumped 6.1% after Trump's physician said he had been treated with an intravenous dose of Regeneron's dual antibody treatment. The wider healthcare index (SPXHC) added 1.7%.
""One of his treatments was an experimental drug from Regeneron (and) that's showing that this could be a major component to treatments moving forward for people,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.
Doubts about the scale of further fiscal aid and a slowing economic recovery have weighed on the S&P 500 recently, with the benchmark index in September logging its worst month since the coronavirus-driven crash earlier this year.
But latest data showed the services industry's activity picked up in September, pulling above a level that prevailed before the pandemic struck the United States.
Further aiding the mood, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said there was still potential to reach agreement with U.S. lawmakers on more coronavirus relief and that Trump was committed to getting the deal done.
""The market has really traded on stimulus news, both to the high side and to the low side over the past few months,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird.
""The need for that stimulus is becoming more and more evident. While it might boost markets a little bit, the real economy is showing that it's necessary to really take this recovery up another level.""
At 11:32 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 1.30%, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 1.37% and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 1.70%.
Heavyweight tech-related stocks including Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) were up between 1.4% and 2.2% after weighing heavily on the Nasdaq (IXIC) on Friday.
The S&P banking subindex <.SPXBK> rose 1.8% as the U.S. Treasury 30-year yield hit its highest since late August. 
Real estate <.SPLRCR> - considered a defensive play - was the only S&P sector in the red.
 MyoKardia Inc  (O:MYOK) surged 58.0% after Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) said it would buy the company for about $13 billion. Shares of Bristol-Myers rose 0.7%.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 22 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 88 new highs and seven new lows.

302,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>","Facebook, Belgian watchdog face off over who should police company","By Foo Yun Chee
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Belgium's privacy watchdog sparred on Monday at Europe's top court over which data protection authority has the power to police the U.S. social media giant in a case that could escalate its privacy fights across the EU.
The case also has the potential to unleash a flood of investigations by national agencies in the 27-country bloc into other U.S. tech companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Twitter and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The case before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) came after a Belgian court sought guidance on Facebook's challenge against the territorial competence of the Belgian regulator's bid to stop the company from tracking users in Belgium through cookies stored in Facebook's social plug-ins, regardless of whether they have an account or not.
Under landmark EU privacy rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its one-stop-shop mechanism, the Irish privacy authority is the lead authority for Facebook as the company's European head office is based in Ireland. 
Google, Twitter and Apple also have their European headquarters in Ireland. GDPR, however, allows some leeway for other national privacy regulators to rule on violations limited to a specific country, which France and Germany have done.
Facebook's lawyer Dirk Van Liedekerke argued for the merits of the one-stop-shop mechanism.
""This would prevent any judicial fragmentation. GDPR is intended to put an end to where data controllers would have to deal with any number of supervisory authorities,"" he told the court.
""We cannot allow rules of competences to be sidestepped by national authorities in national courts. The risk would be huge, risk of cases before the courts.""
The European Commission, which backs Facebook, said it was important to have a tool that ensures consistency in applying GDPR rules across the bloc.
The Belgian data protection authority (DPA), which has the support of the Polish and Belgian governments, said GDPR rules allow for some leeway for national agencies to act in their own country.
""GDPR does not say anywhere that the lead authority has exclusive competence and that the non lead authority may not go to court,"" DPA lawyer Rubin Roex said.
Court President Koen Lenaerts said there could be a problem if national watchdogs were not allowed to fight for their citizens, which in turn would force people to file private lawsuits.
The CJEU will also have to decide whether GDPR rules apply in this case, which dated back to 2015 before the EU framework was adopted in 2016 and came into force in 2018.
CJEU court adviser Michal Bobek will issue his non-binding opinion on Dec. 17, followed by the court judgment in about six months.
The Irish watchdog has opened cases into Facebook, Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp as well as Twitter, Apple, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) Media, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and U.S. digital advertiser Quantcast.

The case is C-645/19 Facebook Ireland & Others.

Investing.com -- No time to die, and yet, no time to live. 
With the delay of the 25th James Bond film, ""No Time to Die,"" Cineworld will suspend operations at all of its 537 Regal theaters and 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse theaters on Thursday. 
That's sinking stocks of theater operators as movie-lovers shy away from returning to the cinema amid the stubborn coronavirus. Cinemark Holdings Inc (NYSE:CNK) is down 16% and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) dropped 11%.
The movie will be delayed until April 2, according to MGM, Universal and Bond producers, Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. 
""In response to an increasingly challenging theatrical landscape and sustained key market closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cineworld confirms that it will be temporarily suspending operations,"" the company said in a statement. 
Studios have been reluctant to release their pipeline of new films, Cineworld said. The closures will affect approximately 45,000 employees.    
""This is not a decision we made lightly, and we did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings in all of our markets,"" Chief Executive Officer Mooky Greidinger said.

305,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",Bristol Myers expands heart drug business with $13 billion deal for MyoKardia,"By Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) - Bristol Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) said on Monday it would buy  MyoKardia Inc  (O:MYOK) for about $13 billion to bolster its portfolio of heart disease treatments, ahead of the potential loss of sales exclusivity of some of its blockbuster drugs.
The deal comes close on the heels of Bristol Myers' $74 billion acquisition of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) last year, which was aimed at creating an oncology giant and shielding itself from fierce competition for its cancer immunotherapy, Opdivo, from  Merck & Co 's (N:MRK) Keytruda.
Shares of MyoKardia, which have nearly doubled in value this year, surged another 57.8% to $220.31, just shy of the offer of $225 per share.
The deal will also help Bristol Myers reduce some of its dependence on cancer drugs and give it access to Myokardia's lead heart drug candidate with blockbuster potential, mavacamten, adding to its existing portfolio of heart drugs that includes blood thinner Eliquis.
Eliquis, which made up about 21% of the company's total sales in the latest reported quarter, faces U.S. market exclusivity loss after 2026. The company's top-selling cancer drug, Revlimid, will also lose some of its U.S. patent exclusivity in 2022.
Bristol Myers said it expects mavacamten to be a ""multi-billion dollar asset"" and drive significant growth through 2025 and the second half of the decade.
""I think it is a typical acquisition premium for our sales expectations for mavacamten as we had estimates in the initial (and lowest risk) indication of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) of about $2.5 billion by 2026,"" said Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten, referring to the 61% premium offered by Bristol Myers.
Mavacamten is being developed to treat obstructive and non-obstructive forms of a condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - estimated to affect one in every 500 people globally.
MyoKardia expects to submit marketing application to the U.S. health regulator for obstructive HCM in the first quarter of 2021 after the drug met the main goal of a late-stage study.

The company said the MyoKardia purchase would add to its earnings beginning in 2023.

Staring down almost $16 trillion of negative-yielding debt worldwide, investors will continue to be drawn to the higher returns offered by emerging-market assets and the prospect of an economic recovery next year, analysts say. Developing-nation currencies are also benefiting from broad dollar weakness, with the U.S. currency still below its 200-day moving average. Trump’s diagnosis has also made it more likely Congress and the White House will reach a deal on pandemic relief before the November election.
Against that backdrop, the benchmark emerging-market currency gauge climbed 0.5% in the five days through Friday, led by the South African rand and Mexican peso. MSCI Inc.’s gauge of stocks gained 2.1%, its best week since August, and the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index of local-currency bonds added 0.4%. Dollar bonds were steady after a three-week sequence of declines.
“We try and zoom out from the current noise around U.S. politics and the potential for a U.S. fiscal stimulus package,” said Anders Faergemann, a London-based senior money manager at PineBridge Investments, which manages about $104 billion. “The recent market wobble represents an opportunity to reposition for a constructive outlook for emerging markets into 2021.”
Still, last week’s revelation that Trump tested positive for the Covid-19 coronavirus will likely keep risk appetite in check. New disclosures about his treatment raise concern that his condition is more serious than what the American public has been told. Emerging-market stocks, currencies and dollar bonds were stronger on Monday following news Trump may be released from hospital soon.
Listen: EM Weekly Podcast: All Eyes on Trump; China Data; Rate Decisions
Emerging-market investors may be on their way out amid uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election, the Institute of International Finance warned last week. While investors poured $12.9 billion of net non-resident portfolio flows into emerging-market bonds in September, they withdrew about $10.8 billion from equities, and the divergence between debt and equity flows is rising, according to the Washington-based trade group for financial institutions.
“Our data shows that a big ‘risk-off’ is brewing in emerging markets,” IIF economist Jonathan Fortun wrote from Washington. “We are tracking high-frequency outflows from EM in the final weeks of September almost as big as in the 2013 taper tantrum.”
After last week’s acrimonious U.S. presidential discourse, this week’s vice-presidential debate between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Vice President Michael Pence on Wednesday will be in focus as there could be an orderly discussion of issues.
There are also country-specific factors to consider. Argentina’s investors will be keen to see the impact of central bank measures that allow the peso to depreciate faster. While Turkey’s lira rose on better-than-expected consumer price data, core inflation -- which strips out volatile items such as food and energy -- pushed higher, a sign that some of the underlying cost pressures may be increasing.
“Both Argentina and Turkey are facing challenging times with declining FX reserves, but the market considers these events idiosyncratic,” Faergemann said. “We don’t expect those concerns to spread to other emerging-market countries.”
Investor anxiety, as measured by implied volatility for developing-nation currencies, eased by the most in three months last week, according to a JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. index.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>","U.S. oil deals sluggish despite Chevron, Devon boost: Enverus","(Reuters) - The pace of mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. oil and gas sector during the third quarter tied with the first quarter for the worst in a decade, according to data released on Monday, as most shale producers remain reluctant to spend after an oil price crash this year.
U.S. crude prices are lower by about a third from the start of the year, as the COVID-19 pandemic has hammered fuel demand and forced oil companies to focus on preserving cash to survive the downturn instead of boosting production.
Energy consultancy Enverus said just 28 deals with a disclosed value were signed during July-September.
However, the total value of these deals, at about $21 billion, was 19.4% higher than a year earlier, helped by oil major  Chevron  Corp's (N:CVX) purchase of  Noble Energy  Inc (O:NBL) and  Devon Energy  Corp's (N:DVN) merger with  WPX Energy Inc  (N:WPX).
Enverus valued those two mergers at $18.63 billion, almost 90% of the total deal value.
""There is a broad consensus that consolidation is a net positive for the industry... but it can be a challenge to find the right asset and balance sheet fits for accretive deals,"" said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at Enverus.
""It may take several more years for consolidation to play out.""
While there is potential for more deals this year, a pickup in activity would need higher commodity prices and new capital inflows, according to Enverus, but traditional sources of funding like private equity firms have become reluctant to participate.
Companies with manageable debt loads are likely to be the focus of mergers while heavily indebted companies are ""being left to find their own way, resulting in a spate of Chapter 11 filings,"" Dittmar added.

Among the largest shale producers to walk down the bankruptcy path during the third quarter were California Resources (NYSE:CRC) Corp  and  Oasis Petroleum  Inc (O:OAS).

Green bonds are used to finance clean energy and environmental projects such as wind farms and low-carbon transport. 
The $200 billion issued this year is 12% higher than the first nine months of last year, even though economies have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
""For much of this year, green bond issuance has lagged behind 2019. But the bumper month in September, with more than $50 billion issued, offers hope of a possible boom in the last quarter of the year,"" said Mallory Rutigliano, sustainable finance analyst at BNEF.
Green bonds make up a small fraction of the overall bond market but they are attracting more attention because meeting emissions-cut targets will need trillions of dollars of capital from public and private sectors.

To enable the transition to a low-carbon economy, policymakers say $1 trillion a year of green investment is needed.

MILAN (Reuters) - Stocks and oil prices rose on Monday as stimulus hopes and suggestions Donald Trump's health was improving brought relief to markets after last week's rush to safety on uncertainty over the impact of the U.S. president's COVID-19 infection.
Trump, 74, was flown to a hospital for treatment on Friday, but his doctors said he had responded well and could return to the White House as soon as on Monday.
Optimism over fiscal stimulus in the world's largest economy also came into play after upbeat weekend comments from Trump himself and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said progress was being made on relief legislation.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.5% by 1214 GMT, supported by overnight gains across Asia and the early session in Europe. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.8%. S&P 500 futures  rose 0.7% and Nasdaq futures (NQc1) 0.8%, indicating a similarly strong start on Wall Street later.
Overhanging the relief rally, however, were concerns that Trump's case could be more severe than public disclosures suggest, and that more restrictive measures by governments to slow coronavirus infections could harm the economic recovery.
Some traders were concerned by doctors' admission that Trump had been given supplementary oxygen and steroids.
""Many questions remain including the use of the steroid drug ... which is usually reserved for those with severe illness,"" said Raymond James strategist Chris Bailey in London.
Trump's infection also comes less than one month before the presidential election on Nov. 3, potentially fuelling more market volatility and making the outcome of the vote even more difficult to predict.
""In terms of the impact on the election, we haven’t seen enough polling to assess whether this increases or decreases his chances of winning,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategists.
According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, Democrat contender Joe Biden opened his widest lead in a month in the U.S. presidential race.
STIMULUS
The were also economic questions for markets, with a survey on Monday showing the euro zone's recovery faltered in September as a resurgence of the coronavirus forces the reimposition of restrictions on activity.
The volatility VIX index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, remained close to the highs it hit on Friday.
""In the case that the markets enter a deep period of volatility or a bear market, the odds of a fiscal stimulus will rise dramatically,"" said Amundi portfolio manager Paresh Upadhyaya. ""This should help settle markets"".
Meantime, suggestions Trump could leave hospital sent oil prices up around 4%. An escalating workers' strike in Norway that has shut four of Equinor's (OL:EQNR) oil and gas fields also helped drive the gains.
Brent (LCOc1) prices were up 4.1% at $40.9 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (CLc1) added 4.5% to $38.7 a barrel.
The dollar was traded in tight ranges, while riskier currencies gained, as investors awaited news about Trump's health and developments in the fiscal talks in Washington. The dollar index (=USD) was down 0.3% at 93.55.
Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries rose to 0.7154% and the yield curve  steepened slightly, signalling investors felt comfortable taking on more risk. 
But euro zone bond yields held near recent lows on worries about possible new restrictions to fight the coronavirus.
The French government has announced new restrictions, closing bars for two weeks. Other countries across Europe are also weighing up more measures. 
Gold , which is often bought during times of uncertainty, fell initially. It later turned slightly positive, up 0.2% to $1,902.3, as a weaker dollar offsets news on Trump's health progress.

Engie, an energy group part-owned by the French state, is due to decide at a board meeting later on Monday whether to sell 29.9% of Suez to Veolia, in a prelude to a full tender offer. 
Engie, which was given extra time to reach a decision after Veolia increased its offer for the stake to 3.4 billion euros ($4 billion) last week, has so far given encouraging signals that it is ready to seal a deal. 
A spokeswoman told Reuters on Sunday that Engie had noted Veolia's assurances over the weekend that it would keep any subsequent bid for Suez friendly. 
But Suez's rejection of Veolia's advances, decrying them as hostile and potentially risking jobs, has led to a poisonous backdrop for any takeover, despite meetings between the parties in recent days. It has also sparked a political row. 
Suez hit back at Veolia's commitment on Sunday not to launch a bid for the whole firm without the blessing of the board, saying it still considered its move a hostile one. 
It backed another possibility - an approach by private equity firm Ardian - though this potential suitor has yet to detail any price, and the chances of an alternative materialising before Engie's board meeting are fading.
At 1040 GMT, Suez shares were down 2.15% at 15.725 euros. Veolia has bid 18 euros per share for the 29.9% stake, valuing the whole of Suez at more than 11 billion euros. 
POLITICAL BACKLASH
Several parliamentarians, mostly from President Emmanuel Macron's own party, last week questioned the industrial logic of the deal and the rush to close it without considering alternatives. They urged the government to delay the process in letter to Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. 
The merged entity would have overlapping water businesses in France, one problem Veolia has sought to pre-empt by saying Suez's French water operations would be sold to infrastructure fund Meridiam. 
Le Maire urged Suez and Veolia on Sunday to find common ground. 
The French government has a 23.6% stake in Engie. Last week company executives said board members and the state were aligned in their views and welcomed Veolia's improved offer. 
Veolia has argued that with Suez it would be better equipped to take on foreign rivals, and the two could reach purchasing and operating cost savings of 500 million euros from the first year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Danimer Scientific said on Monday it has agreed to go public by merging with blank-check acquisition company with  Live Oak Acquisition  Corp (N:LOAK) in a deal which values the U.S. bioplastics company at around $890 million. 
It is the latest example of a company opting to go public by merging with a so-called special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), rather than through a traditional initial public offering (IPO).
A SPAC is a shell company which raises cash in an initial public offering (IPO) with the goal of buying an unidentified private company, usually within two years, in a deal which would then take the acquired company public.
For Bainbridge, Georgia-based Danimer, the SPAC deal offered a quicker route to the public markets and the funding the company needed than a traditional IPO, Chief Executive Stephen Croskrey said in an interview. 
""The SPAC route gives us the speed that we need to get to that capital. We just don't have time to start a traditional IPO process right now,"" Croskrey said in an interview. 
Reuters reported the agreement of the deal earlier on Monday.
Danimer sells renewable and sustainable biopolymers which are biodegradable and compostable, a greener alternative to traditional plastic products.
The global biopolymer market is seen exceeding $13 billion by 2021, according to data from Transparency Market Research.
Danimer is in the process of scaling up production capacity of its biodegradable plastics based on polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). 
The deal with Live Oak will leave Danimer with an anticipated $385 million in cash to continue its plans to expand capacity which were stunted earlier this year by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""We plan to use the proceeds to build out the plant in Kentucky and to build a greenfield facility,"" said Croskrey, who will continue as CEO after the deal.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Wall Street's regulatory gains set to stand even under Biden,"By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A victory for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Nov. 3 would spell the end of the party for the banking industry which has enjoyed more than $40 billion in regulatory cuts under U.S. President Donald Trump's business-friendly administration.
But the industry is likely to keep many of its wins as Democrats prioritize more pandemic aid, healthcare, tax reform and financial rules that address racial injustice, environmental and inequality issues, rather than attacking banks, said nearly a dozen lobbyists and policy experts in Democratic circles.
Banks and investors were preparing for a Biden victory over the weekend after Trump tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday, in a blow for his campaign. 
""A hypothetical Biden administration will be confronting an economy mired in COVID-19, an unsustainable climate policy, a healthcare system whose flaws were exposed by the disease,"" said Aaron Klein, a former Treasury Department official during the 2009 financial crisis that badly marred Wall Street's image.
""This is not 2009 where the stability and soundness of the financial system is the top priority for restoring the economy and the semblance of normalcy,"" said Klein, who is now a policy director at Washington think tank Brookings Institution.
From the relaxation of capital, leverage, liquidity, swap trading and speculative investment rules, to lighter-touch supervision and enforcement, banks have enjoyed a bonanza under the Republican-led Senate and Trump appointees who say the rules were overly burdensome, stymied lending and hurt the economy. 
Biden, who was also accused of being too cozy with Wall Street as a senator and later Barack Obama's vice president, has rarely attacked Trump's financial giveaways and has said relatively little on financial reform more broadly.
As progressives pull the Democratic party to the left, policy experts expect a Biden administration to be tougher on financial firms than both the Trump and Obama administrations. Some liberal groups are already pushing Democrats to consider repealing several Wall Street-friendly rules.
But while Democrats may swiftly overturn some financial rules if they take the Senate, they are likely to focus legislative efforts on Trump healthcare, immigration, environmental and tax policies they hate more, said the sources. 
That would leave most of Trump's Wall Street giveaways intact initially, and put financial policy in the hands of Biden's regulatory appointees who would get to choose whether to spend years unraveling their predecessors' work. 
""The personnel appointed to draft and carry out these rulemakings will have particular importance and also far more independence than under the Trump administration,"" wrote D.C. research group Beacon Policy Advisors in a client note. 
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) firebrand Senator Elizabeth Warren would hold sway over some appointments, particularly at the consumer watchdog which she helped create, and bank regulators. 
Overall, though, lobbyists said they would expect a diverse mix of progressives and moderates, even though few are likely to come straight from Wall Street.
""I don't think you'll see the progressive liberals getting all the appointments they want,"" said Richard Hunt, CEO of Washington group the Consumer Bankers Association.
Biden's campaign, which did not immediately comment, has said he plans to use all available tools to reverse Trump's damaging policies. Warren's office did not respond to a request for comment. 
RACIAL JUSTICE, EQUALITY
Progressives have criticized Trump's watchdogs for easing some post-crisis capital, liquidity and leverage requirements, changes which have saved banks more than $40 billion, according to industry estimates. Many centrist Democrats believe, however, that those rules were ripe for review and are wary of getting bogged down rewriting them again, the sources said. 
Appointees are expected to prioritize policies on which Democrats broadly agree - boosting consumer protections and measures to help tackle racial injustice, diversity, wealth inequality and climate change, said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Steele, a director at Stanford Graduate School of Business and formerly a senior Democratic aide on the Senate Banking Committee.
Those policies include boosting financial inclusion; cracking down on predatory lending, overdraft fees, and debt collectors; strengthening fair lending rules; overhauling the credit reporting system; halting Trump's housing finance reforms; and imposing corporate climate change risk disclosures and bank climate risk controls.
Some measures could put banks on the defensive. Others may offer opportunities for the industry, which has improved its standing in Washington by helping the government distribute more than $500 billion in pandemic aid, said lobbyists. 

""I'm not worried about being shut out,"" said Hunt. ""We have so many people employed in every state and district and we provide so much to the economy.""

318,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","Cineworld brings down curtain on U.S., UK theatres; 45,000 jobs hit","By Muvija M and Yadarisa Shabong
(Reuters) - Cineworld (L:CINE), the world's second-biggest cinema chain, will close its UK and U.S. movie theatres this week, leaving as many as 45,000 workers unemployed, as it fights a coronavirus-related collapse in film releases and cinema-going. 
The company said the reluctance of studios to go ahead with major releases such as the new James Bond film had left it no choice but to close all 536 Regal theatres in the U.S. and its 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse theatres in the UK from Oct. 8. 
Cineworld Chief Executive Mooky Greidinger told Sky News that the operations might resume in ""two months, or a bit longer"". Movies including the superhero sequel ""Wonder Woman 1984"" are slated for a Christmas Day release.
""From a liquidity point of view, we were bleeding much bigger amounts when we are open than when we were closed,"" Greidinger said.
Cineworld's statement on Monday, confirming leaks over the weekend, spelt out the scale of job losses from its move, which affects thousands of ancillary staff including cleaners and security as well as its own employees. 
Shares fell as much as 60% to an all-time low within ten minutes of the opening bell on Monday as the group, which is carrying heavy debt due in part to its acquisition of Regal in 2018, said it was looking at all ways of raising additional funds. 
By 0915 GMT, they were 30% lower, taking their loss this year to more than 90%.
Cineworld's statement follows a grim evaluation by ratings agency S&P on Friday of rival AMC Entertainment (N:AMC), owner of the Odeon chain, which said the U.S.-based group may run out of liquidity in six months unless it can raise more capital.
The entertainment industry has been among the heaviest hit by social distancing and other restrictions, with Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) last week announcing plans to lay off roughly 28,000 employees, mostly at its U.S. theme parks. 
Cineworld began reopening in July after virus-related restrictions started to ease, but the further postponement of the James Bond film ""No Time To Die"" and others including Marvel's ""Black Widow"" have left the months ahead looking bleak.
""Without these new releases, Cineworld cannot provide customers in both the U.S. and the UK... with the breadth of strong commercial films necessary for them to consider coming back to theatres,"" it said. 
While some cinemas in China, the world's second largest movie market, have reopened with strong audiences, there is a lack of major movies to watch on the big screen.
Studios have chosen to release some of this year's major planned blockbusters on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or the Disney Plus streaming platform, and have cancelled others until 2021. 
The boss of rival chain Vue cinemas Tim Richards told BBC Radio: ""Our problem right now is we have no movies, and this was a big blow for us.""
""We are likely going to make it through. I'm concerned about the independents and the small regional operators right now that are going to really struggle, and when they close, they may not reopen.""
Britain has slid into a fresh round of lockdowns and tightened social restrictions in the past month.
""Although the delay of the latest 007 blockbuster prompted the decision, Bond isn't the villain in this piece,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Susannah Streeter said.
""The spread of COVID-19 around the world has been a horror movie for the industry and the fresh wave of infections is the latest installment in what's been a devastating story for cinema chains.""

A hardware glitch paralysed trading in the world's third-largest equity market throughout Thursday, testing the exchange's credibility just as the country's new prime minister prioritises digitalisation.
""We will make utmost efforts to find the causes and prevent recurrences of such troubles,"" Fujitsu CEO Takahito Tokita said at a scheduled briefing on the company's digital strategy. 
The TSE, owned by  Japan Exchange Group  (T:8697), said the glitch was the result of a memory problem at its Arrowhead trading system, and a subsequent failure to switch to a back-up. The breakdown caused the first full-day suspension since the exchange switched to all-electronic trading in 1999.
The TSE said on Monday it had confirmed that the switch-over function was now working and that it had set up a committee to investigate the problem.
Arrowhead, developed by Fujitsu, debuted in 2010, bringing processing times for trades to 5 milliseconds - on a par with the New York and London stock exchanges at the time. The system was overhauled in November, and currently processes orders in about 0.2 milliseconds.
Asked who was responsible for the system failure, Tokita said it was too early to say because the investigation was still ongoing. He declined to comment further on a client's business.

The TSE has said it has no plans at this point to ask Fujitsu for compensation. Tokita said Fujitsu had made no decision on the issue.

320,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 06:54AM ET</span>","Buy the Dip in Global Stocks on Policy Support, Citigroup Says","(Bloomberg) --  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). strategists are worried about a whole host of threats to equities, but still recommend investors buy the dip. They expect central banks to step in if risks mount.
A resurgence in Covid-19 cases, earnings downgrades, a chaotic U.S. election and stretched valuations may all drag on stocks in the coming months, but any market weakness is likely to provoke “aggressive” policy actions, strategists led by Robert Buckland wrote in a note. They forecast “mild gains” for global equities, predicting the MSCI ACWI Local Index will rise to 705 by mid-2021, or 7.5% from Friday’s close.
“Relying on central banks to provide support in the face of weak fundamentals make us uneasy, but it is what it is,” the strategists wrote on Oct. 2. “Our market targets suggest the best returns in emerging markets, and the weakest in Japan.”
Stocks tumbled in September after a summer rally that was especially strong in the U.S. This month has kicked off on a volatile note too, with U.S. President Donald Trump’s condition clouded by confusion after he tested positive for the coronavirus with just weeks to go before the election.
“Joe Biden seems the most likely winner, although nobody should count President Trump out, with his Covid-19 diagnosis the latest twist,” Citigroup’s strategists said.
Their global bear market checklist -- intended to advise what to do when faced with a dip by measuring how excessive the previous peak was -- still suggests buying this time around, although the U.S. looks “frothier” than Europe, they said.
Citigroup strategists remain overweight on U.S. stocks, as better earnings performance counters election risk and expensive valuations, and cut continental Europe to underweight. Sector-wise, they recommend a growth and defensive tilt, switching back to overweight on IT, while calling financials a “value trap” because of low interest rates.

Electricity generation is forecast to increasingly move away from traditional structures involving large fossil fuel-burning power plants, towards localized systems using renewable energy and battery storage, known as distributed energy.
For entities embracing this model, they can choose to 'outsource' their power systems to a specialist entity, in the same way firms hire technology platforms rather than develop their own systems - so-called software-as-a-service (SaaS).
Set up by Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and Siemens' Smart Infrastructure and Financial Services units, Calibrant Energy will build the energy infrastructure at no up-front cost and then manage it for customers including companies, municipalities and hospitals, the statement said.
Calibrant aims to utilize Macquarie's capital and Siemens' technology, as it competes to grow in the space. According to a June forecast from consultancy Wood Mackenzie, around $110 billion of investment could be made in distributed energy in the period 2020-2025.
Other professional investment firms are also seeking to tap into distributed energy. Last month, Blackstone Group (N:BX) launched its own platform.

(Reuters) - Canadian mergers and acquisitions are set to increase following a modest third-quarter recovery from multi-year lows, as market stability and access to capital give companies the confidence to negotiate and price transactions.
Equity offerings also picked up in the three months through September, as stock market recovery following a tumultuous few months early in the coronavirus pandemic encouraged issuers to tap markets to recapitalize.
Some $40.9 billion worth of M&A deals were announced in the third quarter, the highest since the onset of the coronavirus crisis in late 2019 and a 200% jump from the three months ended in June, Refinitiv data showed. But it was lower than the $50.7 billion worth of transactions from a year ago, the data showed.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - French supermarket groups  Casino  (PA:CASP) and Intermarche on Monday won a partial victory in their fight against an EU antitrust raid and demand for information into a buying alliance after Europe's second-top court said regulators failed to prove wrongdoing.
The supermarkets' challenge against the European Commission underlined the recent willingness of companies to fight what they say are excessive demands and regulatory overreach by the EU competition enforcer.
The Commission in February 2017 ordered the companies and their subsidiaries to submit to an inspection.
The EU competition enforcer last year subsequently opened an investigation into the supermarkets' purchasing alliance set up in France in 2014, saying that this could have been used to illegally coordinate their actions.
The supermarkets then took their case to the Luxembourg-based court, disputing the legality of the seizure and copying of data relating to the private lives of their employees and managers and the refusal to return those data.
The General Court agreed with some of their arguments and annulled part of the Commission's inspection decisions. However, it also upheld the EU system for conducting antitrust raids.
""The Commission has failed to show that it had sufficiently strong evidence to suspect exchanges of information concerning the future commercial strategies of the undertakings,"" judges said.
The tie-up was dissolved in 2018 when Casino and France's Auchan agreed to a global buying deal.
Buying tie-ups have become more popular in recent years as a tactic to counter online retail giant Amazon (O:AMZN) and rivals offering price discounts.

The cases are T-249/17 Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and AMC v Commission; T-254/17 Intermarché Casino Achats v Commission; and T-255/17 Les Mousquetaires and ITM Entreprises v Commission.

That was despite a 27.3% plunge in Cineworld (L:CINE) after the world's second-biggest cinema chain said it would close all of its UK and U.S. movie theatres later this week, leaving as many as 45,000 workers unemployed.
Oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa),  BP  (L:BP) and  Total  (PA:TOTF) rose nearly 2%, with crude prices climbing after an easing of the worst fears about Trump's health condition and an expanding workers' strike in Norway, Western Europe's largest oil producer. [O/R]
Trump's doctors treating him for COVID-19 have said his health is improving and he could be sent back to the White House as soon as Monday, although outside experts warn that his case may be severe.

Indonesia is keen to develop a full supply chain for nickel at home, especially for extracting battery chemicals, making batteries and eventually building EVs. 
It has stopped exports of unprocessed nickel ore to support investment in its domestic industries.
Ayodhia Kalake, a senior official at the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investment, said Tesla had reached out to the government informally about a possible venture, but he did not specify what it had in mind. 
""It was still an early discussion and was not detailed yet,"" Ayodhia said in a statement on Monday.
""We need further discussion with Tesla,"" he said, adding that Indonesia has a number of incentives for investment in EVs.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters email seeking confirmation.
Indonesia last month said it had secured a deal to build a lithium battery plant in the country with South Korean LG Chem Ltd (KS:051910) and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) (SZ:300750).
Tesla is looking to ramp up production of trucks and solar projects and its boss Elon Musk earlier this year urged miners to produce more nickel and offered ""giant"", long-term contracts if mined ""efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way"". 
While EVs are expected to help reduce global carbon emission, activists are concerned that production of EV parts and increased mining may damage the environment.

An Indonesian nickel smelting project being built by China's Tsingshan Group and partners to produce battery-grade chemicals withdrew a request to dispose of waste in the ocean, a government official said on Friday.

In a set of proposals published on its website, Deutsche Boerse also suggested index bans for companies that fail to submit quarterly figures on time. 
""It is no secret that I personally would welcome the expansion of the DAX 30 to a DAX 40,"" Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Theodor Weimer said in an emailed statement.
Since its founding in 1988, the DAX has been Germany's answer to the Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York and the FTSE in London, with 30 members forming the corporate elite in one of the world's largest economies. 
Most of the index's founding members have since dropped out. 
The most recent departure was payments company Wirecard, which in a blow to Germany's capital markets, filed for insolvency just two years after its promotion to the index. The payments company owed creditors billions in what auditor EY described as a sophisticated global fraud.
Weimer has since changed rules to allow for a quicker expulsion of companies in the wake of the scandal.
The rules proposed on Monday would make proven profitability a requirement for joining the DAX.
The proposal also suggested reducing the number of constituents in the mid-cap index (MDAXI) to 50 from 60.
Companies where sales of controversial weapons make up more than 10% of revenue should also be excluded from the DAX selection indices, which include the DAX, MDAX, TecDAX and SDAX, Deutsche Boerse said.

Investors now have until Nov. 4 to respond to the proposal. Deutsche Boerse said it would publish the results of the consultation and any decision on changes to the index rules, by Nov. 23.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Monday, with the news that U.S. President Donald Trump could shortly be discharged from hospital reducing the political uncertainty that shook the markets late last week.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.8%. 
President Trump could return to the White House, from the military hospital where he is being treated for the Covid-19 virus, as early as Monday, his doctors said on Sunday. 
Relief about his health is likely to push equities higher as this removes an area of uncertainty ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election. 
Adding to the renewed confidence, President Trump also tweeted his wish for the U.S. Congress to reach an agreement on the latest stimulus package. This adds to the pressure on the two sides to reach a compromise, especially after Friday’s disappointing official employment report.
Turning back to Europe, euro zone finance ministers are due to meet in Brussels later Monday to discuss the implementation of the much-heralded 750 billion-euro coronavirus recovery fund.  
The countries whose economies have been hardest hit by the virus, including Italy, Spain and Greece, are keen to see these funds unlocked to boost the region’s nascent recovery.
Meanwhile, global coronavirus infections have surpassed 35 million, with a second wave continuing to surge through Europe. France reportedly plans to shut down bars in the Paris region, while U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of a “very tough” winter.
The data slate in Europe includes services PMI numbers from a number of countries and also euro zone retail sales figures Monday. Most attention this week, however, is going to be on the release of the minutes from the last European Central Bank meeting on Thursday.
In corporate news, Swiss-based travel retailer Dufry (SIX:DUFN) is likely to be in the spotlight after it announced a joint venture with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), with the move into the Chinese travel retail market to be owned 51% by Alibaba and 49% by Dufry.
Oil prices rebounded Monday, boosted by comments from doctors that President Trump could leave hospital very quickly. Prices had slumped more than 4% on Friday amid uncertainty surrounding the president’s health, adding to concern that rising coronavirus case numbers that could dampen global economic recovery.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.6% higher at $38.00 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.2% to $40.14. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,897.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1728."

The exchange will migrate all open positions in the MSCI Taiwan Index futures to its newly launched FTSE contracts on Oct. 30 and the MSCI product will then be suspended, Michael Syn, who oversees both the stock and futures businesses, said in an interview. The MSCI product had previously been set to wind down as of the license expiration in February.
“There’s uncertainty as to what the market should expect November onward because of the U.S. election” and December holidays, Syn said, adding the delisting is being brought forward to avoid potential operational issues and “to make sure everyone’s strapped in before the elections.”
The move comes after MSCI’s decision in May to shift index licensing for some derivatives products from Singapore to Hong Kong. Come February, its pact with the city-state’s exchange will be limited to products based on MSCI’s Singapore indexes. SGX has partnered with FTSE Russell to introduce new offerings and signed a broad-ranging deal that spans multiple asset classes. MSCI products currently comprise 10% to 15% of the exchange’s net profit.
The bourse introduced the SGX FTSE Taiwan Index Futures contracts in July and there’s already ample liquidity to make the move, Syn said. Total turnover exceeded $1.5 billion in the first week of trading. This is the first time an exchange will migrate open interest on behalf of customers, he said.
The Taiwan contracts accounted for more than half of the volumes of all MSCI derivatives products trading on the exchange, and about 12% of overall equity derivatives volumes, in fiscal year 2020. According to Syn, U.S. customers are key to the Taiwan business, with about 26% of volume occurring overnight amid demand from American investors for the technology-heavy index.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were up on Monday morning over the news that U.S. President Donald Trump could be released from hospital later in the day.
Trump and his wife Melania Trump became the latest high-profile COVID-19 patients after testing positive for the virus during the previous week, with Trump receiving treatment at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center over the weekend.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.33% by 11:20 PM ET (3:20 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 1.31%
In Australia, the ASX 200 soared 2.42%. The Reserve Bank of Australia will meet on Tuesday, and it is widely expected that the central bank will keep interest rates and its three-year yield target unchanged at 0.25%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up by 1.30%. However, experts warned that the city could face a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases “very soon”, which could be its most severe yet.
Chinese markets were closed for a holiday.
Although the medical team treating Trump sent out contradictory messages concerning his health throughout the weekend, the latest statement on Sunday said that he was recovering well and could be discharged as early as Monday, after Trump rode by supporters in a motorcade on Sunday.
The news “for now the market appears to be cheered by Trump’s overall treatment and recovery,” Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) strategists, including Charlie Lay, said in a note.
With less than a month to go until the Nov. 3 presidential election, Trump’s diagnosis brings unwanted uncertainty and volatility to his campaign to be re-elected. Democrat nominee Joe Biden, who has tested negative for the virus, has shot 14 percentage points ahead of Trump, according to the latest Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll taken shortly after the two candidates’ debate on Tuesday. Vice presidential nominees Mike Pence and Kamala Harris are scheduled to take part in the vice-presidential debate on Wednesday.
From his hospital bed, Trump also tweeted his wish for the U.S. Congress to reach an agreement on the latest stimulus package. Although House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi was optimistic that a bipartisan stimulus bill could be passed, adding that Trump’s diagnosis “kind of changes the dynamic,” disagreements between the Democrats and Republicans remain.
On the central bank front, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and European Central Bank (ECB) chief economist Philip Lane will deliver keynote addresses during Tuesday’s NABE conference. The two banks are also scheduled to release the minutes from their September meetings later in the week.
Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases globally has topped the 35 million-mark as of Oct.5, according to Johns Hopkins University data."

LONDON (Reuters) - Supermarkets, food manufacturers and restaurant chains under pressure from campaigners over their environmental impact urged Britain on Monday to strengthen a plan to stop tropical forests from being cut down to grow cocoa, palm oil and soy.
With the food industry under growing scrutiny for its role in driving deforestation in countries such as Brazil and Indonesia, Britain is drawing up legislation to force the sector to tighten oversight of its supply chains. 
In an open letter https://www.retailsoygroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Letter-on-due-diligence-consultation_final.pdf, some 20 large companies welcomed the plans as a ""step forward"" but said ""it's not currently envisioned to be enough to halt deforestation and we encourage the government to go further to ... address this issue.""
Signatories included supermarkets  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), Morrison's (L:MRW) and  Sainsbury 's (L:SBRY), food manufacturers Unilever (AS:UNA), Nestle (S:NESN) and Greencore Group (L:GNC), McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and various livestock producers.
Britain's move to introduce legal penalties for companies found to be complicit in deforestation aims to improve upon a range of voluntary, industry-led initiatives that have faced widespread criticism from environmental groups.
Companies say they would prefer clear direction from governments that would create standard rules rather than navigating the existing maze of voluntary intiatives.
Under the proposed legislation, large companies would have to report on how they source tropical commodities. The companies would also be banned from using products that are harvested illegally in their country of origin.
But the supermarkets and food companies who signed the letter say the proposed new law has a major loophole: farmers in developing countries can often clear forests to grow cash crops for export without breaking any laws.
The companies want the new British rules to apply to all deforestation - not just in cases where the destruction is illegal. 
""The proposed legislation would continue to allow rampant deforestation in hotspots such as Indonesia and Brazil,"" said Robin Willoughby, UK director of campaign group Mighty Earth.
Companies are also concerned that the legislation would not apply to smaller firms who may import considerable amounts of products, such as rubber, from sensitive forest regions.
Cyril Kormos, executive director of Wild Heritage, a nonprofit based in Berkeley, California, said a more comprehensive overhaul of forest management rules globally would be needed to reverse the loss of old-growth forests, whose stores of carbon form bastions to slow climate change.     

""Deforestation pledges only go so far,"" Kormos said. ""We need an equivalent focus on ending degradation of primary forests.""

The company unveiled plans last year to halt overseas expansion after being criticised by the more than 10,000 farmers who make up its cooperative for its foray into countries like China and value added consumer products that were weighing on its profits. 
""For the last 18 months, we have been reviewing every part of the business to ensure our assets and investments meet the needs of the Co-op today,"" Chief Executive Officer Miles Hurrell said. 
""Selling the farms is in line with our decision to focus on our New Zealand farmers' milk."" 
After the sale, the company will also be able to better prioritise its efforts in the foodservice, consumer and ingredients business in China, its biggest market, it added.
China Youran Dairy Group will purchase two farming-hubs located in Ying and Yutian for NZ$513 million, while Beijing Sanyuan Venture Capital is set to acquire an 85% stake in the Hangu farm. 
The dairy giant said it will use the cash proceeds from the deal to pay down debt further, which it has already managed to reduce by NZ$1 billion, as of September.

PARIS (Reuters) - French utility Suez (PA:SEVI) on Sunday rejected assurances from rival Veolia (PA:VIE) that it will not make a hostile bid for the whole company after closing in on a deal to buy a 29.9% stake from power group Engie (PA:ENGIE).
Veolia (PA:VIE) said it would not launch a hostile bid for the remaining shares in Suez and that any bid for the rest of the shares would require approval from Suez's board.
Veolia had moved closer to a deal to buy Engie's 29.9% stake in Suez on Wednesday, in a prelude to a full takeover bid and marking a breakthrough after weeks of hostilities between the two utilities.
Veolia had removed certain conditions and clauses from the previous outline of its agreement with Engie to persuade the different parties that it would seek a consensual deal. 
But in a letter from Suez Chairman Philippe Varin to Veolia's boss, which was made public, Varin said the Suez board considered Veolia's approach as hostile.
The French state, which has a 24% stake in Engie, is closely monitoring the situation. In a hastily arranged call with reporters on Sunday, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called on Veolia and Suez to resume talks to reach an agreement. 
""Some progress was made yesterday and this morning in the talks between Suez and Veolia,"" he said. 
""We wish that Veolia and Suez find common ground ... which is the only way to preserve the workers' interests as well as the industrial interests of the nation.""
Suez has fiercely rejected Veolia's approach and is supporting a plan by French private equity group Ardian to pull together an alternative bid for Engie's stake in Suez.
Veolia has also told Suez it would extend the scope of the assets to be sold to a would-be buyer of Suez's French water activities to include its international water assets.
The businesses that could potentially be sold to smooth the way to the Veolia-Suez deal would yield total turnover of 5 billion euros ($5.86 billion), including the 2.2 billion euros generated by Suez's French water business. 

Veolia has raised its bid to Engie's Suez stake to 3.4 billion euros. The additional guarantees it offered on Sunday to Engie's board will make that acquisition possible, Veolia said in the same statement.

(Reuters) - Cineworld, the world's second-biggest cinema operator, will close all its screens in the United States, Britain and Ireland this week after studios pulled major releases such as the latest James Bond film, a person familiar with the situation said. 
The Regal cinema owner, which began reopening in July after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions started to ease, employs 37,482 people across 787 venues in the U.S., Britain and central Europe, with 546 sites in America. 
The release of the new James Bond movie, ""No Time To Die,"" was pushed into next year on Friday, crushing hopes for a 2020 industry rebound as rising rates of the coronavirus prompt new restrictions and keep viewers away.
Britain's Sunday Times said the London-listed company had written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Culture Minister Oliver Dowden to warn that the industry was becoming unviable.
It warned investors on Sept. 24 that it might need to raise more money if its sites were forced to shut again, after it swung to a $1.64 billion first-half loss. Its shares have fallen 82% this year. 
Efforts to get audiences back into theaters have proved disappointing. While bigger chains like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), Cineworld and others have reopened many locations, crowds have been thin. Small and mid-sized theatre companies have said they may not survive the impact of the pandemic.
Cineworld had said viewers returned to watch ""Tenet"", a Christopher Nolan spy thriller that became a test case for the wider industry when it became the biggest release to open in cinemas in late August since schedules were torn up in March.
But the postponement of Bond, plus delays to other big releases such as superhero movie ""Black Widow"" and Steven Spielberg's ""West Side Story"" give cinema lovers little reason to return. 

Cineworld declined to comment.

Italy has worked for two years on the plan, which gained final approval from the European Central Bank in September and must be completed by Dec. 1. 
Rome bailed out Monte dei Paschi in 2017, acquiring a 68% stake for 5.4 billion euros ($6.3 billion). To meet conditions agreed at the time with European Union competition authorities, it must cut that stake before the bank approves 2021 earnings.
The 'Hydra' scheme approved on Sunday at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting will lower Monte dei Paschi's impaired loans to 4.3% of total lending, below UniCredit's (MI:CRDI) 4.8%, currently the best level among larger commercial banks.
The move was designed to facilitate a merger, but the Treasury is struggling to find buyers for the loss-making bank, people familiar with the matter have said.
Under the 'Hydra' scheme Monte dei Paschi will transfer 8.1 billion euros in impaired loans to state-owned bad loan manager AMCO, together with other assets and liabilities including 1.1 billion euros in capital.
The deal, which includes a 3.2 billion euro bridge loan by banks UBS and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), allowed Monte dei Paschi to shed the loans without incurring losses.
However, the ECB has demanded the bank replenishes its capital buffers, a condition the Treasury had hoped to fulfil by finding a buyer by the end of the year.
Clinching such a deal, however, will require more time as incentives to lure potential buyers will have to be negotiated, sources have said.
The ruling 5-Star Movement has been calling for the state to hold onto MPS and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is yet to sign a decree needed to complete the bad loan spin-off.

With air travel at a fraction of normal levels due to restrictions and travellers' fears related to the pandemic, airlines have slowed deliveries of new aircraft.
Airbus has said it needs to shed 15,000 posts worldwide.
In an interview with the Handelsblatt business daily, Schoellhorn said the situation in early autumn was worse than the company had expected in the summer, adding that the planned 15,000 job cuts would be the minimum.
As some Airbus factories were already underutilized before the pandemic, labour unions now fear that the management could decide to shut down entire locations.
At least for Germany, Schoellhorn ruled out such a move.
""In terms of substance, I do not see any German locations at risk at the moment,"" he said.
Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury said last month the planemaker would do its best to cut costs without resorting to compulsory redundancies, but it could not guarantee they won't happen.

In a letter to staff in September, Faury warned that Airbus may have to carry out compulsory layoffs after air travel failed to recover from the pandemic as quickly as anticipated.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>",Trump's diagnosis fuels uncertainty for skittish U.S. stock market,"By April Joyner and Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - Investors are gauging how a potential deterioration in President Donald Trump's health could impact asset prices in coming weeks, as the U.S. leader remains hospitalized after being diagnosed with COVID-19.
So far, markets have been comparatively sanguine: hopes of a breakthrough in talks among U.S. lawmakers on another stimulus package took the edge off a stock market selloff on Friday, with the S&P 500 losing less than 1% and so-called safe-haven assets seeing limited demand. News of Trump's hospitalization at a military medical center outside Washington, where he remained on Saturday, came after trading ended on Friday. 
Many investors are concerned, however, that a serious decline in Trump’s health less than a month before Americans go to the polls on Nov. 3 could roil a U.S. stock market that recently notched its worst monthly performance since its selloff in March while causing turbulence in other assets. 
If the president’s health is in jeopardy, there's ""too much uncertainty in the situation for the markets just to shrug it off,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. 
The various outcomes investors currently envision run the gamut from a quick recovery that bolsters Trump's image as a fighter to a drawn-out illness or death stoking uncertainty and drying up risk appetite across markets. 
Should uncertainty persist, technology and momentum stocks that have led this year's rally may be particularly vulnerable to a selloff, some investors said. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 2% on Friday, double the S&P 500's decline. 
""If people ... get nervous right now, probably it manifests itself in crowded trades like tech and mega-cap being unwound a bit,"" Delwiche said
A record 80% of fund managers surveyed last month by BofA Global Research said that buying technology stocks was the market's ""most crowded"" trade. 
The concentration of investors in big tech stocks has also raised concerns over their outsized sway on moves in the broader market.
The largest five U.S. companies – Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) – now account for almost 25% of the S&P 500's market capitalization, according to research firm Oxford Economics.
FISCAL STIMULUS TALKS
Trump’s diagnosis has intensified the spotlight on the fiscal stimulus talks in Washington, with investors saying agreement on another aid package could act as a stabilizing force on markets in the face of election-related uncertainty. 
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said on Friday that negotiations were continuing, but she is waiting for a response from the White House on key areas. 
Fresh stimulus could speed economic healing from the impact of the pandemic, which has put millions of Americans out of work, and benefit economically-sensitive companies whose stock performance has lagged this year, investors said. 
For those who are underweight stocks, ""we would be using this volatility as an opportunity to increase equities because we think we're in an early-stage economic recovery,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory.
Market action on Friday suggested some investors may have been positioning for a stimulus announcement in the midst of the selloff.
The S&P 500 sectors representing industrials and financials, two groups that are more sensitive to a broad economic recovery, rallied 1.1% and 0.7%, respectively, while the broader index declined.
Even with worries over Trump's condition, ""the fiscal program has been the loudest noise in the market,"" said Arnim Holzer, macro and correlation defense strategist at EAB Investment Group.
Investor hedges against election-related market swings put in place over the last few months may have softened Friday's decline and could, to a degree, mitigate future volatility, said Christopher Stanton of hedge fund Sunrise Capital Partners LLC.
Despite Trump's illness, futures on the Cboe Volatility Index continued to show expectations of elevated volatility after the Nov. 3 vote, a pattern consistent with concerns of a contested election.
Nagging doubts over whether the Republican president would agree to hand over the keys to the White House if he loses have grown in recent weeks. During his first debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Tuesday, Trump declined to commit to accepting the results, repeating his unfounded complaint that mail-in ballots would lead to election fraud.

""If Trump's health does not recover ... then he might give up on contesting the election,"" said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. But ""markets are not shifting off the contested election thing right now.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co (T:7267) said on Saturday it has confirmed a 17th U.S. death tied to a faulty Takata air bag inflator.
The Japanese automaker said that after a joint inspection with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), it confirmed a faulty air bag inflator was to blame for the Aug. 20 crash of a 2002 Honda Civic that led to the death of a driver in Mesa, Arizona.
The defect, which leads in rare instances to air bag inflators rupturing and sending metal fragments flying, prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history and is tied to 15 U.S. deaths in Honda vehicles and two in  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) vehicles since 2009. More than 290 injuries are also tied to faulty Takata inflators and at least 26 deaths worldwide. 
Honda said the 2002 Civic had been under recall since December 2011 for replacement of the driver’s frontal airbag inflator, while the passenger's frontal airbag inflator was recalled in 2014.
Honda sent more than 15 mailed recall notices over eight years to registered owners of the vehicle before the crash and made other attempts to contact owners. The driver killed was not the registered owner and Honda said it was not certain if the driver was aware of the unrepaired recalls.
The most recent previous fatal confirmed U.S. incident was the June 2018 death of a driver after the crash of a 2002 Honda Civic in Buckeye, Arizona.
The Takata recalls cover about 100 million inflators among 19 major automakers worldwide, including about 63 million inflators in the United States.
NHTSA says the cause of inflator explosions that can emit deadly fragments is propellant breaking down after long-term exposure to high temperature fluctuations and humidity.

In August, Honda agreed to pay $85 million to settle an investigation by most U.S. states into its use of defective Takata inflators.

The Swiss government has granted the airline more than 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion) in loan guarantees to help it cope with the collapse in air travel due to the pandemic. Like many of its peers it decided to shrink its staff and fleet.
""We are initially relying on three socially acceptable measures: a hiring freeze, part-time models with salary reductions, and early retirement,"" Kluehr told newspaper Schweiz am Wochenende, adding that based on staff fluctuations in recent years it should be possible to cut 1,000 jobs without layoffs.
Swiss and Edelweiss Air, a much smaller sister airline, have 10,475 employees, according to the Lufthansa Group's second-quarter financial report https://investor-relations.lufthansagroup.com/fileadmin/downloads/en/financial-reports/interims-reports/LH-QR-2020-2-e.pdf.

Kluehr, whose successor has yet to be announced, said the airline industry's current crisis should last three to five years. In terms of job cuts much would depend on how quickly the market recovers, he added.
""If, in the medium to long term, we expect Swiss's business to shrink by 20% - and that is what we expect at the moment - then the 1,000 jobs would suffice, yes,"" said Kluehr. 

""If we see in the first quarter, looking towards the summer, that the situation is not improving, particularly in long-haul, then the 1,000 jobs will not be enough.""

Investing.com -- Investors are betting big on  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) as they hunt for the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). And maybe it's finally the right time for the hydrogen fuel cell maker.
PLUG, a provider of hydrogen engines and fueling solutions, is up some 600% this year, and has a market cap of more than $5 billion. But in over two decades of being in business, it has yet to post a profit. That should change, at least in 2024, when it is forecasting the tides will turn. And on the plus side, unlike electric truck maker Nikola, Plug actually has a product that runs on its own and is already in the hands of customers like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""This isn't a company talking about doing this at a future date,"" said Chief Executive Officer Andrew Marsh in a phone interview. ""We've done it, continue to do it, and that is what differentiates Plug Power.""
Plug forecasts revenue of $1.2 billion, operating income of $200 million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $250 million in four years, guidance that was recently boosted after it acquired United Hydrogen Group Inc. and Giner ELX, with a goal that more than 50% of the hydrogen it uses be green by 2024.
""There is a lot of hype around hydrogen right now because of Tesla and electric vehicles, and because earlier this year Nikola came out with plans for a hydrogen truck,"" said Hillary Cacanando senior vice president of Energy Investment Research at Odeon Capital Group. ""Plug's stock rose along with that excitement, however I think the excitement around hydrogen is real this time.""
Plug was among those stocks that 20 years ago flew sky-high amid the dotcom boom. It traded as high as $1,174.38 in 2000 only to come plummeting down for the next two decades. Unlike Nikola, it has a solid back story, Cacanando said.
""Nikola has no revenue, it's really a concept story,"" Cacanando said in a phone interview. ""They have strong customers and strong relationships with Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD).""
The concern is in the margins.
Forklifts represent the majority of revenue for Plug today, and that will continue to be the case four years from now, with sales estimated at $750 million for the material handling business at that time, more than doubling from this year, Marsh said.
""We need to add two other big, large customers to get there,"" said Marsh, who is expecting to announce one of those pedestal clients before the end of 2020, at which point the stock will likely spike, like it does every time Plug puts out a press release.
Another $200 million in revenue should come from electrolyzers that store power -- like solar and wind -- and $250 million from large-scale back-up power. Plug is working on a pilot program with a leading data center company for large-scale stationary back-up power for 2021, Marsh said. Again, that press release will likely lead to a jump in shares.
What about vehicles? While Marsh has no doubt electrification will one day replace the internal combustion engine, it will depend on the cost of hydrogen and the available infrastructure to charge the fuel cells. Marsh points to class A trucks -- big rigs -- and the benefit of hydrogen fuel cells over batteries. Not only are batteries heavier, they also require lengthy charging times, where hydrogen fuel cells require no more than three days a year of charging.
Plug built fueling stations for Walmart and Amazon to charge their forklifts. When it comes to states and countries, though, it's clearly a massive undertaking to get fueling stations dotted across the terrain.
""Consumers are pushing for cleaner solutions and that drives companies,"" Marsh said. ""Companies are looking to be cleaner around the world, and that overlapped with policies"" should result in a movement toward building the necessary infrastructure.
The European Union has mandates to move to totally clean energy by 2050, and California's set to go carbon-free by 2045.
Then there's the high cost. While hydrogen can be produced from renewable energy, it's still expensive.
""The cost for hydrogen is expected to come down dramatically over the next several years, and if that's the case, there's a huge opportunity,"" Canacando said. ""The risk is, is the cost really going to come down?""
The other uncertainty is shareholder wrath. Some have bristled at being diluted as the company issued new equity over the years to make money to expand while profit remained elusive. But Marsh says those days may be over, for now.
""We have half a billion dollars on the balance sheet,"" Marsh said. ""We have no plans to raise capital any time soon.""
Investors seem to be drawn to the stock's tech-like opportunities. ""Investors are willing to accept that for growth potential, particularly in this market, with growth momentum stocks doing well,"" Cacanando said.
Apparently so: the stock has 10 buys, one hold and no sells, and hedge fund D.E.Shaw reported a 5% passive stake in Plug Power, or 20.3 million shares, as of Aug. 24.
Plug's 2024 guidance may yet again be updated, as new acquisitions aren't out of the question, Marsh said.
""I'm always thinking about opportunities to leverage our technology,"" Marsh said. ""I would not be surprised if we find a large or small player that would make sense to partner with or maybe form JVs or purchase.""

349,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 03, 2020 08:37AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Palantir,"By Peter Nurse and Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com -- It’s taken some time in coming but Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) has finally gone public, providing investors with an excellent opportunity to benefit from growth at a major player in the key area of data analysis.
As American management consultant Geoffrey Moore said, “without big data, you are blind and deaf and in the middle of a freeway.”
Following years of secrecy, given its ties with customers including spy, law enforcement and military agencies, Palantir’s foray into the public market has forced it to pull back the curtain on its operations and revealed fundamentals that have some scratching their hands.
Investing.com's Peter Nurse argues the bull case for the newly minted stock, while Yasin Ebrahim explains why it's a wait-and-see. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
Palantir provides governments and corporations with the tools required to organize and glean insights from mounds of data, helping in areas as varied as detailing the spread of the novel coronavirus to tracking the activities of terrorists.
The U.S. data analytics firm made its debut on New York Stock Exchange debut on Wednesday, after years of speculation, via a direct listing and without the usual razzmatazz surrounding a traditional IPO. 
It’s true the stock is trading below its $10 opening price, but this is still well above its reference price of $7.25 and things are likely to look very different when the Street starts its coverage.
The company has yet to make a profit, but surely that won't be long in coming given its losses in the first six months of 2020 totaled $164 million, down from $280 million the same period a year prior.
Palantir anticipates 42% revenue growth in 2020 to about $1.06 billion, according to a filing earlier this week, with gross margins for the first half of this year at an impressive 73%. It also forecasts revenue growth of more than 30% next year. 
Palantir was formed in 2003 in the wake of the 9-11 attacks, with its first major backer – the CIA’s venture arm, In-Q-Tel. It was one of the first companies in this space and thus has had a head start in developing the required technology.
While Palantir still analyzes large amounts of data for U.S. government defense and intelligence agencies -- contracts which tend to be frequently rolled over -- the private sector has become increasingly more important. 
In fact, Palantir now says that a little more than half of its customers come from the private sector instead of governments. And there will undoubtedly be increasing demand from companies given the massive amounts of data they generate.
""Broadly speaking Covid has been a tailwind for our business,"" Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said in a recent interview. ""We started 83 new engagements with customers in the first three weeks of Covid without getting on a plane.""
The coronavirus pandemic has forced companies to revisit how they do business, and the Covid era doesn’t look like ending anytime soon.
The Bear Case"
350,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 03, 2020 08:34AM ET</span>","Playboy Comeback Bets on Women, Wellness and Maybe Sports Betting","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- This is not your uncle's Playboy. 
The iconic brand is making a comeback, going public via a special purpose acquisition company and reinventing itself as a pleasure and lifestyle consumer platform for all, focused on everything from sexual wellness to, potentially, online sports betting. 
""Everything that makes you look good and feel good,"" as Chief Executive Officer Ben Kohn put it in a recent video interview. The company has been best-known for its magazine, which stopped publishing earlier this year.
To help get it there, Playboy agreed to merge with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp, a Spac, in a $415 million deal that's scheduled to close in early 2021. That will set the company up to fund acquisitions and expand.
Kohn said the company is already growing on its own, with sales expected to increase 68% year over year. The key to that growth has been capturing younger generations and transforming the brand from its lascivious origins to one that appeals to the current generation.
""Over 85% of our audience today is under the age of 44,"" Kohn said. ""We've grown the female audience by 70%.""
Future acquisitions will be focused on the $250 billion sexual wellness industry, think: condoms, or the expansion of businesses like its recently released line of CBD bedroom products aimed at women. It's offering more than just stuff to buy, too. Playboy wants to provide advice and education. 
""How do we help people have better sex lives?"" said Chief Brand and Strategy Officer Rachel Webber in the same interview. ""That's how we're thinking about it.""
Recently, the company rolled out a three-part class about the orgasm gap with Allbodies, an online health education company. Some 3,000 people signed up for the first class, without any marketing.
""It's such a sign that there's a need in the marketplace,"" Kohn said.
The company is ready to use its brand recognition to expand into new places and businesses.
The Playboy bunny has always had a close association with casinos, and online sports betting could be a new frontier for the company.
""Historically, this brand has worked very well in sports; I can't announce anything that's imminent,"" Kohn said, playing coy. ""It's not like it's not on our radar.""
Also on the radar, in a major way, is the Chinese market, where Kohn says Playboy is the leading men's fashion brand. Not far behind China is India, where Playboy will launch its first legitimate consumer products later this year. 
While the Playboy brand is obviously highly recognizable, it's working to shed its old reputation as an adult magazine full of sexy centerfolds and the occasional edgy interview or article. Playboy's staff is now 50% female, and almost the entire editorial staff consists of women. They also have women behind the camera, and the subjects of the photographs are intimately involved in the shoots.
""At its core, it's about free expression, sexual freedoms,"" Weber said. It's ""about really creating a platform for people to own their sexuality.""       
Still, it will take a long time to shed its salacious past, Kohn said. The brand, however, is powerful. Playboy ranks as the 21st on the annual Top 150 Global Licensors report, which ranks the retail sales of licensed merchandise from the world's most powerful brands, spanning all consumer product segments. That's ahead of Pokemon and Ferrari (NYSE:RACE).
""The advantage of this company is that you can't replicate it,"" Kohn said.

351,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>","Paytm, other Indian startups vow to fight 'big daddy' Google's clout: sources","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Dozens of India's technology startups, chafing at Google's local dominance of key apps, are banding together to consider ways to challenge the U.S. tech giant, including by lodging complaints with the government and courts, executives told Reuters.
Although Google, owned by Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), has worked closely with India's booming startup sector and is ramping up its investments, it has recently angered many tech companies with what they say are unfair practices.
Setting the stage for a potential showdown, entrepreneurs held two video conferences this week to strategise, three executives told Reuters.
""It's definitely going to be a bitter fight,"" said Dinesh Agarwal, CEO of e-commerce firm IndiaMART (NS:INMR). ""Google will lose this battle. It's just a matter of time.""
He said executives have discussed forming a new startup association aimed chiefly at lodging protests with the Indian government and courts against the Silicon Valley company.
Nearly 99% of the smartphones of India's half a billion users run on Google's Android mobile operating system. Some Indian startups say that allows Google to exert excessive control over the types of apps and other services they can offer, an allegation the company denies.
The uproar began last month when Google removed popular payments app Paytm from its Play Store, citing policy violations. This led to a sharp rebuke from the Indian firm's founder, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, whose app returned to the Google platform a few hours later, after Paytm made certain changes.
In a video call on Tuesday, Sharma called Google the ""big daddy"" that controls the ""oxygen supply of (app) distribution"" on Android phones, according to an attendee. He urged the roughly 50 executives on the call to join hands to ""stop this tsunami.""
""If we together don't do anything, then history will not be kind to us. We have to control our digital destiny,"" Sharma said.
One idea raised was to launch a local rival to Google's app store, but Sharma said this would not be immediately effective given Google's dominance, one source said.
Sharma and Paytm, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), did not respond to requests for comment.
Google declined to comment. It has previously said its policies aim to protect Android users and that it applies and enforces them consistently on developers.
STRAINING TIES
This week the U.S. company angered some Indian startups by deciding to enforce a 30% commission it charges on payments made within apps on the Android store.
Two dozen executives were on a call on Friday where many slammed that decision. They discussed filing antitrust complaints and approaching Google's India head for discussions, said two sources with direct knowledge of the call.
Participants included sports technology firm Dream Sports, backed by U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global, social media company ShareChat and digital payments firm PhonePe, the sources said. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.
Google defends the policy, saying 97% of apps worldwide comply with it.
Google already faces an antitrust case related to its payments app in India and a competition investigation into claims it abused Android's dominant position. The company says it complies with all laws. 
These spats strain Google's strong ties to Indian startups. It has invested in some and helped hundreds with product development. In July, its Indian-born CEO Sundar Pichai committed $10 billion in new investments over five to seven years.
The conflict ""is counterproductive to what Google has been doing - it's an odd place for them to be,"" said a senior tech executive familiar with Google's thinking. ""It's a reputation issue. It's in the interest of Google to resolve this issue.""
Google looms over every aspect of the industry.
Paytm on Saturday told several startup founders, in a communication seen by Reuters, that it was collating input on challenges to Google Play Store and its policies to submit to the authorities.

To craft their attack, they are using a shared Google document.

352,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Airbnb aims to raise roughly $3 billion in IPO - sources,"By Anirban Sen and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Home rental company Airbnb Inc is aiming to raise around $3 billion in its upcoming initial public offering (IPO), people familiar with the matter said on Friday, taking advantage of the unexpectedly sharp recovery in its business after the COVID-19 pandemic roiled the travel industry. 
Airbnb will be one of the largest and most anticipated U.S. stock market listings of 2020 which has already been a blockbuster year for IPOs, featuring the likes of record label  Warner Music Group  (O:WMG), data analytics firm Palantir Technologies (N:PLTR) and data warehouse company  Snowflake Inc  (N:SNOW). 
Airbnb said in August it had filed confidentially for an IPO with U.S. regulators.
The company's current plan is to make its filing publicly available in November after the U.S presidential election and is targeting an IPO some time in December, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the plans are private. 
The sources cautioned that the timing is subject to change and market conditions, in particular volatility that could come from the election. 
A spokesman for Airbnb declined to comment. 
The company could achieve a valuation of more than $30 billion in the IPO, the sources added, again cautioning this was subject to market conditions. 
This would be substantially higher than the $18 billion Airbnb was valued at in April when it raised $2 billion in debt from investors. Airbnb's most recent independent appraisal of the fair market value of its stock pegged its worth at around $21 billion. 
The push to go public and the growth in its potential valuation underscores Airbnb's dramatic recovery from earlier this year when it secured emergency funding from investors and the outlook for the travel industry was uncertain. 
Since then, San Francisco-based Airbnb has benefited as travelers shy away from larger hotels and instead prefer to drive to local vacation rentals. 
The company said in July that customers had booked more than 1 million nights in a single day for the first time since March 3.
Shares of U.S. online travel agency Booking Holdings Inc (O:BKNG), which some Airbnb investors use as a conservative public market proxy for its own stock, have rebounded more than 35% in the past six months.
Reuters reported last month that billionaire investor William Ackman had approached Airbnb about going public through a reverse merger with his blank-check company but that Airbnb was prioritizing going public through a traditional IPO.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As big U.S. commercial banks close their books on the third quarter, analysts expect them to report a 30% to 60% plunge in profits on the year-ago period due to the pandemic-induced recession and near record low interest rates.
That slump in third quarter net income comes even though lenders are not going to make outsized provisions for expected loan losses as they did in the first and second quarters.
And, while capital markets and investment banking revenue is expected to be up from 5% to 20%, that won't be enough to make up for the decline in interest income from loans and securities.
""You have soft loan growth and you're still feeling the impact from aggressive Fed actions earlier this year,"" said analyst Jason Goldberg of  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), the third- and fourth-biggest U.S. banks by assets respectively, will report net income down by about 60%, according to I/B/E/S analyst survey data from Refinitiv.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), which rank first and second in assets respectively, are expected to show profits down about 30%.
Investment banks  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), which are benefitting from being more concentrated in the busy capital markets, are expected to report more modest profit declines of about 5% to 10%. 
JPMorgan and Citigroup will kick off the third-quarter bank earnings season on Oct. 13.
Pandemic-driven lockdowns have put tens of millions of Americans out of work and plunged the U.S. into a recession. U.S. output is forecast to fall 3.7% in 2020, the Federal Reserve said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-reopen/u-s-economic-rebound-may-be-a-slow-train-for-the-unemployed-idUKKBN268327 last month.. That is not as bad as feared earlier in June, allowing banks to hold off on adding to their loss reserves. 
At an online Barclays investor conference last month, bank executives said consumers have paid down credit card debt during the recession and businesses have shunned bank loans. Big companies have instead been able to raise cash via the bond markets, which are being propped up by the Fed.
Consumer loans at large U.S. banks were also down about 3% in the quarter from a year earlier, according to Fed data.
As markets plunged in March, the central bank cut overnight interest rates to near zero and began a massive campaign to buy securities. Those purchases and a surge in savings from worried consumers have flooded banks with more deposits than they can lend or risk putting into longer-term securities.

Stuffed with cash, bank net interest margins -- the spread between their cost of money and what they earn on loans and securities -- fell to their lowest levels in 35 years in the second-quarter, according to research by Goldman Sachs.

Brett Icahn, 41, will manage a team of portfolio managers, will buy a $10 million stake in the firm and join the board of directors of the firm his 84-year old father has been running for decades, the company said in a release.
The pair, who have worked together off and on for years, said Brett would likely become chief executive and chairman in seven years or sooner if Carl agrees. Carl Icahn is currently the chairman and Keith Cozza is the president and chief executive officer. The Icahns could not be reached for comment.
Brett Icahn co-managed Icahn Enterprises' Sargon Portfolio until 2016 and helped the elder Icahn make successful stock picks, including an investment in Netflix Inc (O:NFLX).
The Sargon Portfolio generated annualized gross returns of 26.8% over its six-year lifetime.
Six years ago, Brett Icahn planned to launch his own hedge fund, with an activist bent, but quickly abandoned the plan in order to stay at his father's firm, for a while.
Brett Icahn's return comes one year after Carl Icahn moved himself and his firm from mid-town Manhattan to Florida after the investor, known for picking winners and facing off with captains of industry, had grown weary of working in New York.
Carl Icahn gave up investing for outside clients nine years ago, but his vast personal wealth, estimated at $13.8 billion, allows him to stay in the game, putting billions to work in companies like Occidental Petroleum (N:OXY) where he waged a bitter fight to take control.

He hired three portfolio managers to work on investments under his and Brett Icahn's supervision, the statement added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top-performing U.S. stockpickers of the third quarter made bets on companies ranging from healthcare technology to wind power, helping some funds post gains of 40% or more during a three-month stretch that ended with the S&P 500 suffering its first monthly decline since March. 
The $7.4 million WP Small Companies fund posted the best overall performance among actively managed U.S. equity funds with a 45.9% gain through Sept. 29, according to Morningstar Direct data released on Wednesday. Its largest position by far was in healthcare technology company Ontrak Inc, which made up nearly 34% of its portfolio. Shares of the company are up nearly 268% for the year to date. 
The $5.2 billion Baron Partners Retail fund followed with a gain of 45.4% for the quarter, slightly ahead of the $480 million Baron Focused Growth Retail fund. 
The $95 million Shelton Green Alpha fund posted a 29.7% gain for the quarter, making it the 7th-best fund overall and the best performer among funds that invest based on environmental, social and governance factors. Its largest position was in Vestas Wind Systems A/S, which is up 55% for the year to date. 
The outsized gains came in a quarter in which the benchmark S&P 500 rose 8.5% overall. The index dropped 3.9% in September, its first monthly decline since the Federal Reserve launched unprecedented stimulus measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Among fixed income managers, the $3.3 billion AlphaCentric Income Opportunities fund posted the best return among active funds with a 10.4% gain for the quarter. The fund had its largest positions in mortgage-backed securities, including Option One Mortgage Loan Trust and Soundview Home Loan Trust, according to Morningstar data. 
The $862 million MicroSector FANG+ 3x Leveraged fund posted the best return among all funds. The fund, which uses options to triple the daily gain or loss of technology giants such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), gained 94.5% over the quarter, pushing its year-to-date return to 205.5%.

(Reuters) - Activist investment firm Trian Fund Management LP has taken a 9.9% stake each in asset management firms Invesco Ltd and Janus Henderson Group (NYSE:JHG) Plc, totaling about $900 million, people familiar with the matter said.
Trian, founded by Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May, has experience in pushing for better returns at asset management companies at a time when many of the smaller players are struggling to stay relevant with giants like Vanguard and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) controlling the bulk of the industry's assets.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the stakes and said they were funded with capital from a long-term portfolio that Trian has built to help facilitate consolidation in the asset management industry.
Representatives for Invesco and Janus Henderson said each company was committed to delivering value for shareholders.
A Janus Henderson spokesman said the firm was informed about the Trian stake on Thursday and that it continues to ""make significant progress to increase profitability, drive organic growth, and identify and deliver cost savings.""
An Invesco spokeswoman said: ""We continuously evaluate opportunities to further strengthen our ability to meet client needs and enhance long-term shareholder value.""
Trian could not be reached for comment.
The asset management industry has been shaped by a recent wave of consolidation as investors prefer to put money into cheaper index funds instead of more expensive actively managed portfolios.
Earlier this year, Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) , known for its Franklin Income Fund, bought rival  Legg Mason  (NYSE:LM), where Trian had invested for the second time in early 2019.
Invesco bought OppenheimerFunds last year.
Trian often wins board seats at its target companies and had seats on the Legg Mason board. It has previously owned stakes in Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) and  State Street  (NYSE:STT) and recently announced a stake in cable giant Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), saying its stock was undervalued.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Trian Fund Management LP said on Friday that it owns large stakes in Invesco Ltd and Janus Henderson Group (NYSE:JHG) Plc and plans to encourage the asset managers to consider strategic options like a merger as the industry faces a wave of consolidation.
Trian said in a regulatory filing that it owns 9.9% stakes in both Atlanta-headquartered Invesco and Denver-headquartered Janus Henderson and has spoken with both firms.
The news that Trian, which has a history of investing in asset management firms, is pushing for changes at the two prominent U.S. firms lifted stock prices in pre-market trading on Friday. Invesco's shares were up 5.78% while Janus Henderson's shares were up 6.48%.
Reuters reported news of the new stakes on Thursday and representatives for the companies said on Thursday that each company was committed to delivering value for shareholders.
Friday's filing had more details, including that Trian has asked for two board seats for its co-founders Nelson Peltz and Ed Garden at Invesco.
The filing said Trian has held ""constructive"" discussion with Invesco's chief executive officer Martin Flanagan and chief financial officer Allison Dukes. At Janus Henderson, Trian has spoken with non-executive chairman Richard Gillingwater and intends to speak with the board and management about strategic and operational initiatives, the filing said.
It is unusual for an activist to take two stakes in companies in the same business at the same time and push for consolidation, industry lawyers said. But Trian has experience in asset management industry consolidation having sat on the board of  Legg Mason  (NYSE:LM) which was purchased by rival Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) earlier this year. 
Smaller players are struggling to stay relevant with giants like Vanguard and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) controlling the bulk of the industry's assets at a time investors are preferring passive index funds to more expensive actively managed portfolios.

359,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: A Biden victory could weigh on stock market's winners,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors on Wall Street can add another layer of uncertainty to a market already unnerved by last month's sell-off, stalled fiscal stimulus and President Donald Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis, which weighed on stocks on Friday. 
A higher capital gains tax that could accompany a win by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is also emerging as a potential counterweight to this year's powerful rally in stocks.
Biden has proposed https://br.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-biden-trump-proposed-taxes/fact-check-comparison-of-proposed-taxes-under-biden-and-trump-looks-at-highest-tax-bracket-only-idUSKBN2672GE taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, which would increase the tax rate from 20% to 39.6% for individuals and couples earning over $1 million, the highest tax bracket. 
That policy - which would likely be easier to enact if Democrats also win the Senate and retain control of the House - may push some investors to lock in gains ahead of December if Biden emerges the winner in the Nov. 3 vote, fund managers said. 
Tax-motivated selling would likely be most pronounced in technology and other momentum stocks and could push the broad S&P 500 index lower between November and the end of the year, said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV). 
""If you have enough people looking to harvest gains, that has an impact on the stocks that have led the market, and the big tech stocks could be where people choose to sell at the end of the year,"" he said.
On Friday, President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis triggered a sell-off in stocks and oil as investors moved away from risk assets. But many tech and momentum stocks are sporting healthy gains for the year despite a sell-off that pushed the S&P 500 down 3.9% in September, its first monthly loss since March. 
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), for instance, is up 436% for the year through Friday, while  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM) is up 610% and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is up 74%. The S&P 500 index as a whole is up 3.8% over the same time. 
That kind of momentum may be difficult to slow, especially if it is aided by seasonal trends. November and December tend to be among the best months for stock performance, boasting an average gain of 1.34% and 1.57%, respectively, for the S&P 500, according to research firm CFRA.
""The third quarter is usually weak, but when it is really strong, like it was in 2020, this says the rally isn’t over yet,” explained LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.
Still, some believe a Biden victory would provide a strong incentive for profit-taking. 
SELLING 'AHEAD OF SCHEDULE'
Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic, believes a broad Democratic victory will likely lead to more stock market volatility as soon as the results of the election are known as investors start selling winners. 
He has been counseling some clients to generate more income this year as opposed to in 2021, by taking money out of retirement accounts, which would add another layer of selling, he said. 
""You're going to see people selling things that they would be selling anyway, but ahead of schedule,"" he said. 
Investors in the coming week will be keeping an eye on minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent monetary policy meeting, due out Wednesday, for insight on how the central bank views the nascent recovery in the United States. 
Higher taxes do not always lead to increased selling. Overall, the capital gains tax rate could go as high as 40% before having widespread effects on investor behavior and discouraging investment, according to a paper by Princeton University economics professors Owen Zidar and Ole Agersnap.
Personal income tax rates are more likely to affect the market's winners this year, Cordaro said, while increased corporate taxes would most likely lower valuations across the stock market over the next year. 
By 2024, however, enactment of Biden's proposed tax measures and other policies would cut just 4% off of estimated earnings for the S&P 500 compared with baseline estimates, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
Increasing corporate taxes while the global economy is still trying to recover from the coronavirus pandemic could dent the rally in the stock market and cut into company plans to hire or invest in new projects by eating into after-tax net income, said 
hedge fund manager J. Daniel Plants, who runs Voce Capital Management.

""History teaches us that this is the worst possible moment to subject the economy to the type of massive tax increases that Biden is proposing, especially the changes that would impede capital formation and make domestic job creation less attractive,"" he said.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 09:36PM ET</span>",Intel wins second phase of contract to help Pentagon develop chips,"By Stephen Nellis
CHANDLER, Arizona - (Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) on Friday said it has won a second-phase contract in a project aimed at helping the U.S. military make more advanced semiconductors within the United States.
Under the project, Intel will help the military develop prototypes of chips using its semiconductor packaging technology at factories in Arizona and Oregon. The packaging technology allows pieces of chips called ""chiplets"" from different providers to be combined into one package, helping cram more features into a smaller finished product while lowering its power consumption.
""As more and more semiconductor manufacturing has moved offshore, the (Department of Defense) is very interested in ensuring that they have advanced microelectronics for national security manufactured here in the U.S.,"" Bob Swan, Intel's chief executive, told Reuters in an interview as he toured a recently completed $7 billion factory expansion in Arizona, where Intel's workforce totals 12,000. 
""As a U.S.-based company, it's important to us to be able to address some of the fundamental concerns that the U.S. would have about access to these critical technologies going forward,"" he said.
Intel declined to disclose a dollar figure for its portion of the contract, which is being overseen by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division. Intel won part of the first phase of the contract in 2019.
Intel's work with the Defense Department comes as U.S. officials focus on boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing in response to the rise of China as a strategic competitor. About 75% of the world's chipmaking capacity is in Asia, with many of the most advanced plants in Taiwan and Korea, within the reach of the Chinese and North Korean militaries.
“I think one of the areas where we can have the most impact on China broadly is re-shoring microelectronics,"" Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, told the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee in a hearing on Thursday.
Intel is one of three companies in the world that can make highly advanced computer chips. The other two - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd - have packaging technology similar to Intel's.
But Intel has been working on the technology longer and can perform the work in the United States, which the other two cannot, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive officer of VLSI Research.
""There's no one else with the mix of technology that they have in the United States,"" he said. ""Packaging (NYSE:PKG) is a big win for them.""
With Washington's relations with Beijing at their worst in decades, U.S. officials have cracked down on suppliers to Chinese firms such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], with new rules on Sept. 15 barring most U.S. companies from selling to the Chinese telecommunications giant. Intel confirmed last month that it has licenses to keep supplying some products. 
Swan said that global market access was ""very important"" to helping Intel generate the cash needed to build chip factories, called ""fabs"" in the industry.

""We make money, we take that money, and we reinvest predominantly here, in fabs in the U.S. and in research and development,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has agreed to acquire German ATW Automation, a supplier assembling battery modules and packs for the auto industry, a source familiar with the transaction said on Friday.
ATW, a subsidiary of Canadian  ATS Automation Tooling Systems  Inc (TO:ATA), was on the brink of liquidation due to a slump in orders, German media reported in September.
ATS on Sept. 25 announced that certain assets and employees at one of its Germany-based units would be sold and transferred to a third party, without disclosing the name of the company.
ATS and ATW on Friday did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
German outlets TheEuropean and WirtschaftsKurier first reported the acquisition.
ATW, based in western Germany, has about 120 employees and has completed more than 20 battery production lines for international automakers, according to ATS' website.
Tesla plans to ramp up battery production significantly in the coming years and during a recent event presented innovations that it said would sharply reduce the cost of battery packs within the next three years.
The company is currently building its third vehicle manufacturing facility near Berlin, which will also include a battery plant, and aims to start construction on a new vehicle factory in Texas this year.
Tesla's planned future lineup includes the light duty Cybertruck and the Semi truck, which require higher battery capacities.
Tesla on Friday said it had delivered a record 139,300 vehicles globally in the third quarter. The company aims to deliver half a million vehicles by the end of this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday as news that U.S. President Donald Trump tested positive for COVID-19 put investors in a risk-off mood and added to mounting uncertainties surrounding the looming election.
Tech shares weighed heaviest on the indexes, but the blue-chip Dow's losses were mitigated by gains in economically sensitive cyclical stocks.
Despite Friday's sell-off, the S&P and the Nasdaq both gained 1.5% on the week, while the Dow ended the session 1.9% higher than last Friday's close.
Trump tweeted late Thursday that he had contracted the coronavirus and would be placed under quarantine, compounding the unknowns for an already volatile market. 
But stocks pared losses after the White House provided assurances that Trump, while experiencing mild symptoms, is not incapacitated. 
""This injects further uncertainty into the outcome of the election,"" said Roberto Perli, head of global policy research at Cornerstone Macro in Washington. ""My read is that markets have demonstrated an aversion of late especially to uncertainty, not so much to one or the other candidate winning."" 
Equities also got a brief boost after U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement that an agreement to provide another $25 billion in government assistance to the airline industry was ""imminent."" 
""Markets are also paying attention to the likelihood that another stimulus package will pass soon,"" Perli added. ""If that happens it could offset at least in part the uncertainty generated by the COVID news."" 
House Democrats passed a $2.2 trillion fiscal aid package on Thursday, but the bill is unlikely to be approved in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Partisan wrangling over the size and details of a new round of stimulus have stalled, over two months after emergency unemployment benefits expired for millions of Americans. 
Data released on Friday showed the recovery of the labor market could be losing steam. The U.S. economy added 661,000 jobs in September, fewer than expected and the slowest increase since the recovery began in May.
Payrolls remain a long way from regaining the 22 million jobs lost since the initial shutdown, and the ranks of the permanently unemployed are swelling. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 134.09 points, or 0.48%, to 27,682.81, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 32.36 points, or 0.96%, to 3,348.44 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 251.49 points, or 2.22%, to 11,075.02.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California's health secretary on Friday agreed to hear more input from theme park operators before issuing reopening guidelines, a step that further delays Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) plans to welcome visitors back to Disneyland.
Disney Executive Chairman Bob Iger also resigned from a California task force on reopening businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, the Sacramento Bee newspaper reported late on Thursday. No reason was given and Disney did not respond to requests for comment. 
Earlier this week, Disney said the continued closure of Disneyland had exacerbated the financial strain on its parks division from the pandemic. The company, which is in the process of laying off 28,000 employees, has urged California to let Disneyland reopen. 
On Thursday, a trade group that represents Disneyland, Comcast Corp's (O:CMCSA) Universal Studios and others, said it had reviewed California's draft guidelines and then asked the state to hear more recommendations from the industry.
On Friday, Dr. Mark Ghaly, California's health secretary, said he would continue talks with theme park operators. 
""Given the size and operational complexities of these unique sectors, we are seeking additional input from health, workforce and business stakeholders to finalize this important framework - all leading with science and safety,"" Ghaly said in a statement.
Disneyland has been closed since March. The company had announced the resort would reopen on July 17 but later delayed the move indefinitely, saying it had to wait for the state's guidance.
All other Disney theme parks, including Walt Disney World in Florida, have reopened with limited attendance, mask requirements and other safety measures.

370,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 03:58PM ET</span>","Dow Ends Lower as Traders Weigh Stimulus Progress, Trump Infection","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The Dow closed lower on Friday as investors weighed the progress of stimulus talks and the added election uncertainty after President Donald Trump tested positive for Covid-19. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.48%, or 134 points, but snapped its four-week losing streak. The S&P 500 fell 0.95% while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.22%.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled that an agreement on aid for airlines was nearing the finish line. The house speaker had urged carriers including American Airlines and United Airlines to delay cutting tens of thousands of jobs as the industry has suffered from weaker travel demand owing to the coronavirus pandemic.
Airlines climbed on the news, lifting industrials higher, with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) climbed, the latter rising more than 3%.
Hopes for a broader stimulus package were also boosted following a Washington Post report suggesting U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi had made progress on talks, which are set to continue into the weekend.  
""Two people who have spoken with senior administration officials in recent weeks, granted anonymity to share details of private conversations, said the White House is pushing harder for a deal in part because Trump trails in the polls"" the Washington Post reported.
The progress on stimulus slightly eased worries over election uncertainty after President Trump confirmed he and his wife had tested positive for the coronavirus and would isolate themselves.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court said on Friday it will take up a long-running legal dispute over whether the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) can loosen U.S. media ownership rules.
A lower court has thwarted the FCC's efforts to revise the rules since 2003 in a series of decisions.
In 2017, the Republican-led FCC voted to eliminate a ban in place since 1975 on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market. It also voted to make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market, for local stations to jointly sell advertising time and for companies to buy additional radio stations in some markets.
The FCC said in 2003 ""that the ownership rules should be substantially overhauled because they inhibit beneficial combinations between struggling traditional outlets and no longer reflect current market realities.""
The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year directed the FCC to take up the issue again, finding that the regulatory agency ""did not adequately consider the effect its sweeping rule changes will have on ownership of broadcast media by women and racial minorities.""
FCC General Counsel Tom Johnson wrote on Twitter on Friday that the Supreme Court's agreeing to hear the case ""is great news for struggling local news outlets and American consumers.""
The National Association of Broadcasters industry group said the 3rd Circuit ""has blocked common-sense changes to outdated broadcast ownership regulations to the detriment of local journalism. The time has come to allow the FCC to modernize its rules.""

FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, said that court ""was right"" that the commission ""has repeatedly failed to consider the effect of its ownership rulings on women and minorities, which has impeded greater broadcast diversity.""

372,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>","Banks, investors pivot towards Biden win after Trump tests positive for COVID","By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global banks and investors said they were stepping up their preparations for a victory by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden after his rival Republican President Donald Trump revealed he had tested positive for COVID-19 early on Friday.
The development was the latest dramatic twist in an extraordinary election year that had many banks and investors planning for no clear winner on Nov. 3 with a global market panic expected to ensue, Reuters reported Wednesday.
By Friday, they were quickly shifting gears on the basis that Trump's positive result would deal a blow to his campaign and lessen the overall chances of a contested election outcome.
""Trump contracting the coronavirus will elevate institutional money's preparation for a Democratic White House and all the tax, trade and budget implications that go along with it,"" James McDonald, CEO of Los Angeles-based fund manager Hercules Investments wrote in a note.
""We expect institutional investors to start de-risking portfolios and increasing hedges in preparation for market volatility.""
Oil prices dropped on the news and stocks saw an initial selloff in a volatile morning trading session.
Major banks have been running simulations to ensure they can cope with a spike in market, liquidity and credit risks in case of a contested election or even a constitutional crisis.
One senior capital markets banker said on Friday that their institution was still stress testing for all scenarios, but that it had tilted the focus of the simulations more towards a clear Biden victory and what that would entail in terms of volatility and hedging strategies.
""This increases Biden's chances and reduces the chance of lawsuits and recriminations,"" said another banker.
The bankers declined to be identified because the internal plans are private.
Biden, who tested negative for COVID-19 on Friday, has a nine-point lead over Trump following their combative first debate on Tuesday, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published Thursday.
The White House said on Friday that the president was displaying mild symptoms and was self-isolating with first lady Melania Trump who also tested positive. His campaign said it was rescheduling or postponing several planned events. It was unclear if the next television election debate scheduled on Oct. 15 would still go ahead.
One of the bankers added that Trump's predicament would shift the election focus back towards the pandemic and away from the U.S. economy, a signature policy for Trump on which he had led Biden in approval ratings. In a further blow for the president, U.S. employment growth slowed more than expected in September, Friday data showed https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy/wrapup-3-us-job-growth-slows-in-september-permanent-unemployment-increasing-idUSL1N2GS23C.
""He'll be losing valuable time to campaign and it brings the issue that he’s dismissed right back front and center,"" said another major investor. ""He has been trying to put the COVID topic in the rear view mirror and now it comes right back as topic number one.""
Even with the risk of a contested election abating, some investors said they were still planning for heightened volatility.
""I don't think volatility suddenly disappears right after the election,"" wrote Jason Brady (NYSE:BRC), President and CEO at Thornburg Investment Management, a New Mexico-based asset manager with $41 billion in client assets.

""Up and down markets will be with us into December and January as second order effects from the transfer of power with a new administration – or tweaks to an existing one – get priced in.""

Investing.com – The Dow cut some losses Friday, led by a rise in airlines after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi touted further aid for the industry amid advancing talks in Congress, though a fall in tech kept gains in check. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.13%, or 37 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.64% while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.93%.
Pelosi said in a statement that lawmakers will provide further aid for airlines either through a broad stimulus package or “bipartisan standalone legislation,”  Bloomberg reported. 
Airlines climbed on the news, lifting industrials higher, with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) climbed, with the latter more than 2%.
Pelosi urged carriers including American Airlines and United Airlines Holdings to delay cutting tens of thousands of jobs as the industry has suffered from weaker travel demand owing to the coronavirus pandemic.
The progress on stimulus slightly eased worries over election uncertainty after President Trump confirmed he and his wife had tested positive for the coronavirus and would isolate themselves.
“A positive test result for the President is also a reminder to the market that the virus is far from contained and remains the biggest risk to the economy, the outlook, policy and the election itself,” Stifel said in a note.
The diagnosis comes as fears over the slowing pace of the economic recovery continue after the U.S. created fewer jobs than expected last month, with economists warning of further pain ahead.

374,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 03:09PM ET</span>",Airline Payroll Aid Blocked in U.S. House as Job Losses Stack Up,"(Bloomberg) -- A last-ditch effort to pass legislation in the House to prevent massive airline layoffs was blocked on Friday, ending an attempt by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to bypass stalled talks to agree on a stimulus package.
Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat who was leading the push, said Republicans halted his attempt to bring up the bipartisan measure. That effectively ended hopes until next week at the earliest for payroll assistance to struggling carriers, which have already begun laying off tens of thousands of workers.
“Madam Speaker in plain English, what you just said is that the Republican majority killed this legislation, plain and simple,” DeFazio said on the House floor.
DeFazio, chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, appeared frustrated, at one point slamming his hand against the lectern when the chair told him he couldn’t continue talking.
The back and forth whipsawed airline stocks, which fell early in the session and then jumped on Pelosi’s announcement that she would push for a stand-alone measure to help carriers. A Standard & Poor’s index of U.S. airlines pared gains after the aid was blocked, climbing 1.7% at 3:01 p.m. in New York.
Payroll support of $25 billion for passenger carriers expired Sept. 30, prompting American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. to start laying off tens of thousands of employees.
“As relief for airline workers is being advanced, the airline industry must delay these devastating job cuts,” Pelosi said in a statement. “This initiative is focused solely on the workers, keeping them on the payroll so these workers maintain their critical training and certification requirements unique to their industry.”
Pelosi’s support of standalone legislation proposed by DeFazio signaled a newfound willingness to provide airline aid outside of a comprehensive economic rescue package. But it also came at a time of heavy political maneuvering during the lead-up to the November elections in which both parties are trying to blame the other for a lack of Covid-19 aid.
To pass on such short notice, the measure needed unanimous backing by all members.
Hit by an unprecedented travel slump because of the coronavirus pandemic, airlines have been parking jets, paring flight schedules and asking employees to accept voluntary separation deals such as buyouts and temporary leave.
‘Cannot Wait’
As DeFazio sought to push his attempt at aid, American said in a statement: “As promised, we will reverse our furlough process and recall any impacted team members if the Payroll Support Program is extended in the next few days.”
United, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co. didn’t immediately comment, nor did trade group Airlines for America.
“Aviation workers cannot wait,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. “While Congress and the administration continue to negotiate a broader deal, we are out of time.”
Assistance to pay for airline payrolls has received widespread support. President Donald Trump and a group of Republican senators have previously said they supported the goal. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters Friday that the chief executive officer of American Airlines called him.
“The airlines need some help,” Kudlow said.
A bill introduced by Republican senators Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Susan Collins of Maine on Sept. 21 would give passenger air carriers, cargo air carriers, and airline contractors an additional $28 billion in pandemic aid to cover payrolls.
So far, the bill hasn’t been taken up and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hasn’t scheduled a vote on it.
The bills would require airlines accepting aid to hold off on layoffs until March 31, 2021.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 02:51PM ET</span>",Trump's positive COVID-19 test throws markets pre-election curveball,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Lewis Krauskopf
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors already skittish ahead of U.S. elections in November now have another thing to worry about: the president's health.
Donald Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis triggered a drop in oil prices and an initial selloff in stocks on Friday. 
U.S. equities were still volatile on Friday but had cut some of their losses in afternoon trade as investors digested that news and the prospect that lawmakers would agree on a long-awaited fiscal spending bill before the election. 
Where investors go from here could rest on how Trump copes with a disease that has killed more than a million people around the world.
""This is a new uncertainty in a world which is mixed-up already, which is not the best,"" said Chris Bailey, a European strategist at Raymond James.
In the U.S., the benchmark S&P 500 stock index (SPX) was down 0.8% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) dropped 2%. Oil prices fell more than 3%. 
Markets may have also been soothed by news that Trump's opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, tested negative for the virus after the two men met for their first debate earlier in the week.
""If you have the two nominees both infected with COVID, that would really throw another huge uncertainty in the election and what happens next,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory. ""We’ve never had something like that happen before.""
If Trump's symptoms turn out to be mild and he recovers quickly, the Republican president could use the experience to project his image as a fighter in the campaign against Biden. 
But investors might be more alarmed if the 74-year-old gets very sick and has to be hospitalized, as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in the spring, or the virus spreads to other members of Trump's administration.
The news fuelled the sense that investors are headed for a period of heightened volatility, with most agreed that markets will remain on edge for the foreseeable future amid uncertainty over the path of the pandemic as well as the election.
Volatility gauges rose, with the widely watched Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) edging up to about 27.50 points, from around 27 points on Thursday, after rising to nearly 30 points earlier.
The moves were nowhere as large as during the depths of market mayhem in March but, with only a month left before the election, Trump's news comes at a critical time.
In a sign of concerns regarding the political impact of his diagnosis, the gap between October  and November VIX  futures narrowed. VIX futures reflect volatility expectations in the 30 days following their expiration, so October futures capture sentiment regarding the Nov. 3 election date.
In currency markets, implied volatility gauges for the yen over the next month rose to a four-week high of 7.6 vols , signaling more choppy trading ahead.
David Arnaud, a fixed-income fund manager at Canada Life Asset Management, said that he had positioned for uncertainty in the coming weeks by increasing exposure to safe-haven assets such as the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and U.S. Treasuries. 
While MUFG strategists said Trump's diagnosis could strengthen his argument of opening up the U.S. economy if he recovers quickly, some like Saxo Bank say Biden's chances of a win had jumped, a negative for risky assets.
The news spread to betting markets. Betfair suspended betting on the outcome of the U.S. election on Friday, its website showed. Betfair had Biden's probability of winning at 60% on Wednesday after the first debate on Tuesday night.
Investors, who have driven a long rise in global equity markets, were already nervous given the uncertain prospects for more U.S. fiscal stimulus and a brief sell-off in high-flying U.S. technology shares last month. 
""Whether it's Trump or Biden, the biggest problem is uncertainty. As long as we're uncertain about who will win the election, it is difficult for markets to truly settle,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank in Tokyo.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>","Headwinds for Google as rivals, customers criticise Fitbit concessions","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Google's bid to win EU approval for its $2.1 billion purchase of Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) faces headwinds as rivals and customers argue concessions to EU antitrust regulators do not go far enough, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google last week offered to restrict the use of Fitbit data for Google ads and to monitor the process closely.
It also offered to make it easier for rival makers of wearables to connect to the Android platform by offering them access to Android software (API), and said third parties would continue to have access to Fitbit users' data with their consent.
The European Commission is now seeking feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer or demand more. Other sources have said the new concessions are likely to help Google secure EU clearance.
Some rivals and customers, however, plan to tell the EU competition enforcer to ask for more, the people said.
""The definition of wearable API is too narrow,"" said one of the people, who said Google should broaden the scope to take into account new functionalities that come into the market in future.
Google's 10-year data pledge also drew fire from its critics in advertising.
""Why would you limit the data separation remedy to 10 years? Bad idea. Google is making long bets. Ten years is tomorrow,"" the second person said.

Respondents have until next week to provide feedback. The Commission is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 23, although a ruling could come earlier.

The company raised $203.1 million in its IPO by selling 15.6 million shares.
Shares of giant KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) backed retailer opened at $12.10, compared with the IPO price of $13 apiece, valuing the company at $1.07 billion. 
Academy Sports had initially aimed to sell its shares at between $15 and $17 apiece.
The retailer's disappointing debut comes on a day when Wall Street's main indexes were trading lower as news that President Donald Trump had contracted COVID-19 stirred up political uncertainty just weeks before the election.
It also bucks the recent trend of strong appetite from investors for new listings, with 2020 on track to be the best year for IPOs since the Dotcom boom of 1999 and 2000. In a regulatory filing earlier, the company said its revenue for the first half of fiscal year 2020 was $2.74 billion, up about 19% from a year earlier. Net income in the same period more than doubled to $157.7 million. Last year, federal prosecutors said the retailer violated the law by selling an assault-style rifle and magazines to Devin Patrick Kelley, who walked into a Texas church in 2017 and opened fire on worshippers, killing 26 people and wounding 40 others.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), JP Morgan, KKR and BofA Securities were the lead underwriters for the IPO.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) is set to be hit with a charge sheet in the coming weeks setting out the European Union's antitrust concerns over its $27 billion purchase of data provider Refinitiv, two people familiar with the matter said.
LSE announced the proposed Refinitiv deal last year to broaden its trading business and make it a major distributor and creator of market data in a profitable and fast growing sector. It would also make it a rival to Bloomberg.
The European Commission has voiced concerns about the combined company's large market share in the trading of European government bonds because both LSE's MTS trading business and Refinitiv's Tradeweb are already market leaders. 
The EU competition enforcer will send a statement of objections to the companies by mid October, the people said.
In some cases, companies prefer to wait for such a document so they can tailor concessions to the concerns and avoid giving up too much.
The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 16, declined to comment.
Last month, LSE picked  Euronext  (PA:ENX) as the preferred bidder for its Borsa Italiana business, a sale aimed at addressing competition issues. Borsa Italiana, which LSE acquired in 2007, owns bond trading platform MTS.
Bloomberg was the first to report about the imminent EU charge sheet.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's billionaire Issa brothers and private equity group TDR Capital have bought Asda from Walmart in a deal which gives the British supermarket chain an enterprise value of $8.8 billion and the buyers a platform to roll out smaller stores.
Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who founded petrol station operator EG Group nearly two decades ago, are taking Asda back under British ownership for the first time since 1999, when U.S. retail giant Walmart (L:WMT) paid 6.7 billion pounds for it.
""The Issa brothers have a reputation for good brand partnerships, for convenience and for growth and that’s really what we were interested in for Asda,"" Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International told Reuters on Friday.
McKenna said the deal was not about job cuts and the new owners said they are targeting growth by expanding into convenience shops from its large supermarket and online operations, bringing Asda more in line with market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO) and No. 2  Sainsbury 's (L:SBRY).
The Issas said they wanted to utilise their experience to help ""build a differentiated business"" at Britain's third-biggest supermarket chain, in which Walmart will retain an unspecified minority stake, as well as a commercial relationship and a board seat.
British retail veteran Roger Burnley will remain as CEO of Asda in a deal which ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said allows Walmart to continue to refocus its international efforts on markets with more long-term upside, such as India and China.
McKenna would not say for how long Walmart has committed to remain an investor or comment on the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO).
""The brothers and TDR will help make decisions about what that future path looks like,"" she said.
CONVENIENCE SHIFT 
The new owners said they will invest more than 1 billion pounds over three years to keep prices low, develop supply chains and in e-commerce, in addition to convenience stores.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak welcomed the deal, which will see Asda retain its headquarters in the northern English city of Leeds.
Last year Walmart's attempt to sell Asda to Sainsbury's for 7.3 billion pounds was thwarted by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority and McKenna said she expected the regulator to also consider the new deal.
Britain's highly competitive supermarket sector has been upended by the COVID-19 crisis, which sparked a jump in sales - and costs - as shoppers stocked up on goods during lockdowns. 
While Asda's sales rose, it still lagged the growth of its biggest rivals, partly due to a lack of convenience stores that have thrived as Britons shop closer to home.
All of the big four chains also face fierce competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl and there are fears recession triggered by the crisis will spark a margin damaging price war.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an appeal by energy companies including BP (NYSE:BP) PLC,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC contesting a lawsuit by the city of Baltimore seeking damages for the impact of global climate change.
The justices will weigh whether the lawsuit must be heard in state court as the city would prefer or in federal court, which corporate defendants generally view as a more favorable venue. The suit targets 21 U.S. and foreign energy companies that extract, produce, distribute or sell fossil fuels.
The outcome could affect around a dozen similar lawsuits by U.S. states, cities and counties including Rhode Island and New York City seeking to hold such companies liable for the impact of climate change.
Baltimore and the other jurisdictions are seeking damages under state law for the harms they said they have sustained due to climate change, which they attribute in part to the companies' role in producing fossil fuels that produce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
The plaintiffs have said they have had to spend more on infrastructure such as flood control measures to combat sea-level rise caused by a warming climate. Climate change has been melting land-based ice sheets and glaciers.
The Supreme Court in 2019 declined the companies' emergency request to put the Baltimore litigation on hold after a federal judge ruled that the case should be heard in state court. In March, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's decision.
In the absence of federal legislation in the bitterly divided U.S. Congress targeting climate change, the lawsuits are the latest effort to force action via litigation. 
The Supreme Court in a landmark 2007 ruling said that carbon dioxide is a pollutant that could be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Under Democratic President Barack Obama, the agency issued the first-ever regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gases. But efforts in Congress to enact sweeping climate change legislation have failed.

The court took action in the case three days before it begins its new nine-month term short one justice after the Sept. 18 death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Donald Trump has nominated federal appeals court judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace Ginsburg.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) on Friday said it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, a quarterly record for the electric carmaker, but shares fell 5.7% in pre-market trading.
The company slightly beat consensus estimates by Refinitiv for deliveries of 134,720 vehicles, but fell short of some of Wall Street's most bullish forecasts, with analysts issuing a wide range of estimates.
While the broader market was down on Friday morning, Tesla shares were among the heaviest decliners.
Tesla delivered 124,100 Model Y and Model 3 units, slightly below Refinitiv consensus expectations of 128,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles combined. Some analysts had expected weaker U.S. demand for the mass-market Model 3 due to the release of the Model Y.
Including the third quarter, Tesla has delivered some 318,000 vehicles this year, putting the company under pressure to increase deliveries once more to nearly 182,000 in the fourth quarter to reach its ambitious year-end target of half a million deliveries. 
(Graphic of Tesla quarterly deliveries: https://graphics.reuters.com/TESLA-DELIVERIES/yzdvxqwmapx/index.html)
Tesla's total production in the quarter rose 76% to 145,036 vehicles compared with the previous three-month period.
The company last quarter said production at its California plant has ramped up to pre-pandemic levels after production at its core vehicle plant suspended from the end of March to early May due to the COVID-19 lockdown orders.
Tesla's delivery push has been supported by its new Shanghai factory, the only plant currently producing vehicles outside California. Tesla began delivering Model 3s from its Shanghai factory in December and has said it aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans in the factory per year and later 250,000 vehicles a year, including the Model Y.
Some 23,300 Tesla vehicles were registered in China in the months of August and July, with data from September still to come.

Tesla is also building a new vehicle and battery manufacturing facility near Germany's Berlin and seeks to start construction on a vehicle factory in Austin, Texas in the third quarter.

LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street was set for a heavy tumble on Friday as news that U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife had tested positive for coronavirus just four weeks before U.S. elections sent investors into safer gold, Treasuries and the yen.
Europe's main bourses were down 0.5%, having clawed back some of their starker morning falls (STOXX), but the futures markets were pointing to 1.5% to 2% losses for Wall Street's S&P 500  and Nasdaq (NQc1). 
Trump said on Twitter he and his wife had been tested positive for coronavirus: ""We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,"" he said in a late night tweet, adding one of his chief aides had contracted the virus too.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was down 0.2% but still on course for a 2% rise for the week which will be its best in over a month (MIWD00000PUS).
Markets will have other news to digest with monthly U.S. jobs data due at 1230 GMT, but Trump's exposure could cause a new wave of market volatility if it looks like disrupting in any way the presidential election, which is just 33 days away.
How long the risk-averse moves will last depends on the extent of the infection within the White House, said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
""We may have to wait until the end of the weekend for more clarity on the situation,"" he said. 
""It will weigh on the market today and early next week but will not induce a long-lasting correction if the infection is contained to Trump,"" he added.
The United States has never delayed a presidential election, not even during the Civil War or Great Depression, and only moved it for administrative reasons twice - both within the first 60 years of the country’s founding.
When it comes to stock market shocks, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963, saw the S&P 500 plunge nearly 3% and Wall Street shut down the New York Stock Exchange at 2:07 p.m. EST. But the losses were confined to a single day and the market recovered within two days. 
The news from the White House also triggered a rise in the dollar as well the safe-haven Japanese yen which saw its biggest jump in more than a month, reaching 104.95 at 0553 GMT .
Against a basked of currencies, the dollar index was up 0.1% on the day at 93.807 at 1051 GMT.
The Australian dollar, which serves as a liquid proxy for risk assets, was down 0.5% , though regional tensions meant it was Russia's rouble that took the biggest hit, dropping 1.5%.
Germany's benchmark 10-year bond was down around 2 basis points at -0.543% (DE10YT=RR). 
Oil fell, with Brent crude (LCOc1) down 4% at $39.29 a barrel at 1053 GMT, extending losses as the European session wore on.
Gold rose, up 0.2% at $1,908.63 per ounce, having hit a 10-day high earlier in the session .
BETS ARE OFF
""Depending on how this situation evolves over the weekend, notably if more members of the U.S. government's senior leadership are diagnosed positive, gold could be set for an extended rally,"" said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA.
With the situation ahead of the election now thrown into confusion, online gambling site Betfair suspended betting on the outcome of the Nov. 3 vote.
Even before news of Trump's infection, markets had been more bearish after Washington failed to reach an agreement on a fiscal stimulus package to help the U.S. economy recover from the impact of coronavirus.

The last round of monthly U.S. unemployment data before the elections is expected to show that 850,000 new jobs were added in September, down from 1,371,000 the month before. Analysts say this has been relegated to secondary importance in terms of market-moving news.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",European junk bond market stutters after prolonged rally,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - A resurgence in the European high-yield bond market has stalled as a pickup in COVID-19 cases and an upcoming U.S. election crimp demand for risk assets, making it harder for the continent's junk-rated companies to raise cash. 
Europe's junk bond market had rallied since March as unprecedented European Central Bank stimulus flattened rates and boosted demand for assets offering any form of yield. 
But with several countries responding with tighter coronavirus restrictions to rising case numbers, demand for riskier debt has fallen. 
Markit's iTraxx European crossover index of credit default swaps, which measures the cost of insuring exposure to a basket of junk-rated European companies, has risen 55 basis points in the last two weeks alone to 345 bps. 
(Graphic: Junk bond recovery halts - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprmdywve/crossover%20index%20oct%202.png)
""The market came to realise we had quite a few events and potential triggers for heightened volatility such as the U.S. election, a second COVID-19 wave and Brexit, so you saw a shakedown in high-yield markets,"" said Andrey Kuznetsov, senior credit portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), a $629 billion asset manager. 
""And we are not out of the woods yet,"" he added. 
The shakeout in high-yield debt comes just as Europe's sub-investment grade offerings were starting to return to pre-pandemic levels, with 22.63 billion euros ($26.54 billion) of issuance in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data. 
Overall, in a COVID-affected year, European high-yield debt issuance is down 29% to 66.14 billion euros ($77.52 billion) in the first nine months of 2020 compared with same period of 2019. It is also the lowest nine-month figure since 2012. 
(Graphic: European junk bond issuance - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqngrjpx/junk%20bond%20issuance%20oct%202.PNG)
SHAKEN, NOT STIRRED
That said, the fact that the market has remained open and issuers have continued to trickle through has encouraged some bankers. This week alone, Spanish supermarket chain El Cortes Ingles and Dutch chemicals firm OCI (AS:OCI) hit the market, Refinitiv's IFR news service reported. 
Most notably, Italy's Engineering Group revisited markets this week, backing its buyout by Bain Capital and Neuberger Berman with a rejigged offering three months after pulling its first attempt.
""Right now there's some headwinds but these are typically weak patches in a recovering backdrop,"" said Justin Jewell, a portfolio manager at Bluebay Asset Management.
Much will depend on the economic recovery, bankers and investors say, with Citi's economic surprises index showing that European growth is starting to disappoint. 
As long as that continues, high-yield markets will continue to be tricky to navigate, said Federated Hermes' Kuznetsov.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply lower on Friday, as the news that President Donald Trump has tested positive for the coronavirus threatened to upend the looming presidential election, but pared losses as House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi again talked up the prospects of agreeing a new stimulus package.
The need for such a package had meanwhile been illustrated again by a weaker-than-expected employment report. Pelosi was quoted by newswires as saying that Trump's diagnosis ""changes the dynamics"" of the discourse over fresh stimulus, and insisted that the two sides would find ""the middle ground"".
By 9:55 AM ET (1355 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 196 points, or 0.7%, at 27,620 points. It had earlier lost as much as 400 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2%, also paring losses.
Trump's doctor said that he is ""well"" and continuing to discharge his duties from the White House, where he is now quarantining. The White House said later Friday morning that he is experiencing 'mild symptoms'.
Vice President Mike Pence had tested negative for the virus, as have the President's daughter Ivanka and her husband, senior White House adviser Jared Kushner. Speaker Pelosi meanwhile said that she had not been contacted by the White House about guaranteeing the continuity of government, something that suggests there is no great risk of both Trump and Pence being incapacitated at the same time.
Before the opening, the Bureau of Labor Statistics had reported that the U.S, economy had added only 661,000  jobs in the month through mid-September, compared to a consensus forecast of 850,000. The shortfall was fully accounted for by a drop in government employment. The figures nonetheless added to concerns that the economy, which rebounded strongly through the summer, is now running out of momentum as government stimulus programs expire and seasonal factors enable the virus to again spread more easily.
Among individual stocks, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 3.4%, despite beating expectations for deliveries in the third quarter. The beat was down overwhelmingly to its Model 3, which generates the lowest profit margin of all its models.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 1.2% after giving a gloomy preview of its third-quarter earnings. The stock is approaching what would be an 18-year low.

The U.S. auto sector has climbed back quicker than other industries, but automakers had a hand in that with aggressive incentives like zero-for-84 months financing, payment deferrals and job assurance programs.
Ford posted a 5% fall in U.S. auto sales for the third quarter but said a continuing recovery from pandemic-induced lockdowns helped it record better sales compared with the second quarter.
The No.2 U.S. automaker, which announces its quarterly sales volumes a day later than the rest of the industry, said it sold 551,796 vehicles in the country in the quarter, down from 580,251 a year earlier.
Its sales were, however, up 27.2% when compared with the preceding quarter.
""The seasonally adjusted sales pace for September demonstrated yet another sequential improvement for the industry, and a return to near pre-virus levels ... a print 16.4mn is not far off the 17mn level we saw from 2015-19,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Dan Levy said.
""It remains to be seen if this level of sales can be sustained near-term.""
Bigger rival General Motors Co (N:GM) reported a 10% decline in sales on Thursday and said the auto sales have been even more resilient and made a substantial rebound in the third quarter.
While overall industry sales in the quarter were down, the trend was positive as demand increased each month, especially among retail consumers for high-profit SUVs and pickup trucks.

Sales for its F-Series pickup-truck rose 3.5% in the quarter when compared with a year ago, marking its best pickup sales since 2005, Ford said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and  BP  (L:BP) have lost over half of their market value so far this year, with both shares hitting 25-year lows this week, battered by weak oil prices and investor concerns over their plans to shift to low-carbon energy.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), the largest U.S. oil company, which is set to report its third straight quarterly loss at the end of this month, has seen its shares dive 52% since the start of the year.
Oil companies are squeezed by a steep drop in oil prices due to the COVID-19 pandemic combined with growing investor pressure to align their businesses with the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming.
Responding to the pressure, Europe's top companies outlined strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades, with BP and Italy's Eni (MI:ENI) planning to rapidly cut oil output by 2030.
BP CEO Bernard Looney, reacting in a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) post to the drop in BP shares this week, said that there is ""a very significant need to change bp.""
""I think – if anything – the share price performance of the sector is a robust case for change in itself,"" Looney wrote.

The move came a year after the company had suspended the legal process to allow more time for talks with Thailand's energy ministry, ahead of the expiration of its concession in April 2022. 
Thailand wanted Chevron to pay the full decommissioning costs, estimated at around $2 billion, for all infrastructure it had installed at the Erawan gas field, including assets it will hand over to the next operator, Thai state oil firm PTT Exploration (OTC:PEXNY) and Production Pcl. 

Chevron argues that under the terms of its initial contracts from 1971 it is only liable for infrastructure that is no longer deemed usable before it hands over the field to another operator.

Gage, which currently focuses solely on the Michigan market, is expecting sales of around $13.2 million in the third quarter, up 11% from the previous three months.
""We have seen tremendous growth in the Michigan market in 2020 and Gage has been diligent in capturing that growth through its operating assets,"" said Fabian Monaco, president of Gage Cannabis.
Weed companies in the United States have reaped the benefits of cannabis businesses being allowed to stay open as essential services during the COVID-19 restrictions. 
The company outlined plans to open eight to ten new stores by the end of this year and will consider expanding to markets beyond Michigan next year, according to a presentation to investors reviewed by Reuters. 
Gage has already filed an offering circular with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating it could launch a ""regulation A+"" offering in the country before the Canada debut.
A regulation A+ offering, also called a mini-IPO, allows companies to raise capital without actually listing the shares on a stock exchange.
Companies whose businesses involve marijuana cultivation are not yet allowed to list in the United States as the plant remains illegal at the federal level.
Gage-branded products are also sold in Canada by Radicle Cannabis, which is backed by Canopy Rivers (OTC:CNPOF). 

Canopy Growth holds a 27% stake in Canopy Rivers.

The bank said the news overnight that Trump had tested positive for coronavirus could ""bring forward"" pre-election market caution.
It said was trimming exposure to emerging Asia and had in local markets added to ""low yielders"" while cutting back on holdings of higher yielding debt, such as Indonesia government bonds. 
JPMorgan said it had started trimming emerging market FX positions as well and laid out a number of big swings for China's yuan depending on the result of the U.S. election. 
""The Trump victory scenario is the one that worries EM investors, given the President’s history of unilateral tariff action and crowded positions,"" a group of JPMorgan's emerging markets strategists wrote in a note to clients.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Friday after President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19, greatly increasing the political uncertainty as the presidential election draws near.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 42 points, or 1.3%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 330 points, or 1.2%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures slumped 212 points, or 1.8%.
Earlier Friday, President Trump confirmed, via a tweet, that he and the First Lady had tested positive for the virus, just hours after it was confirmed that trusted advisor Hope Hicks had also been infected.
White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said in a letter that the president and first lady were “both well at this time,” and he expected Trump “to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering.”
However, this development comes just a month before the presidential election and clearly raises questions about the political process, particularly as others at the highest levels of government could also have been exposed.
""What is getting me worried more than anything else is the question mark over the legitimacy of the election process,"" said David Arnaud, a fixed income fund manager at Canada Life Asset Management, in a Reuters report.
The market had already been unsettled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin being unable to reach agreement on a new stimulus deal on Thursday, having previously raised hopes that it would be done.
The focus as far as the data slate is concerned will be on the widely watched nonfarm payrolls number, which is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). It’s forecast to come in at 850,000 for September, compared with 1.3 million for August. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 8.2% for September, from 8.4% in August.
Additionally, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is forecast at 79 for September, versus 78.9 the previous month.
In corporate news, airlines, hotel owners and cruise operators are being hard hit in premarket trade as sentiment surrounding these companies, which have been severely impacted by the virus, deteriorates.
Oil prices weakened Friday, continuing the selloff from the previous session and hitting three-week lows on concerns over demand amid a resurgence in Covid-19 cases, with the President's infection amplifying the concern.
U.S. crude futures traded 4.3% lower at $37.06 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 4.1% to $39.25. Both contracts fell more than 3% Thursday, and are on course for a second consecutive week of declines.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,913.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1704.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>","With the Feds circling, Google is starting to play nice with smaller rivals","By Paresh Dave and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Small rivals of Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google say signs are emerging of more benevolent behavior from the online advertising leader amid accusations by the U.S. government and states that the company uses its dominance to thwart competition.
Among the dozens of software companies who rely on Google as an intermediary to ad buyers and sellers, six told Reuters that the company has become more collaborative on data privacy and other changes with them and industry groups, helping these entities instead of ignoring requests as they have done in the past. 
John Nardone, chief executive of Flashtalking - which works with advertisers to personalize messages - said Google recently agreed to open a pipeline to crucial data.
It was an undertaking ""that previously I might not have imagined they'd be open to,"" said Nardone, who publicly criticized Google's rigidity last year. 
Two other companies also said Google this year enabled them to use its services in ways previously restricted, one involving using outside algorithms to analyze Google data and the other gaining sales opportunities Google had reserved for itself.
An executive at another ad software company said Google in the last year had not tried to poach any customers by offering discounted or early access to other products, tactics it had long aggressively pursued to lure lucrative accounts. Google also stopped using top executives to lure customers, the source added.
""The fangs are down right now,"" the person said.
The softening stances come during year-long antitrust investigations by the U.S. Justice Department and states' attorney generals led by Texas. Federal prosecutors are expected to sue Google as soon as next week on search and search advertising while their probe continues into ad software. 
The search lawsuit will likely kick off years of court hearings over whether Google uses its outsized market power unfairly.
Despite the increased responsiveness, sources said Google's small rivals continue to answer questions from investigators about the market shares of Google's ad tools and the practices it uses to promote their adoption. Those rivals eagerly await a possible resolution, including the break up of Google's ads business in an attempt to weaken its control.
""They are both the dominant market operator while also a participant,"" one executive said. ""It's hard to be a referee and player.""
Google rejected the assertion that its approach to competitors has changed due to the investigations, saying it always has sought to collaborate. Texas' attorney general and the Justice Department declined to comment.
The antitrust scrutiny across Big Tech has prompted several concessions this year to smaller companies' longstanding gripes. For instance, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) started allowing browsers beside Safari as the default on iPhones, and Google on Monday vowed to better support alternatives to its Play app store on phones using its Android system. 
To be sure, other complaints about market power have not been addressed, and Google and other online powerhouses continue to defend their dominance as beneficial to customers and consumers.
The state and federal investigations into Google followed complaints from advertising software companies and internet publishers that Google had cut them from prized data or selling opportunities. Google has said many of its actions have been needed to better safeguard users' information amid global scrutiny on online privacy.
Google is still pursuing additional protections, including preventing tracking of its Chrome browser users, that rivals fear will hurt their ability to personalize ads. 
But rather than pursuing a ""my way or the highway"" change, Google this time around has publicly consulted rivals and demonstrated through its comments that its proposals for changing Chrome are amendable, two ad software executives said. 
""That's quite reassuring,"" said Colm Dolan, CEO of publisher software maker Publift and a former Google salesperson.

Chetna Bindra, senior product manager at Google, said the company was ""encouraged by the industry participation in the process and the positive feedback on a number of proposals.""

MADRID (Reuters) - Shares of Spanish engineering and infrastructure group ACS (MC:ACS) surged 16% on Friday after French rival  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) made a non-binding offer to buy ACS's industrial unit Cobra for 5.2 billion euros ($6.10 billion).
ACS's board will proceed with negotiations, the Madrid-based company said in a filing to the stock market regulator.
Vinci has offered to pay at least 2.8 billion euros ($3.28 billion) in cash and the rest in Vinci shares, the filing said. Vinci shares were up 2% after the news.
""Our view is that this process will create value and be good for (ACS) shareholders,"" analysts at Alantra Equities said in a note, acknowledging that Vinci's offer valued Cobra 50% higher than Alantra's own estimates, making ACS a strong ""buy"".
Cobra - whose business covers engineering and public works activities, renewable energy projects and concession contracts - booked sales worth 6.3 billion euros in 2019.
The Alantra analysts said its divestment would leave ACS with a less diversified business.
Angel Perez Llamazares, an analyst at Spain's Renta4Banco, said Cobra would be a good long-term asset for ACS to keep given its high revenues and strong portfolio of green energy contracts, although a sale would also have advantages.
ACS reported a sharp fall in first-half profit in August and has booked losses at its Australian subsidiary CIMIC.
""In theory we consider the cash inflow (from a Cobra sale) positive, helping to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on (ACS) group's balance sheet and the problems registered in certain subsidiaries,"" Llamazares said.

Tech-focused ETFs have been the backbone of the Nasdaq's rally this year with investors pouring in a record $16.7 billion this summer buying into high-flying U.S. mega cap tech firms.
But with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NDX) down more than 6% from an early September peak after a record 84% rally off March lows, investors are worrying the reversal could gather steam with only a month left for U.S. elections.
In the week ending Sept. 30, tech-focused ETFs saw $463 million worth of inflows but a four-week moving average saw $165 million of outflows, the biggest since October 2019, according to Refintiv Lipper data.
Making up around a third of the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX), U.S. tech stocks have been the ultimate pandemic beneficiaries, especially so-called FANGMAN - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Valuations are hovering near 27 times forward earnings for the S&P 500 index, the highest since the dotcom bubble in early 2000. Multiples of some tech stocks are as high as 100 times forward earnings.

405,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 05:24AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Trump Has Covid-19; What Happens Next?,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- So what happens next?
Investors have reacted badly to the news of President Donald Trump's positive test for Covid-19 with a knee-jerk sell-off across asset classes. So far, it looks like a textbook case of markets adding a blanket uncertainty premium to more or less everything. But exactly what risks need to be priced in? 
For now, at least, there is no disruption to the functioning of the U.S. government, which removes the biggest and most important element of political risk. White House Doctor Sean Conley said in a published memo that Trump and the First Lady were both ""well"" after their test, adding that ""I expect the President to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering.""
If Trump's condition were to worsen, the normal course of action, under the 25th Amendment of the U.S. constitution, would be for him to hand over executive authority to Vice President Mike Pence, and to take back the reins when he returns to health. Both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush (twice) have done this in recent history. The White House said overnight that Pence had been tested but has not so far announced the results of his test. Both U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro have, of course, already gone down a similar path this year. 
Given the advances since the spring in containing Covid symptoms, notably through the use of the generic steroid dexamethasone, and given the assurance of top-class medical attention, it seems unlikely that both Trump and Pence could be incapacitated, although Trump's age and weight do profile him as a high-risk case. If both were to be incapacitated, then executive authority would pass to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which would represent a very clear step up in political risk, given the radical shift in power relationships this would entail, so close to the November elections. 
The implications of Trump's illness for the outcome of the elections themselves are far less clear. His campaign schedule for the next week is clearly gone, given the need to isolate for at least a week. The next presidential debate is due in only 13 days, so either Trump Zooms in from the White House or Pence goes to Miami to take on Joe Biden. What happens after that depends entirely on the speed of his recovery.
Opinion polls have suggested so far that Trump is on course for defeat in November. Unless he can make a convincing return to the public stage more or less immediately after quarantine, the question marks that will hang over his health situation can only hurt his chances further. The question is then whether poor health either forces Trump to withdraw, or whether it could serve as a pretext for him to withdraw and return to a highly profitable life of sniping from the political sidelines without having to suffer the stigma of defeat (albeit while losing his current immunity from prosecution).
The Republican Party has already made its nomination and has no formal machinery for withdrawing it on health or any other grounds. Nor is there any historical precedent for having to name a replacement candidate.  
As such, it's for Trump to choose whether or not to withdraw. Given the closeness of the election, Pence would surely be the likeliest to assume the mantle of nominee if he did. Pence may not be able to command the same broad coalition of voters as Trump, but by the same token, he doesn't energize the resistance to Trump to anything like the same degree either. Irrespective of how the presidential election goes, it isn't impossible that Trump's absence from the ballot could tip some closely-contested Senate seats next month, allowing the GOP to keep control of the upper chamber.  
So many questions, so few clear answers. All that can be said with certainty is that, given the extraordinary pressure of the political deadlines, the answers won't be long in coming.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Malaysia Airlines parent firm says group very low on cash - letter,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysia Aviation Group, the holding company for Malaysia Airlines Bhd, said in a letter to lessors the group is unlikely to be able to make payments owed after November unless it receives more funding from state fund Khazanah.
The letter, reviewed by Reuters, follows a request by the troubled carrier for steep discounts on aircraft rentals from its lessors as part of a broad restructuring plan, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Malaysia Airlines later confirmed in a statement on Friday it had reached out to its lessors, creditors and key suppliers recently as it embarks on an urgent restructuring exercise.
According to the letter, the aviation group was experiencing ""an average monthly operating cash burn of $84 million"" but only had $88 million in liquidity as of Aug. 31 and an additional $139 million available from Khazanah, its sole shareholder.
""Based on the current run-rate, absent further funding from shareholders, the group will likely be unable to meet its obligations, including payments to lessors, post November 2020,"" it said.
The letter was sent to lessors last month but the exact date was not immediately clear.
Khazanah, the country's sovereign wealth fund, said it was supportive of the airline's restructuring efforts but if they prove unsuccessful, it will need to evaluate options on how to maintain connectivity for Malaysia.
Malaysia's national airline has struggled to recover from two tragedies in 2014 - the mysterious disappearance of flight MH370 and the shooting down of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine.
Khazanah took it private that year as part of a $1.5 billion restructuring but efforts to turnaround its business have been further upended by the coronavirus pandemic.
Malaysia Airlines said its current plan was ""highly dependent on the individual contributions of all relevant stakeholders in supporting the group.""
""It is intended that this restructuring exercise be completed over the next few months. However, if such an outcome is not possible, the group will have no choice but to take more drastic measures,"" it said.
Sources said Malaysia Airlines plans to negotiate the steep discounts with its lessors via a restructuring plan it is seeking to implement through a UK court process.
The sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

In addition to Malaysia Airlines, the holding company group includes other local carriers and entities involved in aircraft leasing and ground handling services.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Friday, with the news that U.S. President Donald Trump has tested positive for the coronavirus weighing heavily on sentiment by greatly increasing the uncertainty around the November elections.
At 3:30 AM ET (0730 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.8% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.7%.
Earlier Friday, President Trump confirmed, via a tweet, that he and his wife Melania had contracted the Covid-19 virus, just a few hours after a top aide he had spent substantial time with this week had also tested positive. However, he continues to work as normal from the White House.  
“The question is how sick he gets and to what extent this is going to affect his presidential campaign,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
“Another question is whether other members of the U.S. government are infected. The uncertainty has affected risk appetite and thus equities.”
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a $2.2 trillion Democrat-only fiscal stimulus package late Thursday. However, this bill, however, is extremely unlikely to pass through the Republican-dominated Senate, as sharp differences over the size and makeup of the package still exist.
Back in Europe, Equinor ASA (OL:EQNR) stock fell 0.5% after the Norwegian oil and gas firm outlined plans to cut its exploration staff by about 30% globally by 2023 to reduce costs as the pandemic hits the industry hard. Shares in many of the oil majors have slumped, with  BP  (LON:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Repsol (OTC:REPYY) all hitting 52-week lows in early trading. By contrast, renewables specialist Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) and wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa  (MC:SGREN) hit new all-time highs.
Elsewhere, Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) slumped 6.8% after the aero engine maker's 5 billion pound recapitalization plan, which revolves around a deeply discounted rights issue, struggled to gain acceptance.
Consumer inflation data for the euro zone headlines lead the European data slate Friday, but most attention will be on the official U.S. jobs report for a gauge on how the world’s largest economy is recovering.
“Jobless claims edged lower again, but remain incredibly elevated as labour market strains continue. Incomes have also been dropping back and spending growth is starting to slow as we see more evidence of a leveling off in the recovery,” wrote analysts at ING, in a research note.
Oil prices weakened Friday, continuing the selloff from the previous session, as concerns over what a resurgence in Covid-19 cases will do to the demand for crude, with the President's infection amplifying this concern, just as production starts to rise.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.4% lower at $37.80 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.7% to $39.83. Both contracts fell more than 3% Thursday, and are on course for a second consecutive week of declines.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed out a volatile session capped by news of U.S. President Donald Trump testing positive for the new coronavirus on Friday, a day after its worst-ever outage paralysed the world's third-largest equity market.
The market had opened on a positive note, with traders expressing relief that the shutdown was hardware-related rather than a cyber attack. But news of Trump's test reversed the market's course, sending traders scrambling to react.
""I feel like my head is about to explode,"" said Takeo Kamai, head of execution services at CLSA Japan. ""When I heard the news (about Trump), I thought, 'Give me a break,' as I executed my trades.""
He said the Tokyo Stock Exchange was fortunate that trading had resumed on a day like this. 
""There's no doubt there would have been complaints from left, right and centre if (the outage) had happened today,"" he said.
Trade volume reached 2.86 trillion yen ($27.21 billion) on Friday, about 20% above the average daily turnover.
TSE SYSTEM OVERHAULED IN 2019
Thursday's outage was the result of a hardware problem at the bourse's ""Arrowhead"" trading system, and subsequent failure to switch to a back-up. It caused the first full-day suspension since the exchange moved to all-electronic trading in 1999.
It had come on a day of high anticipated trade volume following the release of the Bank of Japan's closely watched tankan corporate survey and a rise on Wall Street.
The meltdown also occurred just two weeks into new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's term - for which he has prioritised digitalisation - and dented Tokyo's hopes of replacing Hong Kong as an Asian financial hub.
""It's problematic that this happened after the TSE upgraded its system as recently as 2019,"" said Takatoshi Itoshima, strategist at Pictet Asset Management. ""IoT (Internet of Things) related shares are meant to be the leader of 'Suganomics' trade but this won't impress foreign investors.""
Officials from the Tokyo Stock Exchange and  Japan Exchange Group  Inc (T:8697), which runs the bourse, as well as system developer Fujitsu Ltd (T:6702), apologised for the debacle on Thursday. 
Arrowhead, developed by Fujitsu, debuted in 2010, bringing processing times for trades to 5 milliseconds - on a par with the New York and London stock exchanges at the time. The system got an overhaul last November, and currently processes orders in about 0.2 milliseconds.
TSE said a disc device failure had caused abnormalities in the distribution of market information and monitoring functions, although the fundamental cause of the problem was still unknown.
It declined to comment on possible compensation issues, while industry sources said brokerages' contracts with the bourse generally shield the exchange from compensation claims associated with trade suspensions, and that no such claims were made after previous shutdowns.
Shares in Fujitsu fell 2.75%, while Japan Exchange Group lost 1.94%, underperforming the main TOPIX index (TOPX), which fell 1.0%.
""TRULY REGRETTABLE""
Japanese government officials expressed dismay, saying financial regulators would order an incident report from the TSE.
""It is truly regrettable that the opportunity of stock trading - an important economic activity - was lost,"" Digital Transformation Minister Takuya Hirai told a news conference.
""Whether it's caused by hardware failure, cyber attack, or natural disaster, there obviously needs to be a risk analysis for all occurrences and a proper BCP (business continuity plan) put in place (as Japan proceeds with digitalisation).""
Fujitsu said any findings from its investigation into the failure would be disclosed through the exchange. It declined to comment on any compensation issues, while TSE Chief Executive Officer Koichiro Miyahara said the bourse had no plans for now for any compensation claims, taking ""full responsibility"" for the shutdown.

Equinor said it wanted to focus on selected areas when searching for new oil and gas resources, including Norway, Brazil and the United States, as its exploration spending had fallen by about a third from 6-7 years ago.

Equinor, which had 21,000 employees at the end of 2019, said it would offer severance packages in some locations, while in Norway the reduction would come as a result of moving people to other jobs or natural attrition.
The majority state-owned firm has previously said it planned significant job cuts in the United States, Canada and Britain to adjust to the fall in oil prices. 
Oil prices more than doubled from their April lows, but have come under pressure again as rising coronavirus cases around the world dampened outlook.
Norway's Lederne labour union has said it will escalate offshore industrial action to four additional Equinor fields next week, after dozens of workers went on strike at the company's Johan Sverdrup oilfield, western Europe's largest.

415,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 02:09AM ET</span>",Gold Erases Loss as Investors Weigh Impact of Trump’s Covid-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Gold erased a decline after President Donald Trump announced early Friday that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for Covid-19, roiling global assets and lifting the dollar.
Trump tweeted that he and the first lady would “begin our quarantine process,” shortly after one of his closest aides, Hope Hicks, had fallen ill with the coronavirus.
Bullion has rallied to a record this year as vast amounts of stimulus were pumped into economies to curb the damage from the coronavirus pandemic. While prices stumbled last month amid a stronger dollar, the precious metal is still supported by low interest rates, a resurgence in Covid cases in some parts of the world, and the heightened uncertainty heading into the U.S. elections.
Spot gold traded 0.1% lower at $1,904.84 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. in Singapore, after earlier losing as much as 0.8%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.3%. Silver for immediate delivery was level at $23.8261 an ounce, recovering from a 1.3% loss.
In a memo, Trump’s physician said that the president and first lady plan to remain at the White House “during their convalescence” and that the medical unit would “maintain a vigilant watch.”
Investors are also awaiting the monthly nonfarm payrolls data due later Friday. Bloomberg Economics analysts do not expect the September report -- the last national tally released before Americans head to the polls -- to be consequential enough to tilt the election outcome."

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening sharply lower Friday, with the news U.S. President Donald Trump has tested positive for the coronavirus weighing heavily on sentiment by greatly increasing the uncertainty around the November elections.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 1.3%.
Earlier Friday, President Trump confirmed, via a tweet, that he and his wife Melania had contracted the Covid-19 virus, just a few hours after a top aide he had spent substantial time with this week had also tested positive.








The U.S. House of Representatives passed a $2.2 trillion Democrat-only fiscal stimulus package late Thursday after the most concerted talks between the top negotiators since early August failed to yield a bipartisan agreement.
This bill, however, is extremely unlikely to pass through the Republican-dominated Senate, as sharp differences over the size and makeup of the package still exist, and time is running out before Congress adjourns.
Most growth forecasts for the fourth quarter had been predicated on the idea that there would be another fiscal package to support the economy’s recovery.
The data slate in Europe centers around the release of consumer inflation data for the euro zone, but most attention will be on the official U.S. jobs report for a gauge on how the world’s largest economy is recovering.
“Jobless claims edged lower again, but remain incredibly elevated as labour market strains continue. Incomes have also been dropping back and spending growth is starting to slow as we see more evidence of a leveling off in the recovery,” wrote analysts at ING, in a research note.
Oil prices weakened Friday, continuing the selloff from the previous session, as concerns over what a resurgence in Covid-19 cases will do to the demand for crude, with the President's infection amplifying this concern, just as production starts to rise.
U.S. crude futures traded 3.6% lower at $37.33 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.9% to $40.55. Both contracts fell more than 3% Thursday, and are on course for a second consecutive week of declines.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,912.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1725."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Google has postponed the Australian roll-out of News Showcase citing regulatory complications, just three months after announcing the product, as the U.S. internet giant grapples with one of the most audacious attempts to police its activities.
After naming Australia, Germany and Brazil as markets where it would start paying publishers to feature their news, the Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) unit dropped Australia from the product's launch this week because its antitrust body has since pushed for laws forcing Google to pay royalties for content industry-wide.
Google said it has therefore ""paused"" contracts with five local publishers whose news was due to feature on News Showcase, which presents content on swipeable cards it dubs story panels.
""As we work to understand the impacts of the news media bargaining code on partnerships and products, we have put this project on pause for now,"" Google's managing director for Australia and New Zealand, Mel Silva, told Reuters in an email.
""Although our concerns about the code are serious, we hope they can be resolved so we can bring News Showcase to Australia soon,"" Silva said.
The delay represents a snag in a strategy widely seen as an effort by the tech heavyweight to show it could work with media companies as governments worldwide, led by Australia, look to new laws to make the firm pay for content on its search engine.
Overnight, Google said it would pay $1 billion to publishers globally for their news over three years, an initiative some industry bodies have said gives it too much sway over terms of royalty payments without involving the law.
A month after Google announced content deals in Australia, Germany and Brazil, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it may bring in arbitrators to decide how much the U.S. company and social media giant  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) should pay for news that appears on their sites.
Facebook responded by saying it might pull all news items from its Australian web pages. Google has said the ACCC's stance has put its flagship search engine under threat.
""It's a pity that work on this project has been paused, but before we blame the regulator we shouldn't forget that the work done by the ACCC provided much of the impetus for Google to do deals with Australian publishers in the first place,"" said Misha Ketchell, editor and executive director of academic-focused publisher The Conversation, one of the firms with a Google deal.
""We are still optimistic. We've been talking to Google all the way through and they've been far more open-minded than their public campaign might suggest,"" Ketchell said.
ACCC Chairman Rod Sims, who plans to make a final policy recommendation about Big Tech content royalties this month, said he was aware of ""voluntary commercial arrangements offered by the large platforms"".
""We note that the timing of these offers appears to coincide with increased Government scrutiny both in Australia and overseas,"" Sims said in an email to Reuters.

""The (ACCC's) objective is commercial, not one-sided, outcomes.""

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Thursday said more than 19,000 of its U.S. frontline workers contracted the coronavirus this year, or 1.44% of the total, a disclosure sought by labor advocates who have criticized the COVID-19 response of the world's largest online retailer.
Some staff, elected officials and unions in recent months have said Amazon put employees' health at risk by keeping warehouses open during the pandemic. Amazon said its rate of infection was 42% lower than expected when considering the virus' spread in the general population.
Amazon in a blog post https://blog.aboutamazon.com/operations/update-on-covid-19-testing encouraged other businesses to report comparable figures. It said it will expand virus testing to 50,000 U.S. employees per day by November through internally built capacity.
The disclosure by Amazon offers a rare look at the disease's impact on a big U.S. employer. Amazon has kept facilities open to meet a surge in demand from shoppers stuck at home, adding temperature checks, social distancing software and other safety procedures.
Athena, a labor and activist coalition, called on officials to investigate Amazon and for more regular reporting by the company in light of the news. ""Amazon allowed COVID-19 to spread like wildfire,"" coalition director Dania Rajendra said in a statement.
Amazon said that out of its 1,372,000 frontline employees at Amazon and its Whole Foods Market subsidiary, 19,816 tested positive or were presumed to have COVID-19 between March 1 and Sept. 19. The figure includes seasonal staff and those who may have been infected outside work, it said.
By contrast, 33,952 would have contracted the virus had Amazon's rate equaled that of the general populace, when accounting for employees' age and geography, it said.
Minnesota had the highest rate with nearly 32 infections per 1,000 workers, versus nearly 16 for the public. Amazon has butted heads with a labor group there; it did not have comment on the specific rate.

""This information would be more powerful if there were similar data from other major employers to compare it to,"" Amazon said in the blog post, adding that it hopes the numbers ""will prove useful as states make decisions about reopening public facilities and employers consider whether and how to bring people back to work.""

419,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 07:30PM ET</span>",Secrecy and speed: Inside Ant Group’s unusual IPO process,"By Kane Wu, Julie Zhu and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ahead of what's likely to be the world's largest initial public offering, China's Ant Group Co Ltd is asking lead bankers to personally sign confidentiality pacts and pressing some investors to explain why they should be allowed to attend marketing meetings, sources familiar with the matter said. 
In doing so, Ant is following a highly unusual process that draws on some of the tactics its former parent and affiliate  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) previously used. 
Other unique measures taken by Ant include dividing up the underwriting work for what could be a $35 billion offering among several banks such that no one firm has the full picture of the process, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Three of the sources said the main underwriters are also discouraged from working on assignments for competitors.
While banks typically sign non-disclosure agreements when taking on underwriting assignments, companies rarely ask bankers to personally do so as well. The lead banks usually also run the entire process and competitive concerns are handled through Chinese walls that separate teams working on different deals. 
Ant's  measures, which have not been previously reported, are frustrating some bankers and investors, and sometimes sowing confusion in the market, three of the sources said. 
Taken together with what has been a fast pace of regulatory approvals for the IPO, they pose the risk that the offering will not get sufficient scrutiny, some lawyers and banking experts said. 
Ant and Alibaba declined to comment.
Philippe Espinasse, an Asian capital markets consultant and former banker, said there is merit in tightly controlling the process for such a large transaction. 
""This is not only to ensure that the banks focus on getting the deal done, and getting it done well, but also to create a sense of competition both among the underwriters and investors,"" Espinasse said.
A person close to Ant, whose status as the world's biggest unicorn and China's top fintech group has resulted in a rapid rise in valuation, said all the banks had the same information and access to data about the company.
FRAGMENTED PROCESS
In its $25 billion IPO in 2014, Alibaba divided up the work so that no single external adviser had the complete picture of its offering, Reuters reported at the time. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alibaba-ipo-banks/with-no-bank-in-charge-alibabas-bankers-learn-to-work-together-idUKKBN0H424K20140909 Then, during its secondary listing in Hong Kong last year, it also made advisers personally sign confidentiality agreements.
Ant is planning a dual-listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Three of the sources said bankers at firms with the lead underwriting roles had been asked to sign confidentiality pacts.
The Hong Kong leg of the IPO is being sponsored by China International Capital Corp (CICC) (HK:3908),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS). Ant's listing on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market is being led by CICC and China Securities Co (CSC) (HK:6066). CICC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. CSC did not respond to a request for comment. 
The fragmentation of the process has sometimes caused difficulties. 
Some banks on the deal, for example, did not know that the IPO's Hong Kong leg would not have any cornerstone investors that usually commit to buying large stakes and hold shares for some time, said four sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Some of these banks were preparing to market orders for their clients and had to switch them to a different kind of allocation instead, two of the sources said. 
The banks have also had to sometimes choose between Ant and deals for the fintech giant's competitors. 
CITIC Securities (SS:600030) dropped out of an IPO of rival JD (NASDAQ:JD) Digits, an affiliate e-commerce company JD.com (HK:9618), before it was granted a role in Ant's listing, three sources familiar with the matter said. 
CITIC did not respond to Reuters request for comment. 
In another case, food delivery giant  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690) believed JPMorgan could not carry on the work of its credit rating ahead of a potential bond issuance as it primarily competes with a business controlled by Ant and Alibaba, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
JPM and Meituan declined to comment. 
Investors' participation in the marketing roadshows for the IPO is also being tightly managed. A Hong Kong-based fund manager said he was told by one of Ant's banks that he had to complete a one-page document outlining his interest in the company before he was allowed to attend. 
The fund manager, who is an existing Alibaba shareholder, said that he had not come across that condition in any other IPOs in this region. 
Reuters could not determine whether Ant was asking all potential investors to do the same. 
QUICK REVIEW
Ant's control over information comes as the regulatory process around the listing has moved quickly. The company, which filed its preliminary prospectus in late August, is expected to be listed in October.
Exchanges and regulators scrutinise the IPO prospectus and question the company about key issues including its financials, corporate governance, shareholders and risk factors as part of the review.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange cleared the listing in 24 days, compared with roughly four months for most IPO candidates that obtained approval in September, according to public disclosures from the exchange.
The Hong Kong exchange is about a month into its review. Public disclosures from the bourse for other listings that obtained approval in September show it took about four months, on average. Ant expects to go public by the end of October, sources have said.
The person close to Ant said it had been responding to the Hong Kong exchange's queries and had no control over the pace of the process.
Fraser Howie, an independent commentator and author of several books about China's financial system, said the speed of approvals reflects the importance of the deal for China and Hong Kong. But it could be problematic for investors.
""It's what everyone wants, so we'll rush it through,"" Howie said. ""It bodes badly for those who care about maintaining standards. It sends a bad signal."" Shanghai stock exchange and China Securities Regulatory Commission did not respond to requests for comment.
The Hong Kong exchange said it has robust and well-established rules and processes for listings. 

""In evaluating applications, the Exchange seeks to ensure strong investor protection and maintain market quality,"" it said in a statement.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 07:30PM ET</span>",Options investor makes big bets on Nasdaq's popular 'FANG' stocks,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An investor bought large blocks of upside call options on Thursday in companies such as Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), trades reminiscent of outsized options purchases made in August by a large investor known as the ""Nasdaq whale.""
The unknown investor purchased calls expiring in January and March for Netflix, Amazon,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) while selling shares of those companies, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
The four companies are collectively known among investors as the ""FANG"" group, for the first letters of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google.
Such a trade involving options allows an investor to reduce stock exposure while maintaining the ability to benefit from future gains in stock prices.
In total, the investor paid a premium of about $180 million for the options, which have a notional value of roughly $1.7 billion, according to data from Trade Alert.
Some market watchers have attributed similar large call purchases in tech-related names made in August to SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984). Those institutional trades came during a flurry of call buying driven by retail investors.
According to some analysts, that activity prompted September's tech-driven sell-off in U.S. stocks, as dealers who sold those calls unwound the shares they had previously purchased to hedge against their short options positions.
""I can't tell you for sure who that is, but I have a feeling it's SoftBank again,"" said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, of Thursday's trades.
SoftBank declined to comment.
Tech-related call buying has continued, but it has cooled since early September. Skew, a measure of demand for protective put options relative to upside call options, has recovered in names such as Alphabet, Amazon and Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
The stock sales accompanying Thursday's options purchases neutralize the overall market impact of the trade, Murphy said. Moreover, given the previous ""Nasdaq whale"" trades, they are unlikely to spur as much reaction from other investors, and the impact is likely to be confined to options markets, he said.
""Because they're buying a bunch of vol in big names, maybe it spurs more vol buying,"" Murphy said. ""But it's more likely to have vol impact than stock price impact.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday refused to dismiss an indictment accusing state-owned Turkish lender Halkbank (IS:HALKB) of helping Iran evade American sanctions.
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan rejected Halkbank's claim that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act shielded it from prosecution, saying that law did not appear to grant immunity in criminal proceedings.
He also said an exception for commercial activity ""would clearly apply and support the Halkbank prosecution,"" citing the bank's interactions with U.S. Treasury Department officials and its alleged laundering of more than $1 billion through the U.S. financial system.
U.S.-based lawyers for Halkbank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Halkbank has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges brought last October.
U.S. prosecutors accused Halkbank of using money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions, enabling oil and gas revenue to be spent on gold and facilitating sham food and medicine purchases.
They also accused Halkbank of helping Iran secretly transfer $20 billion of otherwise restricted funds, including the $1 billion through U.S. accounts.
A trial is scheduled for March 1, 2021.
Halkbank has separately asked the federal appeals court in Manhattan to replace Berman with a different judge because of his alleged bias, an accusation Berman has denied.
Berman has overseen several related cases, including the 2018 conviction of former Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla and a guilty plea by Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader who testified against Atilla.
Halkbank's case has added tension to U.S.-Turkish relations, and gained renewed attention in former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton's recent memoir.
Bolton wrote that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in 2018 gave U.S. President Donald Trump a memo saying Halkbank was innocent, and Trump said the problem would be ""fixed"" once prosecutors were replaced.

The case is U.S. v Halkbank, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00867.

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Two key House of Representatives Democrats on Thursday urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to release all documents related to the government's 18-month review of the grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX.
Representatives Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Rick Larsen, who heads an aviation subcommittee, said that the FAA should not give the plane the go-ahead to fly commercially again before it releases ""system safety assessments, related analysis, assumptions about pilot response times and key test data concerning the safety of the aircraft.""
Boeing declined to comment. The FAA said it would respond directly to the lawmakers. Being ""fully transparent... will only be the first of many steps forward towards this goal that the FAA must take to regain the trust of the flying public.""
On Wednesday, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, a former commercial and military pilot, conducted a two-hour evaluation flight of a 737 MAX and said ""I like what I saw on the flight.""
He defended the agency's public disclosures. ""I think we have been transparent to an unprecedented degree... I understand the desire for transparency. We are providing everything we can, within the law.""
The lawmakers said ""to assure the flying public that Boeing’s fixes to the MAX have rendered the plane safe to once again carry passengers, the FAA will need to do more than merely certify that the plane is now compliant.""
The accidents plunged Boeing into its worst-ever crisis, strained its relationship with the FAA and cast doubt on the U.S. regulator's position as the standard-bearer for global aviation safety.
The FAA is requiring significant software changes to the MAX including new safeguards for a system linked to both fatal crashes and new training for all pilots before they resume flights.

DeFazio's committee on Wednesday unanimously approved bipartisan legislation to reform the FAA's aircraft certification process.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Golar Power Ltd has submitted the top bid for a highly-sought-after liquefied natural gas import terminal being leased by Brazil's state-run energy firm Petrobras, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
The terminal and regasification facility was offered under a wider government effort to end the state oil company's monopoly in natural gas imports and processing. The Bahia state terminal can process 20 million cubic meters per day of LNG and includes a 45 kilometer pipeline. 
A bid by Golar Power, a joint venture between Golar LNG (O:GLNG) and U.S. private-equity firm Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, was the top offer received, the people said. Twelve companies applied to submit offers, including local subsidiaries of  BP  PLC (L:BP),  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and Repsol SA (MC:REP).
On Monday, Petrobras separately said it would conduct an integrity risk assessment of Golar Power, which does business with the state-controlled producer. The results of that review potentially could exclude Golar Power from the competition. 
The chief executive of another Golar LNG-Stonepeak venture, Hygo Energy Transition Ltd, stepped down this week after being cited in a bribery investigation. The former executive, Eduardo Antonello, has not been charged.
Golar, Petrobras, BP, Total and Repsol did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The new operator will be able to start importing fuel at the terminal early next year, Petrobras has previously said. 
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state oil company is formally known, opened the bids on Wednesday and is analyzing the offers before officially announcing a winner, the people said.
Any supplier deemed to be high risk cannot do business with the state-controlled producer, Petrobras said on Monday.

Golar Power is investing in a number of projects in Brazil betting on an increase in LNG usage, now mostly used for power generation. The fuel eventually could be a substitute for diesel, Golar has said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel discussed ways to tighten antitrust laws on Thursday, with two Republicans on the Democrat-dominated panel indicating potential support for some changes.
The antitrust subcommittee, chaired by Representative David Cicilline, is expected to release a much-anticipated report into the four big tech companies -- Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  and Alphabet's Google (O:GOOGL) -- as soon as Monday.
In the hearing, Cicilline said the tech companies used strategies such as self-preferencing and predatory pricing to grow. ""These once-scrappy, underdog startups have grown into the kinds of monopolies we last saw more than a century ago,"" he said.
One witness, Bill Baer, who headed the Justice Department Antitrust Division during the Obama administration, argued to the committee that successive court rulings over the years have made it harder to block a merger.
""If courts are unwilling to step back from this overreach, legislation may well be needed to re-set the boundaries,"" he said.
Representative Ken Buck, a Republican, appeared swayed by calls for tougher antitrust law, including giving more funding to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission.
""We also need to seriously consider increasing scrutiny on big tech companies, including shifting the burden of proof required for a market dominant company to prove that a merger is not anti-competitive,"" he said.
Representative Kelly Armstrong, a Republican, said he agreed with Buck on the need for ""more money, more resources, (and) more enforcement."" He indicated he would be interested in discussing ""tweaks"" to antitrust law.
Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, repeated his concern that Big Tech firms were ""out to get conservatives.""
The Justice Department is also probing the big four tech platforms, and is expected to file a lawsuit against Google next week.

Facebook and Amazon also face inquiries by the FTC, while U.S. state attorneys general are looking at Facebook and Google.

White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany on Thursday urged Congress to quickly pass standalone legislation to aid airlines.
U.S. airlines are collectively burning about $5 billion of cash a month as passenger traffic has stalled at around 30% of 2019 levels. After tapping capital markets, they say they have enough liquidity to last them at least 12 months at that rate.
They have argued for another $25 billion in federal payroll aid to maintain their workforce and meet demand as the economy rebounds. Without the money, flight networks could further shrink, hampering their revenue power and shortening their liquidity runway.
Between voluntary and involuntary furloughs, major U.S. airlines' workforce will shrink by at least 25% in October.
""Airlines quite correctly have been bulking up on cash ... but to be 25% smaller, best case, how are you going to handle the debt service?"" asked airline consultant Mike Boyd.
Cities will lose a number of daily flights and non-stop options, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said. ""Service to small communities will decline pretty dramatically,"" she added.
That threat has resonated with some lawmakers even as the bailout request partly fell victim to broader political turmoil in a bitterly divided Washington.
Some airline officials think if Congress cannot reach agreement now on a broad coronavirus relief package, it may include funding for airlines when it takes up the issue again in the coming months.
But an uncertain recovery has not helped the airlines' case.
Industry experts expect a slight improvement in domestic demand over the winter holidays from current levels, but it will remain far below last year's volumes. Meanwhile, higher-margin business and international travel remain severely depressed.
Daily passengers at U.S. airports have swung from record highs in 2019 to dramatic lows in 2020, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) data. 
""Right now airline traffic is equal to where it was in the 1970s,"" said Becker. ""And the industry has a balance sheet that is 2019.""
Chief executives acknowledge that pre-pandemic air travel demand is unlikely to return for years, and still unknown is how the pandemic, which has forced drastic changes in habits, will impact travel behavior.
American Airlines, which said in August it planned to end service to 15 smaller airports without additional government assistance, said Thursday it is set to end service to 11 cities on Oct. 7.
The airline remains in talks with local officials about continuing service to Stillwater, Oklahoma and Roswell, New Mexico. In an order issued last week, the U.S. Transportation Department said American could not immediately halt service to Joplin, Missouri and Sioux City, Iowa.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Thursday filed criminal charges accusing four founders and executives of BitMEX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, of evading rules designed to stop money laundering.
The Department of Justice charged Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo, who together founded BitMEX in 2014, and Gregory Dwyer, its first employee and later head of business development, with violating the federal Bank Secrecy Act and conspiring to violate that law.
Hayes, 34, of Buffalo, New York, and Hong Kong, is chief executive of BitMEX, while Reed is its chief technology officer.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a separate civil lawsuit to halt BitMEX's U.S. commodity derivatives business. BitMEX is short for Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange.
""We strongly disagree with the U.S. government's heavy-handed decision to bring these charges, and intend to defend the allegations vigorously,"" a spokesman for BitMEX's parent HDR Global Trading Ltd said.
Dwyer's lawyer, Sean Hecker, said his client will contest the charges. Lawyers for the other individual defendants could not be identified.
An indictment filed in Manhattan federal court said the defendants flouted their obligation to implement an anti-money laundering program with a ""know your customer"" requirement, which they knew was needed because BitMEX served U.S. customers.
Their steps allegedly included incorporating BitMEX in the Seychelles because of its seemingly less stringent regulations, and where Hayes once bragged it would cost less to bribe authorities - just ""a coconut"" - than in the United States.
Prosecutors said BitMEX ultimately made itself a ""vehicle"" for money laundering and sanctions violations, including claims it was used to launder proceeds of a cryptocurrency hack and that customers from Iran traded on its platform.
The defendants ""will soon learn the price of their alleged crimes will not be paid with tropical fruit,"" FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney said in a statement.
Each count carries a maximum five-year prison term. Reed was arrested in Massachusetts and the other defendants are at large.
The case is U.S. v. Hayes et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-cr-00500.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 05:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. gaming platform Roblox prepares to go public - sources,"By Anirban Sen, Joshua Franklin and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Roblox Corporation is working with investment banks to prepare for a U.S. stock market listing that could come early next year and which the online gaming platform expects could double its recent $4 billion valuation, people familiar with the matter said.
U.S. demand for video games has surged as consumers seek home entertainment while living under lockdown measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
U.S. consumer spending on video gaming hit a record $11.6 billion in the second quarter, up 30% on the year-ago period, according to research firm NPD Group.
Roblox is weighing whether to go public through a traditional initial public offering or a direct listing, the sources said, cautioning that the plans are subject to market conditions.
The sources requested anonymity as the plans are private. Roblox declined to comment.
In a direct listing, no new shares are sold and underwriting banks do not weigh in on the pricing, unlike in an IPO.
By not selling new shares, companies do not dilute the ownership stakes of existing shareholders and the public listing allows current investors to sell shares easily.
Direct listings are relatively rare. Workplace software maker  Asana Inc  (N:ASAN) and data analytics company Palantir Technologies (N:PLTR) on Wednesday became only the third and fourth companies to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a direct listing.
For San Mateo, California-based Roblox, which was founded in 2004, the listing would come after it raised $150 million in February at a $4 billion valuation in a Series G funding round led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.
At the time of the fundraising announcement, Roblox said it had reached more than 115 million monthly active users and more than 1.5 billion hours of monthly engagement. 
Roblox's platform offers a host of different games across mobile devices and games consoles. The company operates a freemium model where users can make in-game purchases. 

Roblox's public listing would follow that of gaming platform  Unity Software Inc  (N:U) whose shares have risen more than 60% since it went public last month.

Investing.com – The Dow ended well below its session highs Thursday, on rising fears U.S. lawmakers are unlikely to break the impasse on talks for further federal stimulus, though losses were stemmed by an ongoing rise in tech.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.13%, or 36 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.54%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.42%.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the counteroffer on a stimulus deal from the White House, cooling investor optimism that both will find a solution sooner rather than later.  ""This isn't half a loaf. What they're offering is the heel of the loaf,"" Pelosi said in a Bloomberg TV interview. She added: ""[I]t's no use going into a negotiation if you say, 'I'll just take the path of least resistance.'""
The White House offered Pelosi a $1.6 trillion package, short of Democrats' $2.2 trillion proposal, Bloomberg reported. The counter-offer also included $400 a week in additional unemployment insurance, less than the $600 the Democrats requested, the sources said.
The stimulus bill would also include much-needed aid for the airline industry to stem a wave of layoffs in the wake of weaker travel demand. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), rose more than 2% and 1% respectively, moved ahead with plans to cut staff but pledged to reverse the cuts if Congress agreed to roll out aid. 
In the absence of stimulus, however, the recovery in the labor market appears to have continued, though at a slower pace.
The Labor Department reported that 837,000 people filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Sept. 26, less than the 850,000 filers economists had feared, and the lowest claims count since they were 282,000 during the week of March 14.
Tech, meanwhile, pushed the broader market higher. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which together make up a quarter weighting of the S&P 500, closed higher.
Energy proved an exception after oil prices plunged more than 5% as crude demand concerns intensify at a time when coronavirus infections continue to mount.
On the earnings front,  PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) ended more than 1% higher after its full-year guidance and quarterly earnings beat estimates, led by growth in its snack business. The company guided full-year earnings of $5.50 per share, topping consensus estimates of $5.36.
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) surged 25% after reporting a surprise quarterly profit of 50 cents and its first comparable-store sales growth since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Comp sales grew 6%, compared with estimates for a 2.1% decline."

Investing.com  --  To stimulus or not to stimulus. That is the question the market keeps asking, and Washington can't seem to get its act together long enough to give a straight answer. 
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Jobs again
The unemployment rate out at 8:30AM ET (1230 GMT) is expected at 8.2% for September, compared to 8.4% for August. The figure peaked in May at 14.7%.
The widely watched nonfarm payrolls come at the same time. The forecast is for 850,000 for September, compared to 1.3 million for August. Nonfarm payrolls measures the change in the number of people employed during the previous month, excluding the farming industry. Job creation is the foremost indicator of consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of economic activity.
2. Consumer sentiment
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is forecast at 79 for September, versus 78.9 the previous month. The index rates the relative level of current and future economic conditions.
3. Back to the Hill
The coronavirus brings us back to Capitol Hill, where Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is slated to appear before a Congressional committee to testify on the virus situation as U.S. numbers bounce back up.

The Wall Street bank won the bidding for the deal over  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC), according to the report. 
GM's credit card issuer  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF) and Goldman have agreed upon the purchase price and expect to finalize the deal in the coming weeks, the report said.
The acquisition will enhance Goldman's focus on its consumer banking business, which it is expanding to even out volatile results from segments such as trading and investment banking.
Goldman currently has a much smaller presence in consumer banking, unlike larger peers JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), and it is an area Chief Executive Officer David Solomon has been aggressively looking to strengthen.
It is the bank's second major credit card partnership, following the launch of a card with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) last year.
The purchase would also come at a time when U.S. households are cutting back on debt in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Goldman Sachs and Barclays declined to comment, while GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) - The U.S. auto sector on Thursday continued to show signs of a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as improving demand in the third quarter for new vehicles has General Motors Co (N:GM) and other major automakers scrambling to boost production to rebuild dealer inventories.
While sales in the quarter were down, the trend was positive as demand increased each month, especially among retail consumers for high-profit sports utility vehicles and pickup trucks, industry officials said.
""While the economy has made a substantial rebound in the third quarter, retail auto sales have been even more resilient,"" GM Chief Economist Elaine Buckberg said. ""Super-low auto loan interest rates have boosted retail auto sales; yet more strength comes from pandemic-induced demand.""
The third quarter is usually when the industry starts building new models, and piling up inventory for the holiday season. That transition is way behind the normal schedule this year due to the earlier shutdown caused by the outbreak and the initial slow ramp-up in production. 
Industry inventories for full-size pickup trucks, for example, stood at 500,000 vehicles heading into Labor Day this year, down from 900,000 last year, according to J.D. Power analyst Tyson Jominy.
GM, which reported a 10% decline in third-quarter sales but said results improved each month, said the seasonally adjusted sales pace for the quarter was expected to be 15.9 million vehicles, up about 4 million vehicles from the previous quarter.
The U.S. auto sector has held up better than other industries, but automakers had a hand in that with aggressive incentives like zero-for-84 months financing, payment deferrals and job assurance programs, J.D. Power's Jominy said. 
Automaker profits are also getting a boost.
Vehicle prices rose 2.5% in September from last year to an average of more than $38,700, Kelley Blue Book said. And incentive spending in the industry fell for the second straight month in September, the first time that has happened since April 2019, Jominy said.
""Automakers are going to report some pretty monster financial quarters here to close a year,"" he said. ""They're running the assembly plants flat-out right now and incentives are falling. There's a lot of positive financial indicators right now in the market.""  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp's (T:7203) U.S. sales fell 11% in the third quarter, but were up 16% in September. 
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) reported a 10% fall in U.S. sales in the quarter, but they were 38% higher than the prior quarter and the company cited strong consumer demand.
“We are optimistic about the U.S. market and expect sales to remain strong as we close out 2020,” FCA's U.S. sales chief, Jeff Kommor, said. 
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) echoed the theme of improving retail sales despite a 32% decline in the quarter.

""From an industry perspective, consumer confidence in the market is rising,"" said David Kershaw, Nissan's North American sales chief.

PARIS (Reuters) - French utility EDF (PA:EDF) expects that a reform of regulations covering its French nuclear fleet will pass quickly, within a few weeks or months, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.
In the wake of the reform, EDF will also launch a restructuring of the company, one of the sources added. 
Following a delay due to the coronavirus outbreak, France has resumed talks with the European Commission in recent months about reforming ARENH legislation, which gives its competitors access to part of its nuclear output. 
EDF has long wanted to reform the ARENH, which it says is a form of subsidy to its competitors. It says the ARENH puts all the risk and investment on EDF shoulders while giving private competitors easy access to cheap nuclear energy without investing in their own means of production. 
Under the law - voted in 2010 and set to end in 2025 - competitors such as Total Direct Energie, Engie and Eni can buy up to 100 terawatthours of power per year, about a quarter of EDF output, at 42 euros per MWh.
In February, EDF CEO Jean-Bernard Levy said he did not expect an ARENH reform before January 2022.
The planned restructuring of EDF will be aimed at boosting its financing and investment capacity. 
Codenamed ""Hercules"", the project might involve the sale of minority stakes and possibly an IPO of some EDF units, notably its renewable energy and power distribution activities.
These so-called ""green"" activities would remain majority-owned by EDF. EDF's ""blue"" activities - nuclear and hydropower -would remain fully financed by the parent company. 

Unions are against the project, which they see as a first step towards privatisation of the state-owned utility.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 02:15PM ET</span>",Boeing to move 787 production to South Carolina in 2021,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Thursday it will move the rest of its 787 Dreamliner production to South Carolina in 2021, a cost-cutting strategy that raises questions over the future its giant Everett plant north of Seattle.
Reuters first reported on Sept. 21 that Boeing was near a decision to move Dreamliner production to South Carolina as its strategy of supporting two plants has been severely tested by the coronavirus slump in international travel, on top of a cyclical downturn in demand for big jets. 
As recently as last year, Boeing was making record numbers of 787s at its Everett widebody hub north of Seattle and - since 2012 - a second plant in North Charleston, South Carolina.
Boeing said the single site would improve operational efficiency as the U.S. planemaker adjusts to the market downtown and positions for recovery.
But industry officials say it raises the prospect of a another battle between the U.S. planemaker and unions that have unsuccessfully tried to organize in the South Carolina plant. 
Boeing also said 787 production would continue at the Everett site until a previously announced rate cut to six airplanes a month in 2021. 
Boeing estimated it would consolidate production at its North Charleston facility starting in mid-2021.
A review of its 787 production strategy, announced in July along with sweeping rate cuts across its widebody programs, had already rattled unions and politicians in Washington state, who see Boeing wavering on its commitment to its Seattle-area birthplace, something the company denies.
Washington state governor Jay Inslee called the decision ""an insult"" to the more than 1,000 workers who build the 787 jet here and said it requires a review of the ""company's favorable tax treatment.""
The earlier decision to move some production to the non-union state of South Carolina was the culmination of a years-old board-led strategy to reduce reliance on Washington state, where Boeing has had stormy relations with unions in the past.
John Holden, president of a local chapter of the International Association of Machinists, said losing 787 production capacity in Everett ""puts the company, our members and our community in jeopardy.""
Ray Goforth, Executive Director of the SPEEA engineers union, said its ""immediate focus is supporting the members who will be laid-off. Long-term, we will partner with community stakeholders to attract new aerospace jobs to (Washington) state by marketing the aerospace talent pool Boeing is walking away from.""
Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Stan Deal said, ""We recognize that production decisions can impact our teammates, industry and our community partners.""
South Carolina offers cheaper labor, and the largest 787-10 variant cannot easily be built elsewhere due to its size.
But doubling down on the southern state is not without cost. 
Boeing aims to return to a rate of 10 to 11 787s monthly at some point. Running such rates at South Carolina would require investment to expand the facility.
Currently, Boeing builds the 747, 767, 777, and some 787s there. After 2022, only the 767/KC-46 and 777/777X would remain, with Boeing putting out no more than five jets monthly - roughly three times fewer than a year ago. 

After Boeing canceled plans for a new mid-market jet, there is no obvious backfill for the vacated 787 space, which means the remaining low-rate programs would absorb a bigger share of factory overhead.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>","Arkema, executives acquitted of charges from 2017 chemical fire","HOUSTON (Reuters) - A Texas judge on Thursday acquitted the U.S. arm of French chemical maker Arkema SA (OTC:ARKAY) and a top executive of criminal recklessness stemming from a 2017 blaze that injured 21 people, a verdict that ended all charges against its managers.
The company's Crosby, Texas, plant became waterlogged and lost power needed to keep organic peroxide chemicals from igniting after Hurricane Harvey dumped more than 50 inches of rain on the area. The untended chemicals caught fire and burned for days, injuring 21 safety workers and forcing residents from their homes. 
Arkema Inc and former plant manager Leslie Comardelle were found not guilty in a directed verdict by Judge Belinda Hill on Thursday. On Wednesday, she dismissed an endangerment charge against Arkema's U.S. chief executive, Richard Rowe, saying prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to support the charge.
Prosecutors last month separately dropped a criminal assault charge against Arkema and former logistics executive Michael Keough over smoke inhalation injuries suffered by public safety workers assigned to guard the plant. 
""It is beyond unfortunate that these ill-founded charges created years of undue hardship"" for the executives, Arkema spokeswoman Janet Smith said in a statement. She said the company had urged emergency workers wear respirators if they might be exposed to the smoke. 
The company had maintained the charges, brought by Harris County officials, were an attempt to criminalize a natural disaster.
“Today’s ruling by a judge doesn't change the fact that dangerous chemicals on Arkema property ignited and were belched in a cloud of toxic smoke over the surrounding communities, and a first responder there protecting people is now on a lung-transplant list,” said Dane Schiller, a spokesman for the Harris County District Attorney's office. 

The trial had resumed last month after being suspended in the spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the trial, Judge Hill sanctioned prosecutors for withholding evidence beneficial to the defense.

446,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>","Fiat Chrysler, Toyota Beat 3Q Forecasts: Auto Sales Update","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. new-car sales are showing improvement in the latest quarter after a pandemic-induced slump earlier this year. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. both reported better-than-expected results for the quarter.
Total new light-duty vehicle sales probably ran at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.7 million in September, down 1.6 million from a year ago, according to researcher J.D. Power. Retail sales, which exclude deliveries to fleet buyers such as rental-car companies, probably grew year over year in September, the first time that’s happened since February thanks to a couple of extra selling days on the calendar.
Sales have rebounded after touching a multi-decade low of 8.7 million vehicles in April, when factories were idled and buyers across the country were quarantined at home. But deliveries are still lower than a year ago as recession-wary buyers trickle back into showrooms.
Most automakers stopped reporting monthly deliveries last year, so the third-quarter results are the first peek at sales trends since early July. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. aren’t expected to release their quarterly numbers until Friday.
Here are highlights from the automakers that are reporting results for last month:
Chrysler’s Minivan Might
Fiat Chrysler sales fell 10% in the quarter -- above analysts’ forecast for an 11.4% drop -- to 507,351 vehicles. The company cited robust retail demand, which compensated for lower fleet sales to commercial and rental customers.
Sales of the profitable Jeep brand fell 9%, with deliveries of every model lower except the Gladiator pickup -- due in part to inventory shortages.
“Jeep and Ram are hot and we continue to prioritize deliveries to our dealers, who are asking us to ship as many vehicles as we can build,” Jeff Kommor, Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. sales chief, said in a statement.
The only brand that ticked higher in the quarter was Chrysler, thanks to strong sales of the Pacifica minivan. The people-mover’s deliveries soared 32% in the quarter to 28,696 units.
Toyota Hybrid Heft
Hybrids continue to provide a boost to Toyota, with September sales of its electric-gas vehicles up 35% and accounting for almost one-fifth of the company’s total. For the quarter, deliveries fell 11% to a better-than-expected 558,449 vehicles.
The Japanese automaker said overall sales in September rose 16% to 197,124 vehicles and that its was the first month the Toyota brand exceeded a pre-Covid sales plan. Lexus sales surged 31% to 24,754 cars and SUVs.
Hyundai Retail Strength
Retail sales rose every month in the third quarter for Hyundai Motor Co., even as total deliveries fell 1% for the three-month period to 170,828 vehicles. Fleet sales plunged 67% in September.
But that drop was largely offset by demand for popular SUVs like the South Korean automaker’s newish mid-size Palisade, which more than doubled to 7,741 units.

447,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>","Activist investor Icahn brings son back, lays out succession plan","(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn announced the formal return of his son, Brett, to  Icahn Enterprises  (O:IEP) on Thursday, laying the groundwork for a handover of control at one of the world's most successful activist investment firms.
Brett Icahn, 41, will manage a team of portfolio managers, will buy a $10 million stake in the firm and join the board of directors of the firm his 84-year old father has been running for decades, the company said in a release.
The pair, who have worked together off and on for years, said Brett would likely become chief executive and chairman in seven years or sooner if Carl agrees. Carl Icahn is currently the chairman and Keith Cozza is the president and chief executive officer. The Icahns could not be reached for comment.
Brett Icahn co-managed Icahn Enterprises' Sargon Portfolio until 2016 and helped the elder Icahn make successful stock picks, including an investment in Netflix Inc (O:NFLX).
The Sargon Portfolio generated annualized gross returns of 26.8% over its six-year lifetime.
Six years ago, Brett Icahn planned to launch his own hedge fund, with an activist bent, but quickly abandoned the plan in order to stay at his father's firm, for a while.
Brett Icahn's return comes one year after Carl Icahn moved himself and his firm from mid-town Manhattan to Florida after the investor, known for picking winners and facing off with captains of industry, had grown weary of working in New York.
Carl Icahn gave up investing for outside clients nine years ago, but his vast personal wealth, estimated at $13.8 billion, allows him to stay in the game, putting billions to work in companies like Occidental Petroleum (N:OXY) where he waged a bitter fight to take control.

He hired three portfolio managers to work on investments under his and Brett Icahn's supervision, the statement added.

449,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",Big Oil's $110 billion asset sale target could prove big ask,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Leading energy companies are hoping to sell dozens of oil and gas fields and refineries worth more than $110 billion to curb both their ballooning debt and their carbon footprints. 
But with the outlook for oil and gas prices uncertain because of the coronavirus pandemic and a shift to cleaner energy, finding buyers and striking deals might prove tricky. 
""This is not a very good time to sell assets,""  Total  CEO Patrick Pouyanne said while presenting the French giant's strategy to switch to renewables on Wednesday.
Eight of the world's top oil companies,  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM),  Chevron  (N:CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa),  BP  (L:BP), Total (PA:TOTF), Equinor (OL:EQNR), Eni (MI:ENI) and ConocoPhillips (N:COP), are expected to sell assets with resources of around 68 billion barrels of oil and natural gas equivalent.
Those assets today carry an estimated value of $111 billion, and are equivalent to around two years of existing global oil demand, Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy said in a note. 
(Graphic: https://graphics.reuters.com/OILMAJORS-DISPOSALS/oakveergzvr/chart.png)
Oil prices hit their lowest since 1999 in April after a collapse in demand caused by coronavirus-related travel restrictions. They have since recovered to around $40 a barrel, but are not expected to rise dramatically in coming years.
This means an opportunity to snap up cheap assets for smaller companies like  Serica Energy  (L:SQZ),  Cairn Energy  (L:CNE) and Jadestone Energy , Peel Hunt analysts said.
Yet with a narrowing pool of buyers and a growing reluctance to lend to the oil and gas sector, disposals could be tough. 
""Oil and gas asset sales will of course put pressure on market pricing if there are few buyers for these assets,"" Garrett Soden, CEO of Canadian-listed Africa Energy (V:AFE), which is part of Lundin Group, said.
Reduced investments by the majors could however lead to tighter supply and higher oil prices, which would increase the value of their resources, Soden added.
The majors need to sell assets to boost revenues and reduce debt amassed in the wake of the oil price collapse.
European companies including BP, Shell and Total are also looking to focus their oil and gas operations on the most profitable and least polluting projects after pledging to slash carbon emissions in coming decades.
Exxon and BP each hope to sell $25 billion of assets in the coming years, while Shell aims to dispose of $5 billion a year. 
Spiro Youakim, global head of natural resources at investment bank Lazard (NYSE:LAZ), told Reuters that oil company boards should consider spinning off unwanted oil and gas production and refining businesses to attract new investors as buyers such as private equity lose appetite.

""The majors' portfolios are exceedingly large and they include more peripheral assets which could be run more effectively by different types of investors,"" Youakim said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Major Canadian labor unions on Thursday said the aviation sector would suffer permanent damage unless Ottawa provided a C$7 billion ($5.3 billion) 10-year low-interest loan to offset the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, which has slashed travel.
The unions, which represent more than 310,000 workers, said in a statement that Canada remained the only leading developed nation not to have unveiled concrete measures to help the travel and tourism sector.

The average time to get an order at 10 of the biggest fast-food chains in the U.S. this year is just shy of six minutes, according to a report from market researcher SeeLevel HX. That’s about 30 seconds slower than last year, and it shows how the pandemic has sent consumers that would normally eat in the restaurant to drive thrus, putting them to the test.
Such a small delay may seem trivial, but it cost the industry millions in lost revenue, according to the report. The slowdown broadly stemmed from the fact that many restaurants were operating with newly hired staff after a rash of Covid-related layoffs, coupled with higher volumes and a surge of delivery orders, SeeLevel HX CEO Lisa van Kesteren said.
“Covid came along and restaurants found their teams just smashed to smithereens,” van Kesteren in an interview. “Because everything went off-premise, they were inundated.”
SeeLevel HX estimates the 30-second delay costs a chain that serves food throughout the day about $32,000 per store over the course of a year. For a store with 2,000 locations, or about the size of Chick-Fil-A, that would add up to $64 million in lost revenue.

It was one of only three restaurants to get faster this year from 2019. Chick-Fil-A held its position at the bottom of the list in terms of speed, and Dunkin’ fell from first place to seventh. Chick-Fil-A scored highest for order accuracy and customer service, however.

Investing.com --   Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK) jumped 8.6% after Wedbush added it to its best ideas list.
Shares of the online home goods retailer are up over 1,000% in 2020, but the research firm still sees upside. The stock is down about 37% since mid-August. 
""Our bias for substantial upside to consensus Q3 expectations, and the stock’s historical trading pattern around earnings suggest that there could be meaningful upside from current levels, with shares down 43% from their all-time high of $128.50 on August 19,"" Wedbush said, according to Seeking Alpha. ""Our proprietary survey results, industry tailwinds, and continued WFH/Shelter-in-place rules suggest to us that Q3 revenue will be closer to flat sequentially than to down 26% as currently implied by consensus estimates.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Average drive-thru times at major fast food chains got 29.8 seconds slower in 2020, a survey showed on Thursday, dragged by increased safety protocols and staff turnover during the coronavirus pandemic.
A typical brand could lose $64 million annually per 2,000 stores with the slower average times this year, according to the report from market research agency SeeLevel HX.
During the pandemic, Americans have flocked to drive-thrus to get cheap food quickly with limited human contact.
That has made the car-centric service model that came of age in 1950’s California more relevant than ever, prompting chains to accelerate investments in technology and real estate to accommodate extra lanes and new ways to order, pay and speed away.
Across the industry, drive-thru visits grew by 26% in April, May and June, according to research firm The NPD Group. Even as more dining rooms opened in July, drive-thru visits rose by 13%.
Drive-thru orders accounted for nearly 90% of McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) total U.S. sales in the second quarter, versus roughly 70% in more normal times.
Big brands including Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG) and  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) have expedited development plans to add drive-thrus and curbside pickup, especially in suburbia.
 Shake Shack Inc  (N:SHAK) will build its first-ever drive-thru lane next year, while expanding pick-up lanes for mobile orders. 
Most changes will last long after the pandemic, said SeeLevel HX founder Lisa van Kesteren.
""People have discovered the convenience of drive-thru and mobile ordering in a way they really hadn't before,"" she said, and worry about germs is also likely to persist.
Brands are adding artificial intelligence and automation to drive-thrus and digital menu boards that confirm customers' orders are correct.
Of ten brands surveyed, only three – McDonald's, as well as Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) KFC and Taco Bell – were quicker in 2020 than last year. All three had simplified their menus.
KFC had the fastest total time – from when a customer pulls into the line to when she motors away with her food – at 283.3 seconds, just under 5 minutes. It tied with Hardee's for the lowest average number of cars in line, with 1.5.
Chick-fil-A had the slowest time at 488.8 seconds – over 8 minutes - but ranked first for order accuracy, customer service and taste. 

The research was conducted with 1,490 drive-thru visits at 10 major brands, from the last week of June through the first week of August.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Co will on Thursday sign an agreement to invest in the retail division of India’s  Reliance Industries , (NS:RELI) according to a source close to the deal.
Mubadala will invest just over 3 billion dirhams ($817 million), which translates into a 1.4% equity stake in Reliance Retail Ventures Limited on a fully diluted basis, the source said.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Mubadala, the second-biggest state investor in Abu Dhabi after Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, was in advanced talks to invest in Reliance Retail.
Reliance Retail is on a fundraising spree and has secured around $1.8 billion in the past few weeks from KKR & Co KKR.N and Silver Lake Partners.
Reliance, controlled by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, has approached investors, who collectively pumped more than $20 billion into its Jio Platforms digital business this year, to take stakes in its retail business. 
The retail business has nearly 12,000 stores and sells everything from groceries and electronics to fashion and shoes.
Mubadala manages over $230 billion in assets.

Investing.com --  And now there's an ETF for this year's hottest trend: Spacs. 
Defiance ETFs announced the launch of the Defiance Next Gen SPAC Derived ETF, also called SPAK, which tracks special purpose acquisition companies. Shares opened at $25.74 and are moving very little.
Once an obscure corner of the market, Spacs, also called blank-check companies, are all the rage for those that want to go public in a less traditional way. 
Already, companies like Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) and DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) have used Spacs to go public. A blank-check company is a shell company without operations but with the intention of acquiring or merging with a company the using proceeds of the Spac's initial public offering.
The danger of a Spac is there's no traditional road show to vet the company. Investors have to trust in the judgement of the Spac founders. 
Earlier this year, Nikola listed on the Nasdaq by merging with the VectoIQ Acquisition Corp Spac, which was backed by investors including Fidelity and ValueAct, according to Reuters. VectoIQ raised $200 million in a May 2018 IPO. 
Nikola founder Trevor Milton recently resigned after a short-seller report from Hindenburg slammed the company for fraud, days after General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) had said it would take a stake in the company.     
“Picking the winners of individual SPACs can be very difficult, however the ETF structure allows investors to access the most liquid SPAC IPOs in a diversified basket,"" Defiance ETF said in a statement. ""SPAK allows both financial advisors and retail investors to participate in an IPO private equity style of investing, which until now, was only available to large financial institutions.""

460,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>",Big U.S. banks to report profit plunge as pandemic recession takes hold,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As big U.S. commercial banks close their books on the third quarter, analysts expect them to report a 30% to 60% plunge in profits on the year-ago period due to the pandemic-induced recession and near record low interest rates.
That slump in third quarter net income comes even though lenders are not going to make outsized provisions for expected loan losses as they did in the first and second quarters.
And, while capital markets and investment banking revenue is expected to be up from 5% to 20%, that won't be enough to make up for the decline in interest income from loans and securities.
""You have soft loan growth and you're still feeling the impact from aggressive Fed actions earlier this year,"" said analyst Jason Goldberg of  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), the third- and fourth-biggest U.S. banks by assets respectively, will report net income down by about 60%, according to I/B/E/S analyst survey data from Refinitiv.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), which rank first and second in assets respectively, are expected to show profits down about 30%.
Investment banks  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), which are benefitting from being more concentrated in the busy capital markets, are expected to report more modest profit declines of about 5% to 10%. 
JPMorgan and Citigroup will kick off the third-quarter bank earnings season on Oct. 13.
Pandemic-driven lockdowns have put tens of millions of Americans out of work and plunged the U.S. into a recession. U.S. output is forecast to fall 3.7% in 2020, the Federal Reserve said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-reopen/u-s-economic-rebound-may-be-a-slow-train-for-the-unemployed-idUKKBN268327 last month.. That is not as bad as feared earlier in June, allowing banks to hold off on adding to their loss reserves. 
At an online Barclays investor conference last month, bank executives said consumers have paid down credit card debt during the recession and businesses have shunned bank loans. Big companies have instead been able to raise cash via the bond markets, which are being propped up by the Fed.
Consumer loans at large U.S. banks were also down about 3% in the quarter from a year earlier, according to Fed data.
As markets plunged in March, the central bank cut overnight interest rates to near zero and began a massive campaign to buy securities. Those purchases and a surge in savings from worried consumers have flooded banks with more deposits than they can lend or risk putting into longer-term securities.

Stuffed with cash, bank net interest margins -- the spread between their cost of money and what they earn on loans and securities -- fell to their lowest levels in 35 years in the second-quarter, according to research by Goldman Sachs.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday, buoyed by revived hopes of a new package of fiscal stimulus measure to sustain an economy whose rebound from the pandemic has appeared to weaken in recent data. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 223 points, or 0.8%, at 28,005 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.2%.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had ""productive"" conversations on Wednesday and now agree on more parts of what a stimulus package should contain, even though they still remain some $600 billion apart on the overall size of the measures, according to various reports.
Stock futures had earlier trimmed their premarket gains after data showing that personal incomes fell by 2.7% in August, following the end of enhanced unemployment benefits in July. While personal spending still grew, it did so at a reduced rate of 1.0%. Those numbers were published at the same time as data showing that initial jobless claims continue to run at abormally high levels - 837,000 more people filing claims last week. The number of continuing claims, by contrast, fell by nearly 1 million, more sharply than expected. 
The decline in claims was ""welcome, but not definitive"", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.  ""With total initial claims, regular plus (Pandemic Unemployment Assistance), at almost 1.5 million per week, the labor market clearly is still in turmoil.""
Elsewhere, the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing survey showed activity cooled a little in September, although the pace of labor-shedding by the sector slowed. The ISM's purchasing mangers index fell to 55.4, its first drop in five months. Analysts had expected a rise to 56.4 from 56 last month.
Among early movers, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock rose 5.8% on its second day of trading, shaking off a weak close to its debut on Wednesday, while DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) stock rose 3.2% to yet another all-time high. Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) rose 25% after an encouraging quarterly update, while  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP) stock fell 0.7% after warning of currency headwinds to its full-year figures.
Financial stocks underperformed after the Federal Reserve's decision to extend its cap on dividend payments and suspension of stock buybacks by banks until the end of the year. While that was the consensus expectation, a minority of investors had hoped for an early end to the restrictions. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock were both up by less than 0.1%.
In biotech,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 1.9% after it said its experimental Covid-19 drug wouldn't be ready before the presidential election in November.

462,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 09:26AM ET</span>","Ford's new CEO Farley promises urgency at automaker, shakes up management","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) new chief executive, Jim Farley, on Thursday promised the U.S. automaker would move with urgency, responding to investor and analyst criticism of the speed at which his predecessor acted.
Farley, on his first day as Ford's 11th CEO, also announced an executive shake-up that included naming a new chief financial officer. 
Ford's promise to accelerate its turnaround is not new at a time when it is executing an $11 billion restructuring. 
Farley was named chief operating officer in February and promised a faster return to strong profits. He was officially tapped to succeed Jim Hackett in August. 
“During the past three years, under Jim Hackett's leadership, we have made meaningful progress and opened the door to becoming a vibrant, profitably growing company,” Farley said in a statement on Thursday. “Now it's time to charge through that door.” 
Hackett and Ford have been criticized by some on Wall Street for not moving quickly enough on its restructuring. At the end of the second quarter, the Dearborn, Michigan-based company had incurred only $3.9 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges.
Farley will face immediate tests in his new role, including ensuring a smooth launch for the highly profitable, top-selling F-150 pickup truck to avoid the costly missteps Ford experienced when it revamped the Ford Explorer SUV. 
Ford on Thursday reaffirmed its goal for operating margins of 8%, something it identified as a 2020 target before the coronavirus pandemic hit. It did not specify when it would achieve this target.
Ford's operating margin was 4.1% last year, before falling to negative 4.8% in the first half of 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The company also said John Lawler would succeed Tim Stone as CFO. Lawler most recently had been head of Ford Autonomous Vehicles and vice president of mobility partnerships. He also served as president of Ford China for nearly four years. 
Stone, who will remain with Ford through Oct. 15, accepted a job as COO and CFO with ASAPP Inc, an artificial-intelligence software company. Stone had been in the CFO job only since June 2019.
Ford also said it would separate the Lincoln and marketing jobs to put greater focus on both. Joy Falotico, who had held both the Lincoln and global marketing jobs, will focus on Lincoln once a chief marketing officer is named, in a move meant to accelerate the brand's growth. 
Farley outlined his objectives during a virtual town hall meeting with Ford's global team on Thursday, saying the company will allocate capital to its strongest franchises and high-growth opportunities, such as the F-Series pickup truck and its commercial business.
It also will add more affordable vehicles to its global lineup, build electric vehicles at scale and stand up new autonomous-enabled businesses, he said. Decision making will be pushed down to the regional level.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Dan Levy welcomed Farley's urgency and Lawler's ascension, and said investors will expect increased disclosure under the new management team.
Ford has moved to cut costs globally, including earlier this month when it said it would target cutting 1,400 U.S. salaried jobs by year end.
Last year, Ford cut 7,000 salaried jobs globally, as well as targeting 12,000 additional layoffs and plant closures in Europe. It also restructured operations in China and South America. 

The automaker previously said it expects a full-year loss because of the pandemic's impact. It sees a pre-tax profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter, and a loss in the fourth quarter as it launches several new vehicles.

Negotiations for coronavirus relief aid between the White House and House Democrats had stalled in large part over the price tag, with Democrats seeking $2.2 trillion and the White House staying firm at $1.5 trillion.
Shares of American Airlines, United, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) were up between 1.3% and 2.8% in pre-market trading.
U.S. airlines have been pleading for another $25 billion in support to protect jobs for a further six months after the previous package, which banned furloughs, expired at midnight Sept. 30.
The deadline expiry prompted American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL), two of the largest U.S. carriers, to announce they were beginning furloughs of over 32,000 workers.
Both airlines said, as per memos seen by Reuters, they would reverse furloughs if Washington extends aid which affect about 13% of their workforces before the pandemic.
""U.S. carriers have avoided the hard restructuring to date. While there have been furloughs, planes have been retired, and some layoffs are coming, but managements of these airlines have positioned these companies for an eventual recovery,"" said Peter McNally, an analyst at research firm Third Bridge.

Same-store sales jumped 6% for the second quarter ended Aug. 29, compared with a 1.78% drop estimated by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, largely helped by an 89% surge in online sales. 
The retailer had been struggling to keep pace in a rapidly shifting retail landscape before the pandemic, prompting Chief Executive Officer Mark Tritton to focus more on the company's online portfolio after taking charge last year. 
""The marked improvement in our second quarter financial results reflects the potential of our digital-first, omni-always transformation,"" Tritton said in a statement. 
The company has benefited from consumers buying new furnishing and home decor online as many are expected to continue working from home and as several school and college begin classes online.
Gross margins also improved 1,000 basis points to 36.7%, driven by improved products prices, lower coupon expenses and fewer markdowns.
The company posted adjusted profit of 50 cents per share, while analysts were expecting a loss of 23 cents per share.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China estimated that 13 million railway passenger trips were made on Thursday at the start of the Golden Week holiday, the highest for a single day since the coronavirus outbreak began in February, according to state media.
Although this figure signals pent-up demand for travel now that the virus situation within China is largely under control, it is still lower than the 17 million railway passenger trips made on the same day last year. 
There were 186 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China as of Sept 30, a far cry from the tens of thousands of cases during its peak in February, data from the country's National Health Commission showed.
According to China State Railway, average daily passenger trips between Sept 28 and Oct 8 this year were estimated at 9.82 million, with total trips reaching 108 million for the eight-day holiday stretch, state news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday.
This year's Golden Week holiday is one day longer than last year's because it coincides with the Mid-Autumn Festival.
Total air travel bookings during this holiday, at 14,941 flights, is comparable with last year, but bookings for domestic flights have increased 10.5%, according to an estimate by China's aviation authority.
Few people are expected to venture abroad due to quarantine requirements and a dearth of overseas flights. 
China Tourism Academy, a government research institute, estimated that 550 million people, or 68%, of last year's figure will travel domestically during this holiday period, state television CCTV reported.
China's largest online travel agency Trip.com said in a report that Chinese tourists are expected to make 600 million domestic trips this holiday. This is about 77% of last year's figure, according to a Xinhua report.

The country has instructed all domestic tourist destinations to cap the number of tourists at 75% of capacity.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Viridor, the British waste management business owned by U.S. private equity firm KKR, has hired investment bank UBS to sell its waste and recycling subsidiary, two sources told Reuters.
Viridor, bought by KKR from British water utility  Pennon  (L:PNN) for 4.2 billion pounds ($5.4 billion) in March, is looking to simplify its portfolio and will sound out market interest in the next few weeks, the sources said.
The recycling unit has an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of about 75 million pounds, they added. 
Viridor and Swiss bank UBS declined to comment.
KKR did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
As public pressure mounts to pare back on global waste, including the plastic packaging clogging landfills and oceans, companies around the world have committed to improve recycling and reduce their carbon emissions, boosting their credentials with investors and the general public.
Viridor's waste and recycling subsidiary could attract the interest of private equity and infrastructure funds keen to capitalise on the steady returns from a business that often works with underlying contracts, which are consistently renewed. 
Macquarie Infrastructure Partners has separately launched the sale of waste management company Wheelabrator's power plants in the United Kingdom, with initial bids expected in coming days, sources told Reuters in August.

Apollo Strategic Growth Capital said on Thursday it would offer 75 million units at $10 apiece. (https://refini.tv/3l97JKh)
Each unit would represent one ordinary share and one-third of a warrant. One whole warrant would give the holder the right to buy an ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share.
A blank-check company, also known as a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), is a shell company that uses capital raised through an IPO to buy a private company, typically within two years. The deal then takes the private company public.
A number of high-profile investors such as Bill Ackman, Chamath Palihapitiya and Michael Klein have raised billions through their SPACs this year. Ackman's  Pershing Square Tontine  Holdings Ltd (N:PSTH) raised $4 billion in its IPO in July, making it the largest SPAC IPO.
Reuters also reported in September that Riverstone Holdings LLC, one of the oil and gas sector's largest private equity investors, is planning a blank-check acquisition company that will buy a business in the clean energy industry.
Apollo Strategic's units would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""APSG.U"".

A blank-check company, or a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), uses capital raised through an initial public offering to buy a private company, usually within two years. Investors are not notified in advance what the SPAC will buy.
Mountain Crest raised $50 million in an initial public offering earlier this year with the goal of buying a private company. SPACs have emerged as an increasingly popular route to public markets over a traditional IPO in 2020.
Playboy stopped printing its flagship magazine earlier this year, ending a nearly seven-decade run on newsstands that began in 1953 with a debut issue featuring Marilyn Monroe.
The company has expanded beyond its media business to refashion itself as a lifestyle brand and is eyeing expansion into sexual wellness.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",Europe lags a resurgent global IPO market,"By Clara Denina and Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - The amount raised by European companies listing on the stock market fell by a third in the first nine months of the year, in contrast with Asia and the United States where an abundance of technology companies benefitted from the COVID-19 crisis. 
Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) had raised $122 billion globally by the end of the third quarter, the most in two years, as central bank stimulus measures and low interest rates led to a generally hearty appetite for equities. 
Funds raised rose by 75% in Asia and 13% in the Americas compared to the same period of 2019, but fell to just $9 billion in Europe, the lowest amount since 2012, Refinitiv data shows.
Overall, bankers made $8.43 billion from IPO fees, the biggest pot for the first nine months of the year since 2007, while U.S. fees hit an all-time high of $4.2 billion, the data shows.
Warren Buffett-backed data warehouse company Snowflake (N:SNOW) is the largest U.S. listing of the year so far, raising more than $3 billion and doubling in value on its market debut, as offices around the world adapt to remote working.
Meanwhile, Ant Group, the fintech arm of e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), could steal the record for the largest IPO from oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), having filed for a dual listing in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market which could raise as much as $35 billion.
In Europe, e-commerce firm The Hut Group (L:THG) is among a handful of completed deals, with Polish online auction site Allegro preparing to come to market. 
""Recent IPOs in Europe have demonstrated the real scarcity value attached to high quality tech issuers in EMEA: there is a structural underweight in the region,"" said James Palmer, head of EMEA Equity Capital Markets (ECM) at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
""The more fundamental issue for the EMEA IPO market versus the U.S. is the latter's appetite for smaller issuers and deal sizes, which is particularly relevant for many tech and biotech issuers,"" Palmer added.
SP-ACKMAN STRIKES
The United States has also seen a proliferation of SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies), or blank cheque companies, emerge as a major IPO driver, with high profile investors such as Bill Ackman and Michael Klein raising billions of dollars.
A SPAC is a shell company that uses proceeds from its listing to buy another company, with the money raised before the target is identified.
The only such vehicle touted as potential London listing, Harvester Holdings, backed by London-born entrepreneur Martin Franklin, was pulled due to a lack of investor interest, sources said. 
More broadly, global ECM activity rocketed a record 59% to $712 billion in the first nine months of 2020, with similar growth levels seen across the three regions, as companies scrambled for funds to weather the pandemic. 
""Equity markets have been incredibly supportive of companies that have raised money on the front foot and those who have raised defensively as well, and rewarded proactivity,"" said Aloke Gupte, co-head of EMEA ECM at JP Morgan.
    He added that he expects IPOs and rights issues, where new shares are offered to existing shareholders, to continue throughout 2021, even if there are periods of heightened volatility.

Higher oil prices will help exploration and production earnings by $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, compared with the second quarter, it said in a filing. However, weak gas prices will continue to weigh on the segment and could hurt earnings by as much as $500 million.

475,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 07:21AM ET</span>","Meatpackers in the Americas accelerate automation after outbreaks, lagging Europe","By Rod Nickel, Rajesh Kumar Singh and Ana Mano
WINNIPEG/CHICAGO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - As coronavirus outbreaks among workers closed several Canadian meat plants, Henry Mizrahi saw a different future for Lesters Foods, the hot dog factory he runs in Montreal.
Mizrahi made plans to install a robotic arm capable of moving packages into larger containers for shipping, allowing workers greater distance from each other. Lesters, a small private company, is investing several million dollars in a five-year plan to increase automation. 
""The way we've designed plants has worked up to now - now we need to make dramatic changes,"" said Mizrahi, president of the 89-year-old company also known for its smoked meat. 
The United States, Canada and Brazil, all major meat producers and exporters, have adopted technology at a slower pace than Northern Europe or Japan and lagged other industrial factories in automating their operations. The concentration of COVID-19 outbreaks in the meatpacking industry in the Americas partly reflected its greater reliance on elbow-to-elbow working conditions.  
Accelerating the move to automation would increase food security and improve plant safety. But such plans come with costs that some find unaffordable during tough economic times, and workers fear they are being replaced, not protected.
 Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), Smithfield Foods and  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), several of the world's largest packers, all have automation plans under way, their representatives said. 
Meat plants account for just $1 billion in global annual sales of automation supplies and services, distributor Cantrell Gainco said, a sliver of the estimated $215 billion business of industrial automation, according to advisory firm ROBO Global. But North American packer interest is climbing.
Georgia-based Cantrell Gainco, which sells Japanese manufacturer Mayekawa's chicken deboning equipment, has fielded twice the usual number of inquiries since the pandemic spread to North America, said Russ Stroner, vice president of global sales.
Mayekawa said in a statement that global sales of its chicken deboning robot parts are set to rise from $32 million in 2019 to $45 million this year and $60 million in 2021, including North American sales this summer to Tyson,  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) and Peco Foods.
BRAZIL CATCHING UP
In Brazil, the country's fourth-largest pork processor, Frimesa, intensified efforts to automate as the pandemic spread. 
Plans called for spending 20 million reais ($3.53 million)annually on automation, but that program may now get a 5% annual bump, not including one-off pricey equipment purchases like robots, said Claudecir dos Santos, Frimesa's research and innovation manager. The goal is to automate areas where employees cluster together, he said.
Frimesa's Assis Chateaubriand plant under construction in the state of Parana will include five robots, costing some 500,000 euros ($586,000) each. They will perform tasks including cutting open the pig's chest, eviscerating it and slicing the animal in half.
Olymel LP, one of Canada's biggest pork and poultry processors, had an automation plan before the pandemic forced it to temporarily close a Quebec plant for more than two weeks.
It decided then to accelerate the plan, and intends to use robots to sort meat cuts, pick and pack shipments and stack boxes, said Vice President of Engineering and Project Management Marco Dufresne.
Tyson, the highest-selling U.S. meat company, is making a bigger automation push because of the pandemic, said director of engineering Doug Foreman. ""There's a heightened sense of urgency, no doubt about it,"" he said.
Tyson this summer tested a robot at its Arkansas automation center that uses machine vision to move chicken breasts from a conveyor belt into tray packs for sale in grocery stores. 
With retail demand surging, Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC), which is mostly owned by Brazil's JBS, said in July it will use automation to double capacity of a Minnesota plant to produce chicken sold in tray packs. The plant suffered a COVID-19 outbreak in April.
""The outbreaks of corona will put extra spice into the need for automation because the fewer people you have, the less likely you are to suffer from these outbreaks,"" said Henrik Andersen, chief commercial officer at Denmark-based Frontmatec, producer of automation equipment for the food industry. 
Demand from U.S. plants has been particularly strong, Andersen said. 
Greater automation raises suspicions, however, among labor groups.
""It's taking away people's jobs,"" said BJ Motley, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers union (UFCW) branch that represents Smithfield workers in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where more than 1,000 workers contracted the coronavirus.
Smithfield automated the work of splitting hogs at the plant a few years ago, eliminating eight positions, he said.
A Smithfield representative declined to respond to Motley's comments. 
JBS USA uses the threat of replacing workers with automation as a negotiating tactic, said Kim Cordova, president of the UFCW local union that represents JBS beef plant employees in Greeley, Colorado.
""We're threatened with automation all of the time, like, 'If you speak up, we'll just use automation,'"" Cordova said.   
A JBS spokesman said the allegation was ""completely untrue.""
While the virus outbreak has highlighted the advantages of automation, its economic fallout has conversely limited the scope for major technology investments. 
Packers have placed orders with Cantrell Gainco for equipment worth up to $400,000, but pricier projects have been placed on hold in light of uncertainty over how the pandemic will affect cash flow and consumer demand, Cantrell Gainco's Stroner said.
Back in Canada, Mizrahi of Lesters Foods is certain automation is worth the expense.
""When we started to see it hit (other plants), I saw how tragic the impact was on human health.
""The pandemic has certainly accelerated our strategy of planning for more robotic equipment.""

476,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",Bleaker profit outlook at Bayer turns into reckoning over Monsanto,"By Patricia Weiss and Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) shares (DE:BAYGn) plunged after it flagged lower profit next year and warned it may have to write down the value of agriculture assets by close to 10 billion euros ($11.7 billion), rekindling a debate over the merits of the takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON).
Bayer, which acquired the U.S. seed maker for $63 billion in 2018, said late on Wednesday the coronavirus pandemic was a bigger drag on the agriculture business than feared, causing lower biofuel demand and negative currency effects, and competition in soy seeds was also intensifying. 
The stock dropped as much as 12.7% on Thursday to a six-month low and was down 10% at 1054 GMT. That strips more than 5 billion euros off the company's market value.
The drugs, pesticides and seeds maker said it now expects 2021 sales to come in at around the 2020 levels, with 2021 core earnings per share slightly below 2020 levels, based on constant exchange rates.
""Since Monsanto was acquired, Bayer has delivered its basket of bad news every year and it is clear now that the group will not deliver the revenue growth expected at the time of this acquisition,"" said Jean-Jacques Le Fur, an analyst at brokerage Bryan Garnier. 
That is an added headache as Bayer is already struggling to wrap up an $11 billion settlement over claims that Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller causes cancer after a judge took issue with a side arrangement on future cases that may yet be lodged.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said the significant revision of the Crop Science unit's growth forecasts was a particularly unwelcome addition the litigation uncertainty.
""The profit warning for next year is a significant setback for Bayer and its management,"" said Markus Manns, a portfolio manager at German mutual fund firm Union Investment.
""Things like a breakup of the company or management change could likely come on the agenda again sooner or later,"" he added.
The contract of Bayer boss Werner Baumann, the driving force behind the takeover, was last month extended until 2024, in a show of support from the drugmaker's new chairman. That came even as the Roundup settlement deal, agreed in June, has yet to be finalised.
Shareholders denied Bayer's top management a largely symbolic vote of confidence at the 2019 general meeting, following court room defeats over Roundup, but Baumann and his team won the investor vote at this year's iteration.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Thursday, amid increased confidence policymakers will come up with a compromise stimulus deal to help stimulate the country’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic hit.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT),S&P 500 Futures traded 30 points, or 0.9%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 216 points, or 0.8%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 149 points, or 1.3%. 
The major U.S. cash indices closed higher Wednesday, but September was the first losing month on Wall Street since March. That said, the third quarter was still a positive one, and looking ahead, seven of the last 10 Octobers have seen the markets push higher.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are set to resume discussions Thursday on a potential new pandemic relief package, after holding their first in-person talks since August on Wednesday.
According to The Wall Street Journal, the two are agreed that the package should contain a new round of stimulus checks for households, which analysts see as key to sustaining consumer spending.
“The need for economic stimuli has become very apparent in large U.S. companies such as Disney and several U.S. airlines, which have now embarked on extensive firing rounds,” analysts at Danske Bank wrote, in a research note.
New cases of Covid-19 rose in 27 out of 50 U.S. states in September compared with August, led by an increase of 111% in Wisconsin, according to a Reuters analysis.
On the data slate, eyes will focus on the weekly initial jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), especially after Wednesday's better than expected ADP private payrolls number and ahead of Friday’s official employment data, the last such release before the general election.
Also due out at the same time are data about personal income and personal spending for August, while ISM manufacturing PMI data for September are due at 10 AM ET.
In corporate news, earnings are due from home goods retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY)and wine and spirits maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), while the banking sector will be in focus with the Federal Reserve set to curb big bank capital distributions through the end of the year. Airlines are also set to start laying off workers this month without any additional federal support.
Oil prices drifted lower Thursday, handing back some of the previous session’s gains on the back of U.S. stockpiles falling 2 million barrels last week, defying trade expectations for a build.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% lower at $39.63 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $41.70. Both contracts closed more than 3% lower on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,901.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1744.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is drawing up plans to set up Lamborghini as a more independent unit, and is discussing long-term supply deals that could make it easier to list it on the stock exchange, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
""Volkswagen is in the process of carving out Lamborghini, and to organise future supply and technology transfer deals,"" one of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Italian sportscar brand, which is currently a division of Audi, could be partially listed, with Volkswagen retaining a controlling stake, the first person familiar with the talks said.
There is no formal decision to divest Lamborghini, a second source said, adding that the timetable of any deal remained unclear. 
""This is a first step which gives VW the option to list the unit further down the line,"" the second source told Reuters.
A third source familiar with the discussions said the future of Bugatti, Lamborghini and Ducati was discussed during a supervisory board meeting last Friday. 
The possibilities for how to electrify the Lamborghini and Bugatti brands through partnerships and investors was discussed, the third source said. 
Bankers and potential cornerstone investors in an IPO have been approached by the carmaker, the sources said.
Volkswagen declined to comment.
Volkswagen Group's Chief Executive Herbert Diess on Wednesday said the carmaker will announce ""important steps"" about the company's future before the close of the year.
Volkswagen is reviewing what role its high-performance brands Lamborghini, Bugatti and Ducati will play within the multi-brand carmaker as part of broader quest for more economies of scale, senior executives told Reuters.
A global clampdown on combustion-engined vehicles has forced carmakers to accelerate development of low-emission technology for mainstream models, leaving Volkswagen managers struggling to find resources to electrify low volume sportscar models.

Sumitomo Chemical plans to provide $750 million, or 37.5% of the loan, to Rabigh Refining and Petrochemical Company (Petro Rabigh) (SE:2380) while Saudi Aramco will lend the rest, a spokesman at the Japanese chemical company said.
Sumitomo Chemical will use funds it raised by issuing hybrid bonds last year for its share and the loan will be provided soon, the spokesman said.
The Japanese company also said the financial completion guarantees it and Saudi Aramco provided for financing the Rabigh Phase 2 refinery and petrochemicals complex project had been terminated as of Sept. 30.
In 2015, Petro Rabigh signed project financing agreements with a syndicate of banks to receive an aggregate loan of $5.2 billion to cover 60% of the cost of the project in Saudi Arabia.
The parent companies each offered financial completion guarantees for 50% of the loan at the time, but they have been lifted as they have fulfilled the requirements for continuous performance and debt-repayment ability, Sumitomo said.
Petro Rabigh started the scheduled repayment of the debt in June 2019 and will continue to repay the balance of the loan out of cash flow generated from its operations, Sumitomo said in a statement.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 06:31AM ET</span>",How the year 2020 confounded Wall Street strategists,"By Megan Davies, Lawrence Delevingne and Koh Gui Qing
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's (N:BAC) strategists cut their year-end forecasts for the S&P 500 index twice this year, trailing the U.S. stock market as it plummeted in a coronavirus-induced panic. Then, as the market rallied past those revised targets in the ensuing months, the strategists followed by increasing their estimates.
Now, the bank’s researchers, led by head of U.S. equity strategy Savita Subramanian, say of their year-end price target for the index that the “range is wide.”
They currently are forecasting that the S&P 500 will end the year at 3,250 - a level that is just 50 points below what they had been predicting in January. But the index could end up somewhere between 2,200 and 4,000, depending on the course of the virus and the economy, wrote Subramanian and colleagues in a Sept. 3 note.
The S&P 500 on Wednesday closed at around 3,360, which is around 4% higher than where it started the year. 
The business of forecasting markets is fraught in the best of times. But the year 2020 has left many Wall Street strategists scrambling to make sense of the market, with forecasters surprised by the spectacular crash in late February and March and subsequent rally, according to their research notes and interviews.
As the coronavirus spread early this year, Wall Street researchers generally did not anticipate the scale of the disruption it would cause, according to data from market information provider Refinitiv and a Reuters review of S&P 500 earnings and price forecasts by the six largest U.S. banks by assets. That left them chasing the market decline with cuts in their S&P 500 earnings-per-share forecasts or price targets -- or both.
When the downturn in the S&P 500 reversed in late March, several strategists struggled to predict how far and long the rally could go, the review shows.
In a June email to Reuters, Subramanian defended her team’s record and highlighted the unprecedented nature of the crisis. “It is precisely during moments of uncertainty that we should strive to provide investors with our best guess as well as a range of scenarios around that framework,” she wrote.
She did not respond to requests for further comment last week. 
Bank of America declined to comment for this article. Of the other five largest banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) also declined. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), in a response to Reuters in May, said its forecasts are made with the best information it has available at the time and that it noted in research early in the year that a significant change in circumstances relating to coronavirus would alter its forecasts. In response to additional questions from Reuters in late September, the bank declined further comment.
“THEY MISSED IT”
The market’s rebound this year comes as the economy and public health continue to feel the devastating effects of the pandemic. The resulting disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street has investors trying to understand market behavior.
Wall Street research has long been a staple input in investment theses for all stripes of investors, but some say they are relying less on it now.
Rob Christian, co-head of research and investment management at Franklin Templeton’s hedge fund solutions group K2 Advisors, said while he pays attention to sell-side research, his group is putting “less weight on it as there are so many unknowns.”
""In general, they missed it as a group,” Christian said, referring to the pandemic. “We think it is really hard to predict anything now.”
Some of the strategists’ predictions have proved to be correct. JPMorgan’s chief U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, for example, did not cut his initial year-end S&P 500 target of 3,400 during the crash, arguing that the selloff was temporary and policy response would outlast the impact of COVID-19. The target was raised to 3,600 on September 11. 
But he also argued in a Feb. 27 research note that the pandemic would have “one-time earnings hits for companies.” Between then and Sept. 11, he reduced his 2020 S&P 500 earnings per share estimate to $136 from $174.
Lakos-Bujas did not respond to requests for comment.
NOT BULLISH ENOUGH 
Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson and his colleagues cut their year-end S&P 500 forecast the day the market hit its low on March 23. “The speed and intensity of this recession is worse than we expected,” they wrote at the time. But they also said they were “incrementally more bullish,” and by mid-April were raising their year-end S&P 500 target back up again.
It was not bullish enough, however. Early in September, Wilson wrote that investors were surprised by the “persistence and magnitude” of the rally over the past few months. ""While we were early to call for a new bull market back in late March, we have to admit we did not expect the S&P 500 to make its way to 3,600 by Labor Day,"" they wrote in a Sept. 8 note. ""We doubt many others did either.""
At Goldman Sachs, strategists led by David Kostin cut their S&P 500 2020 earnings per share target three times in 30 days and price target twice during the market downdraft of late February and March. When the market started to rally, they held fire even as the S&P 500 surpassed their year-end target of 3,000, and finally raised it to 3,600 in August.
“The building blocks of that price have shifted dramatically during the past six months,” they wrote on Aug. 14.
Wilson and Kostin did not respond to requests for comment.
""A WILD GUESS""
Indeed, economic whiplash from the coronavirus and unprecedented government intervention have made the traditional predictive tools unreliable, analysts and investors said.
Earnings per share estimates, a key input in S&P 500 price forecasts, initially lagged the market and then diverged from it as the shutdowns hurt business, Refintiv data shows, stretching stock valuations in ways that some strategists found hard to reconcile.
Between Jan. 1 and Feb. 19, when the market first peaked this year, Wall Street’s consensus estimate for the S&P 500’s 2020 earnings per share was reduced by 0.9%, according to the data.
Over the next month, as the markets fell sharply, the estimate fell 4.3%. Analysts kept cutting estimates as the economy tanked but the market rallied, reducing it by nearly 23% between March 23 and Aug. 25. The estimates have started to increase slightly since then.
Citigroup strategists led by Tobias Levkovich raised their target on Aug. 24 to 3,300 from 2,900, and said the index could hit 3,600 by mid-2021. But they expressed reservations: “We still think the market may be ahead of itself.”
Levkovich did not respond to requests for comment.
Some have decided to throw in the towel on trying to forecast the market.
Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at financial services firm Canaccord Genuity Group Inc (TO:CF), said it was impossible to arrive at a sensible number. Dwyer suspended his forecast in March, then reinstated it over the summer before withdrawing it on Aug. 31 as the S&P 500 kept rising beyond his target. 
“It's a wild guess,” said Dwyer.

Dwyer added that he believed the overall investment thesis he provides clients is more important “than a made-up target.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock exchanges have put New Jersey on notice: Pass a financial transaction tax and they will relocate their primary data centers, where billions of dollars of trades are executed daily - possibly to Chicago.
A move to the Windy City wouldn't just save millions in annual tax dollars. It could also help level the playing field for market participants by making lightning-fast price changes harder to exploit by high-speed traders and promote deeper liquidity, industry members said.
That's because all 16 U.S. stock exchanges have their disaster recovery sites in the same building at 350 East Cermak Road in Chicago, as opposed to their main sites, which currently reside in three data centers spread across a 50-mile swath of northern New Jersey.
In the electronic trading world, the physical distance a signal must travel is a key factor in how long it takes to get an order filled, and the race to get the best prices is one in which nanoseconds matter. 
Moving to the Chicago site would reduce the possibility for latency arbitrage, where firms detect a trade on one exchange and then use microwave or laser technology and sophisticated algorithms to race to the other exchanges, executing trades and booking profits before those exchanges can update their prices. 
""A lot of investments in fast infrastructure would become obsolete and a lot of trading strategies on that side would be eliminated,"" said Jack Miller, head of trading at Robert W. Baird & Co.
Reducing latency arbitrage would make it easier for market participants to complete trades at their desired price, said a senior exchange executive who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. That would encourage larger displayed trade sizes with tighter spreads between the price at which an asset is being offered and the price for which it is being sold, improving overall liquidity, the person added. 
""Having all exchanges in one geographic location would be healthier for liquidity in our markets,"" said another senior industry executive.
SHOT ACROSS THE BOW
The backup to the U.S. stock market is in an eight-story English gothic-style building just off Lake Michigan, in the shadow of Chicago's sprawling McCormick (NYSE:MKC) Place Convention Center, that hosts several data centers.
This week, Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) New York Stock Exchange unit is running the smallest of its five exchanges, NYSE Chicago, live from the location to show its readiness to move. Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) plans to do the same with its smallest exchange for a week in late October.
All 16 exchanges were also in Chicago this past weekend for an industry-wide exercise simulating a regular trading day, in part to show they could operate from their disaster recovery sites in an emergency. 
But the exchanges also wanted to send a message to New Jersey, which is considering a state tax of a quarter of a cent per financial transaction for firms that make more than 10,000 such transactions per year. 
""The tests are a first step toward demonstrating industry preparedness to move data centers out of New Jersey and protect millions of market participants across the U.S. from New Jersey's invasive proposed tax,"" said the Coalition to Prevent the Taxing of Retirement Savings.
The tax is under review by the state's Senate, Assembly and its governor, said Richard McGrath, a spokesperson for New Jersey's Senate president, Stephen Sweeney, who introduced one of two bills proposing the levy. 
The coalition represents exchange operators NYSE, Nasdaq, Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE), IEX Group and the Members Exchange, as well as financial firms TD Ameritrade (O:AMTD), UBS (S:UBSG),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial (O:VIRT) and data center operator Equinix (O:EQIX).

""They're basically firing a very strong shot across the bow of the people trying to impose a local transaction tax, by signaling, we can literally move everything out of state overnight,"" said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University.

There are hundreds of similar lawsuits pending after many insurers in Germany, including Allianz (DE:ALVG), refused to pay businesses for lockdown losses, arguing that while effects of other pandemics would have been insured, COVID-19 had not been named specifically in the terms and conditions.
Versicherungskammer Bayern has to pay out 1.01 million euros ($1.18 million) to the operator of the Augustinerkeller, one of the city's largest beer gardens, the Munich Regional Court ruled on Thursday.
The insurer said in a statement that it would appeal the ruling, while German insurance lobby group GDV said that the Munich ruling has no implications for other pending cases.
Elsewhere, in Britain, a markets regulator said on Wednesday it had failed to strike a deal with major insurers over prompt payouts to small businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic, dashing hopes that a Supreme Court appeal could be easily avoided.

485,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 05:52AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Bayer's Bitter Harvest,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The walking disaster that is Bayer (DE:BAYGN) stumbles from bad to worse.
This year the German pharma-to-pesticide conglomerate it has racked up tens of billions of euros of litigation costs in relation to cancers caused by Roundup, the weedkiller it inherited with its acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) two years ago.
It's now saying it expects to write almost 10 billion euros off the value of its crop sciences business, citing the damage from the pandemic.
It blamed “reduced growth expectations due to low commodity prices for major crops, intense competition in soy, and reduced biofuel consumption.”
The last part of that is important, because much of its revenue from biofuel comes from Brazil, whose economic damage from the pandemic has resulted in a sharp depreciation of the real.
That damage is not going to be a short-term blip, either: the company said it expects core earnings next year to fall from this year’s levels, meaning that it will be paying dividends at the lower end of its target range rather than at the upper end, as it had until last year.
The news caused Bayer stock to fall by over 10% to a nine-year low.
The stock has now lost two-thirds of its value from its peak posted in 2015. Most of that stems from the $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto that CEO Werner Baumann launched within four weeks of taking over as CE in 2016, convinced that being a ‘world leader’ in crop sciences would carry it to even greater heights.
Even at the time, that seemed a stretch: the value of Monsanto lay primarily in its genetically modified seed technology, which Bayer still can’t use freely across the EU and other important markets, for all that it is a money-spinner in the U.S. 
Baumann’s obsession with doing that deal – which consumed the board’s energy for another two years - blinded him and his board to the risks lurking in Roundup’s long and well-documented association with cancer. Those risks that had been held at bay by Monsanto’s legal team as long as the company remained independent. However, that dam ultimately broke and this summer, Bayer settled with tens of thousands of litigants for just under $11 billion.
As if that weren’t enough, the company - a would-be global leader in pharmaceuticals - has failed to make any meaningful capital out of the pandemic this year. Bayer has been conspicuous by its absence from the race to develop a vaccine for the Covid-19 virus: its biggest contribution to tackling the disease being the production of hydroxychloroquine, or HCQ. HCQ gained fame as the alternative Covid-19 treatment touted by President Donald Trump and others, despite not being recommended for that purpose by the Food and Drug Administration.
It looks like being a long way back, both for Baumann and Bayer."

LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (L:RR) plans to raise a total of 5 billion pounds ($6.5 billion), including 2 billion from shareholders, to cope with a ""worst case scenario"" as the coronavirus travel crisis crushes the British engine maker's cashflow. 
Airlines pay Rolls based on how many hours its engines fly in their larger jets and worries over a long-haul travel slump have knocked more than 80% off its shares this year, reducing its market value to just 2.5 billion pounds. 
Rolls, whose engines power the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 and Airbus 350, said in May it would cut 9,000 jobs as a result of the pandemic and its finances have come under intense scrutiny, which its chief executive said should end with Thursday's plan. 
""This is a comprehensive package which will take any liquidity questions off the table through this crisis,"" CEO Warren East told reporters on a call.
""We wanted this package to provide sufficient headroom even through our worst case scenario,"" East said.
A rights issue has been mooted as an option since July, but East said Rolls had to first demonstrate its restructuring plan was working before it could tap shareholders. 
""We couldn't really have done this much quicker,"" he said. 
Worries about its finances have prompted speculation of a government bailout of Rolls, which was nationalised in 1971 and later privatised. 
But Chief Financial Officer Stephen Daintith dismissed this, saying: ""That's not part of any of our plans"".
Britain's best known engineering firm is a key supplier to the country's military programmes, invests heavily in research and development and helps sustain smaller suppliers.
Rolls shares were down 8% to 119.6 pence at 0936 GMT, their lowest level since 2004, after it said that it would raise about 2 billion pounds through a 10 for 3 discounted rights issue. 
This was fully underwritten at 32 pence per share, it said, a 41% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price, which analysts calculated at 54.6 pence.
LONG HAUL AHEAD
East said that with these latest steps, the damage done to Rolls' balance sheet during the pandemic would be fixed, and it was now able to withstand a downturn which would involve 2021 flying levels at less than half last year's levels. 
But long distance flying remains in the doldrums with a second wave of the coronavirus across Europe and airlines cutting back already reduced schedules. 
Rolls said if long-haul travel did recover, then despite a cash outflow of 4 billion pounds this year it expected to return to positive cashflow during the second half of next year and was targeting 750 million pounds of free cashflow in 2022.
Shareholders will vote to approve the rights issue at a general meeting expected to be held on Oct. 27 and conditional upon its completion, additional debt options will open up. 
Rolls said it intended to begin a bond offering to raise at least 1 billion pounds, while UK Export Finance has indicated it was ready to support an extension of its 80% guarantee of Rolls' existing 2 billion pound five-year term loan and would support a loan amount increase of up to 1 billion pounds. 
Rolls also said it had commitments for a new two-year loan facility of 1 billion pounds.
Yields on Rolls' bonds edged off their highs, with a 500 million euro May 2024 note trading at 4.93%, well off this week's high of 5.25%. .
The new debt follows a plan announced in August to raise at least 2 billion pounds from the sale of Rolls' Spain-based turbine blade maker ITP Aero and other assets.

SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) is among airlines  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has approached to buy dozens of 737 MAX jets built for clients that have since scrapped their orders or gone bust, two people familiar with the matter said. 
As the 737 MAX edges closer to commercial flight after an 18-month grounding, Boeing is scrambling to find buyers for the so-called ""white tails"" - jets painted white, awaiting an airline livery, or whose color schemes need to be swapped. 
The 737 MAX's ban following two fatal crashes had already caused some carriers to walk and the number of unsold jets has soared as the COVID-19 pandemic decimated demand for air travel and new aircraft. 
Boeing has had discussions with Delta to take 40 of the 737 MAX ""white tails,"" the people said. 
Boeing and Delta declined to comment.
Of the top four U.S. airlines, Delta is the only one without the MAX. An order from the Atlanta-based carrier, whose relations with Boeing have been frayed in recent years, would be a surprise, market sources said.
Its $14.2 billion in commitments as of June 30 are primarily for Airbus (PA:AIR) jets. Battling the pandemic, Delta has parked jets and Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in July he was seeking to minimize deliveries over the next two years and did not intend to spend cash on aircraft ""for some period of time.""
Boeing's unsolicited offer illustrates one of the key challenges it faces once a modified MAX with safety upgrades receives approval to fly again.
These include restoring confidence in the plane, clearing a backlog of undelivered jets at a time when the industry is shrinking, and boosting production rates.
Boeing has built some 460 737 MAXs whose delivery has been frozen since the March 2019 grounding. Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts estimate that ties up $16 billion in inventory.

Customers have scrubbed more than 400 737 MAX orders this year after delays exceeded a year, triggering a walkaway clause, and analysts say dozens of these come from the stockpile of aircraft already built and waiting to be delivered.

LONDON (Reuters) - Renewed U.S. stimulus hopes lifted global markets into what is set to be an explosive fourth quarter on Thursday, though an all-day outage on Tokyo's Nikkei meant it wasn't exactly a smooth start.
Europe's STOXX 600 index (STOXX) and the euro (EUR=) were up 0.7% and 0.2% respectively before PMI economic data expected to show the region's ongoing gradual recovery from coronavirus slump. 
The dollar (=USD) was at a one-week low, as robust U.S. data on Wednesday and hopes for U.S. fiscal stimulus led investors to riskier currencies. 
With U.S. elections, the race for a COVID-19 vaccine and a no-deal Brexit deadline all looming, today was likely to be the calm before the storm, said Chris Dyer,  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV)'s director of global equity.
""What I have been saying is that the equity markets are likely to move violently sideways in the next few months,"" he said, though in 12 months the trajectory should be one of global recovery. 
Asian trading saw a 0.4% rise on MSCI's regional index (MIAPJ0000PUS), led by 1.1% and 1.5% gains in Australia and India. The day was dominated, though, by technical problems at Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world's third-largest stock market.
TSE President Koichiro Miyahara apologised at a news conference. He said the exchange decided to suspend the full day of trading because an early resumption could cause market confusion, but it planned to restart on Friday.
S&P500 futures (ESc1) rose 0.4%, extending Wall Street's rebound amid strong employment data and talk of progress on long-delayed COVID-19 relief legislation.
The pound  was 0.6% weaker, after British and European Union negotiators failed to close the gap on state aid in their latest round of talks, one of the key elements blocking post-Brexit trade ties.
British factory activity did grow for a fourth month in a row and coronavirus vaccine developments underpinned market sentiment, despite fast-rising infection rates in Europe and the United States.
The euro rose 0.1% to $1.1756 (EUR=) while the Australian dollar ticked up 0.2% to $0.7181 .

In commodities, oil prices were subdued after their 10% drop in September, with U.S. crude futures at $39.91 per barrel (CLc1) and Brent futures at $42.33 a barrel (LCOc1).

TOKYO (Reuters) - A hardware failure shut down trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday in the worst outage ever suffered by the world's third-largest stock market, which said it aimed to reopen on Friday.
The TSE's first full-day suspension since it began all-electronic trading in 1999 left investors searching in vain to buy back shares after the first U.S. presidential debate.
""I feel painfully responsible for all the confusion this incident has caused for investors and market participants,"" TSE Chief Executive Officer Koichiro Miyahara told a news briefing.
It also raises questions over the exchange's credibility just as Japan's new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga makes digitalisation a top priority and could dent Tokyo's hopes of attracting more banks and fund managers from Hong Kong amid concerns over a new security law imposed by China.
TSE said the outage was the result of a hardware problem at its ""Arrowhead"" trading system, and a subsequent failure to switch over to a backup device.
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said a quick fix was crucial to ensure trust in the roughly $6 trillion market, which ranks behind New York and Shanghai, data from the World Federation of Exchanges shows.
Many market participants had hoped to buy back stocks or increase holdings after an overnight rise on Wall Street, but were unable to do so, traders and analysts told Reuters.
Smaller regional bourses in Nagoya, Fukuoka and Sapporo were also forced to suspend trade because they use the TSE system, leaving derivatives-focused Osaka Exchange as the only equity market still running in Japan on Thursday
""There will be a huge surge in trading volumes around the U.S. presidential election, and this does raise some concerns about the TSE's ability to process a large increase in orders,"" Hideyuki Ishiguro, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities, said. 
Nikkei futures (JNIc1), which trade in Osaka, rose 0.56% on Thursday, in line with a rise in U.S. stocks. 
""We have to make sure this kind of situation is never repeated,"" Japan's top government spokesman, Katsunobu Kato, told a news briefing, calling it ""extremely regrettable"". 
While Tokyo has been eclipsed by Shanghai's market in recent years, it is still a global hub for foreign investors. The volume of shares traded on the TSE's main board (TOPX) was an average of 1.13 billion in the past 30 days. 
The TSE was prone to technical troubles in the past and was notorious for sluggish trading, although there have been fewer glitches since a new system was adopted in 2010. 
Fujitsu Ltd (T:6702), which developed the trading system, said it was investigating the problem. 

The Nikkei (N225) fell 1.5% on Wednesday, its biggest drop in two months, as an acrimonious debate between U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden highlighted the risk of an inconclusive outcome to the presidential election.

H&M, which over decades expanded its network of shops around the world, will aim to cut their number by a net 250 next year, representing 5% of its current network. 
H&M has been shutting more stores and opening fewer over the past couple of years as it adapts to the online shift that is driving more competition. The retailer said earlier this year its net number of stores would decline already in 2020. 
The company also said sales had continued to recover in September from the impact of the virus.
Chief Executive Helena Helmersson said: ""Although the challenges are far from over, we believe that the worst is behind us and we are well placed to come out of the crisis stronger.""
Rival fashion retail groups have also seen a recovery, with market leader  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, reporting a return to profit in its May-July quarter.
""Overall, Q3 is a better quarter than expected and we think H&M continued to manage well what they could directly influence,"" analysts at JPM said in a note. 
""We think that the market is still not fully appreciating the improved quality of H&M business model and infrastructure. We think instead that this set of results is further proof that H&M turnaround is still very much well on track."" 
H&M's shares were up 6.0% at 0804 GMT.
The Swedish company's pretax profit fell to 2.37 billion crowns ($265.6 million) in its fiscal third quarter, from a year-earlier 5.01 billion. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had on average seen a 2.03 billion crown profit.
H&M had already flagged that the profit would land at around 2 billion crowns helped by cost cuts as it recovered more quickly than expected. 
In the March-May quarter, the pandemic had pushed H&M into a steep loss, its first in many decades, as sales halved. 
H&M said its September sales were down 5% year-on-year in local currencies after they fell 19% in the three months through August.
Of more than 5,000 stores worldwide, 3% remain temporarily shut against around 80% at the height of lockdowns, it said. 
H&M, which has struggled for years to stop a rise in inventories, said those were unchanged from a year earlier. Markdowns increased half a percentage point, and H&M predicted they would grow 1-1.5% in the current quarter.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Autopilot has ranked sixth in 10 driver assistance systems evaluated in a European safety assessment, scoring low on its ability to keep drivers engaged.
The Tesla Model 3's Autopilot scored just 36 when assessed on its ability to maintain a driver's focus on the road. But it gained the highest marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, receiving an overall score of 131 and a rating of 'moderate'.
In contrast, the Mercedes GLE's system, which had the highest overall score of 174 and received the top rating of 'very good', received a score of 85 for driver engagement. Most other vehicles had scores of 70 or above for driver engagement.
The European New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), which worked with UK insurance group Thatcham Research, called the assessments the first consumer ratings specifically focused on driver assistance systems - technology that automates some tasks, including acceleration, braking and steering support.
Safety and insurance researchers have frequently warned of the risks of consumers overestimating the systems' abilities, a misconception increased by some automakers calling their products Autopilot, ProPilot or CoPilot.
Tesla's Autopilot has been criticized by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for allowing drivers to turn their attention from the road and U.S. regulators have investigated 15 crashes since 2016 involving Tesla vehicles equipped with Autopilot.
""Unfortunately, there are motorists that believe they can purchase a self-driving car today. This is a dangerous misconception that sees too much control handed to vehicles that are not ready to cope with all situations,"" said Matthew Avery, a Euro NCAP board member and research director at Thatcham Research.
In addition to the Mercedes GLE, the BMW 3-Series and the Audi (DE:VOWG_p) Q8, received the highest rating of 'very good' while two models, the  Renault  (PA:RENA) Clio and the Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) received the lowest rating of 'entry'.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded largely higher Thursday, boosted by renewed hope of a new U.S. stimulus package as well as some positive corporate news.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, weighed down by steep losses in  pharma and chemicals giant Bayer (DE:BAYGN), but the CAC 40 in France rose 0.7%, while the U.K.'s FTSE climbed 0.7%.
Signs of recovery in the European corporate sector have helped, typified by news from H&M (ST:HMb, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer.
The Swedish company said its sales continued to recover in September as it reported a fiscal third-quarter profit that was slightly higher than a preliminary reading and analyst expectations. Its stock rose 6.6%. 
Elsewhere, STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) rose 6.3% in Paris, as the chipmaker raised its 2020 revenue outlook, reporting  a “sharp” acceleration in demand for automotive product and microcontrollers chips. The news pulled German rival Infineon's (DE:IFXGn) stock 5.6% to a new all-time high.
Lamprell (LON:LAM) stock rose 6.4% after the oil-rig constructor said its underlying earnings returned to a profit in its fiscal first half despite the havoc wrought upon the oil market by the pandemic.
It wasn't all good news though, as Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) slumped 12% after it flagged big likely impairments at its crop sciences division, while Rolls-Royce  (LON:RR) fell 5.9% to its lowest in over 16 years after announcing plans to raise 2 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) through a deeply discounted rights issue.
Optimism for a new U.S. stimulus deal had earlier buoyed the market after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had made progress, and the House of Representatives duly postponed a vote on a $2.2 trillion Democratic coronavirus plan to allow more time for a bipartisan deal to come together.
“As coronavirus continues to linger and certain areas of the economy are still shut down, you need some sort of stimulus package,” said Andrea Roemhildt, investment manager at Aware Asset Management, in a Bloomberg report. “The market is just waiting for a signal that this might actually get done.”
Back in Europe, Germany's industrial sector is only improving slowly and the coronavirus crisis is still directly hitting the earnings of industrial firms, Germany's Ifo institute said on Thursday.
Ifo said its indicator for industrial firms' earnings was at -32 points in September, a slight improvement from -43 points in May, when Ifo last asked companies about their earnings.
The German manufacturing PMI also pointed to a gradual recovery, climbing to 56.4 in September, above 52.2 last month. Improvements in France and Spain allowed the Eurozone manufacturing PMI to its highest in two years, however.
Oil prices drifted lower Thursday, after climbing during the previous session on the back of U.S. stockpiles falling 2 million barrels last week, defying trade expectations for a build.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $39.83 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $41.93. Both contracts closed more than 3% lower on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,901.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1733.

Previously, the starting price for Model 3 sedans made in Tesla's Shanghai factory with a standard driving range was 271,550 yuan, after state purchase subsidies. 
Sources told Reuters that the standard range Model 3 sedans would now come with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries which are cheaper than the nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cells it used previously.
Tesla did not disclose what batteries the cheaper version uses.
The price for Model 3 vehicles with a longer range is now 309,900 yuan, down from 344,050 yuan.
Tesla started to deliver cars from the Shanghai factory in December, helping it save on shipping costs and tariffs for imported models. 
Tesla sold more than 11,000 vehicles, mostly Model 3s, in August in China, the world's biggest car market.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, launched a wealth management venture in Shanghai on Wednesday and plans to set up an outbound investment business in Beijing as China opens its doors wider to global asset managers.
The French company, which already owns a mutual fund venture in China, is capitalizing on a new round of financial opening by Beijing that also galvanized other global asset managers such as BlackRock.
""You don't have a single market in the world where you see global asset managers are positioning themselves so proactively, and so resourcefully,"" said Xiaofeng Zhong, Amundi's CEO for North Asia.
Wednesday's opening ceremony for Amundi BOC Wealth Management Co in Shanghai marks the birth of China's first foreign-controlled wealth management venture. The business is 55% owned by Amundi, and 45% held by a unit of Bank of China.
Last July, China allowed foreign asset managers to form majority-owned wealth management ventures with local banks, throwing open a market that fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors estimates will more than double to 57 trillion yuan ($8.37 trillion) in a decade.
""Just following the natural trend is creating a lot of favorable wind,"" said Julien Fontaine, Amundi's Head of Partnerships.
The new venture, which marries Amundi's proprietary portfolio management system and risk-management expertise with Bank of China's nationwide networks and huge client base, aims to launch its first product at the end of the year.
U.S. asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) last month won Chinese regulatory approval to set up a wealth management venture with Temasek Holdings and China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF).
Amundi has secured a quota of $300 million under China's outbound investment scheme QDLP, and will set up a subsidiary in Beijing to help Chinese invest abroad.
Amundi's Zhong said Chinese banks need foreign help to grow their investment capability amid structural reform of the asset management industry.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - SoftBank-backed used-car platform Kavak has become Mexico's first tech ""unicorn"" after reaching a $1.15 billion valuation in its latest funding round last month, Chief Executive Carlos Garcia told Reuters.
The Mexico City-based startup has raised over $400 million in total funding since its founding four years ago, with Japan's SoftBank, Hong Kong's DST Global and U.S.-based Greenoaks Capital leading the recent round, Garcia said in an interview on Wednesday.
The company is SoftBank's most recent Latin American investment to become a unicorn - lingo for tech startups valued at more than $1 billion - after delivery app Loggi and gym membership app Gympass, both from Brazil, and Colombian delivery app Rappi.
Japanese tech investor Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) last year vowed to deploy $5 billion in the region, which Mexican investors praised as a potential game changer for young companies that struggle to fundraise locally.
""It's really humbling for us to be the first Mexican unicorn. It's something really important for the ecosystem in Latin America, and especially Mexico,"" Garcia, 37, said.
Kavak, an online platform for buying and selling secondhand cars with operations in Mexico and Argentina, is laying plans to launch in Brazil early next year, Garcia said.
Kavak entered Argentina in August through its merger with used-car platform Checkars.
After building the business gradually in Mexico, Garcia said he aims to scale up faster in Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, with plans to hire 500 people within a year. Kavak employs some 800 people in Mexico and Argentina, a workforce that Garcia says will nearly double next year.
Despite the hit of the coronavirus crisis, Garcia said traffic has recovered to pre-pandemic levels as shoppers become more comfortable with e-commerce and seek alternatives to public transportation.
He expects Kavak to turn a profit in the next couple of years, and going public is in his sights, too.

""A route to do an IPO is in our plans... probably in the next two to three years we'd think about doing that,"" he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Vanguard Group Inc said on Wednesday it will close most of its business managing money for institutional investors and large pension funds in Australia and New Zealand, and focus on serving retail clients. 
The U.S. investments giant, which has roughly A$164 billion ($118 billion) in assets under management in Australia, will stop offering customised products called segregated mandated accounts (SMA) to large institutional investors. 
The exit comes as Australia's pension funds, which make up the world's third-largest pool of pension assets, have moved towards managing a larger portion of their investments internally to lower costs. This has intensified competition for investment mandates and forced the closures of several funds.
The Pennsylvania-headquartered manager will continue to offer some investment products that are ""pooled"" rather than customised, a spokeswoman said in an email. 
It will work with existing SMA clients in Australia and New Zealand to ensure a smooth transition that is expected to take between 12 and 24 months, she added.
Vanguard declined to disclose the value of the assets managed in those SMAs.
In April, Vanguard launched an Australian platform for retail investors providing access to a range of its managed funds, listed ETFs and shares. It has also registered a superannuation product with the regulator, which hasn't launched yet.

Vanguard said in August will close its Hong Kong and Japan operations and cut jobs across both locations as it shifts its Asian headquarters to Shanghai.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Thursday, boosted by renewed hope of a new U.S. stimulus package to help the world’s largest economy recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.9% higher, CAC 40 futures in France were up 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%. 
Optimism for a new deal flooded the market Wednesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had made progress, and the House of Representatives duly postponed a vote on a $2.2 trillion Democratic coronavirus plan to allow more time for a bipartisan deal to come together.
White House chief of staff Mark Meadows followed by outlining a new stimulus proposal worth over $1.5 trillion, still short of the level the Democrats have been seeking but markets have welcomed the fact that the two sides are talking after weeks of inactivity.
“As coronavirus continues to linger and certain areas of the economy are still shut down, you need some sort of stimulus package,” said Andrea Roemhildt, investment manager at Aware Asset Management, in a Bloomberg report. “The market is just waiting for a signal that this might actually get done.”
Back in Europe, Germany's industrial sector is only improving slowly and the coronavirus crisis is still directly hitting the earnings of industrial firms, Germany's Ifo institute said on Thursday.
Ifo said its indicator for industrial firms' earnings was at -32 points in September, a slight improvement from -43 points in May, when Ifo last asked companies about their earnings.
The release of German manufacturing PMI data later in the session will be keenly awaited, along with eurozone unemployment and PPI data, while the EU leaders also start a summit.
In corporate news, Veolia Environnement (PA:VIE) will be in focus after it agreed late Wednesday to extend its improved offer to buy a 29.9% stake in waste-management company Suez (OTC:SZSAY) from Engie (PA:ENGIE) to Oct. 5. 
U.K. engineering giant Rolls-Royce (LON:RR), which has set a series of 52-week lows in recent days, has announced plans to raise 2 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) through a deeply discounted rights issue.

TSE said it does not know when the issue will be resolved. Bourses in Nagoya, Fukuoka and Sapporo, which use the TSE's system, also suspended trading. The derivative-focused Osaka Exchange is not affected.
A statement from the TSE gave no further details.
Nikkei futures (JNIc1), which trade in Osaka, were last up 0.56%, in line with a rise in U.S. stocks overnight.
The Nikkei (N225) fell 1.5% on Wednesday, its biggest decline in two months, as an acrimonious debate between U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden increased concerns about an indecisive outcome from the presidential election in November.
""The timing is really just bad,"" Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex in Tokyo, said about the trading halt, adding many market participants were hoping to buy back their stocks or increase their holdings following an overnight rise on Wall Street.
""As expected, U.S. stocks were unaffected by the U.S. presidential election, but gained instead on stimulus hopes. And that could have prompted a surge in stocks' buybacks in early Japanese market. But the market was robbed of that chance.""
The TSE had been prone to system troubles in the past and was notorious for sluggish trading, but problems have been relatively rare since it expanded its capability with the introduction of a new system in 2010. 
The TSE had suspended trading in October 2018 due to problems with its trading system.

In 2006, news of an accounting scandal at the then popular internet firm Livedoor Co sparked a massive sell-off. Unable to handle the rush of orders from panicked investors, the TSE had to curtail trading hours for three months.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 11:00PM ET</span>","'Poking the bear': Regional airline Rex using downturn to challenge Qantas, Virgin","By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) - As Virgin Australia shrinks to survive the pandemic, tiny Regional Express Holdings Ltd (Rex) (AX:REX) is picking up some of its larger rival's planes and staff on the cheap - and attracting investors who see profit in the high-stakes plan.
A  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 leasing deal announced on Wednesday is the latest step in Rex's gamble to take on Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and Virgin starting with Sydney-Melbourne, the world's fifth-busiest domestic route before the pandemic. 
The move by Rex, until now an operator of ageing 30-36 seat turboprops, is a rare example of an airline expanding into new markets as the pandemic cripples air travel.
Shares in Rex and charter operator Alliance Aviation Services Ltd (AX:AQZ) have risen this year as investors look for counter-cyclical growth stories. Rex's shares reached a one-year high on Thursday.
Graphic - Regional carriers Regional Express and Alliance Aviation are outperforming larger peers as they undertake counter-cyclical expansion plans: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/bdwvkkyqqvm/AustraliaRegionalAviation.png 
Rex entered the pandemic with a licence, little debt, a paid-off fleet and no planes on order. Last week it signed a term sheet with Asian investment firm PAG Asia Capital for up to A$150 million ($106.23 million) of convertible notes to pay for service to big cities, funds Rex Deputy Chairman John Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) told Reuters will be kept separate from its government-subsidised regional operations.
But even with those advantages and the ability to sign cut-rate contracts, analysts say Rex faces formidable odds in competing against larger players. Those well-established brands have strong loyalty programmes, more frequent flights and fancier airport lounges, and will scramble to win back share as demand recovers.
""They are really poking the bear here,"" Rico Merkert, a professor of transport at the University of Sydney Business School, said of Rex. ""Qantas will do everything they can to defend their market and rightly so. It is about survival.""
Before the pandemic hit, Qantas' Sydney-Melbourne route was the second-biggest revenue generator for an airline globally, contributing $861 million in 2018, according to data firm OAG, ranking behind only British Airways' London-New York route.
Under new owner Bain Capital, Virgin is scaling back on regional routes to concentrate on major ones, including Sydney-Melbourne.
""Although Qantas-branded flights probably won't be priced much lower, Jetstar and Virgin will slash fares in an attempt to kill Rex's jet operation in the cradle,"" said Judson Rollins (NYSE:ROL), managing partner of Auckland-based consultancy Propel Aviation Solutions. ""But Rex will have a significant cost advantage over even Jetstar.""
TOUGH MARKET
Australia is the worst performer among the world's major domestic markets, according to the International Air Transport Association, largely because of state border shutdowns meant to keep a lid on COVID-19. 
Passenger numbers were down 91.5% in August compared with last year, and capacity is running at only 20% of normal, though the federal government expects more state borders to open by Christmas.
Qantas and Virgin have halted all international flying and are itching to put more planes in the domestic market to cover financing costs and stand up staff now on government benefits.
Rex's Sharp said that despite its size, his airline would have a cost advantage because it did not have surplus aircraft or staff.
""We'll grow as the market grows,"" he said. ""We think our customers will be leisure travellers and we believe we will attract small businesses and we will attract government travellers on the best price of the day.""
Rex on Wednesday announced deals to lease six 737s once flown by Virgin, and it has begun advertising for experienced crew members, aiming to keep employee costs about 10% lower than Jetstar.
Brendan Sobie, a Singapore-based independent aviation analyst, said that the way forward for Rex was not easy but that it had a shot at surmounting the challenges.

""I think there are a lot of things going for it – their timing, their cost structure and the fact that they are coming in as a new entrant on trunk routes with a different approach,"" he said.

In a letter to the leaders of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, they said the coronavirus pandemic had dealt a devastating blow to movie theaters and that without funds ""theaters may not survive the impact of the pandemic.""
The letter was signed by more than 70 directors and producers along with the National Association of Theater Owners, the Directors Guild of America and the Motion Picture Association.
The pandemic forced movie theaters to close their doors in mid-March. Big chains including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and Cineworld Plc's Regal Cinemas have reopened, with reduced capacity, in many U.S. cities, but not in the biggest markets of Los Angeles and New York City. 
Efforts to get Americans back into theaters have proved disappointing, and Hollywood studios have delayed the release of big movies like ""Black Widow"" and ""Top Gun: Maverick"" to 2021.
The letter said that 69% of small and mid-sized movie theater companies will be forced to file for bankruptcy or close permanently unless help is forthcoming.
""Cinemas are an essential industry that represent the best that American talent and creativity have to offer. But now we fear for their future,"" the letter said.
Others signing the letter included James Bond movie producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, ""Wonder Woman"" director Patty Jenkins, and action movie director-producer Michael Bay.

They asked Congress to redirect unspent funds from the coronavirus aid package passed earlier this year, or enact new proposals that would help movie theaters weather the pandemic.

Bloomberg News, which first reported about the layoffs, said the bank was looking to cut about 400 jobs, or roughly 1% of its workforce, citing people familiar with the matter.
""At the outbreak of the pandemic, the firm announced that it would suspend any job reductions. The firm has made a decision to move forward with a modest number of layoffs,"" a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said.
Many of the cuts in the current round are tied to back-office roles that had been folded into bigger money-making divisions as part of an earlier reorganization, according to the Bloomberg report Goldman Sachs’ annual cull has long set it apart from Wall Street rivals, which tend to make mass layoffs periodically. 
In January, Goldman said it was aiming for a 60% efficiency ratio over the next three years, compared with 68% in 2019. A lower efficiency ratio means a bank is better at managing costs relative to revenue.
Separately, the U.S. Federal Reserve will curb big bank capital distributions through the end of the year, meaning the likes of JPMorgan (N:JPM), Citi (N:C),  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and Bank of America (N:BAC) will be barred from share buybacks and will have to cap dividends into the new year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed out a second consecutive quarter with sharp gains on Wednesday, but risks remain for stocks because the looming U.S. presidential election and mounting coronavirus cases could make investors cautious.
The S&P 500 rose 8.5% for the third quarter, although it fell 3.9% in September in its first monthly decline since March, when the coronavirus began its rapid spread across the United States. 
Still, the benchmark index's quarterly gain extended its nearly 20% rise in the second quarter, for its biggest two-quarter jump since 2009.
Hopes for an economic recovery and historic stimulus from Washington and the Federal Reserve fueled the U.S. stock market's rally following the coronavirus-driven crash in March. But stocks have struggled since the market peaked on Sept. 2, with September marked by a sell-off in heavyweight technology-related shares.
""Looking forward, what's going to be absolutely critical as we enter the colder months and traditional flu season is, Are we going to see a significant spike in cases?"" said Oliver Pursche, president and chief investment officer of Bronson Meadows Capital Management in Fairfield, Connecticut.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 11% in the third quarter, and registered its biggest two-quarter increase since 2000. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 7.6% for the quarter just ended.

MATERIALS LEAD IN SEPTEMBER
Strategists said many risks remain for stocks, including the pandemic, the Nov. 3 presidential election and the Supreme Court vacancy following Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. Investors have worried that the election results will be uncertain or possibly not accepted.
""People are going into the end of the quarter with a bit of a wary, uncertain feeling,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. ""We not only have a still-unstable COVID pandemic situation, you have the uncertainty of the election.""
The S&P 500 materials sector outperformed and led gains among S&P sectors for September, while the most heavily weighted sector, technology, was among the weakest sectors for the month.
For the quarter, consumer discretionary, materials and industrials were top performers along with technology, while energy was the only declining sector.

GROWTH WINS OVER VALUE FOR QUARTER
Investors have struggled to figure out where to invest, with many mega-cap tech stocks trading well above their long-term price-to-earnings ratios.
Value stocks continued a trend of underperforming growth names for the quarter. The Russell 1000 growth index was up about 13% for the period, while the Russell 1000 value index was up about 5%.

Stocks continued to look more attractive compared with bonds.
After tightening for most of the quarter, the spread between the S&P 500 dividend yield and the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield began to widen in the last month.
""The 'value stocks' - which is where the dividends are - have been underperforming,"" Pursche said. ""When you have underperformance in a sector that provides yields... you're making it more attractive.""

SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Chief Steve Dickson conducted a nearly two-hour evaluation flight at the controls of a Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX on Wednesday, a milestone for the jet to win approval to resume flying after two fatal crashes.
Dickson, a former military and commercial pilot, and other FAA and Boeing pilots landed shortly before 11 a.m. local time (1800 GMT) at King County International Airport - also known as Boeing Field - in the Seattle area. 
""I like what I saw on the flight,"" Dickson told a news conference afterwards, but said he was not ready to give the jet a clean bill of health, with FAA reviews still ongoing. 
""We are not to the point yet where we have completed the process,"" Dickson said.
The flight was a key part of the U.S. planemaker's long-delayed quest to persuade the FAA to lift a March 2019 grounding order triggered by 737 MAX crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people within a five-month period.
The accidents plunged Boeing into its worst-ever crisis, strained its relationship with the FAA, threw into question the U.S. regulator's position as the standard-bearer for global aviation safety and prompted bipartisan calls in Congress to overhaul how the FAA certifies new airplanes.
Critics, including a crash victim's father, said the flight amounted to a publicity stunt and demanded the FAA release test data and other information so outside experts can make their own assessments. 
""Without that secret data, independent experts and the public cannot confirm whether the aircraft is safe,"" said Michael Stumo, whose daughter was among the 157 people killed in the second 737 MAX crash, in Ethiopia.
Dickson said he completed new proposed pilot training requirements, a simulator session, and then conducted midair tests of 737 MAX design and operating changes intended to prevent disasters similar to the two crashes.
In both accidents, a flawed control system known as MCAS, triggered by faulty data from a single airflow sensor, repeatedly and forcefully pushed down the jet's nose as pilots struggled to intervene.
If Dickson's flight and broader reviews go well, the FAA is seen as likely to lift its U.S. grounding order in November, sources said on Wednesday, putting the MAX on a path to resume commercial service potentially before year-end.
That timeline jibes with comments last week from Dickson's counterpart in Europe, Patrick Ky. He said the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) expects to lift its technical ban ""not long"" after the FAA, but national operational clearances needed for individual airlines to resume flying could take longer.

Separately, the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on Wednesday unanimously approved bipartisan legislation to reform the FAA's aircraft certification process in the wake of the 737 MAX crashes.

508,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive: FDA widens U.S. safety inquiry into AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine - sources,"By Marisa Taylor and Dan Levine
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc's COVID-19 vaccine study and will look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources familiar with the details told Reuters.
AstraZeneca's large, late-stage U.S. trial has remained on hold since Sept. 6, after a study participant in Britain fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis. 
The widened scope of the FDA probe raises the likelihood of additional delays for what has been one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development. The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.
Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide. 
The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Johnson & Johnson.
Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.
The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.
""It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,"" said one of the sources.
Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.
The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: ""We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.""
VIRAL VECTOR
All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.
While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target. 
Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.
In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.
The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.
The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.
AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.
Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.
The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear. 
""Safety is likely to have been a major reason"" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.

AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will curb big bank capital distributions through the end of the year, meaning the likes of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co,  Citigroup  Inc. (N:C),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and Bank of America Corp. (N:BAC)will be barred from share buy backs and will have to cap dividends.
The central bank announced it would extend its existing policy of limiting capital payouts for banks with at least $100 billion in assets, to ensure lenders have enough capital to weather the economic strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The restrictions, which apply to 34 banks, including the U.S. operations of several large foreign firms, were extended ""due to the continued economic uncertainty from the coronavirus response,"" the Fed said. 
The Fed announced in June it was taking the unprecedented step of limiting bank payouts after finding lenders faced significant capital losses under a pandemic-informed stress test. Under the new policy, banks cannot pay higher dividends than they did in the second quarter, and payments cannot exceed a firm's average net income over the last four quarters.
Large banks will face a second pandemic Fed stress test later this year, with results to be announced by the end of 2020. The Fed found in its original stress test that lenders could endure as much as $700 billion in loan losses under a severe economic downturn caused by the outbreak. 

Banks were expected to stay afloat amid those losses, but several skirted close to violating minimum capital levels required by regulators, the Fed said at the time.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hopes for another $25 billion in airline aid before midnight Wednesday - the deadline for mass furloughs of airline employees - dimmed after Washington leaders said there was still more work to do on a broad coronavirus relief package. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans and Democrats were still very far apart on how much to spend and called House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's $2.2 trillion proposal ""outlandish.""
The deadlock seemed to close the door on a deal before airline furloughs set to start on Thursday, unless airlines decide to postpone them. 
Earlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged U.S. airlines to delay the furloughs if a bipartisan deal on a broad coronavirus relief package was in sight, something American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Chief Executive Doug Parker said he would consider if there was a ""clear and concrete path"" on a bill.
If not, 19,000 American Airlines workers will be furloughed on Thursday, and at least another 12,000 at United Airlines.
U.S. airlines have been pleading for another $25 billion in payroll support to protect jobs for another six months once the current package, which banned furloughs, expires at midnight.
Nick Calio, who heads the airline trade group Airlines for America, said the industry was still pursuing all potential avenues for new assistance as time runs short.
""People keep talking, but we need results,"" Calio told Reuters. ""We are hopeful but not confident about them reaching a deal on a larger bill.""
Mnuchin told CNBC he planned to talk to chief executives of airlines later on Wednesday.
U.S. airline shares gave up earlier gains in late afternoon trading. (DJUSAR) 
Weeks of intense airline lobbying has won over many but not all Washington lawmakers, while also drawing attention to the plight of other pandemic-hit industries as the crisis persists.
U.S. airline officials said earlier this week there were no plans in place to halt the furloughs without aid by Oct. 1, and it was unclear what would happen if a deal passes afterwards.
Thousands of employees have already been instructed to return their badges. 
Airlines, which were awarded a separate $25 billion in federal loans under a first coronavirus relief bill in March and have also tapped capital markets to shore up liquidity, are operating about half their 2019 flying schedules and suffering a 68% decline in passenger volumes. [L1N2GR014]
The impact of the coronavirus on travel may cost as many as 46 million jobs globally, according to projections published on Wednesday by Air Transport Action Group (ATAG).
Airlines have argued they need trained employees to help drive an economic recovery as the crisis subsides. American Airlines' Parker told CNN he believed one more round of aid would be sufficient.
American Airlines flight attendant Allie Malis was among workers at risk of furlough who planned to keep pressing lawmakers on Wednesday. 

""I've poured every ounce of my energy into passing this extension,"" she said. ""I don't have a Plan B.""

(Reuters) -  NextEra Energy Inc  (N:NEE) Chief Executive James Robo said on Wednesday that the largest U.S. power utility would not embark on a hostile takeover, a day after reports surfaced it had made an approach to  Duke Energy  Corp (N:DUK) in what would be the sector's biggest-ever acquisition. 
Duke Energy, which has a market capitalization of $65 billion, has rebuffed NextEra's acquisition interest, according to a person familiar with the matter who confirmed a Wall Street Journal report about the approach that was published on Tuesday. Details of the bid could not be learned.
Speaking at a Wolfe Research conference on Wednesday, Robo declined to comment specifically on NextEra's approach to Duke, but said that major acquisitions in his industry could only happen if the companies involved worked co-operatively.
""State regulators are really important to getting approvals on getting things done, and you can't do anything that isn't mutual in this industry,"" Robo said.
A spokesman for Duke Energy declined to comment. Its shares were trading up 7.5% at $88.57 on Wednesday. NextEra shares were down 1.7% at $278.12, giving it a market capitalization of $136 billion.
NextEra owns two electric companies in Florida serving more than 5.5 million customers. It is also the world's largest generator of renewable energy from wind and sun. 
Duke Energy operates in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, serving more than 7.7 million households. All six states would need to sign off on any acquisition of the company, and federal utilities regulators would also need to assent.
""While we have no doubt NextEra would be interested in Duke, securing state regulatory approval could be challenging, particularly in the Carolinas which represent over 60% of Duke's regulated earnings base,"" Jonathan Arnold, principal at Vertical Research Partners, wrote in a note on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A member of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday called for new scrutiny of undersea cables that transmit nearly all the world's internet data traffic.
""We must take a closer look at cables with landing locations in adversary countries,"" FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said Wednesday at a commission meeting. ""This includes the four existing submarine cables connecting the US and China, most of which are partially owned by Chinese state-owned companies.""
The United States has repeatedly expressed concerns about China’s role in handling network traffic and potential for espionage. Around 300 subsea cables form the backbone of the internet, carrying 99% of the world’s data traffic.
Starks said the FCC ""must ensure that adversary countries and other hostile actors can’t tamper with, block, or intercept the communications they carry.""
In April, the FCC approved Alphabet Inc unit Google's (O:GOOGL) request to use part of an U.S.-Asia undersea telecommunications cable, but not to Hong Kong, after U.S. agencies raised national security concerns.
Google agreed to operate a portion of the 8,000-mile Pacific Light Cable Network System between the United States and Taiwan, but not Hong Kong. Google and Facebook (O:FB) helped pay for construction of the completed link but U.S. regulators blocked its use.
The companies in August abandoned the proposal to use the Hong Kong portion. A Facebook affiliate has sought FCC approval to use a portion of the cable connecting the Philippines and United States.
Starks noted that on Sept 10, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and China Mobile (HK:0941) withdrew their application to connect San Francisco and Hong Kong as part of the Bay to Bay Express Cable System.
The companies told the FCC they would work to secure a license ""for a reconfigured system"" acceptable to the Trump administration.
The FCC in April denied China Mobile (NYSE:CHL)'s application to operate in the United States. ""The concerns aren’t just about the landing sites of the cables but who owns and operates them,"" Starks added.

The FCC said in April it might shut down U.S. operations of three state-controlled Chinese telecommunications companies -- China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Americas, China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Americas, Pacific Networks Corp and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet (USA) LLC. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai declined to say Wednesday when the commission may take action.

Investing.com – The Dow snapped a five-month winning streak despite closing higher Wednesday, amid uncertainty over further stimulus after U.S. lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a deal but pledged to continue talks. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.20% or 329 points after rising about 570 points intraday. The S&P 500 was up 0.83%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.74%.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin touted progress on stimulus talks, though said he had yet to reach an agreement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a coronavirus aid package. The House expected to vote on the $2.2 trillion package on Wednesday.  Ahead of his meeting with Pelosi, Mnuchin told CNBC he was ""hopeful"" about getting a deal done.
The news cooled some investor optimism on stocks tied to the progress of the economy with airlines, cruise operators and banks cutting gains.  Airlines stand to lose big if Congress fails to reach an agreement on the proposed $2.2 trillion aid package that includes funds for the industry as well as unemployment benefits, direct payments to households and small business loans.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) rose more than 1%, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) was up 0.5% and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH) was up  3%.

Investing.com -- Stocks surged on Wednesday on optimism over another round of stimulus from Washington even though late word was not hopeful.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to achieve a deal. They did say they would continue talks, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the two sides were ""far apart.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had gained more than 500 points earlier in the trading session, gave back only some those gains, closing up 329 or 1.2%, capping an ugly month for the markets, on the last day of the quarter.
The fate of the stimulus package was the focus for investors, as they seemed to shrug off fears about growing Covid-19 cases around the United States, even in areas like New York. A nasty debate between the two presidential candidates on Tuesday also failed to sway markets.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Will drinks and snacks do better than towels and linens?
Reports from a bunch of companies could show whether shopping for towels and sheets was more popular than at-home drinking and snacking over the last few months.
Earnings are due out from home goods retailer  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY), which is expected to report a loss of 32 cents a share on $2.6 billion revenue, but several other retailers have beaten expectations.
Meanwhile wine and spirits maker Constellation Brands Inc Class A (NYSE:STZ) is expected to report earnings of $2.50 a share on $2.2 billion revenue, and soda and snack maker PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) is expected to report EPS of $1.48 on $17.2 billion in revenue.
2. Jobs, jobs, jobs
The weekly unemployment measurements come out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). The data will compared to Wednesday's better than expected private payroll gains reported by ADP and comes a day before the last official government data on jobs before the general election.

Analysts tracked by Investing.com predict income will fall 2.4% from the prior month while spending is expected to rise 0.7%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors including Steven Schwarzman, Mary Callahan Erdoes and Barry Sternlicht are bracing for more market volatility as the U.S presidential vote nears but see opportunities to make money in commercial real estate and financial companies.
The S&P 500 index has slipped almost 5% this month after recovering for months amid the economic crisis sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, and some speakers at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference on Wednesday forecast bigger market swings ahead.
""I see a pretty significant correction among high-flying (technology) stocks if the Democrats win,"" said real estate investor Barry Sternlicht who runs Starwood Capital Group.
""Short term it will be bad for equities,"" he forecast, citing presidential hopeful Joe Biden's plan to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% as a negative factor.
For Mary Callahan Erdoes, chief executive of  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM)'s asset and wealth management business, risks stretch beyond the U.S. election to include the COVID-19 crisis and fallout of Britain leaving the European Union. ""Is my portfolio right-sized for another bout of volatility?,"" she urged investors to ask themselves.
On the other hand, investors also expressed optimism that a virus vaccine would arrive and that the economy is recovering.
Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) CEO Stephen Schwarzman said commercial real estate, especially warehouses and laboratory space, has been a focus while his firm largely exited hotel and retail real estate investments. ""We are the largest owner or second largest owner in the world in health care office buildings, research labs. That business is doing great. Everyone's paying their rent,"" Schwarzman said.
John Vaske, head of the Americas at Singaporean investment giant Temasek, said rising affluence and longer lifespans had already made investments in fintech and payments groups more attractive. Those trends are being accelerated by the pandemic.
Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, said he still likes the $45 billion commitment to SoftBank Group's Vision Fund, the world's biggest technology focused venture capital fund. ""It's not the greatest performance, but still it's not down, which is something really good especially with this kind of investment,"" he said.
Activist investor Jeff Ubben, who recently left ValueAct Capital to found impact investing firm Inclusive Capital, backed Nikola Motor Company, where he sits on the board, after the electric truck company came under fire from a short seller and its founder exited.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>",Five ways the U.S. elections could affect equity markets,"By David Randall
(Reuters) - The upcoming U.S. presidential election will likely be an important catalyst for stock market moves in coming months as investors gauge the probabilities of a contested vote and the policies a potential winner would enact. 
Democratic nominee Joe Biden is ahead in national polls and in betting markets the former vice president is favored to win with an average 59% likelihood, according to RealClearPolitics. 
Here are five issues in Washington that investors say will be important for asset prices.
1) An orderly election 
Republican President Donald Trump has questioned the validity of mail-in votes, raising concerns that the results of one or more states will be decided in the courts. 
Trump again declined to commit to accepting the results during Tuesday night's first presidential debate, repeating his unfounded complaint that mail-in ballots would lead to election fraud. That has bolstered the case for investor betting on markets staying volatile well after Election Day on Nov. 3.
""People would like to have certainty as soon as possible which way it's going to move forward,"" said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. 
A report from BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) estimated the chances of a contested election result stand at between 7% and 10%, while assigning only a 1% chance to the possibility of a constitutional crisis that the Supreme Court is unable to avert. 
2) Tax rates
Fears of rising tax rates under a Biden administration could hit the large technology stocks that have led the market rally this year if investors seek to book gains before the increase takes place, said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV). 
At the same time, companies could look to issue special onetime dividends to return cash to shareholders before income taxes rise. 
""In a normal year you see tax-loss harvesting. This might be a year of tax-gain harvesting,"" Perkin said. 
Hedge fund manager J. Daniel Plants, who runs Voce Capital Management, expressed concern that higher tax rates would squash economic growth and eat into companies' after-tax net income, making ""an already expensive market appear even pricier.""
""This is simply not the time to engage in such experiments with the economy reeling and the outlook so uncertain,"" he said. 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) take a more sanguine view, forecasting that Biden’s plan would likely shave just 4% from the S&P 500's expected earnings by 2024. 
3) U.S.-China tensions 
A second Trump term would likely see the president continue confronting China through higher tariffs and restrictions on trade and investment, analysts at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics wrote.
They assign a 40% probability to Biden gaining the presidency with a Republican Senate and Democratic House, compared with a 35% chance of Trump getting re-elected with the same combination.
Some investors believe Biden's policies toward China are unlikely to substantially differ from Trump's. 
""There's a perception that Biden would be better on China, but he could just be different. You wouldn't have the tweets (from Trump), but you would have a Western coalition trying to manage the rise of China,"" said Dwek.
4) Coronavirus response
U.S. deaths linked to the coronavirus are now above 206,000, by far the highest number of any country, according to a Reuters tally.
Trump has said that a vaccine against the virus would be ready in record time, perhaps before the election, raising questions about whether political pressure might result in the deployment of a vaccine before it is safe.
Analysts at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) put the chances of a coronavirus treatment or vaccine coming sometime in the next three months at around 15%, while reducing the probability of renewed lockdowns to 20% from 30%.
5) Additional fiscal stimulus
The recent death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has dimmed hopes of Congress passing an economic stimulus bill before the November election, another factor that has weighed on stocks during a volatile September.

Moody's Analytics believes the economy would return to full employment in the second half of 2022 under Biden compared to the first half of 2024 during a second Trump term, largely because of the challenger's more expansive fiscal policies.

RIO DE JANEIRO/LONDON (Reuters) - Liquefied natural gas firm  Hygo Energy Transition Ltd  (O:HYGO) has postponed its planned New York initial public offering for several weeks and may scrap the listing entirely after its CEO was named in the early stages of a corruption investigation in Brazil, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Eduardo Antonello, who has not been formally accused by Brazilian authorities, stepped down from his role as chief executive of Hygo on Tuesday to defend himself in the probe, Antonello's defense and Hygo said in e-mails. It is unclear if the move was temporary or not.
No charges have been made against Antonello and he has denied any wrongdoing.
Hypo, a joint venture between Golar LNG Limited (O:GLNG) and U.S. private equity firm Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, had been slated to float its shares in New York on Sept. 24. That was put on hold after the New York Stock Exchange suspended debut trading of the shares the same day, without offering an explanation.
The suspension came hours after Antonello was named in the Brazilian investigation.
Antonello's lawyer, Rodrigo Brocchi, said in a statement sent to Reuters on Tuesday that false corruption allegations made to Brazilian prosecutors during plea bargain testimony were prematurely made public by Brazilian authorities despite no proof. He added that the accusations, which date back to 2011, had unfairly damaged Antonello's reputation.
The turmoil could halt a $485 million flotation that was designed to promote greater use of the super-chilled fuel in Brazil as a cleaner alternative to diesel, oil and coal. It also coincides with the country's efforts to open its wider natural gas industry to private investors.
Hygo has hired international law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett to evaluate the viability of the IPO continuing, one of the two sources said.
The IPO will be ""on hold"" until the law firm issues a report in the coming weeks, said the first source, who declined to be named, citing the sensitivity of the issue. The second source also said the IPO was postponed and could be scrapped.
Hygo said in an e-mail to Reuters it expects to resume its IPO plans within six weeks. Golar declined to comment on the IPO's timeline.
Stonepeak, the New York Stock Exchange, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
Asked about whether it had hired Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, Hypo said it had retained a specialized firm to conduct internal due diligence, but declined to name the firm.
Hygo said that what it described as Antonello's leave was ""not in any way linked to any action or misconduct during his tenure at Hygo.""
His functions will temporarily be taken over by the company's board, Golar said in a separate statement to Reuters.
""In an abundance of caution, Hygo has initiated a review to seek to confirm that there have not been any deviations from its culture of compliance in connection with Mr. Antonello's service to Hygo,"" Golar said, adding that the accusations in the probe date from before Hygo was formed.
Golar LNG has lost about half of its share value since police carried out raids of offices, including Golar's, in Rio and Sergipe on Sept. 23.
The raids and investigation by prosecutors are part of the sprawling six-year 'Car Wash' probe that has led to the jailing of two former Brazilian presidents and hundreds of executives and politicians.
The overhang from the Antonello investigation ""is likely to have an impact on the valuation of Hygo and potentially their ability to win incremental business,"" Stifel analyst Benjamin Nolan said in a note to clients last week.
The path to realization of an IPO could be longer, with increased risk, given the need to refinance debt and other obligations, Nolan said.
""Despite the increased risk, we believe the upside potential is substantial and would remain buyers,"" he added.

524,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 02:56PM ET</span>",Euro Slips as ECB Mulls Idea of Shift Toward Fed Inflation Measures,"By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The euro fell against the dollar as the European Central Bank talked up the idea of moving toward a Federal Reserve-style average inflation targeting measure that would likely see interest rates remain lower for longer.
EUR/USD fell 0.23% to $1.176.
In a sign the ECB could be ready to follow the Fed's lead, bank president Christine Lagarde hinted the institution is considering ditching its current policy that targets inflation of ""below but close to 2%"" to allow prices to run above target.
""In the current environment of lower inflation, the concerns we face are different (than in 2003) and this needs to be reflected in our inflation aim,"" Lagarde said.
In recent years, eurozone inflation has remained short of the bank's target. A move toward a Fed-like average inflation targeting measure could allow inflation to run hot to make up for periods of lagging price pressures.
""While make-up strategies may be less successful when people are not perfectly rational in their decisions  — which is probably a good approximation of the reality we face — the usefulness of such an approach could be examined,"" Lagarde added.
The debate over whether the central bank should allow inflation to run above target comes as analysts suggest the central bank is running out of tools and has shown little appetite to cut rates below zero.
""It is far from certain if and to what extent the ECB can still lower its interest rates. The market has been speculating for some weeks that interest rates might fall further into negative territory. However, there are likely to still be considerable doubts about such a step,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said. ""As long as the uncertainty about the ECB’s future approach persists, the road for the euro will remain bumpy as well."""
525,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>","Global banks ramp up preparations for U.S. election night chaos, sources say","By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global banks are preparing for the possibility that there will be no clear victor on the night of the U.S. presidential election, a scenario that could spark days or weeks of chaos in global equities and fixed income markets, several bankers said.
Over the past two weeks, major banks have run simulations to ensure they could cope with a spike in market, liquidity and credit risks, and have been advising clients on precautionary hedges and capital raising strategies if a contested election result on Nov. 3 leads funding markets to dry up.
Reuters/Ipsos polls show the contest tightening, with Democratic candidate Joe Biden holding a slim lead over President Donald Trump in three highly competitive states, while three other battlegrounds show a dead heat. A surge in postal ballots driven by pandemic fears is expected to delay some results.
""We're starting to talk not just to clients, but also to our staff, about the potential that you might see a longer than expected period (with no clear result) because of the large number of mail-in votes,"" said Itay Tuchman,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s global head of FX. ""We're getting prepared for that.""
If the winner is too close to call, a legal battle and even a constitutional crisis could ensue, say bank strategists. Trump last week said he expects the result to be settled by the Supreme Court. Tuesday's unruly first televised presidential debate has added to the uncertainty.
""If there is a constitutional crisis, we believe that the loss of political credibility and standing of the United States as a stable country could threaten its status as a safe haven with unfathomable consequences for the economy and for markets,"" BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' Head of Macro Strategy Daniel Ahn said.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also flagged the risk of a contested result in research published this month.
TESTING OUT SCENARIOS
One person at a major Wall Street bank said over the past two weeks his institution had been running models to stress test market, credit and liquidity risks in the worst-case scenarios.
Market participants need to ensure they have enough funds set aside to take advantage of the volatility and not be over-exposed to any single asset, said Matt Freund, head of fixed income strategies at global fund manager Calamos Investments.
""You have to make sure that you're not in a position to be a forced seller and you need to make sure that your liquidity is adequate so that you can view volatility as an opportunity and not a problem,"" he added.
Trading desks were caught off guard twice in 2016 when Britain voted to leave the European Union and when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. At one point on the night of the British referendum, JP Morgan processed around 1,000 trades per second on its electronic FX platform, the bank has said.
The 2020 election will once again put traders through their paces, with U.S. futures markets pricing in twice as much volatility in the next two months as in the period before and after the 2016 U.S. election. But banks are wiser this time, while the pandemic has also helped many prepare technology and staff for extended periods of turmoil, even with staff working remotely. 
Volatility could also prove a boon for well-positioned Wall Street banks, some of which have already had their best trading year in a decade by helping clients shuffle their portfolios around amid this year's upheaval.
Some bankers said they are discussing with clients strategies for navigating volatility in both the run-up and aftermath of Nov. 3. One senior executive at a big European bank with U.S. operations said he was advising clients on hedging strategies that could offer protection across rates, currencies, commodities and equities markets.
Wary the capital raising window will slam shut, others are also trying to expedite deals. 

One senior capital markets banker said the biggest worry was that a contested election would see debt markets dry up. They are telling clients not to wait: ""If you know you are going to raise capital this year, then you should go sooner rather than later whilst we can still predict the short-term.""

526,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","Nikola CEO confident of closing deal with energy partner, shares up almost 21%","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA) Chief Executive Mark Russell said Wednesday he is confident the electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicle startup will close a deal with an energy partner, and he defended the company's technology and strategy against a short-seller's fraud allegations, sending shares up almost 21% at one point.
Russell told Reuters he is confident Nikola will still announce by year-end a collaboration to build hydrogen-refueling stations. There have been reports this week that Nikola's talks with energy firms, including  BP  Plc (L:BP), had stalled. 
""We've talked to all of those folks and those discussions are continuing,"" he said in an interview. ""We're confident that we're still going to hit the milestones laid out there of announcing a partner by the end of the year and getting stations going starting next year.""
Short-seller Hindenburg Research released a scathing report on Sept. 10 that called Nikola a ""fraud"" and said Nikola founder and former Executive Chairman Trevor Milton had made false claims about Nikola's proprietary technology.
Milton resigned and left the company on Sept. 21 and was replaced by Steve Girsky, whose firm took Nikola public earlier this year through a reverse merger. 
Nikola has said it has discussed Hindenburg Research's charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission and will ""fully cooperate"" with the agency's inquiry. Russell and Girsky on Wednesday declined to comment on probes by securities regulators or the Department of Justice. Hindenburg officials declined to comment.
Nikola's shares have lost more than half their value since announcing on Sept. 8 a prospective alliance with General Motors Co (N:GM) to produce an electric pickup and fuel cell commercial trucks.
On Wednesday, Nikola stepped up its efforts to regain investor support with a lengthy statement defending its business model and technology. It reaffirmed its timetable for launching vehicles and announcing partnerships. 
Nikola said it still expects to break ground on its first commercial hydrogen station in the second quarter of 2021.
Girsky, who joined Russell in the interview, said Nikola will be as much a service provider, generating revenue from refueling and other after-sale businesses, as a manufacturer of vehicles. 
""Downstream revenue is more profitable and less cyclical. To be able to capture that revenue is pretty powerful to us,"" Girsky said.
Russell said talks continue to finalize an alliance with GM but declined further comment. Nikola had previously said it expected to finalize terms prior to Sept. 30.
GM also affirmed Wednesday that the talks with Nikola continue. 
Russell said Nikola's success did not depend on partners, but they ""increase the odds of succeeding.""
JP Morgan analyst Paul Coster said in a research note Nikola is trying to ""re-establish control of the narrative around the company."" He said closing the GM deal is the most important near-term catalyst and Nikola's strategy remains compelling although execution risks remain. 

Nikola shares rose as high as $21.59 and were still up 17.5% at $21.02 in afternoon trading.

527,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 02:09PM ET</span>",Hedge Funds May Escape Fed Blame Over Market Mayhem in March,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds can rest easier for now.
Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said he doesn’t think the investment firms deserve the lion’s share of blame for tumult that swept financial markets in March -- contrasting statements from other policy makers that the funds’ overly leveraged Treasury trades were a crucial factor.
“Our view is that was not a significant source of the pressure that we were seeing in the Treasury market,” Quarles, who also heads the Financial Stability Board of global regulators, said Tuesday during a University of Maryland webinar. Still, he added that market watchdogs lack the “granular data” to fully substantiate that assessment.
The comments are significant because Quarles has been leading an effort by global central banks to examine whether hedge funds and other non-bank financial firms should face more oversight.
Hedge funds have feared that regulators would clamp down on them since June when the Bank for International Settlements called the firms’ rapid unwinding of so-called basis trades “a key driver” of the March turmoil. The transactions involve buying Treasury securities using leverage via repurchase pacts while simultaneously selling futures contracts.
Read More: Fed Headed for a Clash With Hedge Funds, Other Shadow Banks
Treasuries are normally a safe haven for investors. But the securities whipsawed in March after governments locked down their economies due to the coronavirous, prompting a frantic dash for cash that engulfed financial markets. The Fed was forced to intervene to restore order to the U.S. government debt market, purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars of Treasuries and setting up a lending facility to backstop brokers.
Quarles said the selling of Treasuries by foreign central banks appears to have had a bigger impact in March than hedge funds’ basis trades. That comment echoes the conclusion of a recent study by Harvard University professor Marco di Maggio that was commissioned by a hedge fund industry lobbying group, the Washington-based Managed Funds Association.
Read More: Hedge Funds Reject Central Banker Criticism on Volatility
In a July 14 letter to central bank chiefs and finance ministers of the Group of 20 leading nations, Quarles seemed more in the camp of those sounding alarms about money market and hedge funds. Wearing his hat as FSB chief, he argued then that their March activity had forced the hands of global regulators. The FSB is close to concluding an investigation into what happened, expecting to release the results around the time of G20 meetings in October and November, Quarles said Tuesday.
While Quarles has spoken often in recent months about the need to increase oversight of non-banks, he indicated Tuesday that he doesn’t want to subject the firms to bank-like rules that would govern how much capital and liquid assets they must hold and be aimed at ensuring their solvency. Instead, the FSB will concentrate on what Quarles called interconnectedness -- the relationships that firms have with each other that can rapidly spread panic through the financial system.
Quarles, whose term as Fed vice chairman ends in October 2021, also left open the possibility that the agency might tweak bank regulations to allow them to play a bigger role in providing liquidity to financial markets during times of stress.
“There was a certain element of pressure from the regulatory framework that limited the ability of some of the dealers to expand holdings given the dash for cash,” he said.

Russia's power market has become attractive for Western producers of gas turbines as the country has started to modernise a quarter of its thermal power capacity.
Russia does not produce its own medium or large capacity gas-fired power turbines and Moscow wants this type of power equipment produced locally.
This has created a rare opportunity for Western producers of turbines as global demand has been weak in the past few years. InterRAO plans to invest between 40 billion and 45 billion roubles to launch production of the gas turbines as part of the joint venture with U.S. group GE, Maslov said. InterRAO has a 51% stake in the project. 
By 2025-2026, their joint venture will be producing gas turbines with the capacity of 79-87 megawatts and 181-210 megawatts with at least 90% of these produced locally. 
InterRAO hopes to sell 20-25 of these turbines by 2030, Maslov said, adding that demand was likely to rise further after 2030. 
""We believe in this market,"" he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French investigators have called for a review of the design and maintenance of titanium alloy engine parts to ensure they guard against the risks of metal fatigue following an engine blowout on an Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 exactly three years ago. 
France's BEA agency made the recommendation in a final report into the accident in which an Air France jet carrying more than 500 passengers lost the front section of one of its four engines while flying over Greenland, before landing safely in Canada. 
The move follows a perilous investigation involving a 21-month international aerial and ground search across the ice sheet to find a crucial titanium alloy fragment, buried 3 metres below the surface and just a metre away from a hidden crevasse.
The probe focused on the fan hub at the centre of a 3-metre-wide fan at the front of the engine made by Engine Alliance, co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney (N:RTX).
The BEA said a recovered fragment had shown tiny fatigue cracks in a titanium alloy called Ti-6-4 and urged regulators - the Federal Aviation Administration and European Union Aviation Safety Agency - to carry out a review of design, manufacturing, maintenance and certification processes.
""Neither the manufacturer nor the certification authorities had anticipated this phenomenon in this alloy during the design of the engine,"" the BEA said.
Such recommendations by leading investigators do not have to be followed automatically but typically carry some weight. 
Engine Alliance said it had already taken steps to address the findings. Airbus said no flaws had been found during inspections of other engines from the same supplier, one of two A380 engine manufacturers alongside Rolls-Royce (L:RR).
A spokeswoman for Rolls said it was confident the issues associated with the Engine Alliance part ""cannot be attributed to any Rolls-Royce engine fan discs currently in service"".
Titanium alloy is used widely in aerospace, the metal's biggest customer due to its strength compared to the weight of each part, and its ability to handle high temperatures. 
The industry has faced concerns in the past about titanium alloy manufacturing processes following an engine failure. 
In 1989, a severe engine blowout on a United Airlines DC-10 led to the death of 111 people during an attempted landing at Sioux City, Iowa.
That crash sped improvements in manufacturing methods for titanium alloy. But some engine experts have rejected any suggestion that there is an industry-wide manufacturing issue.
During the operation in Greenland to find the missing A380 engine fragment, French, Danish and U.S. specialists battled problems from faulty generators to storms, buried tents and concerns about polar bears, according to an expedition report.

At one point, the team resorted to low-tech methods including bamboo sticks and concentrated juice to mark the snow after their high-precision positioning system failed, but the investigation also spurred development of new sensor equipment.

Investing.com --  Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) opened at $10 in its NYSE debut on Wednesday, a pop of 37.9%.
The New York Stock Exchange had set a reference price of $7.25 for the secretive data analytics company. 
No shares change hands at the reference price, which acts as a guide to investors and is determined based on recent secondary trading performance, according to Bloomberg. At that price, Palantir would have a market value of about $16 billion. That’s less than the $20.8 billion to $28.2 billion that some analysts had estimated. Palantir won’t raise proceeds, Bloomberg said.
Peter Thiel, an early Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) investor, venture capitalist and former PayPay chief, co-founded Palantir 17 years ago. Government agencies and large companies use Palantir software to collect, analyze and map out large data sets. 
The company went public via a direct listing in which existing shareholders sold stock to new investors rather than raising money through a traditional share sale. The opening price for a direct listing is determined by the market maker and the issuing company based on demand, and there’s no inherent discount for buyers.    
Thiel controls Palantir shares valued at about $2.4 billion, based on a share price of $7.25, according to CNBC. Palantir traded as high as $11.50 in the private market last month.
“Palantir has had a pretty active market for the stock with market-based pricing for years,” Kelly Rodriques, CEO of pre-IPO marketplace Forge told CNBC. “It’s been down, up, down and back up again.”      
In a recent filing, Palantir said it expects growth of 42% in 2020, totaling $1.06 billion in sales. Adjusted operating income is estimated at $121 million, for a margin of 11.5%.
On Tuesday, Palantir was awarded a $91 million contract with the Department of Defense to do research and development for the Army Research Laboratory (NYSE:LH). 
Palantir has only 125 clients, but points to expanding software margins that come with making the technology more easily and widely deployable, CNBC said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee on Wednesday unanimously approved bipartisan legislation to reform the Federal Aviation Administration’s aircraft certification process after two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people.
Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, said the House would vote on the sweeping reform measure later this year. 
The  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019. Among other reforms, the bill requires that an expert panel evaluate Boeing’s safety culture and recommend improvements.
""Those crashes were the inevitable culmination of stunning acts and omissions within Boeing and the (FAA),"" DeFazio said at a hearing.
He said the FAA had failed to properly ensure the safety of the 737 MAX, and called aircraft certification ""a broken system that broke the public's trust.""
Boeing and the FAA have declined to comment on the legislation.
The bill would require American aircraft manufacturers to adopt safety management systems and complete system safety assessments for significant design changes, ensure that risk calculations are based on realistic assumptions of pilot response time, and share risk assessments with the FAA.
A report released last week by House Transportation committee Democrats found that the 737 MAX crashes were the ""horrific culmination"" of failures by Boeing and the FAA and called for urgent reforms.
The House bill would extend airline whistleblower protections to U.S. manufacturing employees, require FAA approval of new workers who are performing delegated certification tasks for the agency, and impose civil penalties on those who interfere with the performance of FAA-authorized duties.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson is conducting an evaluation flight at the controls of a 737 MAX in Seattle, a key milestone as the U.S. planemaker works to win approval for the aircraft to resume flights.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A fractious U.S. presidential debate on Tuesday night has done little to ease market worries that the results of the Nov. 3 election will be contested or uncertain, options markets showed.
Futures on the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as ""Wall Street's fear gauge,"" continue to show investors bracing for market gyrations in the weeks after the election, with elevated prices for November and December contracts. 
For much of the year, October futures, which capture the Nov. 3 election date, had traded at a premium.
The pricing reflects concerns that a greater-than-usual number of mail-in ballots could mean delays of weeks in certifying election results and that a close outcome could be contested. VIX futures reflect volatility expectations in the 30 days following their expiration.
""Last night's debate only solidified this fear for many investors,"" wrote Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. 
Worries over a smooth transition in the wake of the presidential election have grown in recent weeks. 
In Tuesday's debate, President Donald Trump declined to commit to accepting the election results, repeating his unfounded complaint that mail-in ballots would lead to election fraud. Following the debate, U.S. equity futures fell overnight while the VIX rose.
During Wednesday's session, Wall Street's major indexes advanced as data showed private payrolls increasing more than expected in September and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was ""hopeful"" that a deal on a coronavirus relief bill could be reached.
Yet VIX futures kept close to their previous levels, and the premium for November futures over October futures held steady, suggesting concerns for the months ahead had not abated. 

""Last night didn't change anything for anybody,"" said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Thompson Capital Management in Chicago.

Investing.com -- Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) rose almost 6% after a strong Barstool Sportsbook launch that prompted a slew of price target increases. 
The Barstool app was introduced on Sept. 18 in Pennsylvania, and broke records for the most downloads ever for the launch of a new mobile sportsbook, Chief Executive Officer Jay Snowden said in a statement. 
""This momentum has continued into our second week of operation, as this weekend’s handle grew by 14% over our initial weekend despite continuing to spend $0 in external marketing,"" he said.   
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) raised its price target to $83 from $62, maintaining its overweight rating, while Craig-Hallum raised its price target to $90 from $75, maintaining a buy. The shares are currently trading around $72.46.
Craig-Hallum analyst Ryan Sigdahl said the Barstool launch ""increases our confidence that PENN can be a leader in the rapidly expanding U.S. sports betting and iGaming market. 
Rosenblatt raised its price target to $90 from $80. Analyst Bernie McTernan reiterated a buy and noted the launch, with growth in the second weekend, suggests a lower probability of the bear case playing out and a greater probability of the bull case occurring, according to StreetInsider.  
The company also announced that it raised $982 million. Penn closed on its underwritten public offering of 16,100,000 shares of its common stock, $0.01 par value per share, which includes 14,000,000 shares of its common stock initially offered by the company and 2,100,000 shares of its common stock issued pursuant to the option granted the underwriters.
“This successful offering provides our company with additional resources to accelerate our unique omni-channel strategy, including launching the Barstool Sportsbook app in new markets, developing new products and features, establishing Barstool-branded sports bars and retail sportsbooks and reimagining the customer experience at our casinos, all while fortifying our balance sheet,” Snowden said.

545,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 11:27AM ET</span>","Mnuchin Sees One More Chance for Stimulus, as House Readies Vote","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he sees “one more serious try” at securing a deal with Congress on another fiscal stimulus package and suggested he’ll offer Democrats a proposal for roughly $1.5 trillion in pandemic relief.
Mnuchin said Wednesday on CNBC that the administration’s counter-offer to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is similar to a plan put forward by a bipartisan group of House members -- which included an escalation in spending up to $2 trillion if the coronavirus pandemic persists. That’s still short of a $2.2 trillion relief package that Democrats unveiled Monday and are preparing to bring to a House vote.
Mnuchin said he hopes to have an “understanding” worked out by Thursday.
Pelosi has asked Democrats to deliver a “strong vote” for the party’s latest package, which is smaller than the $3.4 trillion they passed in May but rejected by Republicans. In a letter to colleagues, she described it a “proffer” in talks. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told fellow Democrats Wednesday his intention is to send the bill to the floor Wednesday or Thursday if there is no deal with Mnuchin.
Mnuchin and Pelosi will talk Wednesday afternoon, the Treasury chief said. Renewed optimism on the potential for a compromise saw U.S. stocks open to gains, after futures had earlier tipped another down day.
“Whether we get this fiscal deal done or we don’t, I am confident we will continue to have economic growth and rebound,” Mnuchin said. “I’m confident we can get something done, and if we don’t, we will come back and work on it after the election.”
He also underscored that more support for airlines is critical, as carriers face the risk of a wave of layoffs. Mnuchin said that he doesn’t expect a stand-alone bill for airline aid, and that he’ll update top executives on the talks after he confers with Pelosi.
The negotiations between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats are at a critical juncture. Either Pelosi can cut a deal with the White House or the Democratic-led House will vote on her $2.2 trillion plan without Republican support, allowing members leave town for pre-election campaigning.
If no deal is reached, Democrats could vote by Thursday. Timing will depend on the result of Pelosi’s talks with Mnuchin. House Republican leaders have already rejected the proposal.
While the legislative text adds clarity to the Democratic offer, the top-line spending level is no closer to what Republicans say they’ll support. President Donald Trump has indicated he could agree to as much as $1.5 trillion in aid -- but even that is more than the $650 billion put forth in a “skinny” aid package by Senate Republicans earlier this month.
Officials in both parties privately questioned whether the differences could be bridged. Pessimism about reaching a deal was one of the factors that helped push stocks lower on Tuesday. Private economists have increasingly abandoned predictions for a deal before the election. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). recently cut their forecasts for growth next quarter as a consequence.
The negotiations have been at an impasse since August. Pelosi on Tuesday continued to say she is hopeful that an agreement can be reached. “We’re in a negotiation and hopefully we will come to a bipartisan agreement,” she said on MSNBC after talking with Mnuchin.
Yet Pelosi said on MSNBC that GOP resistance to rolling back tax breaks in the March stimulus has proven to be an obstacle. The bill contained tax breaks used by real estate businesses; the housing sector has since boomed thanks to record-low mortgage rates.
Republicans continue to oppose the scale of spending Democrats favor. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, speaking on CNBC Tuesday morning, said the true cost of the Democrats’ bill is closer to $2.6 trillion and about one-third of it is related to subjects that Republicans don’t believe are strictly tied to the pandemic.
“For some reason, we just can’t get it done, but the conversation, the talks will continue,” Kudlow said. “The other team wants a gigantic package and we don’t think we need that.”
Pelosi said the much of the difference between the May House plan and the latest proposal is the length of time many of the provisions would be in effect.
“We didn’t take out priorities,” she said. “We just reduced the timeline as to how long those benefits would last.”
A key point of disagreement has been the Democrats’ push for large-scale aid to state and local governments. The plan released Monday has $436 billion for one year of assistance -- less than a previous demand for $915 billion, which triggered scorn from Trump administration officials who called it a bailout for poorly run states.
The Democratic plan includes new aid for airlines, restaurants and small businesses that wasn’t in the original House package, and it has more than double the amount for schools.
The bill would provide another round of $1,200 direct relief payments to individuals and $500 per dependent -- less than the $1,200 for dependents Democrats originally proposed. It also has $600 per week in extra unemployment benefits through January, the same amount that expired in July and helped disposable incomes surge even as the economy tipped into recession.
With the Senate under Republican control, and its leaders now preoccupied with the president’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, the bill is unlikely to advance absent a major push from the Trump administration.

546,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",A Quarter of Women Are Considering Scaling Back Careers,"(Bloomberg) -- A quarter of women are considering leaving the workforce or scaling back on their career aspirations because of the extra demands created by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the annual study of women in the workplace released Wednesday by McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org.
Working mothers are three times as likely as working fathers to be handling a majority of housework, and the disparity is particularly onerous for Black women, according to the Women in the Workplace report, which surveyed more than 40,000 employees at 317 companies. The study also found that senior-level women are more likely than male peers to feel burned out, in part because they are often among few women at their level and they are more likely than younger workers to be parenting.
“If we had a panic button, we'd be hitting it,” Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and co-founder of LeanIn.Org, said in a statement. “Leaders must act fast or risk losing millions of women from the workforce and setting gender diversity back years.”
The setback comes after women, who make up about half the U.S. workforce, had been making progress. Between 2015 and 2020 the share of women in senior vice president roles rose to 28% from 23% and women have secured about 21% of C-suite roles up from 17% five years ago, the McKinsey/LeanIn.org study found. Women also hold 28% of the board seats in the S&P 500, the highest level ever.
These setbacks—characterized by some economists as the nation’s first female recession—are in contrast to the gains women made after the 2008 recession. Participation among women ages 25 to 54 peaked in 2000, then dipped after the financial crisis, only to begin accelerating again from 2015 until the pandemic.
Even before the coronavirus hit, women continued to lose ground at the early stages of their career, according to the study. For every 100 men promoted into management, only 85 women are elevated, and that drops to 71 for Latinas and 58 for Black women.

547,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 10:54AM ET</span>",Stressed U.S. Cities See Slim Shot at Covid Relief After Shutout,"(Bloomberg) -- Syracuse, New York, is negotiating with unions to furlough almost all of its more than 300 public-works employees. In Illinois, the town of East St. Louis is trying to stave off payless paydays. Arlington, Texas, might drop trash collection to once a week from twice.
After Covid-19 cratered tax collections, U.S. cities have been cutting, postponing and squeezing. While states and big cities from New York to California are also suffering and have complained loudly, leaders of smaller cities argue they’re worse off because they’ve been left out of direct federal pandemic relief in the first stimulus and are now watching their chances of aid fade as Congress remains at an impasse about a month from the election.
Read: Wall Street Loses Faith That Congress Will Rescue States, Cities
“The days of being cautiously optimistic are gone -- in some ways, we’ve run out of time,” said Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh, an independent. “Our problems aren’t going away. They are only getting worse.”
Most towns across the U.S. didn’t get direct aid in federal stimulus packages earlier this year because their populations fell below a 500,000-person threshold. Out of 19,000 cities, towns and villages in the U.S., only about 36, representing 14% of the nation’s population, met that benchmark for direct aid, according to the National League of Cities. Yet as early as April, nearly all municipalities with more than 50,000 residents forecast falling revenue this year, according to the group’s survey of 2,463 cities, towns and villages.
Negotiations between the White House and congressional Democrats are at a critical juncture this week. On Monday, House Democrats released their latest plan, a $2.2 trillion package with $436 billion for one year of aid to state and local governments. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are in discussions, which will help decide if another package is enacted before the election. Democrats on Wednesday were waiting for a Mnuchin counteroffer.
The plan proposed on Monday includes $179 billion for a coronavirus local relief fund that would help cities, counties and other local governments “to mitigate the fiscal effects stemming from the public health emergency,” according to a copy of the bill.
Even though the financial circumstances of U.S. municipalities before Covid-19 varied, most now face similar threats. Syracuse forecasts its revenue to fall $41 million during fiscal years 2020 and 2021 because of hits on sales taxes and reduced state aid. It’s making $18 million in cuts in fiscal 2021 such as limited furloughs.
New York City expanded week-long furloughs to more than 9,000 employees to save $21 million starting Oct. 1. Chicago is trying to close a nearly $800 million budget gap that will expand to $1.2 billion next year.
Without fresh aid from Washington, cuts by local governments may weigh on the recovery like they did during the last recession. New York Federal Reserve President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) said Tuesday he’s “concerned about state and local governments” given requirements to balance budgets led states to “cut back dramatically” on spending following the last downturn.
While some states are struggling, cities, especially the smaller ones, have less control over their own destinies. States often determine key taxing measures applied at the local level. In 2017, state funding made up about 17%, or roughly $83 billion, of local revenue, said Michael Pagano, the director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois in Chicago.
Unrestricted state aid to municipalities had been falling before Covid struck -- down 3% in the decade through 2017 -- but the pandemic may exacerbate that trend, he said. New York’s fiscal 2021 budget cut $8.2 billion in aid to localities.
“Cities are in a more vulnerable position than states,” said Pagano, one of the authors of the National League of Cities City Fiscal Conditions 2020 report.
The urgency for aid to avoid economic consequences is crucial because states are expecting a $200 billion revenue shortfall from fiscal 2020 through 2022 and local governments of all types about $175 billion during that period, said Dan White, head of fiscal policy research at Moody’s Analytics. The firm reduced its estimate for needed state and local aid to as much as $400 billion, down from $500 billion in June.
‘Toughest Days’
“Cities across America still have some of the toughest days ahead,” said Arlington Mayor Jeff Williams, a Republican. “We are one of the major economic engines of America.”
The town nestled in Northern Texas between Dallas and Forth Worth is forecasting its first deficit after five years of surpluses. The local economy had been booming before the pandemic, but sales taxes have plummeted. Williams is worried about a hit next year from property taxes and concerned many small businesses that are barely hanging on will close down.
Arlington is working on cuts from 2% to 12% across its departments. It’s delaying infrastructure projects and may drop garbage pickup from twice a week to just once.
‘Payless Paydays’
Towns that were in fiscal trouble before the pandemic struck, like East St. Louis, Illinois, are in especially dire straits. Last year, a portion of its tax revenue to be intercepted for its underfunded police and fire pensions. This year, gaming receipts from a casino, one of the main sources of taxes, have fallen to $2.2 million from $6.6 million in the first nine months of 2019, according to data from the city.
City Manager Brooke Smith is delaying overtime payments to police officers and fire fighters to maintain cash, but she worries if federal aid doesn’t come through that “payless paydays” could be in East St. Louis’ future.
As winter approaches in Dayton, Ohio, Mayor Nan Whaley worries about having enough city snow truck drivers to clear roads quickly enough and whether small businesses can make it when outdoor dining and other activities cease. She has already cut almost 70 employees through layoffs and early retirement.“I don’t think we’ve seen the bottom,” said Whaley, a Democrat and vice president with the U.S. Conference of Mayors who is lobbying Congress for direct aid to cities. “Fourth quarter is make or break.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened moderately higher on Wednesday, after a stronger-than-expected private payrolls report from ADP for September, coupled with another banner month for home sales, outweighed concerns about rising Covid-19 cases and the possibility of a disputed presidential election in November. 
Comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talking up the possibility of a deal on a fresh fiscal support package also lifted spirits. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 250 points, or 0.9%, at 27,703 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%. 
Earlier, ADP had reported that the U.S. private sector had added 749,000 jobs in the month through mid-September, while August's job gains were also revised up to 481,000 from 428,000. The numbers suggest that the labor market's rebound in the summer was stronger than initially thought, although whether it can sustain that strength as the coronavirus starts to regain momentum is another question. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) late on Tuesday announced it will cut 28,000 jobs at its theme parks and cruise operations in an apparent admission that neither will operate anywhere near full capacity for the foreseeable future.
Disney stock shrugged off premarket losses to trade down only 0.2%. but on a nationwide basis, new infections of Covid-19, which had fallen steadily since the end of July, have been rising more or less since the cut-off date for the ADP survey, while hospital admissions also appear to have turned upwards again.   
The still-high level of unemployment - visible in the weekly jobless claims and set to be confirmed again in Friday's official labor market report - has led most analysts and much of the Federal Reserve's top brass to argue forcefully for more fiscal measures to support the economy.  The Democrat-led House of Representatives and Republican-controlled Senate have haggled over a compromise for more than a month, both apparently content for the other to take the blame for the lack of progress.
""We’re going to give it one more serious try to get this done and I think we’re hopeful that we can get something done,” Treasury Secretary Mnuchin told a conference organized by CNBC on Wednesday.
Among individual stocks, Nextera Energy (NYSE:NEE) fell 2.8% after a Wall Street Journal report saying that it had been rebuffed in a bid for  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK). Duke stock rose 7.8% in early trading.
Chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) fell 5.0% after it said in its quarterly update that it had failed so far to get government permission to sell certain highly-sensitive products to China's Huawei.
Homebuilder  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) stock rose 3.3% to a new all-time high after data showed pending home sales rose 8.8% in August. The numbers point to an ongoing boom in the housing market fueled by low interest rates and the desire of many people to lower their Covid risk and find more space outside densely-populated cities. "

The National Association of Realtors’ index of contract signings to buy previously owned homes surged 8.8% from a month earlier, according to data released Wednesday. Analysts had estimated 3.1%. Compared with 2019, pending sales jumped 24%.
“Tremendously low mortgage rates have again helped pending home sales climb,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist.

Record-low mortgage rates have fueled the housing market in recent months as Americans look for more space to spread out and millennials age into homebuying.

The company said it expects to report an adjusted loss in the range of $210 million to $260 million for the quarter, compared with the average analyst estimate of a $243 million loss, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
Houston-based ConocoPhillips said it intends to resume share repurchases of $1 bln during the fourth quarter.

In one of the biggest layoff announcements since the pandemic caused widespread economic shutdowns, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. said it’s slashing 28,000 workers in its slumping U.S. resort business and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc will cut as many as 9,000 jobs as crude’s crash forces billions of dollars in cost savings.
Announcements like these point to further challenges in a rebound that’s already slowed after an initial bounce back in May and June. Weekly figures due Thursday are estimated to show filings for U.S. unemployment benefits remain far above pre-virus levels, while Friday’s jobs report is expected to reveal that employers added a half-million fewer workers in September than in August.
With the pandemic still raging and U.S. lawmakers having failed so far to reach an agreement on extending federal relief for the unemployed and small businesses, many key measures in the world’s largest economy look set to remain weak for some time. While the first wave of job cuts hit service workers the hardest -- in industries such as restaurants and entertainment -- economists see other higher-paid positions at increasing risk of layoffs as the recovery grinds slowly forward.

FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss contract drug maker Lonza (S:LONN) is launching the sale of its Lonza Specialty Ingredients (LSI) unit, people close to the matter told Reuters on Wednesday, adding it could be worth 3-3.5 billion Swiss francs ($3.25-3.79 billion).
The sources said UBS (S:UBSG) is expected to send out information packages on LSI to peers such as  Lanxess  (DE:LXSG) or  Clariant  (S:CLN) as well as to private equity groups in October. 
LSI has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about 300 million Swiss Francs ($323 million) and may be valued at 10-12 times that in a potential deal, they said.
The Basel-based company, which announced the sale plans in July, was not available for comment, while UBS declined to comment. 
LSI is divided into two units, one making microbial controls for paints, hygiene, personal care and wood treatment, and a specialty chemicals services business offering contract manufacturing to clients.
The division traces Lonza's industrial roots, which go back more than a century to when it made synthetic fertilisers. 
In the first half of 2020, LSI's revenue decreased by 5% to 819 million Swiss Francs, while core EBITDA dropped slightly to 161 million.
Sales of products used in hygiene and home & personal care have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, as has demand for vitamin b3 in feed applications. However, sales of products used in wood protection, oil and gas, crop protection and the composite materials business dropped.
After bulking up its main pharma business with a $5.5-billion takeover of U.S.-based drug capsule maker Capsugel in 2017, Lonza unloaded assets including its 1,200-employee water treatment and residential swimming pool care business last year to streamline activities.

""Volkswagen needs to change: From a collection of valuable brands and fascinating combustion-engine products that thrill customers with superb engineering - to a digital company that reliably operates millions of mobility devices worldwide,"" Diess told shareholders at the company's virtual general meeting.
Vehicles need to stay in contact with customers, offer new services and comfort functions on a weekly or even daily basis, he said. 
""We will take further important steps to set the course for this in the rest of 2020,"" Diess said.
Senior executives told Reuters the company is reviewing what role its high-performance brands Lamborghini, Bugatti and Ducati will play as the company increasingly focuses on electric, digital and autonomous vehicles.
Volkswagen, which also owns VW, Audi, Porsche, Seat and Skoda, is looking at whether it has the resources to accelerate development of electric platforms for smaller brands at a time it is investing billions to transform its more mainstream cars.
Asked whether Ducati, which is known for making noisy combustion-engined motorbikes, has an electric future, Markus Duesmann, who oversees research and development for the group, said: ""It will not take long until we see an electric Ducati.""
Whether Ducati, which is a medium-sized premium motorbike brand, would offer an electric variant, depends on whether a bike could offer range comparable to a combustion-engined variant, Duesmann said.
Advances are being made in battery technology which could make this possible, he added. 
Separately Frank Witter, the company's chief financial officer, in response to a question about whether a sale of Lamborghini is planned, said Volkswagen does not comment on speculation about potential divestments.

Lamborghini's Chief Executive Stefano Domenicali this week announced his departure from the sports car maker to take on a new job as president of Formula One.

""We will open our insides, we are available to be vivisected to respond to all of this political pressure...,"" President Luigi De Vecchis said at the opening ceremony of the group's cyber-security centre in Rome. 
The comments came on the same day that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began a two-day visit to Italy.
The United States has lobbied Italy and other European allies to avoid using Huawei equipment in their next generation networks, saying the company could pose a security risk. Huawei rejects those charges.
""I am speechless that a country the size of the United States attacks another country through the demolition, via groundless accusations, of a company of that country,"" he said.
De Vecchis said that, despite all the pressure, Huawei had no intention of leaving the Italian market and was considering adding further products in fields such as energy.
""It's extremely unlikely Huawei will leave the market because of the current situation,"" he said.
De Vecchis said the staging of the event the same day as Pompeo's arrival in Italy was a coincidence and also that he was unaware of any issues relating to the closing of 5G deals in Italy because of the government's use of its so-called golden powers on infrastructure considered strategic.
During a meeting with Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Pompeo highlighted the substantial business and investment ties between the United States and Italy and warned of the risks of doing business with China, a spokesman for the U.S Secretary of State said. 

Pompeo is due to talk later on Wednesday with Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said on Wednesday it would start replacing the direct messaging service within Instagram with a version of its Messenger app, the first major step in its plan to tie together messaging across its suite of apps.
The move enables users of each service to find, message and hold video calls with contacts on the other without needing to download both apps.
It also introduces features like custom emojis and themes that have been mainstays on Messenger but were not previously available in Instagram's minimalist messaging product, along with new features like disappearing messages.
If users accept the update, the messaging icon in Instagram will change to the Messenger logo. As on Messenger, Instagram users - who have not been able to forward messages - will be able to do so to a maximum of five people at a time.
""The goal of this exercise is to get to the point where we build something once and then it works across (apps), so we don't have to repeat the same thing multiple times,"" said Messenger chief Stan Chudnovsky.
An initial launch will begin on Wednesday in a few unspecified countries and then be rolled out globally soon.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg first announced a vision for cross-app messaging early last year. The company eventually aims to integrate WhatsApp and extend end-to-end encryption across all three services.
The move is likely to figure in antitrust deliberations over Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which are the subject of several probes.
Antitrust experts have raised concerns that weaving the services together could make it more difficult for regulators to break up the company.

Chudnovsky said no new categories of user data would be swapped between Instagram and Messenger beyond what was already shared, as both messaging services have relied on the same back-end infrastructure for years.

LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - World stocks fell and safer assets such as the yen and dollar found buyers on Wednesday after a chaotic first U.S. presidential debate and rising COVID-19 cases turned investors cautious, though strong factory surveys boosted China's markets.
President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden battled over Trump's record on the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare and the economy in a bad-tempered first debate marked by personal insults and Trump's repeated interruptions.
U.S. stock futures had nudged higher early during the debate but then retreated as Trump cast doubt on whether he would accept the election's outcome if he lost.
Asian trading had been choppy rather than outright weak but Europe main markets were down as much as 0.5% <0#.INDEXEM> amid worries too over the steep rises in coronavirus infections across the region again.
""The debate just added to the confusion about how the election will run,"" said SEB investment management's global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson. ""But financially it doesn't change anything"".
S&P 500 futures were last 0.5% lower, with Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 futures down by as much as 1%.
The U.S. dollar crept higher and is set for its best monthly gain since July 2019, while the yen rose 0.2% to 105.50 per dollar, its strongest daily rise in nearly two weeks. 
""The only point worth mentioning is that the debate may have increased expectations for a contested election result,"" said UBS' chief economist Paul Donovan said ""Given the importance of international investors to U.S. markets, this may add volatility around the election.""
Markets globally, most of which are headed for their first monthly retreats since March's meltdown, either deepened losses or pulled back from highs scaled after data showed China's economic recovery remains on track. 
MSCI's broadest index of world shares which tracks nearly 50 countries dropped 0.2% for a 4% September loss. Oil is down just over 10% this month, while gold's 4.1% drop will make it its worst month since late 2016. 
Asia had held its ground overnight, led by a 0.8% gain in Hong Kong, though Japan's Nikkei fell 1.5% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost over 2%. 
Chinese property developers gained, led by a 15% jump in Evergrande shares after the heavily-indebted giant reached a deal to ease cash crunch concerns.
China's factory activity expansion accelerated in September, helped by rising export orders.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 in September from 51.0 in August. Analysts had expected it to pick up slightly to 51.2.

CONTESTED RESULT
The presidential debate yielded no clear winner and barely moved the needle in betting markets, which project a narrow Biden victory. Odds maker Smarkets slightly lowered Trump's chance of re-election to 40% after the debate from 42% beforehand.
But as the election draws closer, investors are increasingly expecting a bumpy final lap and are bracing for the possibility that the result is unclear on polling day.
Options trade points to a volatile November. Two-month dollar/yen volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the yen, is elevated, and its premium over one-month volatility is near record levels.
On Wednesday, major currencies eased against the dollar after the debate, The euro dipped from a one-week high to back below $1.17, Germany's Bund yield hit a two-month low, and the risk-sensitive Australian dollar fell 0.2% to $0.7118, heading for its worst month since March. 
Biden said in the closing stages of the debate he would accept defeat if he lost at the ballot box and would not claim victory prematurely.
Trump, who has refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election, repeated unfounded allegations that mail-in voting would lead to fraud.
""I don't think we were expecting anything else from Trump,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone. ""He continues to put that contested (result) risk premium back into the market.""
Elsewhere, oil prices fell amid rising concerns about fuel demand as the coronavirus pandemic worsens. 
Brent crude futures were last down 0.9% at $40.66 a barrel and U.S. crude futures were down 0.7% at $39.00 a barrel. Gold slipped 0.4% to 1,890 an ounce.

The Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) predicted that the travel slump and a slow recovery will threaten 4.8 million aviation workers and more than half of the 87.7 million total jobs supported directly or indirectly by the sector, in related leisure industries and supply chains.
""We know that a lot of jobs in air transport and the wider economy relying on aviation are at risk,"" said Michael Gill, who heads the group representing airlines, airports, aircraft makers and other sector players.
The warning came after airlines cut their 2020 traffic forecast amid renewed coronavirus outbreaks and travel restrictions that darkened the outlook. ATAG said its findings drew on research by forecaster Oxford Economics.

Airlines are pressing governments to abandon quarantines and other travel curbs blamed for worsening the slump, and instead roll-out rapid COVID-19 testing at airports.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other U.S. tech giants could be banned from favouring their services or forcing users to sign up to a bundle of services under draft EU rules aimed at reining in their power.
The draft rules, known as the Digital Services Act, aim to set the ground rules for data-sharing and how digital marketplaces operate. They are expected to come into force by the end of the year.
The European Commission is taking a tough line against U.S. tech giants, driven in part by antitrust cases resulting in decisions that subsequently failed to boost competition because of the lengthy process that typically takes several years.
The case has taken on urgency because of the dependence of thousands of EU companies on the tech giants for their business.
Gatekeepers, such as companies with bottleneck power or strategic market status, will not be allowed to use data collected on their platforms to target users unless this data is shared with rivals, according to the document seen by Reuters. 
""Gatekeepers shall not pre-install exclusively their own applications nor require from any third party operating system developers or hardware manufacturers to pre-install exclusively gatekeepers' own application,"" the paper said.
Another clause would ban gatekeepers from blocking rivals offering their products to customers outside of the gatekeeper's platform or services, a move which would affect Apple and Google with their restrictive app store rules and payment.

The rules would also subject gatekeepers to annual audits of their advertising metrics and reporting practices.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government is planning tougher oversight of telecoms network vendors that, while stopping short of a ban on Huawei [HWT.UL], will make it harder for the Chinese company to keep a foothold in Europe's largest market.
Three coalition and government sources said on Wednesday that an agreement had been reached in principle to extend scrutiny of a vendor's governance and technology to Radio Access Networks (RAN) powering next-generation 5G services, in addition to the more sensitive core.
The Handelsblatt daily reported earlier that, after two years of wrangling, Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition had agreed on a formula for how to handle so-called high-risk vendors in a proposed IT security law.
Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, declined to comment on the Handelsblatt story, telling a government news conference that the same security standards would apply to all vendors. The interior and economy ministries, both run by Merkel allies, said discussions on the legislation were continuing.
European governments have been reviewing market leader Huawei's role in the building of their networks following pressure from the United States, which says it poses a security threat because, among other concerns, Chinese companies and citizens must by law aid the state in intelligence gathering.
Restricting Huawei is the right approach, a senior U.S. official said, urging Berlin to support its NATO allies by removing Chinese technology from its next-generation networks.
""We are seeing things moving in the right direction in Germany ... There is really no future with Huawei,"" said Keith Krach, the U.S. undersecretary of state for economic affairs who has visited Berlin and Brussels in recent days.
Huawei denies it poses a security risk. It said it could not comment on a measure that was still being drafted, but highlighted its 30-year track record of delivering safe networks and transparent cooperation with the German authorities.
""We cannot identify any comprehensible reasons for restricting our market access,"" Huawei's German spokesman said.
German officials say that, while Britain has formally banned Huawei and France will informally exclude it, Germany will eventually strangle it in red tape. ""The final outcome is the same,"" one senior security official has told Reuters.
POLITICAL JUDGEMENTS
Scrutiny of vendors would include up-front and ongoing assessments by Germany's cybersecurity watchdog and intelligence services, subject to a judgement from key government departments on whether a vendor is trustworthy, some sources said.
Exactly who has a seat at the table for that political call remains a subject of debate, with Merkel's coalition partners the Social Democrats, who run the foreign ministry, pushing to have a say.
The compromise still needs to be drafted into a legal text: ""We hope that cabinet can adopt this in October, or at the latest in November,"" said one coalition source.
Germany's three mobile network operators - Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY), Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) Deutschland - are all clients of Huawei and have argued that ripping out and replacing its equipment would be costly.

Market leader Deutsche Telekom's 5G network, built largely with Huawei equipment, should cover two-thirds of the German population by the end of the year, meaning it will be largely completed by the time IT security law takes effect.

LONDON (Reuters) - Boohoo reported a 51% increase in first half profit and raised its full year guidance on Wednesday, with publicity over failings in its supply chain showing no impact on the British online fashion retailer's sales.
Last week, Boohoo accepted all the recommendations of an independent review which found several failings in its supply chain in England after allegations about working conditions and low pay, setting out steps to tackle the problems.
Boohoo, which sells own-brand clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products targeted at 16- to 40-year-olds, has been under intense scrutiny since July when the allegations surfaced after a lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
Unlike store-based rivals who had to shutter shops for several months during coronavirus lockdowns, Boohoo was able to trade throughout the first half and said it had made a good start to the second, with momentum continuing into September.
""Boohoo has shrugged off the supply chain scandal and strutted ahead with strong revenue growth across all its brands and markets,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Susannah Streeter said.
Boohoo shares were down 2.6% at 0753 GMT, but have recovered all their losses from July when the supply issues emerged and are up 27.5% in 2020.
The group made a pretax profit of 68.1 million pounds ($87.4 million) in the six months to August 31, on revenue up 45% to 816.5 million pounds.
Revenue for 2020-21 was now expected to grow by 28% to 32% versus approximately 25% previously guided, while core profit margin (adjusted EBITDA margin) was expected to be around 10%, versus 9.5% to 10% previously forecast.
Boohoo said it is planning for economic uncertainty in the second half, including possible reduced consumer spending.
It also anticipates product return rates returning to normal levels, continued delivery cost inflation in some overseas markets and increased marketing and capital expenditure.

Shares of the company, which earlier this month skipped interest payments on some bonds, fell over 24% premarket.
Virus-led lockdowns, which decimated travel and fuel demand, have forced many shale producers to halt oil drilling, leaving them with no source of cash to repay their massive debts. Oasis had long-term debt of $2.76 billion with just $77.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30. 
The company said it expects to cut debt by $1.8 billion through the restructuring and secured $450 million in debtor-in-possession financing.
U.S. oil prices have so far fallen by nearly a third from over $60 a barrel at the beginning of the year and briefly turned negative in April.
In July and August, 13 North American oil producers filed for protection from creditors, according to a report by law firm Haynes and Boone, reflecting crude oil prices below levels that are profitable for many companies.
Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) and Chaparral Energy (OTC:CHAPQ) Inc filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, while  Whiting Petroleum Corp  (N:WLL) completed its financial restructuring at the start of this month. 
""Due to historically low global energy demand and commodity prices, we determined it is best for Oasis Petroleum to take decisive action to strengthen our liquidity,"" Oasis Chief Executive Officer Thomas Nusz said in a statement. 
The company said its upstream operations and production would continue normally as restructuring happens, and its independent pipeline company,  Oasis Midstream  Partners LP (O:OMP), was not included in Chapter 11 proceedings.

Oasis listed assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion, according to a court filing.

(Reuters) - U.S. casino operator Caesars Entertainment (O:CZR) agreed on Wednesday to buy British-based gambling group  William Hill  (L:WMH) for 2.9 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) to expand in the fast-growing U.S. sports-betting market.
The U.S. group, owner of Las Vegas's Caesars Palace, intends to sell William Hill's non-U.S. operations, including more than 1,400 UK betting shops, and said it would integrate the U.S. business into Caesars with few, if any, job losses.
It could sell the UK assets to private equity group Apollo (N:APO), sources told Reuters this week, and if that failed, launch an auction process.
Shares in William Hill, which already offers sports betting in Caesars casinos in the United States, hit a two-year high of 312 pence on Friday after the British company said it had received separate takeover offers from Caesars and Apollo.
With the board backing the deal with Caesars, market pricing now indicates investors expect the 272 pence per share takeover by the U.S. company to go through. William Hill shares were last down 0.15% at 273.85 pence.
""This is the best option,"" William Hill Chairman Roger Devlin said. 
The deal, which Caesars will partly fund via a $1.7 billion issue of new stock, is a move to take control of - and expand - the companies' U.S. sports-betting joint venture, currently 80%-owned by William Hill. 
Long the preserve of informal bookmakers, sports betting in the United States is growing rapidly after a landmark ruling in 2018 and gambling companies are reaching out for European expertise to back expansion.
In Britain, William Hill has closed more than 700 betting shops after new regulations limited the maximum stake on lucrative gaming machines. Its UK rivals include GVC (L:GVC), which owns the  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) brand, as well as Flutter Entertainment (I:FLTRE).

Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said the prospect of a bid battle with Apollo had faded due to the threat of Caesars terminating the joint venture if its deal failed. For the bid to go through, it needs 75% support from William Hill shareholders.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions came back with a bang in the third quarter as executives rushed to revisit deals left on hold at the height of the coronavirus pandemic and boardrooms regained confidence after a roller-coaster year.
A deal frenzy in September led to a record third quarter with more than $1 trillion worth of transactions around the world, mostly focused on coronavirus-resilient sectors such as technology and healthcare, according to Refinitiv data.
The third-quarter spike, however, failed to take up all the slack after a lacklustre start to the year.
M&A deals overall were down 21% at $2.2 trillion in the first nine months of 2020, with U.S. transactions coming in at $800 billion, a 43% slump from the same period last year.
""The way out of this crisis is through M&A and we have started to have really engaging conversations with CEOs and boards around strategic positioning post-COVID,"" said Alison Harding-Jones,  Citigroup 's (N:C) head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and vice chairman of EMEA banking, capital markets and advisory.
""People have realised they need to consolidate to create stronger and better-equipped businesses to deal with what the world looks like going forward,"" she said.
M&A activity in July, August and September leapt 80% from the previous quarter when the spread of COVID-19 triggered global lockdowns and brought business to a standstill.
In the United States, deal volumes rose threefold to $414 billion from the second quarter, Europe was up 21% at $231 billion and Asia Pacific spiked 67% to $274 billion.
""The market is picking up quite rapidly. Ironically, the prospects for M&A activity are stronger now than they were pre-COVID,"" said Peter Weinberg, founding partner and chief executive of Perella Weinberg Partners.
'GET ON WITH LIFE'
The latest transaction to become a casualty of the pandemic was LVMH's (PA:LVMH) $16 billion takeover of U.S. jeweller Tiffany (N:TIF), which is hanging in the balance after the French luxury giant said it could not meet a deal deadline.
While that was a blow for transatlantic mergers, the deal flow between the United States and Europe was partly restored by Nvidia's (O:NVDA) $40 billion swoop on British chip designer Arm Holdings.
German health firm Siemens Healthineers (DE:SHLG) and French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY), meanwhile, spent billions on U.S. takeovers, buying  Varian Medical  Systems (N:VAR) and Principia (O:PRNB), respectively.
Other big deals included PetroChina's (SS:601857) (HK:0857) sale of its oil and gas pipelines for $49 billion and a $42 billion move by Altice's (AS:ATCA) Franco-Israeli founder Patrick Drahi to take the telecoms firm private. 
The third-quarter deal frenzy, however, gave mid-market mergers the biggest boost. Transactions in the $5 billion to $10 billion range are up 24% so far this year while combinations worth more than $10 billion have dropped 37%.
Dealmakers said the looming U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3 was a factor for companies considering acquisitions but a sustained economic recovery should help stimulate merger activity, regardless of the winner.
""The election is in focus with clients right now. But if you look back, the underlying strength of the economy and the capital markets are better predictors of M&A activity than any single event like the election,"" said Chris Roop, co-head of North America M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM).
In Europe, a long-awaited season of banking deals kicked off over the summer with Spanish and Italian banks finalising merger discussions, raising expectations that German and Swiss rivals might follow suit.
""The critical phase of when nobody knew what was happening is over. CEOs want to get on with life and business implementation as they've realised they cannot stand still,"" said Patrick Frowein, co-head of EMEA investment banking coverage and advisory at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
""One CEO recently told me: 'In the morning I work on the theme of crisis and in the afternoon I work on the topic of opportunity. The mornings are getting shorter and the afternoons longer'.""
STOCK DEALS FAVOURED
In general, the pandemic has pushed companies to reconsider what it means to diversify their business, Stephan Feldgoise, global co-head of M&A at Goldman Sachs (N:GS) said.
""The willingness of corporations to look through what is market uncertainty is really what's evolved right now,"" Feldgoise said.
""COVID has changed the perception of what it means to be diversified. To refocus a business, to have multiple products lines and to achieve geographic diversification is helping to drive M&A."" 
Despite the market volatility, companies have largely used stock as their preferred acquisition currency, locking in high valuations while keeping cash reserves intact to help weather the coronavirus storm.
""Stock deals are increasingly attractive because there's often a lower premium to pay and the target shareholders will participate in the upside of the combined entity,"" said Philipp Beck, M&A head for EMEA at UBS (S:UBSG).
""This is a theme that will continue as it allows the parties to preserve balance sheet flexibility and ease liquidity concerns,"" he said.
Deep-pocketed private equity investors have largely been on the sidelines, wary of buying assets that are hard to price without visibility on how long it will take for growth to return to pre-pandemic levels.
""When you look at the market fundamentals, you see that there is a lot of private equity money to be deployed. But high multiples and hefty valuations continue to remain the main challenge for most funds,"" said Simona Maellare, global co-head of alternative capital at UBS.
Going forward, however, the mood is set to change, with financial investors likely to follow in the footsteps of U.S. buyout fund KKR (N:KKR), which has been a prolific dealmaker during the pandemic, bankers said.

""There is a window of opportunity for financial sponsors to drive post-COVID-19 growth. If you look at the cycle we're at a low point but there are signs of a recovery in many segments,"" Deutsche Bank's Frowein said.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>","German agency awards new onshore wind, solar power licences","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's network agency said on Wednesday it had awarded licences to build 677 megawatts (MW) of renewable power installations under the first so-called innovation tender that promotes combining generation and storage activities.
The authority is trying to reverse a lull in applications for green power projects that threatens progress in the country's green energy transformation.
Interest has fallen sharply since 2017, when generous 20-year feed-in tariff guarantees, awarded under a 2000 law to promote renewables, were abandoned in favour of an auction-based programme.
The innovation tenders - introduced and held alongside regular auctions for new capacity - are meant to reward storage technology aimed at relieving transport grids of the stress arising from the intermittency of green power.
The aim is to create incentives for utilities and equipment makers to invest within a secure framework, although the sector must ultimately become self-financing.
The Bundesnetzagentur energy markets regulator said in a statement that among the 677 MW, 28 solar power installations and one onshore wind project with on-site storage had attracted guarantees of fixed payments.
It had received bids for a volume of 1,095 MW, equivalent to a big nuclear power plant.
The payments for the assets will be shared by consumers via the grid fee element in their power bills and will go to producers on top of prices they achieve in the wholesale market.
They amounted to a volume-weighted average 2.65 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) for individual production units and 4.5 cents/kWh for combined units that share a grid feed-in point, the statement said.

German round-the-clock power for delivery next year traded at 4.1 cents/kWh in the wholesale market on Wednesday .

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific mergers and acquisitions are forecast by bankers to remain buoyant after surging 63% in the third quarter, driven by technology companies and conglomerates making strategic moves as they emerge from the pandemic.
Japanese companies are at the forefront of the M&A boom, as shown by SoftBank Group's (T:9984) $40 billion sale announcement of chip maker ARM to Nvidia (O:NVDA) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (OTC:NPPXF) Corp's (NTT) (T:9432) launch this week of a $40 billion buyout of its wireless carrier business. 
Deals involving Asia companies totalled $432 billion in the July-September quarter, the highest for the period in at least the past decade, according to Refinitiv data. They totalled 
$844 billion in the first nine months of the year, up 13% and compared to a 20% decrease globally for the period. 
A strong outlook for M&A in Asia, with big markets such as China and Japan resuming domestic business activities, will please banks on hopes volume growth will help offset a slump in fees to seven-year lows as a result of COVID-19 disruptions.
""As the macro recovery takes hold, the first deals we expect to see are those which will help companies build or aggregate scale both in-market and across the region,"" said Raghav Maliah, co-head of Asia ex-Japan M&A at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Eight out of the region's 10 largest deals were announced in the third quarter, including China's giant oil & gas pipeline merger valued at $49 billion including debt.
The tech sector and tech-related businesses, many of which have experienced growth during the pandemic, are expected to primarily drive deal activities, bankers said.
India's  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI) has received over $10 billion in funding this year for its digital unit. It is in talks with more investors, including Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Co, to fund its retail unit.
In China, a number of U.S.-listed tech companies including  Sina Corp  (O:SINA) and Sogou Inc (N:SOGO) announced take-private plans, many with hopes of relisting in China's own Nasdaq-like STAR market for higher valuations.
""Strategic activity will rebound driven by sectors experiencing strong recoveries from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in technology, new-economy and private sector oriented businesses,"" said Goldman's Maliah.
Deals involving Japanese companies surged more than five times in the third quarter from the second quarter to bring the total value this year to $198 billion. That was up 58% year-on-year.
""The domestic M&A market continues to be active as there are less barriers to engage and do due diligence on each other,"" said Shinsuke Tsunoda, Nomura's global head of M&A. 

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) tops the region's M&A league table in the first nine months, followed by Goldman Sachs and CICC.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asia's equity capital markets generated a record pay day for investment bankers in the third quarter, bolstered by surging appetite for technology deals and a rush to list on China's new STAR Market, Refinitiv data showed.
Asia Pacific, including Japan, saw bankers garner $3.6 billion in equity capital market (ECM) fees in July-September, up 145% from the same period a year earlier. The previous peak was $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Bankers are also preparing to fatten their pay packets when Ant Group raises up to $35 billion in a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai likely in October.
""Global capital markets are working. An enormous amount of money is available worldwide,"" said Aaron Arth, head of the Asia ex-Japan financing group at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). ""All signs point to a steady desire and need for capital.""
Total equity market capital raised in Asia in the quarter climbed 148% to $133.8 billion. ECM fees account for almost 40% of the region's investment banking wallet, versus 25% globally, making it a hotly contested business.
The strong showing means the $6.9 billion in fees raised in the region in the first nine months of 2020 have surpassed the $6.15 billion generated for all of last year.
While all major banks saw their earnings rise, Chinese banks benefited most from new listings on the Nasdaq-like STAR Market. China International Capital Corporation (HK:3908) became the region's top revenue earner for the first time, tripling its fees to roughly $405 million in the nine-month period.
China-led IPOs accounted for 44% of IPOs in the world for the first three quarters with $57.4 billion worth of deals, more than double the amount for the same time last year.
Led by a $7.5 billion secondary listing for Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SS:688981), there were 62 STAR Market listings that raised $14.7 billion in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.
""In Asia, there has been an acceleration in technology and digital adoption because of COVID and that is leading to these deals coming to the capital markets in full force,"" said Udhay Furtado,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s co-head of Asia Pacific equity capital markets.
""The pipeline is as robust as ever. There are a lot of companies coming across the region - they are very high quality, these are companies people want to own for the long term who will be with us for generations.""
In Asia, the value of technology capital deals rose 51% to $35.7 billion.

Paul Uren, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s co-head of global investment banking coverage in Asia Pacific, said he thought equities markets would remain in favour as liquidity stayed high and interest rates are likely to be kept at record lows in the foreseeable future.

576,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Why Brazil's massive IPO pipeline is giving investors indigestion,"By Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - What was shaping up as Brazil's best year for initial public offerings in more than a decade is now on the rocks, as many companies shelve their plans amid concerns on the country's fiscal discipline and a surfeit of new equity supply.
Fueled by surging demand from domestic retail investors seeking alternatives to historically low interest rates, local companies were expected to raise roughly 100 billion reais ($17.7 billion) by year-end in 2020 by selling their shares in IPOs and follow-ons.
But several companies' IPO hopes have been dashed in recent weeks. Even state-owned lender Caixa Economica Federal's planned flotation of its Caixa Seguridade SA insurance unit, which had aimed to raise more than 10 billion reais, collapsed last week.  Cosan  (NYSE:CZZ) SA's (SA:CSAN3) gas unit Compass and investment bank BR Partners met the same fate.
Many additional companies are also mulling cancellations, bankers say, as investor sentiment is soured both by concern about government overspending and by the sheer size of the pipeline of companies seeking to go public.
Others, such as homebuilder Lavvi and drugstore chain Pague Menos, yielded to pressure from investors and cut their initial valuations. 
'ANEMIC'
This year, Brazilian IPOs have been mainly funded by local investors, fueled by record low benchmark interest rates at 2%. Foreign investors have accounted for 38% of the money in Brazilian IPOs this year, below the historic average level of 60% since 2007, giving domestic investors a lot of influence over pricings.
Cash equities have seen foreign investment outflows of some 90 billion reals so far this year, while local equity funds had inflows of over 60 billion reais, according to a recent Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) report.
""International investors' sentiment toward Brazil this year is anemic, with most showing preference for Chinese companies among emerging markets, especially tech IPOs,"" said Andre Rosenblit, head of at  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA' broker unit.
Uncertainties around U.S. presidential elections and a second wave of COVID-19 in Europe, and a related shift to a more ""risk off"" posture among global investors have also emerged as obstacles to new stock flotations.
In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro's government is mulling a new minimum income program, without cutting expenses. This has caused sparking a sell-off in the real currency, the stock exchange index and raised long-term interest rates. 
Beyond that, Brazil's short-lived IPO boom became a victim of its own success as companies' rush to float shares ran afoul of an immutable fact: the country's investor base - even given its recent growth - can only absorb so many IPOs.
The problem in many cases, is simple: there are simply not enough buyers at once for the massive bulge in supply, bankers, companies and asset managers say. Some asset managers even complain they lack enough analysts to scrutinize - for example - three drug retailers or a dozen construction companies simultaneously seeking a flotation.
'MORE SELECTIVE'
""There is certainly new money flowing from government bonds to equities, but not enough for all these share offerings,"" said asset manager Renato Ometto, at Maua Capital, which has 6 billion reais under management. ""To buy all these IPOs, I would have to sell another stock in my portfolio and I don't want to do that.""
Almost 50 Brazilian companies have filed for an IPO by year-end and many other had been eyeing flotations, bankers say. Such a massive pipeline has not been seen since 2007, when 64 companies were listed, but over a 12-month period.
Many of the IPOs that have gotten off the ground have quickly come back to earth, posting disappointing returns and making fund managers and retail investors more skeptical about the next ones. Out of 18 IPOs by Brazilian companies this year, only 10 are trading above their IPO prices.
""With so many IPOs, investors have more bargaining power and are being more selective,"" said Eduardo Miras, Brazil head of investment banking at Citi. ""But the market hasn't closed, things will find an equilibrium.""
Credit bureau Boa Vista Servicos SA on Monday successfully priced its shares at the mid-point of its pricing range, raising $383 million. And Caixa Seguridade is mulling a comeback in December in what would be its third IPO attempt this year.
""Benchmark interest rates are at record lows. This is very constructive for the economy,"" said Eduardo Mendez, head of Latin America Equity Capital Markets at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). ""Clouds are visible in the sky, but there is no hurricane on the horizon,"" he added.

The exact terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the companies said Mubadala will acquire a minority stake in Silver Lake from Dyal Capital Partners, a unit of U.S.-based investment management firm Neuberger Berman, through a secondary transaction.
Dyal, which acquired a stake of less than 10% in Silver Lake in 2016, will retain roughly half of its original investment.
Buyout funds typically have a 10-year time frame to deploy capital, but under the terms of this deal, Silver Lake will have 25 years to invest the funds.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Wednesday, as the chaotic nature of the first presidential debate raised concerns of a contested election result. 
By 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 17 points, or 0.5%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 170 points, or 0.6%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 67 points, or 0.6%. 
The major U.S. cash indices are on course to close down for the month, for the first time since March. Indeed, as it stands, this would be the weakest September for stocks since 2011.
President Trump and his Democratic challenger, former Vice President Biden, faced off in their first debate of the campaign in Cleveland on Tuesday, an event that offered little of substance with both sides seemingly keen to trade insults.
Trump again declined to say he would accept the results of the election, instead railing against mail-in ballots and warning that the contest would not “end well.”
""Investors have gone back to worrying about a contested election, a delay in the outcome and whether Trump will go peacefully if he loses,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital, in a Reuters report.
Meanwhile, the United States recorded 42,185 new coronavirus infections and 914 virus-related deaths on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a citywide daily rate of positive virus tests of 3.25%, the highest daily rate since June.
On the data slate, the third print for Q2 GDP is expected to be unchanged, showing a drop of 31.7%, ADP nonfarm employment is forecast to show a bump of 650,000 for September from 428,000 in the previous month, and pending home sales are forecast to have increased 3.2% in August from July, when they rose 5.9%. 
In corporate news, the focus is likely to be on Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), as the data-mining firm starts trading on the New York Stock Exchange via a direct listing. The company has attracted a lot of interest since starting in 2003, backed by money from the CIA to develop software for the government. 
Oil prices fell Wednesday, continuing the sharp losses of the previous session, on the back of worries about future consumption. Oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) vividly illustrated these concerns, saying it’s set to cut up to 9,000 more jobs.

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - China is preparing to launch an antitrust probe into Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, looking into allegations it has leveraged the dominance of its Android mobile operating system to stifle competition, two people familiar with the matter said.
The case was proposed by telecommunications equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd last year and has been submitted by the country's top market regulator to the State Council's antitrust committee for review, they added.
A decision on whether to proceed with a formal investigation may come as soon as October and could be affected by the state of China's relationship with the United States, one of the people said.
The potential investigation follows a raft of actions by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to hobble Chinese tech companies, citing national security risks.
This has included putting Huawei on its trade blacklist, threatening similar action for Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981) and ordering TikTok owner ByteDance to divest the short-form video app.
It also comes as China embarks on a major revamp of its antitrust laws with proposed amendments including a dramatic increase in maximum fines and expanded criteria for judging a company's control of a market.
A potential probe would also look at accusations that Google's market position could cause ""extreme damage"" to Chinese companies like Huawei, as losing the U.S. tech giant's support for Android-based operating systems would lead to loss of confidence and revenue, a second person said.
The sources were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter and declined to be identified. Google did not provide immediate comment, while Huawei declined to comment.
China's top market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and the State Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
EUROPE'S EXAMPLE
The U.S. trade blacklist bars Google from providing technical support to new Huawei phone models and access to Google Mobile Services, the bundle of developer services upon which most Android apps are based.
Google had a temporary licence that exempted it from the ban on Huawei but it expired in August.
It was not immediately clear what Google services the potential probe would focus on. Most Chinese smartphone vendors use an open-source version of the Android platform with alternatives to Google services on their domestic phones. Google's search, email and other services are blocked in China.
Huawei has said it missed its 2019 revenue target by $12 billion, which company officials have attributed to U.S. actions against it. Seeking to overcome its reliance on Google, the Chinese firm announced plans this month to introduce its proprietary Harmony operating system in smartphones next year. 
Chinese regulators will be looking at examples set by their peers in Europe and in India if it proceeds with the antitrust investigation, the first source said.
""China will also look at what other countries have done, including holding inquiries with Google executives,"" said the person.
The second source added that one learning point would be how fines are levied based on a firm's global revenues rather than local revenues.
The European Union fined Google 4.3 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in 2018 over anticompetitive practices, including forcing phone makers to pre-install Google apps on Android devices and blocking them from using rivals to Google's Android and search engine. 
That decision prompted Google to give European users more choice over default search tools and giving handset makers more leeway to use competing systems.
Indian authorities are looking into allegations that Google is abusing its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app.

581,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>","Shell to cut up to 9,000 jobs in low-carbon transition","By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) announced on Wednesday plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs, or over 10% of its workforce, as part of a major overhaul to shift the oil and gas giant to low-carbon energy.
Shell, which had 83,000 employees at the end of 2019, said that the reorganisation will lead to additional annual savings of around $2 billion to $2.5 billion by 2022, going partly beyond cuts of $3 to $4 billion announced earlier this year.
Shell's London-traded shares were up 0.15% by 0920 GMT, compared with 0.9% gains for the broader energy sector.
Last month it launched a broad review of its business aimed at cutting costs as it prepares to restructure its operations as part of the shift to low-carbon energy.
The Anglo-Dutch company said it expected to cut 7,000 to 9,000 jobs by the end of 2022, including some 1,500 people who have agreed to take voluntary redundancy this year.
Rival BP (NYSE:BP) this year announced plans to cut around 10,000 jobs as part of CEO Bernard Looney's plans to rapidly expand its renewables business and reduce oil and gas production.
Reducing costs is vital for Shell's plans to move into the power sector and renewables where margins are relatively low.
Competition is also likely to intensify with utilities and rival oil firms including BP and Total all battling for market share as economies around the world go green.
""We have looked closely at how we are organised and we feel that, in many places, we have too many layers in the company,"" CEO Ben van Beurden said in an internal interview published on Shell's website.
FUEL SALES RECOVERY
In an operations update, Shell also said its oil and gas production was set to drop sharply in the third quarter to around 3.04 million barrels of oil equivalent per day due to lower output as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and hurricanes that forced offshore platforms to shut down.
(Graphic - Shell's oil and gas production: https://graphics.reuters.com/SHELL-PRODUCTION/xklvyqjyrvg/chart.png)
Shell, the world's largest fuel retailer, saw a recovery in fuel sales in the third quarter from lows hit in the previous quarter as some countries gradually emerged from lockdown measures.
In the second quarter, Shell narrowly avoided its first quarterly loss in recent history, helped by a booming trading business. It however announced nearly $16.8 billion in impairment charges after sharply lowering its outlook for oil and gas prices in the wake of the pandemic.
Shell said it will take another impairment charge of $1 to $1.5 billion in the third quarter.
Shell is exploring ways to reduce spending on oil and gas production, its largest division known as upstream, by 30% to 40% through cuts in operating costs and capital spending on new projects, two sources involved with the review told Reuters earlier this month.
""The transformation to a leaner and lower-carbon organisation is the right one for Shell longer term in our view, but with the macro environment still challenging this may take some time to reflect in the share price,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note.
Shell said on Wednesday it also plans to reduce the number of its refineries to less than 10 from 17 currently and over 55 15 years ago.
""If we want to get there, if we want to succeed as an integral part of a society heading towards net-zero (carbon) emissions, now is the time to accelerate,"" van Beurden said.

582,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Shell Adds a Chapter to Big Oil's 2020 Tale of Woe,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) is cutting costs as fast as it can, but it still can’t promise a turnaround in profitability.
The Anglo-Dutch oil major said on Wednesday it will cut between 7,000 and 9,000 jobs by the end of 2022 –  representing 8%-11% of its global workforce – in an effort to make itself fit for a period of sustained low prices and a possible long-term decline in demand for fossil fuels.
The move had been flagged weeks ago by CEO Ben van Beurden, who said in a statement on the company’s website that “we have too many layers in the company: too many levels between me, as the CEO, and the operators and technicians at our locations.”
Before the pandemic, such an announcement would almost certainly have been greeted with enthusiasm by investors who would have seen it as safeguarding the company’s profitability and hence their precious dividend. However, investors no longer believe that the good days will ever return. When Shell cut its dividend in the summer, for the first time since World War 2, it effectively acknowledged as much.
Van Beurden is leading his remaining investors into the terra incognita of the energy transition and all that is known about that is that electricity – especially renewable electricity - has been a lot less profitable than oil and gas for as long as anyone can remember.
Even if Shell can make a success of transitioning to a new, green energy model, it still has to manage a balance sheet full of oil and gas assets for which it paid billions, and which may never be monetized. The company said impairments in the third quarter would be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, a sharp drop from the write-offs earlier in the year, but still a move that points to ongoing pressure on the asset side of the balance sheet.
Such pressure is feeding market doubts that Shell will be able to sustain a payout that it has already cut by two-thirds. After a modest 0.4% rise on Wednesday morning, Shell stock now yields 5.2%, a return that is jarringly out of line with the broader market.
Optimists will argue that the stabilization of crude prices – and the cyclical rebound that has always followed periods when the industry has cut back investment in new fields – makes Shell at least a bet that can go both ways from here. After all, the stock has lost over one-third of its value since June and 60% since last September. Skeptics will want to see the company's rising debt ratio, or gearing, stabilize before they are convinced.
Shell can surely one day expect a cyclical tailwind to turn its stock around. However, the secular headwind that is climate change and an investment focus on mitigating it is never going to fade."

PARIS (Reuters) - French waste and water company Veolia (PA:VIE) hiked its bid for a stake in rival Suez (PA:SEVI) on Wednesday, and offered a negotiating window for any subsequent full takeover proposal after its initial approach was rebuffed. 
Veolia said it had raised its offer for a 29.9% stake in Suez held by power group Engie (PA:ENGIE) to 3.4 billion euros ($4 billion) from 2.9 billion euros.
The company has been trying to persuade Engie to sell the stake as prelude to launching a full takeover bid for Suez, arguing the two would form a global waste and water champion better equipped to take on rivals, including from China. 
But Suez has vehemently rejected the approach, describing it as hostile, and set about creating a foundation for its French water business, which could be a hurdle for any Veolia takeover. 
That has led to an increasingly acrimonious tit-for-tat which the French government, a shareholder in Engie, has been trying to defuse. 
Veolia on Wednesday piled the pressure on Engie to come to a swift decision by saying its new 18 euros per share offer - up from 15.5 euros previously - would expire by the end of the day, sticking to a timetable it had set itself at the end of August.
""It (the offer) is still due to run out at midnight tonight,"" Veolia Chief Executive Antoine Frerot told reporters. 
But Veolia also amended its bid by saying it would only launch a subsequent tender offer for the whole of Suez with the blessing of the company's board, and offered a six month period during which to negotiate, should it acquire the 29.9% stake. 
Suez shares were up 7.2% to 15.99 euros at 0829 GMT. A full bid for Suez at 18 euros per share would value the company at 11.2 billion euros. 
HURDLES
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Wednesday urged Veolia to do everything to keep its approach friendly and said the parties needed time to work things out. Speaking before details of Veolia's revised offer emerged, he told LCI TV that the government would not be beholden to any ultimatums. 
The French state has a 23.6% stake in Engie, which in turn has 32% in Suez. 
Engie said its board was due to meet later, but declined to comment further. 
Engie had been holding out for a higher bid and had said it would also be interested in any alternative proposals Suez might come with for the stake, which it had already earmarked for disposal, but so far no rival buyers have emerged. 
Veolia has tried to pre-empt any anti-trust problems with its acquisition project by announcing a plan to sell Suez's water business in France should the two conclude a deal.
But Suez has hit back, saying Veolia's approach was opportunistic and would destroy jobs.

584,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>","More hedge funds launch in April-June period, after first-quarter 12-year low","LONDON (Reuters) - A total of 129 new hedge funds launched in the April-June quarter this year, recovering from the previous quarter's 12-year low as investor confidence slowly recovered from the COVID-19 hit, according to industry tracker Hedge Fund Research.
The second-quarter number was the highest since the year-ago period when 153 hedge funds started trading, HFR said in a report on Wednesday.
Many hedge funds put launches on hold at the start of the year as the new coronavirus pandemic hit markets and sent investors fleeing for safe-haven assets.
Against that backdrop, just 84 hedge funds launched in the first three months of the year in the worst quarter since the financial crisis, according to the data.
""As investor risk tolerance continues to recover into the second half of the year, institutions are expecting to increase or begin implementing allocations to hedge funds as components of diversified portfolio allocation and in response to the equity and credit market volatility of early 2020,"" HFR president Kenneth Heinz said.
However, the number of launches was dwarfed by the 178 hedge funds that HFR said had shut down in the second quarter, although that was down from a four-year-high of 304 in the preceding three months.

Volkswagen and Audi were caught disguising excessive diesel pollution by using illegal engine management software to falsify emissions readings during anti-pollution tests. 
The carmaker initially claimed the fraud was the work of a handful of engineers, and that no senior managers were involved, but testimony from a raft employees led prosecutors to remand Stadler in custody for four months in 2018.
He arrived in court in a Mercedes-Benz to face trial which is expected to take until 2022. Stadler is accused of knowingly selling cars which had manipulated engine software and did not comply with environmental standards.

The company, which makes around 5% of the world's steel, said last year it aimed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 30% by 2030.
President and chief financial officer Aditya Mittal made the new commitment before speaking about the challenge of decarbonising steel at a conference.
He said in a statement all regions of the world would have to contribute to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
""As the world's leading steel company, we believe we have a responsibility to lead the efforts to decarbonise the steel-making process, which today has a significant carbon footprint,"" he said.
ArcelorMittal has pilot projects looking into two areas - use of hydrogen to convert iron ore to iron and ways of becoming carbon neutral by using sustainable biomass or carbon capture and storage.
The company also set out certain policies required to hit the carbon neutral target.
Mechanisms such as green border adjustments were needed so that producers could not import cheaper steel made under less stringent environmental criteria elsewhere.
Clean energy must be abundant and affordable, necessary infrastructure and finance must be in place and policymakers should accelerate the transition to a circular economy, the steelmaker said.
ArcelorMittal said it would give more details of its plans before the end of this year.

587,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 04:11AM ET</span>",Height of fashion? Clothes mountains build up as recycling breaks down,"By Sonya Dowsett and George Obulutsa
MADRID/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Clothes recycling is the pressure-release valve of fast fashion, and it's breaking under COVID-19 curbs.
The multi-billion-dollar trade in second-hand clothing helps prevent the global fashion industry's growing pile of waste going straight to landfill, while keeping wardrobes clear for next season's designs. But it's facing a crisis. 
Exporters are struggling, as are traders and customers in often poorer nations from Africa to Eastern Europe and Latin America who rely on a steady supply of used clothes.
The signs are everywhere.
From London to Los Angeles, many thrift shops and clothing banks outside stores and on streets have been deluged with more clothes than could be sold on, leading to mountains of garments building up in sorting warehouses. 
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began early this year, textile recyclers and exporters have had to cut their prices to shift stock as lockdown measures restrict movement and business slows in end markets abroad. For many, it's no longer commercially viable and they can't afford to move merchandise.
""We are reaching the point where our warehouses are completely full,"" Antonio de Carvalho, boss of a textile recycling company in Stourbridge, central England, wrote to a client in June, asking for a price cut for clothes he collects. 
De Carvalho pays towns for clothing collected in his containers then sells it on at profit to traders overseas.
Since May, he said, the price he has been able to charge overseas buyers had dropped from 570 pounds ($726) a tonne to 400 pounds, making it hard for his company, Green World Recycling, to cover the costs of collecting and storing items. 
Buyers were also asking to increase the credit periods before they had to pay from 15 days to 45-60 days, adding to cash-flow problems, de Carvalho wrote. 
""We are losing ... a huge amount of money, making a big loss for the operation.""
'GOING OUT OF BUSINESS'
De Carvalho's experience is mirrored across the sector, suggesting that, even once the pandemic passes, the battered trade could take a long time to recover.
Recyclers are removing clothes banks from streets, reducing the number of times they are emptied per week and looking at laying off workers to conserve cash, according to Reuters interviews with 16 market players in Britain, the United States, Germany and the Netherlands. 
At the same time, in a bleak irony for such firms, donations have mounted as people stuck at home clear out their wardrobes - a boon in normal times.  
""This is unlike any other recession in a century,"" said Jackie King, executive director of U.S. trade body the Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles Association (SMART). ""I would anticipate there will be companies going out of business.""
The retreat of recyclers is having far-reaching consequences for an industry that has seen an annual average of more than $4 billion of used clothing exported globally over the five years to 2019, according to U.N. trade data. 
Exports have shrunk this year.
In Britain, the weight of used clothing exported from March to July was around half what it was for the same period last year, official trade data shows. Exports improved in July - the latest month on record - as merchants rushed to shift stock as countries began to re-open, but were still down around 30%.
In the United States, the value of exports from March to July fell 45% compared with the same period last year, government data shows. 
Up to a third of clothes donated in the United States - the world's biggest exporter of used clothing - ends up for sale in markets in the developing world.
KENYAN WOES
The consequences of the decline can be seen in countries like Kenya, which imported 176,000 tonnes of second-hand clothing in 2018, equivalent to over 335 million pairs of jeans.
Business is sluggish in the open-air Gikomba market in Nairobi, one of the biggest second-hand clothes market in East Africa. Shop assistants stand idle while traders call out to shoppers asking them to try their garments
Traders have been hit with a double-whammy of the shrinking supply, exacerbated by the government banning the import of used textiles in March on concerns they could carry the novel coronavirus, and a drop in footfall due to people staying home.
""Before coronavirus came in, I would manage to sell at least 50 (pairs of) trousers a day,"" said trader Nicholas Mutisya, who sells jeans and hats. ""But now with coronavirus, even selling one a day has become difficult."" 
""We cannot buy bales (of clothes) directly, so we buy our stock from those who have already bought them.""
The ban on used textiles imports was lifted in August after pushback from traders in Kenya and industry bodies in Europe and the United States who said second-hand clothes were safe as the virus could not survive the journey to Africa.
Yet the struggle continues for traders like Mutisya and Anthony Kang'ethe, who works as a driver for a shop selling second-hand clothes in bales shipped from Britain. He said the business had been hit hard by the supply crunch.
""Before we used to have five workers in our company,"" Kang'ethe said. ""We are left with two.""
DARK SIDE OF FASHION
Large-scale commercial trade in second-hand clothing from Europe and the United States to emerging markets took off in a big way in the 1990s due to growing African and Eastern European demand for Western fashion.
Such demand has provided a badly needed release value for a booming fashion market, where clothing production has approximately doubled over the past 15 years, according to sustainability charity the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.
The fashion industry is the second-biggest consumer of water and is responsible for up to 10% of global carbon emissions - more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined, the U.N.'s environment programme said in March 2019.
Meanwhile, clothes account for a massive, and growing, pile of waste that ends up in landfills.
In Britain, shoppers buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe, amounting to some five times more than what they bought in the 1980s, according to a 2019 UK parliamentary report by the Environmental Audit Committee.
About 300,000 tonnes of clothing goes to landfill or incineration per year, the report said.
The United States produces just under 17 million U.S. tons (15.4 tonnes) of textile waste per year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency - equivalent to around 29 billion pairs of jeans. Two-thirds of this ends up in landfills.
Many fashion retailers, including Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and H&M, encourage shoppers to bring unwanted textiles to their stores for collection and, in the case of H&M, even offer discounts on new purchases in exchange.
Only a small proportion of clothes collected by Inditex end up for sale in international markets, a company spokesman said. H&M said clothing collected in its stores was processed by I:CO, a unit of German textile recycling company Soex.
""The whole problem is just getting bigger,"" said Anna Smith, a doctoral researcher at King's College London looking at a so-called circular economic system, which aims to eliminate waste. 

""People are consuming more and more.""

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Wednesday, with positive economic data not being sufficient to offset investor worries following a heated first U.S. presidential debate.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index fell 0.2%.
German retail sales rose much more than expected in August, climbing by 3.1% on the month after an upwardly revised drop of 0.2% in July, raising hopes that household spending in Europe's largest economy will help the region recover in the third quarter. The country's  unemployment data also surprised to the upside, with the unemployment rate falling to 6.3% in September, compared to expectations that it would stay at 6.4%.
Britain's economy also shrank by less than originally estimated in the second quarter, still a record 19.8% drop, but better than the initial estimate of a 20.4% fall in output. Additionally, U.K. house prices posted their biggest annual gain since 2016 in September.
Earlier Wednesday, Chinese PMI data showed that the world’s second-largest economy's recovery continues to progress. 
This positive news wasn’t able to overcome the caution that took hold of the markets after a contentious presidential debate in which Donald Trump again cast doubt on whether he would accept the election's outcome.
In corporate news, Veolia (PA:VIE) stock rose 1.4% after the French waste and water giant raised its bid for most of Engie’s stake in Suez (PA:SEVI) making a final push to clinch a deal that would be a prelude to a full takeover. Suez shares rose 7%, while Engie stock rose 1.6%.
 William Hill  (LON:WMH) stock fell 0.5% after the board of the U.K. bookmaker said it had agreed to be acquired by Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment at a price of 272p/share, which valued it at 2.9 billion pounds ($3.72 billion).
Oil prices fell Wednesday, continuing the sharp losses of the previous session, on the back of worries about future consumption amid the Covid-19 pandemic and continued oversupply issues. Oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) stock rose 1.2% after it said it would cut up to 9,000 more jobs as it wrestles with a new environment of low prices and potentially lower long-term demand.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showed a draw of 831,000 barrels for last week, as against an expected build of 1.4 million barrels, but this wasn't enough to push the market higher. 
Investors now await crude inventory data from the Energy Information Administration later in the session. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $38.98 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.9% to $41.19. Both contracts closed more than 3% lower on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,892/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1730 after ECB President Christine Lagarde, in a keynote speech, flagged the likelihood of a softer inflation target in future

589,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>","Libor’s Exit Sparks Legal Fears for Global Banks, Moody’s Says","(Bloomberg) -- While most global banks say they’re gearing up for a shift from Libor, concerns persist about lawsuits if borrowers reach a cliff-edge scenario, according to Moody’s Investors Service.
Banks’ clients are lagging in their effort to prepare for Libor’s exit and this could come back to haunt lenders, Vice President Olivier Panis said in an interview on Tuesday. Financial institutions risk litigation and fines for misconduct if clients say they hadn’t fully understood the consequences of a shift to a replacement benchmark after the London Interbank Offered Rate expires at the end of 2021, he said.
“These are the risks that financial institutions see as most important,” Panis said. “Banks have recruited entire project teams and the chief financial officers are involved in market discussions so they are the front of this massive global reform. Most of their borrowers are not, they just follow.”
It’s a sign of uneven progress in winding down Libor, which underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars of global assets, from student loans and mortgages to interest-rate swaps and collateralized loan obligations. International regulators are developing new replacement rates after trading that informed the rate dried up, and European and U.S. banks were found to have manipulated it for their own gain.
Despite Covid-19 disrupting the Libor timetable, nearly 95% of financial institutions still expect the benchmark to retire on time. Some 77% of firms including asset managers and insurers report their transition plans are on schedule, the ratings firm found in a survey.
Meanwhile, borrowers are being “very passive” about the transition, according to Claude Brown, a partner at law firm Reed Smith LLP in London.
“My experience talking to borrowers is they say ‘we don’t need to be proactive, we will wait until we’re contacted and told what needs to be changed’,” Brown said. “If banks say to the Financial Conduct Authority that they’re finding it difficult to get borrowers to engage, they will get short shrift. As we approach the deadline I can see increasing sanctions.”
Lenders will now be stepping up their communication plans with clients to ensure they understand the transition in full, according to Moody’s.
“A lot of banks said the easiest part is spending, developing in-house solutions,” Panis said. “Making sure that clients will be ready for the new contracts and have their treasury systems ready is the difficult part.”
Banks are intensifying their exit plans, with U.K. lender Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LON:LLOY) seeking holders’ permission to switch bonds from Libor to the Sterling Overnight Index Average, known as Sonia.
Earlier this month Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and Lloyds completed one of the first cross-currency swaps using Libor’s replacements, marking the latest step in the long exodus away from the rate.
Federal Reserve Bank of New York General Counsel Michael Held on Tuesday urged firms not to delay the transition. The process encompasses “legal risk, but also operational risk, credit risk, regulatory risk, reputational risk, you name it -- Libor has it all,” he said. “The possibility of a failed Libor transition is something that should keep all of us up at night.”

Job reductions of 7,000 to 9,000 are expected by the end of 2022, including around 1,500 people taking voluntary redundancy this year, Shell said Wednesday in a statement. The company sees sustainable annual cost savings of $2 billion to $2.5 billion by that time.
“We have to be a simpler, more streamlined, more competitive organization,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said. “We feel that, in many places, we have too many layers in the company: too many levels between me, as the CEO, and the operators and technicians at our locations.”
The move adds to the growing list of major announcements this year which has seen Big Oil slash dividends, take multibillion-dollar writedowns and ax jobs following oil’s coronavirus-induced plunge. BP (NYSE:BP) Plc said in June it planned to cut 10,000 jobs as it moved into cleaner energy,  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) intends to trim 10% to 15% of its global workforce, while  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). is reviewing staffing country by country.
Shell began the process in May, when Van Beurden told staff in a memo that it was reshaping the company to make it leaner and more resilient and that there could be redundancies in the second half of the year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The Anglo-Dutch major offered voluntary severance, scaled back recruitment and reviewed expatriate staff contracts.
The reorganization is also designed to further Shell’s expanded green ambitions. The company said in April it planned to eliminate all net emissions from its own operations and the bulk of greenhouse gases from fuel it sells to its customers by 2050. Shell also said that ultimately, it would only do business with emission-free companies.
The company also flagged on Wednesday that it expects oil-product sales volumes in the third quarter to be 4 million to 5 million barrels a day. Refining margins will be “significantly” lower than in the second quarter. It also sees post-tax impairment charges of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
Shell is scheduled to publish quarterly results on Oct. 29.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday, with investors acting cautiously following a heated first U.S. presidential debate and despite data suggesting China’s recovery remains on track.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.9% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.7%. 
Chinese data released earlier Wednesday showed that the world’s second-largest economy's recovery continues to progress. The September manufacturing PMI came in at 51.5, beating August’s 51 reading, and the non-manufacturing PMI was 55.9 against August’s 55.2 - both remaining above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
“China has been in the lead in terms of the Asia recovery story, but there is little doubt that its recovery also helps pull the rest of Asia along in its wake,” wrote ING’s Robert Carnell, in a research note.
However, this positive economic news has been unable to persuade investors to put their money to work, judging by the weak tone in the futures markets, with Covid-19 infections on the rise again globally and after a contentious presidential debate in which President Donald Trump again cast doubt on whether he would accept the election's outcome.
""What people are most concerned about is the fairness of the election and how it will be carried out...under normal circumstances, the positive economic data from China we've seen would support risk-on trades, but this time is different,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank in Tokyo, in a Reuters report.
Turning back to Europe, the U.K. GDP was revised to show a drop of 19.8% in the second quarter compared with the first, after the initial estimate showed a drop of 20.4%, while German retail sales rose a better than expected 3.% in August.
Later in the session sees the release of German unemployment data for September, which will be studied carefully as an indicator of the strength of the economic recovery in Europe’s largest economy.

Chairman Mukesh Ambani said Reliance would leverage General Atlantic's ""extensive expertise at the intersection of technology and consumer businesses"" to expand its new commerce venture, tying neighbourhood stores for online deliveries of groceries, apparel and electronics.
With the latest investment from General Atlantic — which has also invested in Airbnb, Slack and Uber (NYSE:UBER) — Reliance has now raised around $2.3 billion for its retail arm.
General Atlantic is also an investor in Reliance's digital business Jio platforms, and sources told Reuters this week Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Co is in advanced talks to invest up to $1 billion in the company's retail unit. 
In India, competition for market share has prompted e-commerce players to look for new partnerships. Financial daily Mint reported on Tuesday U.S. retailer Walmart was in talks to invest up to $25 billion in Tata Group's planned ""super-app"", which will tie in all of the conglomerate's consumer businesses.
Reliance Industries' shares rose as much as 1% to 2,267 rupees as of 0413 GMT.

(Reuters) - The World Trade Organization has authorized the European Union to impose tariffs on U.S. goods worth $4 billion to retaliate against subsidies for American planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA), people familiar with the matter said.
The delayed award provides a fresh source of potential trade friction weeks before November's U.S. presidential election, after Washington last year began imposing tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods over state support for Boeing rival Airbus (PA:AIR).
The two sides have been locked in a 16-year-old dispute at the Geneva-based WTO over aid to their aircraft industries in a pair of cases that together represent the world's largest-ever corporate trade dispute.
They were informed of the decision by WTO arbitrators on Friday, and the award is expected to be published within weeks.
The U.S. Trade Representative and the EU's Washington office did not immediately answer requests for comment. 
Boeing declined to comment on the confidential WTO report but accused Airbus of ignoring its recent decision to forgo tax breaks in Washington state to try to resolve the dispute.
Airbus, which recently announced its own concessions on funding in France and Spain, was not immediately available.
Sources on both sides said EU tariffs on products such as Boeing jets, which must still be adopted formally by the WTO, were unlikely to be imposed before the Nov. 3 presidential election as Brussels seeks to avoid inflaming a bitter campaign.
Both sides are expected to claim victory, however, with U.S. sources pointing to the higher core tariffs in favor of Boeing.
European sources said the latest award does not include some $4.2 billion of tariffs against the United States left over from an earlier case, giving the EU $8.2 billion in total firepower.
The United States says the previous award, granting the EU tariffs to retaliate against special tax treatment for U.S. exporters, which the EU never implemented, is no longer valid because a law creating the disputed system was repealed in 2006.
The WTO has refused to be drawn into the controversy over unused tariffs, saying it has nothing to add to previous rulings on the former system of U.S. Foreign Sales Corporations.
Analysts say the eagerly awaited ruling on EU counter-tariffs could finally ease years of deadlock, during which both sides signaled interest in settling the aircraft dispute while accusing the other of refusing to talk seriously.

""Everybody’s been waiting for this. It sets the stage for a negotiation,"" said William Reinsch, a former senior U.S. Commerce Department official and trade expert at the Council on Strategic and International Studies.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Lawyers for the Canadian government asked a judge on Tuesday to keep Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's extradition case to the United States ""on the straight and narrow"" and described the evidence presented by the defence as inadmissible.
Government lawyer Robert Frater asked the judge to throw out the defence's arguments and end their effort to add an allegation that the U.S. government had abused the process.
Lawyers for Meng told the court that the United States extradition request to Canada is based on so many ""omissions and misrepresentations that it's unreliable and ineffective.""
Tuesday's arguments are the latest in a series of hearings in a case that has strained China's relations with the United States and Canada.
Meng, 48, was arrested in December 2018 on a warrant from the United States charging her with bank fraud for misleading HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran and causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions law.
The daughter of billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition while under house arrest in Vancouver.
Frater said the judge should disregard the defence’s arguments around who knew what at HSBC and accused the defence of attempting to litigate the fraud charges against Meng in the extradition case.
Frater asked the judge to keep the case ""on the straight and narrow"" and ""refuse to spend precious court time on issues that have no hope of success.""
The crux of Meng's argument is that the United States misrepresented the case when it asked Canadian officials to arrest her.
Huawei has long described Skycom Tech Co Ltd as a separate local business partner in Iran, but the U.S. indictment said Huawei controlled Skycom and used it to violate U.S. sanctions.
The United States has used part of a PowerPoint presentation given by Meng to HSBC as proof of fraud, but Meng and her lawyers argue otherwise.
""No banker would leave that meeting thinking that Huawei had distanced itself from Skycom,"" Frank Addario, one of Meng's lawyers, told the court on Tuesday, adding that ""HSBC knew what it was getting into.""
The judge must decide whether the defence's latest allegation is plausible enough to be worth fully litigating. 
If the judge rules in Meng's favor, an additional set of hearings will be added to the case schedule for arguments.
A decision on this issue is expected by Oct. 30.

The hearing is expected to wrap up on Wednesday. Meng's extradition case is scheduled to finish in April 2021.

597,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 12:15AM ET</span>",Seattle approves minimum pay rate for Uber and Lyft drivers,"(Reuters) - The Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers for companies like  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) on Tuesday.
Under the ordinance, effective January, the drivers will now earn at least $16.39 per hour - the minimum wage in Seattle for companies with more than 500 employees. 
Seattle's law, modeled after a similar regulation in New York City, aims to reduce the amount of time drivers spend ""cruising"" without a passenger by paying drivers more during those times. 
City officials argue this should prevent Uber and Lyft from oversaturating the market at drivers' expense, but the companies say it would effectively force them to block some drivers access to the app. Both Uber and Lyft have locked out drivers in response to the NYC law.
""The City's plan is deeply flawed and will actually destroy jobs for thousands of people — as many as 4,000 drivers on Lyft alone — and drive rideshare companies out of Seattle,"" Lyft said in a statement. 
Uber did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and New York's New School, who analyzed the Seattle ride-hailing market using city data and a driver survey, found drivers net only about $9.70 an hour, with a third of all drivers working more than 32 hours per week.

But a study of data provided by Uber and Lyft showed most ride-hail workers in Seattle are part-time drivers whose earnings are roughly in line with the city's median, defying some perceptions of drivers working full-time for little pay.

Maggie Wu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, made the remarks at an livestreamed investor day event.
The company, a dominant player in China's cloud market, is fending off challenge from domestic rival Tencent (HK:0700) which is also trying to capture cloud business opportunities. 
Alibaba has said it would invest 200 billion yuan ($29.36 billion) in its cloud infrastructure over three years.
In the June quarter, Alibaba's cloud computing revenue grew 59% from a year earlier to 12,345 million yuan on higher revenue contribution from its public cloud and hybrid cloud businesses.

Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics unit, will likely see operating cash flow turn positive in fiscal year 2021, Wu added.

600,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 11:54PM ET</span>",Alibaba Expects First Profit From its Cloud Arm This Year,"(Bloomberg) --  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. foresees its cloud services arm turning profitable for the first time this year, a milestone for the decade-old business that underscores how Asia’s largest corporation expects a return to pre-pandemic levels as China’s economy rebounds.
Alibaba’s shares rose as much as 4% in Hong Kong, their biggest intraday gain in over a month. Its internet computing business is growing roughly 60% at an annual revenue run rate of about $7 billion, Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu told investors at an annual company conference. The unit should turn profitable in the year ending March, she said.
Cainiao, the logistics service Alibaba folded fully into its broader empire in 2017, should generate positive cash-flow on an operating basis over the same period, she added.
China’s most valuable corporation has invested billions in hosting computing for corporations over the cloud, while building a nationwide logistics network that can handle the billions of parcels its e-commerce business throws out. Achieving profitability will boost Alibaba as it tries to revitalize growth alongside a recovery in the broader Chinese economy. The e-commerce giant is riding a pick-up in consumer spending -- particularly online -- in a country among the first to recover from Covid-19.
“We typically spend 8 to 10 years incubating, nurturing and growing a new business,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang told investors. “We still regard ourselves to be in the nascent stage of the global cloud era.”
Like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).’s, Alibaba’s cloud service emerged from the computational power needed to handle billions of online shopping transactions to become one of its fastest-growing initiatives. The Chinese company today relies on the service, which competes globally with Amazon Web Services,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), to underpin both its global expansion and forays into newer arenas such as live-streaming.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
China’s investment in new infrastructure -- including 5G networks and data centers -- could reach 8-10 trillion yuan in its 14th Five-Year Plan, taking the limelight from traditional projects that may still make up more than 80% of infrastructure spending. A dual development push could buttress the economy while laying the foundation for technology-driven long-term growth.

Alibaba’s cloud business continued to grow during the global Covid-19 shutdowns this year. It held a leading 40.1% share of China’s total cloud infrastructure services spending in the June quarter, more than double its closest competitors, according to industry researcher Canalys. Even as economies start to recover, the company is aiming to take advantage of the shift to upgrade more corporate IT infrastructures to the cloud and boost cloud-based collaboration at work, Zhang told investors Wednesday.
Retail sales in the world’s No. 2 economy rose for the first time this year in August, after virus restrictions eased. The comeback in consumer spending has allowed Alibaba to further expand a $700 billion empire that already spans online retail, food delivery and internet computing. It owns a third of Ant Group, the Chinese financial titan pursuing potentially the world’s largest initial public offering, and most recently outlined plans to create a new line of business by modernizing factories.
Excluding its stake in Ant, Alibaba’s strategic investments are currently valued at $45 billion, Wu told investors on Wednesday, adding that the company will continue to invest in technology and research. Alibaba last year reported an $83 billion stake in its global portfolio of investments, which included its 33% stake in the fintech behemoth.
Zhang -- credited with orchestrating Alibaba’s last big foray into a new arena, with a move into brick-and-mortar retail -- is responding in part to intensifying competition on multiple fronts.  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. has lured small-town buyers away with cheaper bargains, while traditional foe JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. has ventured beyond its traditional strength in consumer electronics into groceries, a category that leapt to the fore during nationwide lockdowns.
Even social media companies like ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. are increasingly reaching out to shoppers through live-streaming -- a route Alibaba pioneered with Taobao Live -- after Covid-19 fueled online entertainment. While rival video apps like Tencent-backed Kuaishou and ByteDance’s Douyin typically directed traffic to Alibaba platforms, they’re now seeking to handle the transactions by themselves.
Then there’s sustained competition in food delivery. Alibaba’s Ele.me now directs flowers, housekeepers and masseurs to doorsteps in addition to lunchboxes, while Tencent-backed Meituan Dianping (OTC:MPNGF) tries its hand on beauty products and smartphones.
With more than 1 billion annual active consumers, Alibaba generated over $1 trillion in gross merchandise value in the 12 months ended June, Wu said. Spending on its platforms accounted for about 18% of China’s total retail sales, up from about 10% in 2015.
“Domestic consumption, cloud computing and data intelligence, and globalization -- these are the three growth engines for Alibaba’s future,” Zhang said. “Digitalization is the biggest opportunity of our time.”

601,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 11:09PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Stocks’ Yawning Gap Versus World Keeps Getting Wider,"(Bloomberg) -- Stock investors lost more money in Hong Kong than in most places this quarter. Again.
The Hang Seng Index has lost nearly 3%, lagging MSCI Inc.’s gauge of global stocks by more than 10 percentage points for a second quarter running. The Hong Kong benchmark has not seen back-to-back underperformance of that magnitude in data going back to the 1990s. Nearly a third of Hang Seng members lost 11% or more during the period.
A massive rally in the onshore market and a strengthening yuan had helped drive a promising start to the third quarter, but optimism quickly faded. The index is down 10% from its July high and has breached almost every major support level. Locally-listed mainland banks made up the bulk of the quarter’s worst performers, weakened by Beijing’s call to sacrifice profits to ease the financial hardship of people and businesses hurt by the pandemic, low interest rates and souring loans.
Investors have few reasons to be bullish toward Hong Kong shares, which are among Asia’s worst performers this quarter. Risks include the prospect of U.S. moves against Chinese companies before the November presidential election. Among the Hang Seng’s biggest stocks, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) have become embroiled in tensions between Beijing and Washington. Adding to the gloom is an uncertain outlook for China’s economy -- many Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong derive the majority of their income from the mainland.
“Investors have become increasingly cautious, as anxiety over further U.S. sanctions against Chinese firms prevails,” said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific-Yamaichi. “They refuse to put money in stocks right now until there’s more clarity on the election outcome.”
Tencent had to grapple with President Donald Trump’s effort to ban its messaging app WeChat. The tech giant has gained 4% this quarter, a significant slowdown from its 33% rally in the first half of the year.
HSBC, the third most heavily-weighted stock on the Hang Seng Index, is the worst performer on the gauge this year. Investors have turned bearish on the lender amid accusations of money-laundering and speculation its massive push into China could be thwarted. Its shares tumbled 17% this quarter and hit a 25-year low.
The Hong Kong dollar has been a bright spot in the market. Capital inflows chasing local new listings have pushed the currency toward the strong end of its trading band with the greenback. The city’s de-facto central bank sold a total of $22.9 billion worth of the local dollars to defend its foreign-exchange peg since April, helping to boost interbank liquidity to the highest in three years.
“Stocks will likely remain volatile in October, as more bad news may come before the U.S. elections, given Trump is expected to build his campaign around confronting China” said Banny Lam, head of research at CEB International Investment Corp. “After that, the market direction will be determined by China’s economic recovery, as well as corporate earnings.”

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, with China’s economy continuing to maintain its recovery and Americans tuning into the ongoing, heated U.S. presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.
Trump, currently trailing in the polls, “really needs to outperform tonight,” Rockefeller & Co LLC senior portfolio manager Jimmy Chang said on Bloomberg.
“The market is starting to price in potentially a blue sweep,” in reference to a scenario where the Democrats win both houses of Congress and the White House, implying higher taxes but also more stimulus which would boost reflationary trends and weaken the dollar, Chang added.
Investors were also rebalancing their portfolios on the last trading day of the month and the third quarter.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.54% by 10:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.51% ahead a week-long holiday. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that the world’s second largest economy continues to progress its recovery, with purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) for September remaining above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
The manufacturing PMI was 51.5, beating the forecast 51.2 and August’s 51 readings. The non-manufacturing PMI was 55.9 against August’s 55.2. However, the Caixin manufacturing PMI of 53 was slightly under the forecast 53.1 and August’s 53.1 figures.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.17%, despite Japan releasing data that showed industrial production in August grew 1.7% month-on-month, beating the forecast 1.5% and July’s 8.7% growth.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.58% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.87%.
South Korea’s markets were closed for a holiday.
Investors are also hopeful that the U.S. Congress will pass the $2.2 trillion stimulus package proposed by the Democrats before November’s presidential election. U.S. House of Representative Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday that she is hopeful that a deal will be reached by the end of the week and talks with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin scheduled later in the day.

EU leaders will also reiterate at a summit in Brussels the goal of finalizing by the end of this year negotiations for an “ambitious” EU-China Comprehensive Investment Agreement that would address “current asymmetries in market access, ensures a level playing field, and establishes meaningful commitments on sustainable development,” according to a draft of a joint communique seen by Bloomberg that is subject to changes.
The EU has become increasingly impatient with China, seeking concrete actions from Beijing that would allow European companies to compete in large sectors of China’s economy, which are still effectively closed off to them. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday reiterated China’s commitment to conclude the investment agreement before year end.
The EU will also urge China “to make progress on overcapacity and engage in negotiations on industrial subsidies at the World Trade Organisation,” according to the draft.
The declaration comes amid growing criticism by European leaders of Chinese actions to clamp down on freedoms in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, where Beijing imposed a new national security law in June, angering the U.S. The EU will underline “its serious concerns about the human rights situation in China, including developments in Hong Kong,” the draft said, an assertion almost certain to irk Beijing.
China has repeatedly called such matters its own internal affairs and warned against foreign interference.
The EU is also expected to call on China to assume greater responsibility in dealing with global challenges, including taking more ambitious climate action, and will welcome President Xi Jinping’s recent commitment to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 as a “step in the right direction.”

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) said on Tuesday it will lay off roughly 28,000 employees, mostly at its U.S. theme parks, where attendance has been crushed by the coronavirus pandemic, especially in California where Disneyland remains closed.
About two-thirds of the laid-off employees will be part-time workers, the company said in a statement. 
Disney shut its theme parks worldwide when the novel coronavirus began spreading this year. All but Disneyland - nicknamed the Happiest Place on Earth - reopened, though the company was forced to limit the number of visitors to allow for physical distancing.
""We have made the very difficult decision to begin the process of reducing our workforce at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment at all levels,"" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of the parks unit, said in a statement.
He cited the parks' limited capacity and uncertainty about the pandemic's duration, which he said was ""exacerbated in California by the state's unwillingness to lift restrictions that would allow Disneyland to reopen.""
In a letter to employees, D'Amaro called the move ""heartbreaking."" He said management had tried to avoid layoffs by cutting expenses, suspending projects and streamlining operations. The company had continued to pay health benefits for furloughed workers since April.
""However, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while operating at such limited capacity,"" D'Amaro said. 
Walt Disney World in Florida had employed 77,000 full- and part-time workers before the pandemic, while Disneyland in California employed 32,000.Disney did not disclose how many other U.S. employees work in the parks unit, which includes consumer products, cruise lines and other businesses.
Last week, Disney urged California officials to issue guidelines that would allow Disneyland to welcome visitors again.

On Tuesday, Dr. Mark Ghaly, California's health secretary, said the state had taken a science-based approach to reopening that aimed to ""minimize the health and economic risks that would be caused by opening and shutting repeatedly.""

607,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 09:01PM ET</span>",Luxury brands bank on a raring China market as pandemic lays waste to global demand,"By Sophie Yu and Silvia Aloisi
BEIJING/MILAN (Reuters) - On the southern Chinese island of Hainan, a duty-free shopping paradise, mainland tourists keen to splurge will often patiently line up for an hour or more to enter a Gucci, Tiffany or other luxury brand store.
""I'm mentally working on a shopping list,"" says Zeng Rong, 34, a Beijing-based auditor who is looking forward to her upcoming Hainan trip. ""I'd like to buy a Bottega Veneta bag as well as a coat and a down jacket from Moncler before the weather gets cold.""
With the coronavirus pandemic having sent most of the world's luxury spending into a tailspin and China the only major economy expected to show growth this year, high-end brands now depend more than ever on Chinese consumers like Zeng for sales.
Their spending largesse, which extends across China's biggest cities, is spurring luxury brands to double down on the Chinese market - embracing e-commerce and pushing ahead with store openings whereas in most other countries such plans have been postponed or scaled down.
Lavish events are also back. Louis Vuitton menswear designer Virgil Abloh held a Spring/Summer fashion show before a live audience in Shanghai last month. Prada (OTC:PRDSY) hosted private viewings of its new collection last week - also in Shanghai, the country's fashion capital which has begun to replace Hong Kong as the favoured shopping haven for domestic tourists.
Driven by well-heeled consumers forsaking their usual overseas trips to places like Milan and Paris as well as pent-up demand that built during lockdown, spending in China on luxury goods has surged.
Prada has said the group's China sales jumped 60% in June and 66% in July, while LVMH noted that in some weeks since March when the country came out of lockdown, Louis Vuitton and Dior have seen China sales more than double.
""Mainland China has become the place where all the purchase power is trapped,"" said Mauro Maggioni, Asia Pacific CEO at Italian luxury sneaker and apparel brand Golden Goose which has 21 stores in mainland China. It also opened stores on China's top e-commerce sites last month and plans a new shop in Hainan soon. 
As luxury spending in China reaches new heights for some brands, the Chinese are set to account for around half of all global spending on high-end brands in 2020, up from 37% last year, according to McKinsey & Company.
That said, industry executives say it will not be enough to make up for the near absence of Chinese tourists abroad, who have been responsible for two-thirds of Chinese luxury spending. Total global luxury spending is expected to plunge as much as 35% from last year's $300 billion, according to consultancy Bain.
YOUNG AND FLUSH WITH CASH
China is, however, the place to be. Store numbers for top luxury brands there rose 4% in the first half of 2020, while those for cosmetics brands jumped 8%, according to a report by property consultancy Savills. 
""I can see the continuous potential of the Chinese market,"" Michele Norsa, executive deputy chairman at Italy's Ferragamo, told an earnings briefing this month. The luxury shoe and accessories maker is reviewing its store network with a view to closing some in Europe and opening more in China.
Helping stoke domestic demand, the Chinese government has long sought to bring some of the money splashed abroad by its citizens overseas back home.
It cut import tariffs in 2018, enabling luxury brands to reduce their China prices, while this year in Hainan, it has expanded the amount of duty-free shopping allowed to 100,000 yuan ($14,650) from 30,000 yuan as well as the types and number of products allowed.
Also, unlike many other countries where luxury spending tends to be the domain of older generations, China skews younger with many luxury consumers between 25-35 - often the only child of the family and armed with money from indulgent parents.
Younger Chinese shoppers also prefer e-commerce and the world's poshest brands have started wading into online sales in China, putting aside concerns about the potential for counterfeiters to take away their sales and the loss of the luxury shopping experience over the internet.
Services like livestreaming now give luxury brands the ability to more directly connect to shoppers, said Golden Goose's Maggioni, adding that with online stores his brand could now reach shoppers in up to 100 Chinese cities.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Tmall marketplace has seen 50 brands including Giorgio Armani and Alexander Wang open stores on its three-year old luxury platform this year and another 20 are expected to join by the end of the year, bringing the number to 220.
Getting brands to join is not hard, Luna Wang, head of the division said at a Tmall Luxury event last month, noting the far greater market penetration that comes with an online presence.

The lawsuit is expected to accuse Google, builder of the world's dominant search engine, of looking to disadvantage rivals such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Bing by depriving them of the data about users and user preferences that they need to improve and to advertise to people. 
The Justice Department has also been investigating Google's ""search advertising,"" the ads that appear under a search box if a person looks up a consumer item like ""dishwasher."" Google controls the sale of the space under these searches, as well as the tools to make those ad sales.
Google has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The Justice Department declined to comment. 
Regarding search, Google has said users have access to other information sources, like Twitter for news and Amazon for products. In advertising, it says it competes with a large array of companies, including Oracle (N:ORCL) and Verizon (N:VZ). 
State attorneys general, many of whom are already investigating other Google businesses, are in the process of considering whether to sign on to the federal lawsuit, the sources said. 
The lawsuit would be the first real blow to fall after the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission said last year they had opened antitrust investigations of Google, Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Apple (O:AAPL). Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democrats have praised the effort.

Separately, President Donald Trump's administration has said social media companies, including Google's YouTube, have stifled conservative voices.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Tuesday granted CEO Tim Cook 333,987 restricted stock units, with a possibility to earn as many as 667,974 more if he hits performance targets, in the executive's first stock grant since 2011. 
“Tim has brought unparalleled innovation and focus to his role as CEO and demonstrated what it means to lead with values and integrity,"" Apple's board of directors said in a statement.
""For the first time in nearly a decade, we are awarding Tim a new stock grant that will vest over time in recognition of his outstanding leadership and with great optimism for Apple’s future as he carries these efforts forward.”
Cook is in the ninth year of his 10-year grant from 2011. Each restricted stock unit conveys the right to one common share when it vests. 
Apple's stock closed at $114.09 on Tuesday, which puts the value of the units at $38.1 million at Tuesday's price. But they will be more valuable if Apple's stock price rises by the time they vest. One-third of the units will vest on April 1, 2023 with another third vesting in 2024 and the final third in 2025.
In October 2023, Cook will also be eligible to receive additional units based on performance. The target amount is 333,987 units, but the total could vary between none and double that amount based on Apple's relative total shareholder return from fiscal years 2021 through 2023, according to a regulatory filing.
Apple's move brings Cook's compensation timeline into line with other executives at the company. Apple on Tuesday also awarded a similar grant to Chief Operating Office Jeff Williams (NYSE:WMB), who will receive 89,064 restricted stock units on the same terms as Cook, including the possibility of performance-based units.

Cook told Fortune magazine in 2015 that he plans to donate his wealth to charity.

Final passage is expected Wednesday on the measure, H.R. 8337, which easily passed the House last week on a 359-57 vote.
The funding bill would keep the government operating through Dec. 11 at current spending levels.
Congressional Republicans and Democrats, along with White House officials, last week removed the final stumbling block striking a deal by agreeing to provide aid to farmers in exchange for more food assistance for low-income families. The bill provides as much as $30 billion for the Department of Agriculture’s Commodity Credit Corp., which the Trump administration has used to send virus relief payments to farmers. Democrats got almost $8 billion for a pandemic program to feed children who normally receive school lunches.
Once the temporary spending bill is finalized, lawmakers will try to complete work on the 12 annual appropriations bills for fiscal 2021 in the post-election lame-duck session in November and December. The Senate hasn’t drafted any of the bills so far, and there’s likely a battle ahead over paying for Trump’s wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and replacing military funds he redirected to pay for border security last year.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin agreed earlier this month to keep talks on a coronavirus relief stimulus package separate from the stopgap bill. The two have restarted stimulus talks this week but both sides remain far apart from agreeing to a proposal.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp (N:MPC), the largest U.S. oil refiner, on Tuesday began cutting jobs across the company, according to people familiar with the matter, as the COVID-19 pandemic sapped demand for motor fuels. 
U.S. refiners have posted large losses this year as fuel consumption tumbled amid lockdowns and work-from-home policies to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Thin profit margins have been undercut by the need to operate plants at less than 80% capacity. 
Marathon officials are ""communicating with our employees about measures we announced earlier this year to strengthen Marathon Petroleum for short-term and long-term success,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. She declined to comment on specific actions. 
The Findlay, Ohio-based company has been shedding units to improve results. It had 60,000 employees as of Dec. 31, with two-thirds in retail operations that are being acquired by 7-Eleven Inc, an arm of Japan's Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd (T:3382).
About 60 salaried staff were let go by midday on Tuesday at Marathon's large Galveston Bay plant in Texas and another 60 people were dismissed at the company's Los Angeles refinery, the sources said. 
The Galveston Bay operation may lose as many as 100 workers this week and up to 200 before the reductions end, one of the people said. 
In August, Marathon began closing refineries in Martinez, California, and Gallup, New Mexico, eliminating 800 jobs. The latest cuts are across the company, one of the people said. 
It is expected to report a $623 million third-quarter loss on Nov. 2, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It lost $9.2 billion in the first half of the year, mostly on impairment charges. 
Last week,  LyondellBasell Industries  (N:LYB) also disclosed plans to cut 10% of staff at its Houston oil refinery because of heavy losses. Plant operations would be challenged for several years because of the drop in demand, a LyondellBasell executive said.

(Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday set a reference price of $7.25 per share for Palantir Technologies Inc, valuing the data analytics company at a $15.8 billion ahead of its public market debut on Wednesday.
While the valuation was lower than the $20 billion that Palantir fetched in a 2015 private fundraising round, the reference price is not an offering price for investors to purchase shares, but rather a benchmark for performance when the stock starts trading on the stock exchange on Wednesday. 
Two previous high-profile direct listings -  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) in 2018 and  Slack Technologies Inc  (N:WORK) in 2019 - had started trading significantly above their reference prices.
Palantir opted to go public through a direct listing rather than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). This meant the company did not raise any money, but current investors are able to sell more shares.
Palantir shares are set to start trading on the NYSE on Wednesday under the symbol ""PLTR."" The opening public price will be determined by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers.
Palantir, co-founded in 2003 by billionaire Peter Thiel, is among 2020's most eagerly anticipated public listings. Known for its secretive contracts with the Central Intelligence Agency and other government groups, there has been much conjecture about how much Palantir is actually worth and whether investors will view it as a lucrative software provider or a less-glamorous consulting business.

The Denver, Colorado-based company has yet to turn a profit. It reported a net loss of $164.7 million for the first six months of 2020, down from a loss of $280.5 million a year earlier. Revenue over the same period rose almost 50% to $481.2 million.

(Reuters) - Kroll Bond Rating Agency will pay $2.01 million, mainly in fines, to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges that some of its practices were inadequate to ensure its ratings would be accurate, the regulator said on Tuesday.
The SEC said KBRA let analysts make adjustments that materially affected ratings for commercial mortgage-backed securities without requiring they have an analytical method or explain their rationale for the adjustments.
It also said KBRA's ratings for collateralized loan obligation combination notes, which often combine a series of interest-paying securities and an unrated equity piece, did not reflect potential payouts from cash flows owed to noteholders.
""Ratings agencies play a crucial gatekeeping role in the securities market"" and must enforce policies ""to ensure the consistency and integrity of credit ratings,"" Daniel Michael, chief of the SEC enforcement division's complex financial instruments unit, said in a statement.
The payout by New York-based KBRA includes $1.85 million of civil fines, plus $164,836 of disgorgement and interest.
In a statement, KBRA said it stood behind the integrity of its ratings, methodologies and processes, and did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
Credit rating agencies assess companies and the securities they issue, and investors use the ratings to determine what securities are worth. Rating actions often move markets, and some investors are restricted from buying securities that lack credit ratings. 

KBRA is among nine credit rating agencies registered with the SEC as nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations.

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) has agreed to pay more than $920 million and admitted to wrongdoing to settle federal U.S. market manipulation probes into its trading of metals futures and Treasury securities, the U.S. authorities said on Tuesday. 
The landmark multi-agency settlement lifts a regulatory shadow that has hung over the bank for several years and marks a signature victory for the government’s efforts to clamp down on illegal trading in the futures and precious metals market. 
JPMorgan will pay $436.4 million in fines, $311.7 million in restitution and more than $172 million in disgorgement, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Tuesday, the biggest-ever settlement imposed by the derivatives regulator.
Between 2008 and 2016, JPMorgan engaged in a pattern of manipulation in the precious metals futures and U.S. Treasury futures market, the CFTC said. Traders would place orders on one side of the market which they never intended to execute, to create a false impression of buy or sell interest that would raise or depress prices, according to the settlement. 
This manipulative practice, which is designed to create the illusion of demand, or lack thereof, is known as ""spoofing.""
Some of the trades were made on JPMorgan's own account, while on occasions traders manipulated the market to facilitate trades by hedge fund clients, the CFTC said. The bank failed to identify, investigate, and stop the behavior, even after a new surveillance system flagged issues in 2014, the agency said.
""The conduct of the individuals referenced in today's resolutions is unacceptable and they are no longer with the firm,"" said Daniel Pinto, co-president of JPMorgan and CEO of the Corporate & Investment Bank. 
He added that the bank had invested ""considerable resources"" in boosting its internal compliance policies, surveillance systems and training programs.
In parallel settlements, the bank entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut, staving off criminal prosecution on charges of wire fraud.
It also agreed to pay $35 million to settle related charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, although the bank's payment to the CFTC would offset that fine, it said. 
In an unusual concession, JPMorgan also admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to the SEC and Justice Dept. settlements. 
""This record-setting enforcement action demonstrates the CFTC's commitment to being tough on those who intentionally break our rules, no matter who they are. Attempts to manipulate our markets won't be tolerated,"" said CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert. 
The CFTC and Justice Department have taken aim at spoofing in recent years, using sophisticated data analysis tools to spot potential wrongdoing that it could not previously detect.
Reuters has reported that around 2017, the agency began using techniques it originally developed to spot healthcare fraud schemes to identify suspicious trading patterns, including by scanning activity on exchanges.
“The idea was: let’s mine this data source to see who the worst actors are,” Robert Zink, a top Justice official who helped lead the effort, told Reuters in May https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-doj-trading-insight/traders-beware-u-s-taps-new-tools-to-find-fraud-in-volatile-commodities-market-idUSKBN22X14E.

The agency has already charged six JPMorgan traders for manipulating metals futures between 2008 and 2016. On Friday, meanwhile, two former  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) traders were found guilty https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-bank-traders-convicted/two-ex-deutsche-bank-traders-convicted-in-u-s-over-fake-orders-idUSKCN26H00X by a federal jury of spoofing, the agency said.

“Major fractions of banks of all sizes indicated that the loss sharing with the MSLP in the event of a default was too uncertain, and that the required certifications and covenants were too restrictive for the bank,” the Fed said Tuesday in releasing the results of a special edition of its Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices.
Banks that had declined to take part in the program mentioned “their ability to provide credit to eligible borrowers without the MSLP, as well as unattractive key MSLP loan terms for lenders as reasons for not registering,” the report said.
The results revealed a wide gap between how banks view the Main Street program and how key Fed officials see it.
Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, which administers the program, said in a Sept. 23 speech that the terms “should be attractive to banks, both because of the fees collected” and because the Fed buys out 95% of every loan.
He then pointed a finger at larger institutions for not participating. “None of the nation’s largest banks, by this metric, are currently active in the program,” he said.
The Main Street program has come in for criticism and scrutiny from lawmakers for so far lending out only about $2 billion of its $600 billion capacity.
The survey also showed banks expect loan inquiries from businesses of an eligible size to increase over the next three months, but “only a modest share of banks expected their willingness to extend MSLP loans to increase over the same period.”

By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asset management firm Richard Bernstein Advisors said on Monday it has funded a scholarship at Spelman College geared toward bringing more Black employees into its industry.
The scholarship will provide tuition assistance for a student's junior and senior years at Spelman, a historically Black woman's college in Atlanta. The recipient will also take part in a summer internship at Richard Bernstein Advisors (RBA).
Richard Bernstein, the firm's chief executive, said difficulty finding Black candidates prompted the launch of the scholarship. The firm of 29 has no Black employees. Small firms such as his, Bernstein said, lack the recruiting capabilities of larger asset managers and may be less visible to Black talent.
""If your workforce is predominantly white, you don't have access to word of mouth, so you don't have connections,"" he said.
Several other financial institutions have pledged money toward higher education for Black students as the Black Lives Matter movement has garnered renewed attention.  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp and Synovus (NYSE:SNV) Financial Corp announced scholarship funds this summer. On Wednesday, U.S. Bank announced funding to several organizations, including the United Negro College Fund, as part of a $116 million commitment to ""address social and economic inequities.""
Some companies' statements and initiatives on racial diversity have garnered skepticism regarding their ultimate impact, particularly on employment of racial minorities within those firms.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's chief executive drew criticism after suggesting that there was not enough qualified minority talent.
""Every organization has a laundry list of programs they are doing,"" said John Wilson, director of engagement at Calvert Research and Management. ""But the data from these firms are still lacking in terms of representation.""
Bernstein hopes RBA's scholarship will address that lack of representation within his own firm, even if it has limited impact beyond that.
""Are we going to have the impact of a bank hiring 50 people a year? Of course not,"" he said. ""But can we meaningfully impact two or three students a year? Yeah, I think we can.""

Credit Karma Money Checking will initially be available only to those members who hold a savings account with Credit Karma, the San Francisco-based company said.
Opening a checking account will require no minimum balance or deposit requirements, it added.
The service will be available more widely in early 2021 with offerings being added throughout the year.
Credit Karma, which has 100 million members in the United States, Canada and the UK, is best known for letting customers access their credit scores and some other personal finance tools for free. It also offers third-party credit cards and loans to customers, tailored to their credit history.
Several fintechs have been expanding the types of financial services they offer and moving beyond their initial area of focus. Many are now seeking to attract deposits, often through enticing rates or low fees.
Credit Karma hopes its product will stand out among competitors because of how it connects to the company's other offerings, Kenneth Lin, Credit Karma chief executive officer and founder, said in an interview.
""The differentiation is going to be the connection to the credit and a holistic view of your financial life,"" Lin said. ""It helps consumers build credit and pay off the debt and save for their future.""
Credit Karma will be offering its checking account through MVB Bank Inc, a member of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, a U.S. bank regulator. Lin said the company does not have plans to apply for a banking charter.

The U.K. had sought to break the logjam by submitting a new round of proposals on how its state-aid rules will work after Brexit, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. The issue is one of the biggest obstacles to an accord.
But the British offer still doesn’t go far enough, according to two officials in Brussels, who said insufficient progress has so far been made for the talks to head into the intense final phase, known as the tunnel, at the end of this week.
That could change, as long as the British show willingness to compromise further in this week’s discussions between the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his opposite number, David Frost, according to an official in Brussels.
Alternatively, Barnier could call for further rounds of talk, but that could make it make it more difficult to reach a deal before Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s self-imposed deadline of mid-October.
Risk of No Deal
It’s possible that target could slip as the two sides try to hammer out a deal. If Britain crashes out of the EU’s single market at the year-end without a trade deal in place, it could poison relations with the bloc for a generation and leave business grappling with the cost and disruption of trade tariffs and quotas.
The two main obstacles to an agreement remain deciding which of the EU’s state-aid rules the U.K. will have to follow after leaving, and what access fishing boats from the bloc will have to British waters.
The document on state aid is among five confidential draft legal texts the U.K. submitted to the bloc. The others address fisheries, law enforcement, energy and mobility and social-security coordination.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 01:16PM ET</span>",Emissions crunch drives Volkswagen to overhaul its supercar strategy,"By Edward Taylor, Jan Schwartz and Ilona Wissenbach
WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is reviewing the future of its high-performance brands Lamborghini, Bugatti and Ducati as part of broader quest for more economies of scale as it shifts to mass producing electric cars, senior executives told Reuters.
Volkswagen's management board and directors will look at the carmaker's strategy at a meeting in November and are working on a new ""to do list"" as the company tries to more than double its value to 200 billion euros ($235 billion), one executive said. 
The review could result in technology partnerships for the high-performance sports car and superbike brands, restructuring, or other options up to and including a listing or sale, two executives, who declined to be named, said.
They said Volkswagen, which also owns VW, Audi, Porsche, Seat and Skoda, is looking at whether it has the resources to develop electric platforms for its smaller brands at a time it is investing billions to transform its more mainstream cars.
The stark choice faced by Volkswagen comes as Chief Executive Herbert Diess seeks new ways to free up cash to fund its move away from combustion engines after powerful labour leaders blocked a cost-cutting drive in Germany.
In an interview with Reuters, Diess declined to comment on the high-performance brands individually but acknowledged that Volkswagen, which also has a stable of trucks, needed to reinvent itself for an era of electric and autonomous cars.
""We are constantly looking at our brand portfolio, this is particularly true during the phase of fundamental change in our industry. In view of the market disruption, we must focus and ask ourselves what the transformation means for the individual parts of the group,"" Diess told Reuters. 
""Brands must be measured against new requirements. By electrification, by reach, by digitalisation and connectivity of the vehicle. There is new room for manoeuvre and every brand must find its new place,"" he said.
'ASPIRATIONAL TARGET'
Besides building the common electric vehicle architecture that will underpin many of its bigger brands, Volkswagen needs to free up cash to develop connected and autonomous vehicle technology and new forms of mobility services.
Last year, Volkswagen sold 4,554 Lamborghinis, which start at about $200,000 and cost millions for special editions. It sold 82 Bugattis, which have seven-digit price tags, and just over 53,000 Ducati motorbikes.
But some company insiders question whether it's worth investing scarce resources to produce silent electric versions if they don't appeal to fans of the noisy, high-octane brands.
Unlike many U.S. firms which can tap more liquid and deeper capital markets to raise money for investment, Volkswagen relies more on cash flow from sales of combustion-engine cars to fund its shift to battery-powered vehicles. 
""We are a large conglomerate and have to struggle with a low multiple and a conglomerate discount. But we are doing something about it,"" Diess said, pointing to the sale of engine drive maker Renk and the restructuring of truck brand MAN.
Diess believes the company's valuation will rise once the market understands how profitable its electric vehicles are, but it faces a short-term investment crunch after EU lawmakers proposed a 50% cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.
He told Reuters the goal of raising Volkswagen's market value to 200 billion euros by 2025, was still valid.
""We formulated the 200 billion euros company valuation as an aspirational target,"" Diess said. 
""Volkswagen is severely undervalued when you look at its technological competence, its global positioning and perhaps also when you see that, compared with the competition, we have the best prerequisites in terms of technology.""
INTELLIGENT VEHICLES
Now, Volkswagen is worth 78 billion euros, far below rival Toyota's (T:7203) $187 billion valuation, even though it sold more vehicles than the Japanese company last year. Volkswagen sold 10.96 million - the most by any carmaker in the world - while Toyota came in second with 10.74 million.
Analysts say that's because Volkswagen has more brands, is less efficient and has higher costs. Volkswagen Group had 671,205 employees at the end of 2019, well above the 359,542 Toyota staff at the end of its last financial year.
Bankers are pinning their hopes on investor enthusiasm for companies pushing sustainable transportation and on support from labour leaders for financial transactions which may help Volkswagen raise cash for investment.
""The crucial thing now is to manage the transition to electromobility. That is by far the greatest lever for us in this phase,"" Diess said. ""Individual mobility will change dramatically. Electrification only accounts for 10% to 20% of this change. The big push will come from the increasing intelligence of vehicles.""
A new software stack for the company's 10 million vehicles won't hit the market until 2023 or 2024, Diess said, making it harder for investors to recognise VW's potential now. 
Tesla's (O:TSLA) value has surged this year to above $400 billion as investors backed the U.S. pioneer to cash in on an electric vehicle revolution.
'THE RIGHT PATH'
Although analysts say radical surgery is needed to boost Volkswagens' stock price, winning over its supervisory board, where workers control half the seats, may be the hardest part.
""The company's strategy is good. It has already foreseen that there will be adjustments here and there,"" Volkswagen Group's supervisory board chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch told Reuters, referring to some divestments already announced.
Volkswagen has no plans to list Porsche or Audi, and other plans will only get a hearing if they protect jobs in the long run, according to IG Metall, Germany's biggest union.
Its leader, Joerg Hofmann, told Reuters he was not fundamentally opposed to listing, or spinning off divisions. 
""We have never opposed plans by a company to fund growth on the stock market,"" he said. ""But if the goal is to break up a company for the sake of getting a higher valuation, or to separate off 'Bad Industry', then we say No,"" Hofmann said.
Rather than walking away from underperforming assets, the company has a responsibility to invest in the future of its employees and locations, he said.
""I think Diess is taking the right path,"" Hofmann said.
After several clashes with VW's powerful labour chief Bernd Osterloh, Diess said he had changed his approach.
""In the last five years I have learned a lot here. In Wolfsburg we have our own culture and also special power structures. This requires a very integrative management style. With my sometimes confrontational approach, I have reached my limits. I have to recognise that and adjust to it.""

The FTC in February moved to block the venture, which combined the Powder River Basin and Colorado assets of the firms, claiming it would eliminate competition. Peabody and Arch had then said they intended to challenge FTC's decision and would continue to pursue the JV.
The court ruling signals more woes for coal miners, which have suffered due to increasing competition from cheap and abundant gas and subsidized renewable energy, along with rising public concern over climate change.
Peabody's shares fell more than 16% after the ruling, while Arch was down 8.2%.
The JV was formed in June 2019, combining two productive and adjacent U.S. coal mines – Arch's Black Thunder mine and Peabody's North Antelope Rochelle mine. It was owned 66.5% by Peabody and 33.5% by Arch.
In a separate statement on Tuesday, Arch said it has terminated a thermal asset joint venture with Peabody and plans to pursue strategic alternatives.

The company added it would continue to streamline its corporate structure as part of its ongoing transition into a pure-play metallurgical coal producer.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 12:26PM ET</span>",Touchless lattes and self-service kiosks: office break rooms go virus-proof,"By Nivedita Balu and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Out with grimy microwaves and sticky coffee machines with worn-out buttons, in with stylus pens, QR codes, no-touch water coolers and mobile apps that pick what brew the machine will make for you.
From the headquarters of Ford in Dearborn, Michigan and Goldman Sachs in New York to Fedex facilities across the United States, workers are returning after months of lockdowns to the new reality of social distancing, hybrid remote and office work schedules, and strict hygiene protocols.
The break room, where employees used to get their daily fix of caffeine and office gossip, is a big part of that reboot as coffee companies, such as Keurig Dr. Pepper (O:KDP), Lavazza and Nestle (S:NESN) roll out new technology for the COVID-19 era.
Nestle says it has worked with manufacturers to add a function to its coffeemakers that lets users to make a selection by just hovering a finger over the menu and has been delivering those to clients since June.
Lavazza lauched a new model in September that works with a mobile app to whip up those cappuccinos and lattes without having to touch the machine. 
U.S. coffee machine manufacturer Bunn has chosen a different approach, retrofitting its machines with a QR code that lets users order drinks through a webpage.
Last year, supplying offices with beans and brewers was a $5.7 billion business in the United States alone, according to research firm Packaged Facts. Coffee companies, which saw lockdowns wipe out so-called professional sales that also include the hospitality industry, bet they can revive that business by addressing workers' and employers' concerns.

(Interactive graphic on U.S. coffee office service sector sales here https://tmsnrt.rs/36fUSlh.)
DASH FOR AN APP
Lavazza had a new brewer slated to debut at a trade show in May, but started redesigning it to add a touchless function when the pandemic struck in March, Bruce Williamson, vice president of innovation and marketing at Lavazza Professional said.
""We had to very quickly use the weeks (we had) preparing for an app."" 
Williamson said a survey of about 170 consumers across the United States Lavazza commissioned in August validated its decision. It showed 40% of employees expected to leave the building less often to get a drink and to rely more on office supplies, but were nervous about infection risks.
""What they are telling us is... 'I'm going to come back to the office but I'm nervous about touching the machine'."" 
Employers, suppliers and designers are also experimenting with a one-stop service that allows office workers to refuel without going outside, while those working remotely can do it from the comfort of their home.
K-cup pod maker Keurig is supplying coffee for ‘mini-marts’ set up to replace office cafeterias and offering fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat, coffee and other staples. It has also signed deals with several companies that have classified K-cup pods and brewers essential work items and pay for their deliveries to staff working remotely, said Phil Drapeau, the company's general manager for the 'Away from Home' business.

Ford (N:F) said more than 100,000 people out of its global workforce of 190,000 have returned to its facilities since May, but cafe service remains suspended and it offers pre-packaged meals and beverages instead. The carmaker is also testing onsite grocery kiosks selling locally sourced dairy, produce, and meal prep kits.
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) told Reuters that 15% of its New York workforce is back with standard precautions in place - mandatory masks in all areas except employee desks and limits on the number of people in conference rooms and common areas.
RETHINK AND RECALIBRATE
Surveys and official guidelines suggest offices will fill up only gradually and might even never return to pre-pandemic capacity. 
GoodFirms, a Washington, D.C.-based research firm, said this month its international survey of 168 businesses showed nearly a third of workers had already returned and nearly 60% wanted to do so, but more than half remained concerned about their safety.
A makeover of office catering was important for addressing such concerns, says Alicia LeBeouf, marketing and retail strategy executive at food service company Canteen, which counts FedEx (N:FDX), Pinterest (N:PINS),  Target  (N:TGT) and UPS (N:UPS) among its clients.
Buffets and chefs preparing meals on demand are replaced by grab-and-go food stations at Verizon (N:VZ) and UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH); contactless coffee machines get rolled out at  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT); fridges get pedal-operated doors at  Mohawk Industries  (N:MHK) and individually wrapped plastic utensils replace cutlery. 
At several FedEx facilities, Canteen has replaced card payment terminals at its grab-and-go stations with Canteen’s “Connect & Pay” app, which allows consumers to scan and pay with their mobile device, and access nutritional informational on products.
The layout also needs to change, says Tom Vecchione, workplace strategist at New York architecture firm Vocon. The company is knocking down doors and removing screens for its clients to create more spacious common areas that make social distancing easier while replacing chairs with stools 
to discourage people from lingering for too long.
Canteen's LeBeouf said employers were banking on workers coming back, but they would not be returning to the same office they left before the pandemic.

""We've had to recalibrate and...rethink everything.""

Lufthansa earlier said on Twitter that it had been forced to cancel some flights to India after New Delhi rejected its planned flight schedule for October.
A statement from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said that current arrangements were resulting in an ""inequitable distribution of traffic in favour of Lufthansa"".
""There are restrictions in place for Indian nationals desiring to travel to Germany, which was putting Indian carriers at a significant disadvantage,"" the DGCA said.
Indian carriers were operating 3-4 flights a week to Germany, but Lufthansa had been operating 20 flights a week, said DGCA, adding that negotiations were continuing with the government. 

India formalised a bilateral ""air bubble"" with Germany in July and has similar arrangements with the United States and France.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA) have not finalized their deal to jointly build electric pickup trucks and hydrogen fuel cell tractor-trailers, one day ahead of the date targeted, and are continuing discussions, GM said on Tuesday.
""Our transaction with Nikola has not closed,"" GM spokeswoman Juli Huston-Rough said in a statement. ""We are continuing our discussions with Nikola and will provide further updates when appropriate or required."" 
A statement by Nikola echoed GM's. Huston-Rough and a Nikola spokeswoman declined to comment further when asked if terms of the deal were being renegotiated.
Shares of Nikola were down 7.1%, while GM's stock was off 1.5% in midday trading.
When the deal was announced, Nikola said it expected it to close before Sept. 30, adding either side could terminate the agreement if it wasn't finalized by Dec. 3.
The alliance, announced Sept. 8, included plans for GM to receive an 11% stake in Nikola then worth about $2 billion and payments up to $700 million for building the startup's Badger pickup. 
With Nikola shares now trading below $18 a share, GM's potential stake is worth less than half the initial value. 
In return, GM agreed to supply Nikola with electric batteries, a chassis architecture and a factory to build the Badger pickup, as well as GM's fuel cell system for Nikola's planned heavy trucks. 
As part of the deal, GM also would keep 80% of EV regulatory credits generated by the Badger and have the right to buy the rest at market rates, which would help GM offset sales of its gasoline-powered vehicles. 
Short-seller Hindenburg Research then released a scathing report on Sept. 10 that called Nikola a ""fraud"" and said Nikola founder and then executive chairman Trevor Milton had made false claims about Nikola's proprietary technology.
Milton denied the allegations and Nikola threatened legal action while referring the matter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice have reportedly opened investigations into the matter, although neither has confirmed that to Reuters.
Milton, who owns 25% of Nikola, resigned on Sept. 21, citing a desire to not be a distraction. He was replaced by board member and former GM Vice Chairman Steve Girsky, whose firm VectoIQ took Nikola public earlier this year through a reverse merger.
Hindenburg previously said Milton's exit was ""only the beginning of Nikola's unraveling"" and warned GM to ""carefully evaluate"" the potential damage to its brand. 

GM, instead, has said it would stand by the deal, which it said made strategic sense by giving the Detroit automaker scale to cut costs.

Golar said Antonello's leave was in no way linked to any action or misconduct during his tenure at Hygo Energy, a liquefied natural gas transport and infrastructure operator formed with U.S. private equity firm Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners.
Antonello's functions will be taken over temporarily by Hygo's board, Golar said.

635,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>","Pelosi, Mnuchin Resume Pivotal Talks on New Stimulus for Economy","(Bloomberg) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Tuesday discussed the latest Democratic stimulus proposal in talks that will determine whether another coronavirus relief package gets enacted before the election.
The negotiations between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats are reaching a critical juncture this week as both sides either manage to reach a deal or the House moves to pass the Democratic proposal and leave town for pre-election campaigning.
House Democrats released their latest plan, a $2.2 trillion package that the White House greeted initially with silence.
Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke Tuesday morning for 50 minutes to go over provisions of the Democratic proposal, and hey plan to speak again Wednesday, according to Pelosi’s spokesman.
While the details of the legislative text add clarity to the talks, the top-line spending level is no closer to what Republicans say they’ll support. President Donald Trump has indicated he could agree to as much as $1.5 trillion in aid -- more than the $650 billion put forth in a “skinny” aid package by Senate Republicans earlier this month.
Should no deal be forthcoming, House Democrats have said they intend to proceed on their own to vote on the new plan, allowing the party’s candidates in the Nov. 3 elections to highlight their action on coronavirus relief. The last vote was on the bigger, $3.4 trillion Heroes Act back in May, which the Senate didn't take up.
The negotiations have been at an impasse since August.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, speaking on CNBC Tuesday morning, said the true cost of the Democrats’ bill is more like $2.6 trillion and about one-third of it is related to subjects that Republicans don’t believe are strictly tied to the pandemic.
“We have a number of asks that I think both sides would agree with -- four, five, six asks that would really help the economy,” including expanded small business aid, funding for schools, supplemental unemployment payments and airline aid, he said.
“For some reason, we just can’t get it done, but the conversation, the talks will continue,” Kudlow said. “The other team wants a gigantic package and we don’t think we need that.”
Pelosi said Monday that the White House would have to agree to “much more” spending for a fresh round of stimulus if there is any hope of striking a deal before the election. “We can get this done,” Pelosi said Monday on MSNBC, while emphasizing the need for more money.
A key source of division has been Democrats’ push for large-scale aid to state and local authorities. The plan released Monday has $436 billion for one year of assistance, less than a previous demand for $915 billion, which had triggered scorn among Trump administration officials who called it a bailout for poorly run states.
The Democratic plan includes new aid for airlines, restaurants and small businesses that wasn’t in the original House package, and it has more than double the amount for schools.
The bill would provide another round of $1,200 direct relief payments to individuals and $500 per dependent -- less than the $1,200 for dependents Democrats originally proposed. It also has $600 per week in extra unemployment benefits through January, the same amount that expired in July and helped disposable incomes surge even as the economy tipped into recession.
Housing Aid, Virus Testing
The legislation continues the Heroes Act’s aims of bolstering housing assistance, with tens of billions of dollars to assist renters and homeowners make monthly rent, mortgage and utility payments.
Also included is $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and isolation measures, along with $28 billion for procurement, distribution and education campaigns for a safe and effective vaccine.
Democrats have also cut spending demands on hazard pay for essential workers, housing assistance, health insurance and the Postal Service.
With the Senate under Republican control, and its leaders now pre-occupied with Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, the bill is unlikely to advance without a major turnaround in the Trump administration’s position.
Private economists have increasingly abandoned forecasts for a deal before the election. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. andGoldman Sachs Group Inc. recently cut their forecasts for growth next quarter as a consequence.

""Alliances between two or three countries won't work, it needs to have a European dimension,"" Enel Chief Executive Francesco Starace said at an energy conference.
The European Commission is looking to scale up renewable hydrogen projects across polluting sectors from chemicals to steel in an effort to meet the EU’s net-zero emissions goal by 2050.
The priority is to develop green hydrogen produced from wind and solar power by using devices called electrolysers and deploy it in sectors hard to decarbonise or where electrification is difficult.
But critics fear it will prove too expensive for mass usage.
Starace said to be competitive green hydrogen needed renewable energy costs to be around $40-50 per megawatt hour, as was already the case, and electrolysers to cost six times less.
""We are convinced that in 3-5 years (the 6-fold fall in electrolysers) will happen,"" he said, adding demand would allow scale.
Enel, one of the world's biggest renewable energy companies, is set to launch a new green hydrogen business next year to speed up its plans to become a carbon-free power producer by 2050.

Demand for fully cooked plant-based alternatives jumped 25% in the four weeks to Aug. 22, data from Nielsen showed, as consumers grow increasingly health conscious and concerned about the environmental impact of industrial animal farming. 
The company said the wider distribution of its Beyond Burger patties - made from peas, mung bean and rice to mimic the taste of a beef burger - from 800 Walmart stores to over 2,400 comes after the successful launch of its value offerings this summer, at a time traditional ground beef prices were spiking due to COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions at beef plants.
It also comes at a time the company, which derives about half of its global sales from restaurants such as Dunkin (O:DNKN) and KFC, is trying to reroute its products to retailers to keep sales humming as restaurants continue to remain closed due to coronavirus-led restrictions. 
Tuesday's deal with Walmart, which in 2015 was the first retailer to launch its frozen offerings, comes on the heels of Beyond Meat's announcement about expanding availability of its breakfast sausage patties at 5,000 more stores in the United States by the end of September.
Along with the burger, Walmart also sells other Beyond Meat products such as its plant-based sausage in the fresh meat aisle and sausage patties in freezer aisles, the plant-based meat maker said. The sausage and sausage patties, however, were not part of the expanded distribution deal. 

(This story corrects paragraph 3 to say 800 Walmart stores, not 8,000 Walmart stores)

643,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",Options on Treasury ETF Hint at Hedges for Higher U.S. Inflation,"(Bloomberg) -- The inflation outlook in the wake of the pandemic continues to divide strategists. One part of the derivatives market is signaling that some investors see a risk of U.S. price pressures building up after the election.
An options measure known as skew for the $18.5 billion iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) ETF is pricing in a greater chance of a “violent” climb higher in yields than a drop over the next two months, according to Chris Murphy, derivatives strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP.
One explanation is that investors are hedging against the possibility of heightened concern about inflation if “a clear election winner with a clear mandate to spend more money” emerges, he wrote in a note.
For some, stimulus injections and loose monetary policy will in time stoke prices. Others argue the economic toll of the pandemic and stalled fiscal relief point to deflation as the bigger threat.
So-called 10-year breakeven rates derived from Treasury inflation-protected securities and nominal securities have trended down to 1.6% this month, signaling skepticism about the Federal Reserve’s goal of lifting inflation temporarily above 2%.
Other factors could be influencing the skew, Murphy said. These include current historic low yields leaving little room for further declines, doubts about bonds providing a useful stock hedge and worries over America’s rising debt -- all of which might ultimately mean higher yields.
Implied volatility across asset classes, such as gold, point to positioning for a wide range of inflation outcomes that likely hinge on the election result, according to Michael Purves, chief executive officer of Tallbacken Capital Advisors LP.
“Intuitively, it seems like fiscal stimulus is increasingly likely to be delayed until 2021,” he wrote in a note. “It’s hard to see inflation expectations becoming re-energized until we know where fiscal policy resides -- and we may not know where fiscal policy is really going until the election is clearly resolved.”

645,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>",Eating In and a New CEO Are Recipe for 368% Tupperware Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- More people eating at home and enthusiasm about a corporate turnaround campaign have made Tupperware (NYSE:TUP) Brands Corp. one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street.
Tupperware shares have soared 368% in the third quarter, giving it the biggest gain in the S&P 1500 Composite Index, which includes far more celebrated stocks like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Clorox (NYSE:CLX) Co. And the rally isn’t over, according to analysts.
The coronavirus pandemic has helped boost sales of kitchenware, including everything from storage containers to baking sets. Also, efforts to convert in-home parties to digital virtual parties during the isolation period have paid off. Last quarter, 15% of Tupperware’s total U.S. sales were through the e-commerce tool, and in June shipments were the highest for any month in nearly 20 years, the company said.
Much of the success is also attributed to the reorganization and cost-cutting initiatives undertaken by Chief Executive Officer Miguel Fernandez, who took over in April. Orlando, Florida-based Tupperware cut costs by more than $60 million in the second quarter, and ultimately expects to slash about $180 million in total annual expenses this year.
“We are becoming a leaner and more centrally organized company,” Vice Chairman Rich Goudis said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call in late July.
The stronger sales and corporate turnaround led to D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser to rate Tupperware a buy when she began research coverage of the eight decade-old company earlier this month. Her 12-month price target on the stock is $30 per share, implying another 41% gain from Monday’s closing price.
“Tupperware is benefiting from more cooking at home and from concerns over food storage and safety,” Weiser said in an interview last week. “Many of Tupperware’s products, kitchenware, gadgets, and storage containers, are on trend right now,” which helped contribute to more than 30% sales growth in the U.S. and Canada last quarter.
That’s a big reversal from double-digit declines seen in each of the prior three quarters. In fact, before the second quarter, Tupperware sales had fallen in every three-month period since late 2017, and they’re still significantly lower than they were back in 2013 when the stock hit a record $96 a share. The company is projected to have revenue of $1.54 billion this year, compared with $2.67 billion in 2013.
Still, the stock’s rapid advance over the past three months has pushed Tupperware’s price-to-earnings ratio to around 17 times, the highest in more than three years, and its market capitalization to above $1 billion versus just $210.7 million at the end of the second quarter, according to Bloomberg data.

Molson Coors will launch Topo Chico in the first half of 2021, its third hard seltzer to hit the shelves. The low calorie drink will compete with the popular White Claw beverage as well as other hard seltzer from companies, including Anheuser Busch Inbev NV (BR:ABI).

The launch is expected to strengthen Molson's plan to revamp its business as consumers shift to low-alcohol spirits, including hard seltzers, and premium beers.

JOHANNESBURG/ABIDJAN (Reuters) - When COVID-19 hit Ivory Coast, Bonaventure Kra, who works at an import-export business, began to worry. Handling hard cash all day was a risk. Queuing in crowded bank branches exposed him to infection.
Then, in the midst of the pandemic, French telecommunications giant Orange (PA:ORAN) launched an entirely digital bank - its first full banking venture in Africa.
""Going back to cash would be like travelling back in time,"" Kra said in the country's commercial capital, Abidjan. ""I intend to use it permanently."" 
Africa's mobile phone operators are ramping up plans to bring banking to millions of Africans, in some cases for the first time, after the coronavirus crisis caused a surge in use of digital financial services.
Orange, MTN (J:MTNJ),  Telkom  (J:TKGJ) and Vodacom (J:VODJ) are lowering fees, rolling out new lending services ahead of schedule, and expanding mobile payment networks with the aim of finally denting the so-far unshakeable dominance of cash.
""It's one of those industries that we consider to be ripe for disruption,"" Sibusiso Ngwenya, financial services managing executive at South Africa's Telkom, told Reuters. 
With their revenue under threat as governments cap data prices and customers abandon voice phone services for free messaging apps, telcos have sought to leverage their reach into remote villages and urban shanty towns in a pivot to banking.
The global health crisis has been an unexpected catalyst, with some African governments releasing COVID-19 stimulus grants via mobile money platforms and central banks easing regulations, including limits on mobile transactions.
Orange added over five million new customers for its mobile money services in April and May alone. MTN hit one million South African users in June, when it had expected half of this, and recorded a 28% jump in mobile money transactions per minute across all its African markets in the first half of the year. 
TAKING ON THE CASH KING
Cash is still king in Africa. 
It accounts for around 99% of transactions in Nigeria, the continent's most populous country, and dominates even in South Africa (90-95%) where banking penetration is relatively high, according to a 2017 estimate from consulting firm McKinsey. 
World Bank figures indicate just under 43% of sub-Saharan Africans over the age of 15 had a bank account in 2017. The region's total population stood around 1.1 billion last year. 
That compared with 55% in Latin America and the Caribbean, almost 70% in South Asia and around 74% in East Asia and the Pacific. 
That presents a huge opportunity, said Francois Jurd de Girancourt, head of McKinsey's financial institutions practice Africa. Prior to the crisis, it rated the continent as the world's No.2 market in terms of growth and profitability potential with banking revenues set to hit $129 billion by 2023. 
Telcos are well-positioned to secure a piece of that pie.
By last year, sub-Saharan Africa boasted 469 million mobile money accounts - more than any other region in the world - according to industry body GSMA. 
Mobile phone penetration outstrips access to banks. Operators' distribution models are low-cost. And telcos possess a wealth of customer data they can use to assess lending risk, a big advantage in a region where most markets lack credit bureaus.
Vodacom, the African unit of Britain's  Vodafone  (L:VOD), is now moving to expand lending, insurance and payment businesses currently available only in South Africa to other markets.
It has advanced by months launches of initiatives like overdrafts for the mobile money agents that work on its behalf, helping customers open accounts and withdraw and deposit cash.
It has also accelerated plans for cash advances to merchants at registered pay points, its financial services CEO Mariam Cassim told Reuters. 
Orange has Mali, Burkina Faso, and Senegal in its sights as expansion markets for Orange Bank Africa, with the timetable dependent upon local regulatory approval.
Both MTN and Telkom, meanwhile, are preparing to offer micro-loans in South Africa, the companies said.
MTN, Africa's largest operator, will roll out a mobile money offering for businesses, which is currently being piloted in Rwanda, to other markets by the end of the year. It will also pilot an initiative to digitise cash-heavy small businesses in South Africa, namely small shops known as spazas and often located in townships, executives told Reuters. 
And after growing the number of vendors accepting payment via its platform by 100,000 in the first half of the year, it has now doubled an end-2021 target to 1 million.
""We are ... using the opportunity that the crisis is offering us to really accelerate,"" said Serigne Dioum, who heads MTN's mobile financial services division. 
'NO LOSERS'
Mobile operators still have a long way to go to overtake traditional lenders. 
Banking revenue pools in sub-Saharan Africa stood around $70 billion in 2019, according to a McKinsey estimate, while the main mobile operators earned less than $3 billion from financial services. 
Some regulators remain wary of mobile money, and many informal businesses still don't accept digital payments. 
Such factors mean mobile money adoption varies wildly across the continent. Cash use actually rose in some countries during the pandemic. 
M-Pesa, run by Vodacom unit  Safaricom  (NR:SCOM), dominates the financial system in Kenya. But both MTN and M-Pesa have in the past been forced to drop mobile money initiatives in South Africa after struggling to attract customers.
""You need a massive market share to be making a lot of money just from payments,"" said McKinsey's Jurd de Girancourt, adding that telcos will need customers to use other services too.
""It's fine if you are M-Pesa. But we're probably not going to see that,"" he said. 
Big banks, historically deterred by low incomes and poor infrastructure, are also fighting back and pushing into underserved segments. 
They are agreeing partnerships with fintech firms, building their own networks of agents to distribute banking services and launching rival offerings. 
They also partner with telcos, marrying their vast balance sheets with the mobile firms' wide customer bases. 
South African lender Absa (J:ABGJ) is set to launch partnerships with mobile operators in Tanzania and Uganda, its head of retail banking in Africa Vimal Kumar told Reuters. 
Absa is also expanding its Kenyan digital offering to cover full-service banking with roll-outs in Zambia, Botswana and Mauritius set for later this year and the rest of its markets in 2021.
""There is no loser,"" Kumar said. ""The opportunity is so large that no one player is going to be able to dominate.""

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has added to pressures on Thyssenkrupp, which is striving to turn around its loss-making business units after selling its elevator division, by far its most profitable asset, to a private equity consortium earlier this year.
Its shares are trading at their lowest since mid-May when the pandemic's impact on the stocks of industrial companies around the world was severe.
""We don't expect output figures in the auto industry to return to pre-crisis levels for at least two to three years,"" Ingo Steinkrueger, head of Thyssenkrupp System Engineering, said in a statement.
Thyssenkrupp in May said that System Engineering would be broken up, with two sub units - car body solutions and lightweight solutions - becoming part of the Automotive Technology division.
The remaining parts - battery solutions and powertrain solutions - are being shifted to the Multi Tracks unit, which accounted for 6 billion euros ($7 billion) of sales, 20,000 jobs and 400 million euros of negative cash flow last year.
Thyssenkrupp's delicate financial situation has given rise to speculation it might seek state participation, but Andreas Pinkwart, economy minister of Thyssenkrupp's home state North Rhine-Westphalia, said no request had yet been made.
Pinkwart also said he could not comment on whether the German government was holding talks with Thyssenkrupp over taking a stake, adding he would support efforts to give the steelmaker financial aid to decarbonise its activities.

U.S.-listed shares of Sogou were up about 3% in premarket trading.
The move comes a day after Chinese social network Weibo (NASDAQ:WB)'s owner Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) Corp said it would be taken private in a $2.6 billion deal. Rival e-commerce firms  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com have also sought to return to equity markets closer home by making secondary listings in Hong Kong. 
The offer price represents a premium of 56.5% to Sogou's close on July 24, the last trading day before Tencent offered to take it private.
Controlling stakeholder Sohu (NASDAQ:SOHU).com Inc said it would receive about $1.18 billion in cash from Tencent as part of the deal, sending its shares up about 14% in premarket trading.
Tencent currently owns a 39.2% stake in Sogou, according to a letter it sent to Sogou shareholders in July.
Sogou, which was founded in 2005 and debuted on the U.S. market in November 2017, generates revenue mainly through search advertising services. 

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)( Asia) is acting as financial adviser to Tencent on the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Target said it will hold its ""Deal Days"" promotional event on Oct. 13 and 14 and will also expand Black Friday pricing for the whole of November, promising shoppers nearly 1 million more deals than last year.
The retailer has already made plans to staff more employees at distribution centers and for its contactless services to make shopping easier for those ordering online and collecting items in stores.

Amazon, which postponed the its annual sales event from July to October this year due to the health crisis, said it is investing an additional $100 million in special Prime Day and holiday promotional programs.

KONOLFINGEN, Switzerland (Reuters) - Food company Nestle SA (S:NESN) said the COVID-19 pandemic has forced its senior management to become more immersed in daily operations as executives need to deal with safety and business continuity issues, its chief executive told Reuters in an interview.
With its 291,000 employees and sales in 187 countries, Nestle has so far weathered the pandemic relatively well as consumers stocked up on packaged foods during lockdowns, but the unexpected situation changed the priorities of its top executives.
""From the moment the crisis evolved from a China-only situation to an international crisis, we formed a crisis committee which I chair,"" Mark Schneider said on the sidelines of an event at a Nestle dairy research centre near Bern on Monday.
""Management style of everyone in senior management, me included, has become so much more operational as you deal with more operational matters trying to ensure safety and business continuity,"" Schneider said, adding the committee was now meeting only once a week, versus twice at the beginning of the crisis.
He said there were some unforeseen disruptions in supply chains in the first weeks that made it necessary to increase inventory levels from raw materials to finished goods to gain flexibility. 
""It cost a bit of extra inventory and working capital, but now is not the time to optimize working capital, it’s the time to maximise business continuity. What the consumer wants to see at this time is shelves that continue to be stored,"" Schneider said.
He said he expected industry supply chains to become more local, but that would take a bit of time. 
Schneider said consumers had turned to well-known brands during the crisis - a trend that helped the maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee - and were also buying more value packs and larger pack sizes.
To stay in touch with factories around the world, Nestle is using its remote support centres more actively - not just at its Swiss dairy research facility, but also at other product development sites. From there, staff can connect to factories worldwide to remotely solve problems thanks to tools like smart glasses and augmented reality software.
""Some of that is here to stay because if you can do something remotely with the same quality, there’s no need to travel,"" Schneider said, adding travel restrictions were in place until the end of the year, with exceptions only for business-essential trips. 
He said he himself had taken only two cross-border trips since the company banned international travel in February.

653,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>","European Coffee Giant Targets Starbucks, Peet’s in U.S. Foray","(Bloomberg) -- Tchibo, one of Europe’s biggest coffee purveyors, is betting that more than 70 years of industry experience will help it take on the likes of  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). and Peet’s Coffee in its first U.S. foray.
The Hamburg-based company is introducing its roast and ground coffees to the U.S. in the coming weeks in the latest initiative by Chief Executive Officer Thomas Linemayr, whose previous experience in the U.S. included overseeing Lindt & Sprungli AG’s American division. Tchibo coffee is already sold across Europe and its CEO now aims to woo U.S. coffee aficionados.
“We will cater toward more affluent, younger consumers and coffee connoisseurs,” Linemayr, 59, said in a phone interview from New York. “We want to establish our company as a quality leader.”
Tchibo’s coffee will be distributed by Rainmaker Food Solutions and will be available at a broad selection of retailers in the Midwest markets of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin. The products include roast & ground, and whole bean -- two categories boosted by lockdowns -- and a coffee machine with grinding capacity will also be offered.
Tchibo, founded in 1949, has annual sales of “just under” $4 billion, with coffee comprising about half of that, Linemayr said. The company has coffee farms in Brazil and Tanzania, and has more than 1,000 retail stores, where it sells home appliances including coffee machines. The company aims to compete against the big U.S. national retailers and, to some extent, Starbucks and Peet’s, Linemayr said.
Tchibo is entering a roast-and-ground coffee market that generated about $4 billion in sales last year in the U.S., according to James Watson, a market analyst for Rabobank in New York. That market is experiencing a push toward a more refined product.
“There is significant premiumization occurring, which we think is due to consumers moving from coffee shops to grocery,” Watson said in an interview. “Companies that are gaining market are the largest and most premium.”
Coffee grinder sales and coffee subscription services are also growing in a period when the Covid-19 pandemic has changed consumer behaviors -- implying that consumers are building new infrastructure to support at-home consumption, Watson said. The shift may not last, though, once consumers feel more comfortable returning to coffee shops.
Premium Opportunity
“Americans are drinking far less coffee at the office than they once did, and a large portion of that is shifting instead to roast & ground in an at-home setting,” said Matthew Barry, the Chicago-based beverage consultant for market researcher Euromonitor International. “There is opportunity in more premium coffee designed for at-home consumption.”
As consumers spend more time at home and save money by not going out for coffee, Barry said there’s good reason to think that a significant amount of drinkers will look to splurge more on coffee than they did before Covid as long as the pandemic is around.
Tchibo will face competition from Illycafe SpA, the European roaster that sells premium products and has been expanding in the U.S. Covid-19 has been blow for the company’s sales, 60% of which comes from restaurants, cafes, airlines and transportation, chairman Andrea Illy told Bloomberg TV earlier this month. The Trieste, Italy-based company responded by boosting its focus on at-home consumption and e-commerce, helping counter some lost sales.
Linemayr is tapping into his U.S. experience to help Tchibo gain an American foothold. He had gained success when heading Lindt & Sprungli’s U.S. business from 1999 to 2016, helping the chocolatier rise to the No. 3 brand in the country based on sales.
“We tried to understand the consumer and carefully built the brand -- it was quite a ride,” he said. “What I learned is that you must really forget what made you successful in Europe -- you need to learn how to conduct business in America.”

654,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>",Wall Street's IPO enemies ready one-two punch,"By Joshua Franklin, Krystal Hu and Anirban Sen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - There have only been two direct listings on the New York Stock Exchange in the last two years. There is about to be two more in a single day.
Data analytics company Palantir Technologies (N:PLTR) and workplace software maker  Asana Inc  (N:ASAN) are set to debut on the U.S. stock market on Wednesday bypassing an initial public offering (IPO).
The last direct listing was workplace messaging platform  Slack Technologies Inc 's (N:WORK) debut in 2019, which came a year after music-streaming service  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT) went public without an IPO.
It is a seminal moment for some investors and corporate executives who have been pushing to shed investment banks as their middlemen. For years, they have criticized IPOs as chummy deals that allowed bankers to allocate the most shares to their top clients.
""Ever since the IPO process has existed, entrepreneurs and their investors have believed that bankers have sub-optimized and taken too much for themselves,"" said Ben Narasin, a partner at U.S. venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates. 
""If Palantir and Asana are successful, which they should be, more and more companies will return to looking seriously at direct listings,"" Narasin added.
IPOs have been on a tear this year, as companies rode the stock market rally that followed the coronavirus-induced slump. Companies have launched almost $50 billion in U.S. IPOs so far in 2020, excluding special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) IPOs. This has already outpaced the haul for all of 2019 and is on track to be the busiest since 2014 and second biggest since 2000. 
In 2020, the price of a newly listed company's shares has risen by an average of 38% on the first day of trading, according to IPOScoop data and Reuters calculations.
This has fueled renewed criticism among investors snubbed by the investment banks underwriting the IPOs, as well as suspicion among some companies that bankers are leaving money on the table in their IPO to help create a first-day trading ""pop"".
Phil Hellmuth, an angel tech investor and poker player with over $20 million in career winnings, said in an interview that he tried to buy $500,000 worth of shares in data warehouse company  Snowflake Inc  (N:SNOW) during its $3.36 billion IPO earlier this month.
Hellmuth knocked on the door of four hedge funds, acquaintances in Silicon Valley, mutual fund Fidelity, and one of the banks underwriting the Snowflake listing, but had no success getting into what has been this year's largest IPO. As a result, he missed out when Snowflake's shares more than doubled in its debut.
""If I can't get a piece, the average investor has no chance to get a piece,"" said Hellmuth. 
Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman told Reuters he had no regrets with how the company's IPO went. 
Fidelity said it was not possible to ascertain why an investor was unable to participate in an IPO without knowing the customer's details.
In a direct listing, no shares are sold in advance, as is the case with IPOs. The company's share price in its market debut is determined by orders coming into the stock exchange. 
The downside is that the companies involved cannot raise money, though both NYSE and Nasdaq have requested U.S. regulators allow them to change their rules to allow companies to sell new stock in a direct listing.
This inability to raise funds has so far curbed the enthusiasm for direct listings of many cash-hungry companies, especially during the economic downturn brought about by the pandemic.
""I think we were going to see more direct listings this year but for COVID-19. Many companies that were thinking about a direct listing switched to an IPO for the capital raise aspect,"" said Ran Ben-Tzur, a capital markets lawyer at Fenwick & West LLP.
NO MONEY RAISED
Palantir and Asana are two technology companies defying the coronavirus downturn. 
Palantir will also be the first direct listing where the majority of shares will be restricted from being sold until after the company reports 2020 earnings early next year. Such lock-up agreements are standard in IPOs but have so far been absent from direct listings and can result in a company achieving a higher valuation. 
""Banks have done the math on the impact of not having lock-up agreements in a traditional IPO and believe that without a lock-up structure a company will not able to raise at as high of a valuation because there's no scarcity of shares,"" Ben-Tzur said. 
For Asana, whose investors will not be subject to any lock-up restrictions, one reason the company was attracted to a direct listing was the desire for a fairer way to price the shares, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Asana declined to comment.
Kevin Hartz, who took the event-ticketing company he co-founded, Eventbrite Inc (N:EB), public through an IPO two years ago, said in an interview that more companies are considering alternative ways to go public including direct listings in search of a better price-discovery process.
""It's still a very broken process for new issuances like the Snowflake IPO. By underpricing, this brought significant dilution. That is not an optimal outcome for the company nor existing investors,"" said Hartz.
Both Palantir and Asana hired banks to provide financial advice for their direct listings. On the direct listings done to date, a smaller group of banks have shared a smaller pot of fees. 

For its 2019 listing, Slack, which was worth around $23 billion when it started trading, expected to pay $22.1 million in fees to three financial advisers. By comparison, 26 banks earned $85 million in commissions from the 2017 IPO of  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP), which was worth about $31 billion at the time of its public listing.

The investment bank said its predictions were in stark contrast to what's expected by most market participants, who see ""a blue wave election to have major downward ramifications for earnings"".
Goldman models a 4% upward revision by 2024 to its baseline earnings forecast, which assumes no change in policy, and the potential earnings outlook under policies expected to be enacted in the event of a Democratic sweep.
""From an earnings perspective, a Democratic sweep could have a modestly positive net impact on the trajectory of S&P 500 profits"", the analysts wrote in a research note, adding that other factors should play a bigger role in shaping the future profits.
""Over a medium-term horizon, the status of a vaccine, the path of the economic recovery, and Fed policy will be more important in determining equity valuations than the outcome of the election.""
The end of the uncertainty surrounding the November election should in any case support stocks, they said.
""Regardless of the outcome, the resolution of the election should help reduce equity risk premium and support valuations"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Dave Lewis steps down on Wednesday after six years as Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) chief executive, during which he got Britain's biggest retailer back on track after an accounting crisis, leaving new challenges for his successor Ken Murphy.
Murphy, 53, who was formerly at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance (O:WBA), faces the long-term impact of the coronavirus crisis, a recession and possible disruption when Britain's Brexit transition period finishes at the end of 2020.
Tesco was on its knees shortly after former  Unilever  (L:ULVR) executive Lewis, 55, joined in 2014 when an accounting scandal knocked millions off its profits and billions off its share price.
But by October last year, Lewis declared Tesco's turnaround complete, its position as clear market leader among Britain's supermarket groups reinforced.
Lewis received a total pay package of 6.4 million pounds ($8.2 million) in 2019-20.
Murphy, an Irishman who is taking on his highest profile business role, starts as Britain's supermarkets have seen grocery sales boosted by the pandemic, both in stores and online, but have also seen a big increase in costs.
There are also fears that the pandemic-induced recession will spark a margin damaging price war.
After Lewis sold Tesco's businesses in Thailand and Malaysia, and in Poland, Murphy will have to decide the future of its central European division, with stores in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, its only remaining overseas supermarket operations apart from Ireland.
A week after Murphy starts, analysts expect Tesco to report second quarter UK like-for-like sales growth similar to the first quarter's 8.7%, but anticipate increased costs will drag down core earnings.
Murphy's appointment at Tesco follows Simon Roberts taking over as CEO at arch rival  Sainsbury  's (L:SBRY) in June. It means that Britain's two biggest supermarket groups will be run by Boots alumni, who know each other well.

Paris-based LVMH countersued Tiffany on Monday, arguing that its agreement with the company had no carve-out for pandemics under the definition of a so-called material adverse effect. As a result, Tiffany assumed the risk of a virus outbreak, LVMH said.
Disputing LVMH's claim that the ""pandemic had devastated Tiffany's business"", the U.S. jeweler said it only experienced a single quarter of losses before returning to profitability.
""LVMH cannot show that the steps Tiffany took to protect the health and welfare of its employees and customers during the pandemic violated the Merger Agreement,"" Tiffany said. 
The company said LVMH had still not provided it or the court with a copy of the letter from the French government that prohibited the acquisition prior to its scheduled date.

A U.S. judge last week set a four-day trial on the case beginning Jan. 5. The judge said during a hearing that he hoped Tiffany and LVMH could have ""productive discussions to avoid the need for litigation.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open largely unchanged Tuesday, after Monday’s strong gains, as investors warily await the first U.S. presidential debate and look for progress of a fiscal stimulus package in Washington. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures were largely flat, the Dow Futures contract was also flat, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 7 points, or 0.1%. 
The major U.S. cash indexes closed firmly higher Monday, with all three benchmarks ending up over 1.5%. However, they are still on track to snap a five-month win streak after sellers dominated through most of September.
Investors are awaiting the first debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden later Tuesday, with the election just over a month away. The two are expected to face questions about everything from healthcare policy in the time of Covid to national security and immigration. 
“Tonight's debate will be critical, since it represents one of the last set-piece opportunities for either candidate to change the contours of the race,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts wrote in a note.
Also of interest will be the prospect of further U.S. stimulus after House Democrats unveiled a slimmer $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill, in what seems a last-ditch attempt at a compromise in order to create a new coronavirus relief package.
This comes as the global death toll from Covid-19 rose past one million on Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. 
Americans should expect Covid-19 cases to rise “in the days ahead”, Vice President Mike Pence said Monday, with increased testing showing worrying trends in some Midwest states. Earlier in the day, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious diseases expert, said the U.S. is “not in a good place.” 
On the data slate, September consumer confidence data from the Conference Board are expected out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the number at 89.2, which would be up from 84.8 the prior month.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Advent International has raised a $2 billion fund to invest in Latin American companies, it said on Tuesday, its seventh focused on the region, hoping to target assets made cheaper by depreciation in local currencies. 
The firm, which has been investing in Latin America since 1996, is eying 13 to 15 opportunities in financial services, healthcare, industrials, consumer and technology, mainly in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.
Advent says it is targeting equity investments between $50 million and $300 million, which should lead it to deals bigger than those made by its previous funds in local currencies, as money in Latin America - mainly Brazil's real - has devalued during the coronavirus pandemic.
The real is down nearly 30% against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year.
""It gives us firepower for bigger deals,"" Patrice Etlin, a managing partner at Advent in São Paulo and member of the firm's global executive committee, said in an interview. He added that the fund is 65% bigger in reais than the previous one, which was slightly bigger in dollar terms. 
Reuters first reported that Advent was seeking to raise a new fund for the region last year.
Despite the recessionary outlook for Latin America due to the pandemic, Etlin said the region offers good investment opportunities. ""In our current portfolio, we have seen a fast recovery from the worst of the pandemic.""
Etlin said the fund has been analyzing tech companies recently, as he considers the environment in Brazil attractive for such investments.
Earlier this month, Brazilian financial startup Nubank acquired Advent-backed broker Easynvest in a cash and stock deal that gave the private equity firm an undisclosed minority stake in Brazil's most prominent fintech.
Last year, Advent launched a $2 billion dedicated tech fund and an office in Palo Alto, California, as part of its expansion in technology investments.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet (O:GOOGL) unit Google has offered concessions for a second time in a bid to address EU antitrust regulators' concerns about its bid for fitness tracker maker Fitbit (N:FIT), a European Commission filing showed on Tuesday.
The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 23, did not publish details of the concessions in line with its policy.
The EU competition enforcer will now seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more, or either clear or block the detail.
Last month, it rejected Google's pledge not to use the fitness tracker's data for advertising purposes in a bid to address competition concerns, saying that it was insufficient.
The Commission recently asked Google rivals and customers about interoperability issues, what technical steps the company could take to foreclose competition to Fitbit to increase its sales, and how incentives could prompt it to do so, according to a person familiar with the matter.

It also asked about issues related to digital healthcare and the kind of data Google needs and where they could acquire it, the person said, suggesting concessions may be needed in these two areas.

With no domestic network, the Southeast Asian city-state's national carrier (SI:SIAL) has been financially battered by curbs on international travel and recently laid off around a fifth of its staff.
The airline also said on Tuesday it would offer tours of its training centre and flight simulator experiences but scrapped an initial idea to follow a growing trend in Asia for scenic flights following backlash on environmental grounds. 
""With COVID-19 drastically reducing the number of flights operated by the SIA Group, we have created unique activities that would allow us to engage with our fans and customers during this time,"" Goh Choon Phong, CEO of Singapore Airlines (SIA) said.
Those who wish to dine aboard the double-decker A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft, can choose between different cabin classes and menus designed by international chefs. Customers will be given goodie bags and those who wear traditional clothing to dine will receive additional gifts.
If customers opt to have the plane food delivered to their home, they will receive welcome videos, guides on how to heat and plate the dishes and ""a specially curated playlist to recreate the SIA onboard experience"", the airline said.
Earlier this month, Thai Airways transformed the cafeteria of its Bangkok headquarters into an airline-themed restaurant, decked out with airplane parts and seats and cabin crew in full uniform.

Converting retired planes into eateries is not a new concept, but using active planes for such purposes shows the financial stress airlines are under with passenger traffic not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024.

666,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 05:47AM ET</span>",StockBeat: LVMH Risks Making a Dog's Breakfast of Tiffany's,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Has Bernard Arnault made a dog's breakfast of Tiffany's?
LVMH (PA:LVMH), the company founded by France's richest man, has a bad case of buyer’s remorse, but it has its work cut out in trying to get out of its $16.6 billion offer for New York’s most famous jeweller.  Its countersuit on Monday, filed in a Delaware court after Tiffany's (NYSE:TIF) had sued to enforce the terms of the takeover, has some strong arguments but has very few legal precedents to offer it hope: according to Delaware courts have only once granted a suit to tear up a merger agreement on the grounds that LVMH is seeking.
LVMH has probably made life even harder for itself by changing its story over the last month: it said in early September that it had been unable to complete the merger because of a request from the French government, whose plans to introduce a new digital service tax had prompted the announcement of tariffs on French goods by President Donald Trump’s administration.
Only later did it start to argue publicly what is now its main defense: that the pandemic, and Tiffany’s mishandling of it, constitutes a “material adverse effect”,  meaning effectively that LVMH would be buying a company very different from the one it agreed to buy.
Merger agreements typically have clauses written into them that excuse the buyer from completing the acquisition in the case of a “material adverse effect”.  They also include clauses at the target company’s request that detail the kinds of circumstances that wouldn’t qualify as such, hence the key passage in LVMH’s filing:
“In the course of the negotiation, Tiffany sought and received carveouts for highly specific events, such as “cyberattacks”, the “Yellow Vest” movement and the “Hong-Kong Protests”. Yet Tiffany did not obtain a carveout for public health crises or pandemics. In contrast, hundreds of other merger agreements executed in the decade preceding the Merger Agreement contained express pandemic or epidemic carveouts. “
That the pandemic would hit Tiffany hard was obvious from the very start. It depends heavily on footfall to its boutiques, especially the flagship store in New York, which was pummelled by the virus in March and April. It’s also disproportionately dependent on tourist spending, which all but completely dried up.
Which being the case, LVMH argues that Tiffany shouldn’t have been taking on additional debt to carry on paying dividends this year. The French company argues that this amounted to a breach of covenant by Tiffany to preserve its business organizations substantially intact.
An expedited trial is scheduled for January. In the meantime, negotiations between the two could result in an agreement for the deal to go ahead at a lower price.
The weakness of Tiffany’s outlook as a standalone business – analysts don’t expect sales to return to pre-pandemic levels for three years – puts a lot of pressure on management to get the deal done. , A looming second wave of Covid-19 will not help Tiffany’s position in such circumstances.  Tiffany’s current share price says the market expects Bernard Arnault to get a discount of 13% to his rich initial offer.  He’ll get it a much bigger one if – if - the court accepts his arguments."

Veolia has described the offer as part of its ambition to create a ""world champion of ecological transformation"".
Engie's board chairman Jean-Pierre Clamadieu said the Sept. 30 expiry of Veolia's offer and the fact that no counter-bid had emerged was putting Engie, which owns almost 32% of Suez, under pressure.
Clamadieu also said Veolia's plan for Suez was solid and that Engie's board would decide on Wednesday on the group's bid, which it has promised to enhance, whether it be the price or commitments in terms of jobs.
""About the price, I don't know what (Veolia CEO) Antoine Frerot will tell us today or tomorrow. Engie's board will have to decide tomorrow what position it will take regarding this offer"", he told a parliamentary hearing.
Activist fund Amber earlier urged Engie's board to decide on Veolia's offer by Wednesday, dubbing it a ""unique opportunity (...) that should not be missed"".
Clamadieu also said he was disappointed no rival bid emerged for Suez and added he had been taken aback by the Suez's management move to put its French water business in an ""obscure"" Dutch foundation, a move seen as a ""poison pill"" against Veolia.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the French state would not give in to any pressure over Veolia's bid for Suez, asking both companies to be reasonable and stressing there was no rush.
The French state holds a 23.6% stake in Engie. Clamadieu said the government, as a board member, had approved Engie's new strategic decisions, including the sale of financial holdings.
Suez shares were down 0.27% at 0910 GMT but still up more than 19% since Veolia announced its bid on August 30.

Separately, Bloomberg News reported that the Tata Group, whose listed companies have a combined market value of $160 billion, is in discussions with potential investors about stakes in its digital platform. 
Walmart did not respond to a Reuters request for comment, while Tata and Goldman declined to comment.
Shares of Tata Group flagship  Tata Consultancy Services  (NS:TCS) climbed 2.6% on Tuesday, while  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC) gained nearly 1% in a flat overall market (NSEI). 
If the deal goes through, it could mark Walmart's biggest investment in the country, topping the $16 billion the U.S.-based retailer paid for a 66% stake in ecommerce company Flipkart.

They have targeted a growing population of tech-savvy shoppers, luring them with discounts, free returns and easy exchanges.
""Tata already has a good reputation for its products and Walmart's advanced technology and experience in the space will help with better distribution,"" said Rajiv Frank, marketing and brand consultant at New Delhi-based Brandtrotter.

Among the sectors in negative territory: growth-sensitive banks, automakers and travel & leisure, all down between 0.7% and 0.9%. 
Investors are weighing the potential impact on the U.S. economy of either the re-election of President Donald Trump or a victory for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. 
Many see a Biden victory increasing the chances of further fiscal stimulus to counter the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic, judging such a scenario would be a boon for stocks. 
""What seems clear is that were you to see a blue wave, a Democratic sweep, you'd see substantial fiscal stimulus,"" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ""The risk, I have always thought, to this recovery is premature fiscal tightening.""
Biden's campaign has seized on a fresh line of attack on the eve of the debate with Trump - set for after the U.S. market close - accusing the Republican incumbent of gaming the system to avoid paying his fair share of taxes. 
""Tonight's debate will be critical, since it represents one of the last set-piece opportunities for either candidate to change the contours of the race,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts wrote in a note.
U.S shares were set to open lower, with futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq giving up earlier gains to slip into negative territory. Hard-hit sectors like hotels, banks and airlines had made strong gains on Monday.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in nearly 50 countries, was flat.

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday that Democratic lawmakers unveiled a new, $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Pelosi in recent days has said she thinks a deal can be reached with the White House on a new coronavirus relief package and that talks were continuing.
CONFIDENT CONSUMERS?
Also in focus was economic data due later in the day that is set to shed light on the U.S. economy's progress, with consumer confidence and home price data on the agenda.

Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, shedding earlier gains. China's blue-chip CSI 300 index climbed 0.2%, though Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 0.9%, wiping out morning gains.
Asian markets have been buoyed by positive signs around China's economic recovery, although the continuing havoc caused by the coronavirus pandemic has raised concern about high valuations.
Elsewhere, sterling extended its overnight gains on optimism about a Brexit trade deal as the European Union and Britain kicked off a decisive week of talks.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Tuesday, as investors banked some of the gains from the previous session, fretting about the damage the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is doing to the region’s economy.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.7% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 1%.
The global death toll from Covid-19 pandemic rose past 1 million on Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, with the death rate increasing in recent weeks as infections surged in several countries.
Europe accounts for nearly 25% of the deaths, and the World Health Organization has warned of a worrying spread in western Europe just weeks away from the winter flu season.
French consumer confidence held steady in September, as INSEE's consumer confidence index held at 95, after a single point upwards revision for the month of August. This is reasonably good news, but last week’s PMI data showed Europe’s recovery had stalled, with the dominant services sector dropping below 50.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Monday that the region’s central bank is ready to deploy more monetary stimulus to aid the recovery if needed, but this is likely to take some time to be agreed upon.

673,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",China real estate takes back seat as hopes pinned on consumption to drive recovery,"By Lusha Zhang and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China is tapping the brakes on property prices and cutting the availability of mortgage loans to spur households to spend instead of repaying debt, as policymakers try to ignite private consumption and stimulate the pandemic-stricken economy.
China's household leverage ratio had soared to a record by the end of June, prodded by a jump in mortgages as the government allowed real estate to support the economy.
Indeed, the mortgage burden for Chinese households has grown so huge that it hobbles private consumption, analysts say, and residential incomes plunged into negative territory this year.
Since August, policymakers have tried to stimulate spending under a so-called ""dual circulation"" strategy President Xi Jinping espoused this year, analysts say.
But balancing consumption with the property market could be tricky to pull off. A precipitous fall in property prices would crush consumer sentiment, the opposite of what policymakers want to achieve.
""China's property market is more and more crowding out spending ability,"" said Wang Jingwen, senior analyst with China Minsheng Bank. ""Those who have to tighten their belts to pay down payments or mortgages are the ones with the most marginal propensity to consume, a demographic critical to China's shift to a consumption-led economy."" 
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) said in a report last year that China's property market has not made a net contribution to the economy since 2018, when homes became so expensive that they left little spending cash for households. 
China's central bank said last year that every 1 percentage point increase in ratio of household debt to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) would cut retail sales growth by 0.3 percentage point. The ratio rose to 59.7% as of end-June, from 55.8% at the end of 2019, CASS data showed.
At the same time, household income has plummeted, down 1.3% in the first half of this year, compared with a 5.8% increase in 2019.
Data will not immediately show whether slowing mortgage growth is giving households more financial freedom to spend, unless incomes suddenly jump.
Still, in August, for the first time this year, retail sales grew, up 0.5% year-on-year. 
""The government aims to rely less on the property market, but will keep it moving within a band, to prevent any drastic price rise or drop,"" said Lu Wenxi, senior analyst for property agency Centaline. 
GRAPHIC - China's new home prices growth: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-ECONOMY/CHART/bdwvkklwdvm/chart.png
INCOME GROWTH
At the height of the Sino-U.S. trade war in 2019, new home prices were allowed to rack up double-digit gains for months, piercing the upper limit of what analysts say is an informal regulatory band determined by the growth rates of household income and gross domestic product. 
Then came COVID-19. 
China's first economic contraction on record prompted the government to quickly loosen curbs on the property market, which traditionally contributes a fifth of China's GDP. 
Mortgage debt ballooned, with medium- to long-term household loans hitting a record in July, central bank data showed. 
But instead of letting the property market soar further, policies soon guided prices back into a lower range not seen since early 2018. Prices have been growing just under 5% year-on-year in recent months. 
Economists polled by Reuters expected China's home prices to grow 4.8% this year and slow to 3% for the first half of 2021.
""The important thing is to guide money into the real economy, and let real industries fuel economic growth and get income growth to outpace home price growth,"" said Song Hongwei, senior analyst of Shanghai-based property consultancy Tospur. 
That would deflate the property bubble without bursting it, and let consumption become a more important economic driver, Song added.
Economists say the household debt ratio will keep growing as new homes are built amid urbanisation and urban renewal, but at a pace more in line with the growth rate of the rest of the economy. 
""The key is to give people money to spend,"" Yao Jingyuan, an adviser to the cabinet, told Reuters.

""In the past, because of our economic model, capital has contributed more to economic growth, and enjoyed a bigger share in distribution,"" Yao added. ""Rich people got richer and banks made big fortunes. In the future, we should adjust the contribution of key factors and let workers' incomes to get a bigger share.""

Back in Europe, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said, while addressing European lawmakers on Monday, that the region’s central bank is ready to deploy more monetary stimulus to aid the recovery if needed as the pandemic hampers prospects for the economy.
This comes as the global death toll from Covid-19 rose past 1 million on Tuesday, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University, with the death rate increasing in recent weeks as infections surged in several countries.

The report also said that growth in China would be 2% for 2020, attributable to government spending, strong exports and a low rate of new cases since March but limited by slow domestic consumption. Meanwhile, growth in the rest of the region is projected to contract by 3.5%.
“Globally, a loss of momentum and the renewed rise in COVID-19 infection rates points to the need for additional fiscal and monetary support. That policy outlook is continuing to provide a supportive backdrop to equities despite recent volatility,” ANZ Bank New Zealand analysts said in a note."

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A $2.2 trillion draft bill for coronavirus aid unveiled by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives late on Monday gave airlines some hope for a second bailout before tens of thousands of layoffs occur on Thursday, although tough hurdles remained.
""I'm hopeful. I'm not necessarily optimistic,"" Chief Executive Nicholas Calio of trade group Airlines for America told ""PBS NewsHour"" in an interview.
Washington insiders said passage by Thursday, when an initial $25 billion that protected airline jobs through September expires, was unlikely, and the airline group did not detail the congressional action it hoped to see.
An option would be a quick standalone bill for the airlines, although senior Democratic congressional aides said that was also difficult given that many industries are seeking help.
International President of Flight Attendants-CWA Sara Nelson called the proposal, which includes $25 billion for airlines to keep workers on the payroll for another six months, ""a significant and serious move in negotiations.""
""It makes agreement on a full relief bill very possible in time to save our jobs,"" she said.
Between United Airlines (O:UAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL) alone, more than 30,000 employees will be furloughed on Thursday, and tens of thousands more at those airlines and others have agreed to voluntary leave as the sector battles a deep downturn in demand because of the pandemic.
Julie Hedrick, president of the union representing American Airlines' flight attendants, called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to schedule a vote.
""If we are going to save the airline industry, we have to do it now,"" she said.
The House bill would provide $28.3 billion for the aviation sector, including $25 billion for passenger airlines and $3 billion for cargo carriers, under the same terms as the first package in March.
The measure would provide $13.5 billion to airports as well as aid for other sectors, including $120 billion to restaurants.

It would also direct $75 million to ensure scheduled passenger air service to small communities.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies has built up stakes in Chinese semiconductor companies and other tech businesses as the world's largest telecoms equipment maker bolsters its supply chain in the face of pressure from the United States.
Habo Investments, set up by Huawei in April 2019, has closed 17 deals for stakes in Chinese tech companies since August last year, public records show. 
The investment arm was established in response to what Huawei's rotating chairman, Guo Ping, last week described as ""suppression"" by the United States after escalating restrictions that have cut off Huawei's supplies of many overseas chips and effectively barred it from building its own.
""Since Huawei is only one company, we use investment and technology to help our supply chain partners become mature,"" he said.
The company has emerged as a focal point in deteriorating U.S.-China relations with President Donald Trump's administration alleging that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese company has denied repeatedly.
Huawei's investment push also coincides with ramped-up government efforts to boost China's semiconductor sector, which still lags behind leading chip producers including the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.
CHASING CHIPS
While the investments might help Huawei in the future, analysts say they have done little so far to address the supply chain gaps that are undermining its once-booming smartphone business and could eventually threaten its core network equipment operations.
""It will take a long time,"" said one Chinese chip investor. ""But they don't have many good options, so they must turn to investing outside."" 
Huawei declined to comment on the investment division's operations. 
Most of Habo Investment's deals have been in chip-related Chinese start-ups, a few of which have become part of Huawei's supply chain.
Vertilite, which was founded in 2015 and received an investment from Huawei this year, makes VCSEL sensors that support facial-recognition technology in cameras. 
The company did not respond immediately to a request for comment, but one Vertilite investor said its sensors are used in a number of Huawei handsets.
However, many of the businesses Huawei has backed are at an early stage in their development.
""Most of these companies are small, niche players who are good at what they do, but they are not necessarily globally competitive,"" said Ivan Platonov, who tracks China's chip sector at research company EqualOcean.
Shoulder Electronics, for example, makes RF filters that enable wireless communications but has yet to achieve compatibility for advanced 5G phones. 
A spokesman for the company, which received investment from Habo in January, could not be reached outside business hours on Monday.
3Peak, which also received investment from Habo this year, makes analogue-to-digital converters (ADC) used in wireless network base stations. 
U.S. players dominate that market segment and 3Peak generated only 300 million yuan ($43.99 million) in revenue last year, according to a prospectus it issued before listing on Shanghai's STAR market.
3Peak did not respond immediately to an emailed request for comment.
Habo's portfolio also includes companies outside Huawei's core telecoms operations. Several investments in chips, raw materials and battery technology companies point to ambitions in self-driving cars.
Late last month it also closed an investment in Open Source China, a Shenzhen-based business behind Gitee, a Chinese rival to U.S. coding platform GitHub.
Gitee did not respond immediately to an emailed request for comment.
Habo typically acquires stakes of 5-10%, filings show, though valuations have not been disclosed.
CHANGE OF PACE
The recent investments mark a change in pace and tactics for Huawei, ramping up the frequency of such deals and refocusing on domestic businesses rather than overseas companies.
In 2013, for example, Huawei acquired Ghent-based photonics company Calopia. The following year it purchased Neul, a British maker of chips for the internet-of-things sector.

""Huawei likes to do its own R&D. So investment or acquisition was done only as a last resort, and that was why it tended to be towards U.S. or European technology companies,"" said one former Huawei staffer who helped to scout acquisition targets.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Pension funds for truckers, teachers and subway workers have lodged lawsuits in the United States against Germany's Allianz, one of the world's top asset managers, for failing to safeguard their investments during the coronavirus market meltdown.
Market panic around the virus that resulted in billions in losses earlier this year scarred many investors, but no other top-tier asset manager is facing such a large number of lawsuits in the United States connected to the turbulence. 
In March, Allianz (DE:ALVG) was forced to shutter two private hedge funds after severe losses, prompting the wave of litigation the company says is ""legally and factually flawed"".
Together, the various suits filed in the U.S. Southern District of New York claim investors lost a total of around $4 billion. The fallout has also prompted questions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Allianz has said.
A spokesman for Allianz Global Investors said in a statement to Reuters: ""While the losses were disappointing, the allegations made by claimants are legally and factually flawed, and we will defend ourselves vigorously against them.""
The plaintiffs are professional investors who bought funds that ""involved risks commensurate with those higher returns,"" the spokesman added.
The latest claims against Allianz and its asset management arm Allianz Global Investors last week include one from the pension fund for the operator of New York's transport system, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). It has 70,000 employees and made an initial investment of $200 million.
Similar suits have been filed against Allianz by pension funds for the Teamster labor union, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Arkansas teachers. The suits are seeking a jury trial to award damages.
The suits allege that Allianz Global Investors, in its Structured Alpha family of funds, strayed from a strategy of using options to protect against a short-term financial market crash.
The SEC's inquiry continues and Allianz is cooperating. The SEC did not respond to requests for comment.
Attracting investors with an ""all-weather"" investing approach, Allianz ""bet the house"" and ""out of greed ... sacrificed the hard-earned pension and benefits of the MTA's workers, who at the time were risking their lives under COVID keeping New York alive,"" the MTA's lawsuit said.
An MTA spokesman said employee pensions are not at risk.
The cases are a second front of litigation for Allianz, one of Europe's largest insurance companies. The Munich-based company and its competitors face suits for not paying claims related to business closures during the pandemic lockdowns. 
The company's insurance business as a whole has been under pressure as it faces claims for cancelled events, and a decline in demand for car and travel insurance. It expects to post the first decline in annual profit in nearly a decade.
At the end of March, Allianz informed investors it was liquidating two funds, as well as an offshore feeder fund. Investors lost 97% on one of the funds, the suits say.
In April, Morningstar downgraded its rating for the remaining funds to negative ""because of the failure in risk management protocols and the uncertainty"".

Allianz disputed that rating and in July published an internal report https://us.allianzgi.com/en-us/institutional/strategies-and-solutions/alternatives/liquid-alternative-investments/structured-alpha-march-2020-performance that found that the losses ""were not the result of any failure in the portfolio's investment strategy or risk management processes"".

Instead, Petroleos Mexicanos is drowning in debt, its oil output is declining, and now it appears to be losing fuel market share in its own backyard.
In the past 21 months of the Lopez Obrador administration, Pemex has lost roughly 13% of Mexico’s gasoline market to private companies, compared with 4.5% in the previous 35 months since Mexico liberalized its fuels market, according government figures compiled by Bloomberg. His government is now seeking to dial back the reforms that have allowed the world’s biggest players to wrest business from Pemex.
“The cracks are beginning to appear” in AMLO’s energy policies, said Rajan Vig, founder of independent oil-trading firm Indimex in Mexico City. “Demand continues to exist. In fact, it has increased. And if you restrict supply, people are going to have to find more creative ways of bringing in the product.”
In 2016, Mexico allowed companies other than Pemex to import, distribute and sell fuels for the first time since the industry was nationalized in 1938. Since then, the world’s top energy companies have invested aggressively in Mexico, with oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, BP (NYSE:BP) Plc,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) opening thousands of gasoline stations, and international trading houses including Koch Industries Inc., Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc and Trafigura Beheer BV building fuel storage, transport and logistics infrastructure to bring more barrels into the country.
Those efforts are bearing fruit. At the end of August, private companies were supplying about 17.5% of total gasoline volumes in the country and approximately 27% of diesel, fuels production and imports data from the energy ministry show. While Pemex saw a jump in diesel imports in August, in June and July private companies imported more diesel than the state-owned oil company for the first time.
The trend bodes poorly for the Lopez Obrador administration, which has pledged to strengthen Pemex by dialing back the 2013-2014 energy reforms of the previous administration. Last week, AMLO told energy regulators in a closed-door meeting to stop issuing new permits for fuel retailers and energy infrastructure. He said that he will consider changing the constitution in the next three years if his goal of reversing output declines at Pemex can’t be met under current laws.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on Monday introduced bipartisan legislation to reform the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) aircraft certification process in the wake of two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes.
The Boeing 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two crashes in five months killed 346 people. Boeing did not immediately comment.
The committee is set to vote on Wednesday on the proposed legislation that would require U.S. aircraft manufacturers to adopt safety management systems and requires an expert review panel to evaluate Boeing's safety culture and make recommendations for improvements.
The proposal, which has the backing of committee chair Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, and the top Republican Sam Graves would also require manufacturers to complete system safety assessments for significant design changes, ensure risk calculations are based on realistic assumptions of pilot response time, and share risk assessments with the FAA.
DeFazio said Congress can ""meaningfully address the gaps in the regulatory system for certifying aircraft and adopt critical reforms that will improve public safety and ensure accountability at all levels going forward.""
The prospects for winning approval for the legislation this year remain unclear. On Sept. 16, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee postponed consideration of a separate bill to overhaul FAA aircraft certification.
The same day, House Transportation committee Democrats issued a report that found the 737 MAX crashes were the ""horrific culmination"" of failures by Boeing and the FAA and called for urgent reforms.
The House bill would extend airline whistleblower protections to U.S. manufacturing employees, require FAA approval of new workers performing delegated certification tasks for the agency and impose civil penalties against those who interfere with performance of FAA-authorized duties.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson will conduct an evaluation flight at the controls of a 737 MAX on Wednesday, a key milestone as the U.S. planemaker works to win approval to resume flights.

The filing comes at the start of a blockbuster week for IPOs with the likes of Central Intelligence Agency-backed Palantir Technologies and workplace app Asana Inc set for their market debuts.
Buyout firm TPG had acquired a majority stake in McAfee from Intel in 2016 in a deal which valued the company at $4.2 billion, including debt.
McAfee has managed to grow its main cyber security software business, which focuses on consumers, through price increases, new partner programs and good retention rates in the last few years, according credit ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service Inc.
The growth has been partially offset, however, by weakness in its business of serving other companies, which remains competitive, according to Moody's.
McAfee's revenue jumped 9.4% to $2.64 billion in the year ended Dec. 2019, while net loss narrowed to $236 million from $512 million during the same period.
The company hired the former CEO of BMC Software, Peter Leav, as its new chief executive, Reuters reported in January.

The share of Taiwanese financial institutions in China’s offshore syndicated and club loans tumbled to the lowest since at least the first three quarters of 2010 to $362 million-equivalent for 2020 year-to-date, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on deals with disclosed lender commitments. This is a 74% drop compared to the first three quarters of last year, continuing a downward trend that began in 2018.
The total volume of Chinese offshore syndicated and club loans with at least one Taiwanese lender involved has also tumbled to $4.9 billion for this year so far, falling 65% compared to $14.1 billion the first three quarters of 2019, Bloomberg-compiled data show.
The drop in lending by Taiwanese banks is driven by concerns over the pandemic’s economic impact on China, as well as lenders generally, not just those in Taiwan, turning increasingly cautious over the uncertain geopolitical backdrop, said Vicky He, Credit Suisse’s head of loan syndication for North Asia.
As of June, 36 Taiwanese banks were exposed to the tune of NT$1.6 billion ($55 billion) to China, including credit lines, investments and cash deposits. On average, that was 37.5% of their 2019 net worth, according to Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission, down from 47% in the same period in 2018.
Credit Suisse’s He said banks now focus on existing relationships where they can see the borrowers’ track record, as well as reputable, tier-one private equity sponsor-driven transactions.

BERLIN (Reuters) - EdtechX Holdings, an investment platform focusing on the future of education and work, is launching its second listed blank-check company and is looking to buy a business in the sector worth up to $2 billion.
Run by a Franco-British duo of financiers, EdtechX Holdings Acquisition Corp II is seeking to raise gross proceeds of up to $150 million by floating on New York's Nasdaq exchange, according to its prospectus filed on Monday.
Flotations by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), or blank-check companies, have in 2020 emerged as an increasingly popular route to the public markets over a traditional IPO.
A SPAC is a shell company which raises funds in an initial public offering (IPO) with the goal of acquiring a private company, usually within two years of listing. The acquired company then becomes publicly traded as a result.
According to the prospectus, the venture will seek to sign a deal with a company in the private education, training and education technology sectors with an enterprise value of between $400 million and $2 billion.
Its focus will be on the United States, Europe and Asia, excluding China.
EdtechX Holdings II is managed by financiers Benjamin Vedrenne-Cloquet and Charles McIntyre, who also own IBIS Capital, a niche investment bank based in London, and EdtechX Global, a thematic research and events platform.
The launch follows an earlier IPO of a first listed shell by EdtechX Holdings in 2018. The venture completed a $535 million merger with Meten, China's top English-language training company, in March.
Meten EdtechX (O:METX) briefly gained unicorn status - with a valuation of more than $1 billion - after the merger. Its shares have since declined as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted its operations.
Investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) is the sole bookrunner on the latest deal, with Macquarie Capital acting as lead manager.

(Reuters) - LVMH (PA:LVMH) countersued  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF) on Monday, arguing the iconic U.S. jeweler's financial mismanagement in the pandemic permits the French luxury goods giant to walk away from its proposed $16 billion acquisition of the company.
The move comes after Tiffany sued LVMH earlier this month, objecting to the Paris-based company's decision not to go through with the deal they signed in November because of a French government request and the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
In its counterclaims filed in Delaware Chancery Court on Monday, LVMH said the agreement with Tiffany had no carve-out for pandemics under the definition of a so-called material adverse effect. As a result, Tiffany assumed the risk of a virus outbreak, LVMH added.
The French company also said Tiffany breached its agreement to operate as usual by paying out the highest possible dividend. 
LVMH said it could not close the deal with Tiffany because it received a letter from the French government asking the conglomerate to delay the transaction until next year, beyond the Nov. 24 contractual deadline the companies had agreed to.
Tiffany did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has disputed LVMH's assertion that the French government intervention prevents it from closing the deal and that a material adverse effect had occurred. It also defended its ability to pay out dividends under its contract with LVMH.
LVMH also said Tiffany stands to profit ""far more"" if the deal proceeds than as a stand-alone company. Tiffany's top five executives are in line to receive at least $100 million in total compensation if the deal moves forward, according to the counterclaims.
A U.S. judge last week set a four-day trial on the case beginning Jan. 5.
The judge said during a hearing he hoped Tiffany and LVMH could have ""productive discussions to avoid the need for litigation,"" referring to a potential settlement.
The letter that LVMH says prevents it from completing the deal was signed by France's foreign minister, who said his office had received an inquiry from LVMH, and that it was natural for him to respond with advice.

LVMH in its counterclaim said the letter is a mandatory directive to take part in France's efforts to defend its national interests in a trade dispute with the United States.

(Reuters) -  Universal Health Services  Inc (NYSE:UHS), one of the largest for-profit hospital operators in the United States, said on Monday its network has been knocked offline following an unspecified ""IT security issue.""
UHS, which runs some 400 hospitals and care centers, mainly in the United States but also in the United Kingdom, did not specify the nature of the issue, saying in a brief statement it was using ""established back-up processes"" to recover.
Text messages reviewed by Reuters showed UHS instructing employees to avoid exposing their devices to the company's corporate network, something one expert said was a sign of a ransomware outbreak.
""I can't think of any other reason,"" said Gabrielle Hempel, a researcher who studies the security of medical devices and says she has been in touch with people dealing with the incident.
Ransomware, which works by locking victims out of their computers until a ransom payment is made, has long been a pernicious threat to hospitals and health care providers. The coronavirus pandemic has heightened concerns that cybercriminals could target medical facilities.
UHS' statement said ""our facilities are using their established back-up processes including offline documentation methods,"" adding that patient care ""continues to be delivered safely and effectively."" It said no patient or employee data appeared to have been compromised.
In text messages to employees, the company said the disruption ""may last 24 hours or more.""
""Do NOT attempt to connect to UHS email or other UHS network applications,"" one of the messages said.
The nature of the disruption in UHS' case was not clear. The company has not answered questions about the size and scope of the problem. Hempel said hospital cyberattacks should be taken seriously.
""Data is at risk here definitely, but you also have people's lives at risk too,"" she said.

Investing.com – The Dow closed sharply higher Monday, helped by a strong showing for the banks and technology after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi renewed investor hopes for a further coronavirus stimulus.                 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.51%, or 410 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.66%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.87%.
Financials surged on a strong rally in banking stocks as renewed hopes that Congress could still agree a deal on stimulus maintained investor expectations that the pace of economic recovery can continue.   
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rose more than 2%, while Citigroup (NYSE:C) ended 3% higher.
“We can get this done,” Pelosi said Monday on MSNBC, referring to Democrats $2.4 trillion aid package, though admitted that the White House will have to agree to ""much more spending.""
The proposed fiscal package would include unemployment benefits, direct payments to households and small business loans as well as aid for airlines.
Airlines rallied sharply, lifting industrials higher, with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), up more than 5%. United Airlines also received a boost after the carrier said its pilots agreed to reduce their working hours to avoid furloughs that were set to begin in October.
Tech, meanwhile, pushed the broader market higher. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which together make up a quarter weighting of the S&P 500, helped tech build on its gains from last week.

693,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 04:09PM ET</span>","Bank Stocks, Presidential Debate, Consumer Data: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Stocks surged Monday, recovering some of the ground lost this month, as investors and traders expressed renewed hope that another economic stimulus could be in the near future.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats were pushing ahead with a $2.4 trillion deal that would send payments directly to American households and support businesses.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 500 points at one point in the afternoon and closed up 410 points, or 1.5%, boosted by financials. Major tech stocks were also up, lifting the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite.
Another round of stimulus could continue to boost bank shares going into October. The presidential candidates square off on Tuesday in the first of three debates, and some consumer confidence and home price data are due out.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow.
1. Financials get a boost from stimulus hope
Stocks had staged quite a recovery since their low point in March, climbing more than 50%, but then September hit. Since the beginning of this month, the Dow is down nearly 3% and the Nasdaq is down nearly 6%, according to CNBC.
Investors have been fretting about the progress of the recovery and Congress' on again-off again attempts to pass another round of financial aid for the economy. Now that stimulus appears to be back on again, expect financial stocks to help lead gains.
The S&P financial sector was up 2.3% on Monday, helping to smooth over an otherwise abysmal year. Over three months, financials are up 2.25% though they are still down 23.5% year-to-date.
More stimulus could help big lenders like  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), which was up 3% on Monday. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was up 2.9%, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was up 2.6%, and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) was up 0.8%. 
2. Will Presidential debates and more scandal sway investors?
President Donald Trump faces his election opponent former Vice President Joe Biden in the first of three televised debates late Tuesday. The two are expected to face questions about everything from healthcare policy in the time of Covid to national security and immigration.
Trump may also face questions about his taxes after The New York Times published an explosive story on Sunday, based on two decades of data on the president's taxes that showed he didn't pay taxes for years and only paid $750 the year he was elected.
While the NYT report didn't appear to affect stocks on Monday, another dragged out scandal involving Trump could weigh on markets over time, especially if it appears to sway public opinion just a few weeks before the general election.
3. Consumer confidence and housing prices on tap
Speaking of swaying opinion, September consumer confidence data from the Conference Board are expected out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the number at 89.2, which would be up from 84.8 the prior month. Consumer confidence plays a role in predicting consumer spending.
In addition, the Case-Shiller home price index for July, which comes out an hour earlier at 9:00 AM ET (1300 GMT) is expected to be 0.3%, up from 0% the prior month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration faces ongoing court battles after two legal setbacks in its efforts to bar U.S. app stores from offering Chinese-owned TikTok or WeChat for download.
In two separate rulings, judges have questioned the evidence that data from American users is being accessed by the Chinese government imperiling U.S. national security that prompted the extraordinary orders by the U.S. Commerce Department.
U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who issued an order late Sunday blocking the TikTok download ban that was set for 11:59 p.m. Sunday, questioned the government's evidence.
""The government has provided ample evidence that China presents a significant national security threat, although the specific evidence of the threat posed by (TikTok), as well as whether the prohibitions are the only effective way to address that threat, remains less substantial,"" Nichols wrote in an opinion released Monday.
In the WeChat case, Judge Laurel Beeler in California wrote that ""on this record — while the government has established that China’s activities raise significant national security concerns — it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns.""
Beeler set a Oct. 15 hearing on the Justice Department's request she reconsider her ruling and allow the WeChat order to take immediate effect.
TikTok owner ByteDance and WeChat owner Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) have denied the apps are used for spying on Americans.
Nichols, a Trump appointee, anticipated further legal filings by both the government and TikTok before a final decision on whether to block other restrictions set for Nov. 12.
Nichols also rejected the Justice Department's effort to invoke the Espionage Act, which authorizes life imprisonment or the death penalty for those who share U.S. defense secrets.

""It is not plausible that the films, photos, art, or even personal information U.S. users share on TikTok fall within the plain meaning of the Espionage Act,"" Nichols wrote.

(Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Monday in a broad rally as investors sought bargains among sectors hardest-hit by the coronavirus recession, now limping toward its ninth month. 
All three major U.S. stock indexes were solidly higher on the heels of the longest weekly losing streak in over a year for both the S&P 500 and the Dow. 
But energy (SPNY) financials (SPSY) and industrials (SPLRCI), which suffered the most bruising blows from the economic shutdown, enjoyed among the largest percentage gains among major S&P 500 sectors, all of which were up more than 1%.
""Investors are looking for opportunities,"" said Oliver Pursche, president of Bronson Meadows Capital Management in Fairfield, Connecticut. ""And financials and industrials have underperformed in the last few months, so it's not surprising to see rotation into them."" 
But even with Monday's jump, the indexes are only days away from closing the books on their first monthly declines since March, when markets were sent into a freefall by pandemic-related lockdowns. 
""September is usually a rough month for markets,"" Pursche added. ""But people are going to get their third-quarter statements and be very happy with the sharp rebound.""
Indeed, with the third quarter's expected gains, the S&P is on course for its best two-quarter winning streak since 2009, and the Nasdaq is set for its largest advance since 2000. 
Market leaders Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) once again gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, and 29 of 30 constituents of the blue-chip Dow were in the black. 
Data released over the weekend showed Chinese industrial profits grew for the fourth straight month, evidence of progress in the global recovery from the pandemic recession.
The lack of a COVID-19 vaccine and an additional fiscal stimulus package from Washington nearly two months after emergency unemployment expired for millions of Americans have weighed on the markets in recent sessions. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 493.96 points, or 1.82%, to 27,667.92, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 56.1 points, or 1.70%, to 3,354.56 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 167.42 points, or 1.53%, to 11,080.98.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) announced late Friday that it has secured a $5.5 billion government loan, and might access more. The news sent the commercial carrier's stock up 4.5%.
This also gave a lift to the broader airline sector, which was badly stricken by pandemic-related restrictions and plunging demand. The S&P 1500 Airlines index <.SPCOMHOME> gained 4.4%.
Boeing (N:BA) extended Friday's gains, rising 6.1% after Federal Aviation Administration Chief Steve Dickson said the agency was set to conduct a 737 MAX evaluation flight this week.
 Devon Energy  Corp (N:DVN) said it would buy peer  WPX Energy Inc  (N:WPX) for $2.56 billion, sending their shares jumping 11.3% and 15.9%, respectively.
Ride-hailing platform  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) rose 3.2% after a judge ruled the company could resume operations in London. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 6.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.00-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 25 new lows.

The company earlier this year had postponed the two-day shopping event, which started in 2015 to drum up sales during the summer shopping lull, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""It's a wait and see moment for how the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing economic decline will impact retail sales this shopping season,"" said Matt Fox, founder of Ithaca Wealth Management.
""The October Prime Day event is close enough in people's minds that Christmas is right around the corner, compared to the usually July date of the event, therefore, expect more holiday shopping purchases to occur this year, lengthening the holiday shopping season from October to end of December.""
Amazon said it is investing an additional $100 million in special Prime Day and holiday promotional programs. 
The Seattle-based company is on an expansion spree on the back of a meteoric rise in its business, thanks to a surge in online orders during coronavirus-induced lockdowns, which helped it post its biggest-ever quarterly profit in 26 years in July.
The company does not disclose revenue from the event, but had said that merchants contributed to $2 billion in sales during Prime Day in 2019, which spanned for 48 hours and 18 countries.

U.S. automakers are facing a problem most forecasters and industry executives did not expect when the pandemic slammed the economy this spring: Strong demand and lean inventories at dealerships.
Automakers report September U.S. sales on Thursday, and forecasters expect the annualized sales pace will exceed the August rate of 15.2 million vehicles. Consumer demand for high-profit SUVs and pickup trucks has recovered rapidly since the spring.
Detroit automakers say their plants are now running at close to full speed in order to re-stock showrooms.
""We are running full out,"" said Gerald Johnson, General Motors Co's (N:GM) head of global manufacturing. 
Even so, North American production is about 2 million vehicles behind last year, said Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at research agency Cox Auto. ""The consumer demand after the shutdown ended was very strong and it continues to outpace the ability of the industry to stock the shelves,” he said.
The third quarter is usually when the industry starts building new models, and piling up inventory for the holiday season. That transition is way behind the normal schedule this year.
“The share of MY2021 inventory is only about 2.7% of all of the available inventory so far in 2020,"" said Chesbrough, referring to model year 2021. ""In comparison, it was almost 22% last year. Consumers are not finding the new models as automakers are still making the older stuff.”
REBUILDING PROFIT 
The sales recovery is driven by customers such as Michael Dean, a 58-year-old real estate agent in North Carolina. He bought a new seven-seat Toyota Land Cruiser Prado equipped with a diesel engine for $62,500, to help him expand his online swimming pool business, Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) Research.
Dean’s original first choice was a Mitsubishi Pajero, another sport utility vehicle with a more affordable price tag. A $3,000 discount, however, lured him to stretch his budget by $12,500 and buy the Prado, a rare diesel variant that some dealers in the United States still import and sell.
“My online business is doing rather well and I'm optimistic about my future income ... and the dealer discount let me justify the extra expense to myself,” Dean said.
Cox Auto and J.D. Power expect 2020 U.S. auto sales will fall by about 15% from a year earlier, but earlier in the year the forecast was for sales to decline by more than 30%. Supplies of used vehicles are also tight, sending wholesale used vehicle prices up nearly 20% compared with August 2019, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics said in a report on Monday. 
The combination of better-than-expected sales and lean inventories should rebuild profits at the Detroit automakers.
(Graphic: U.S. auto inventory position in 2020 - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-AUTOS/ygdvzkbwopw/chart.png)
Analysts expect General Motors to report a third-quarter profit of about $1.8 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) is expected to earn $638.9 million, and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) 469.5 million euros ($546.03 million).
“Most automakers have not projected huge losses and the rebound is stronger than what most forecasts suggested months ago,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president, Industry, Labor & Economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan.
CAR’s 2020 sales volume forecast is 13 million units in the United States, down about 24%. In comparison, the industry volumes were down 40% during the 2008-09 financial crisis.
U.S. dealers could have fewer vehicles to choose from for the rest of the year. J.D. Power estimates dealers will have about 3.1 million vehicles in stock by year-end, down 400,000 from 2019.
“Industry is seeing about 50% of the vehicles turning in under 20 days,” said Tyson Jominy, vice president of data and analytics at J.D. Power.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday proposed new rules for electronic trading platforms for U.S. Treasuries, corporate debt and municipal securities, aimed at improving transparency and operational preparedness in the world's biggest securities market. 
The proposal, which would be subject to public consultation, aims to address concerns about the shift to alternative trading systems (ATS) that trade government securities as well as the repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements on those securities.
The SEC has signaled for years that it planned to hone oversight on the fixed income market even as it put stiffer regulations in place for U.S. equity markets, which have generally been more transparent, industry advocates have said.
Under the new rules, ATS trading platforms will be treated more like stock exchanges, analysts expect.
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton on Monday said the proposed rules seek to ensure that ""the implementation of our time-tested regulatory framework keeps pace with market developments."" The U.S. Treasury provided input, he said.
The U.S. government securities markets are among the most liquid and significant securities markets in the world, making up more than half of the outstanding debt issuance in the U.S. bond market, the SEC said. The average daily trading volume in government securities was about $835 billion over the last six months of 2019, dwarfing equities, it said.
If adopted, the new rules would better enable regulators to hold firms accountable for potential technology glitches that affect trading and assess a platform's preparedness for cyber attacks by mandating that firms maintain backups in case of disaster or emergency scenarios, the SEC said.
The firms will also have to be more transparent about how their platforms operate.

Investor advocates have long called for more transparency and disaster-recovery measures for the ATS market. The industry has expressed concern about potentially higher compliance costs.

Investing.com --  Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) slipped 5% after billionaire Nelson Peltz quit as advisor.
The news comes days after the company reported weak sales guidance and shares tumbled.  
The activist investor resigned as a senior advisor to Aurora Cannabis to pursue other commitments, Bloomberg reported. Peltz, a founding partner of Trian Fund Management, a $9 billion hedge fund, joined Aurora 18 months ago to help the company devise a strategy for the U.S. market, Bloomberg said. 
Earlier this month, the company named Miguel Martin as chief executive officer.  
Last week, Aurora Cannabis reported that net revenue for the first quarter of 2021 is expected to be between C$60 million and C$64 million, compared to C$67.56 million in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter a year earlier, Aurora reported cannabis net revenue of C$94.6 million.
The company expects adjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments on cannabis net revenue to be within a range of 46% to 50% and non-production costs in the low C$40 million range. 
Aurora reported a 4.5% quarter-on-quarter decline in fourth quarter net revenue to C$72.11 million.

Pelosi said she talked with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday and plans to discuss the stimulus with him again on Monday. She held out hopes that they still can find a way to bridge the roughly $1 trillion gap between them on a plan to bolster the economy.
“We can get this done,” Pelosi said Monday on MSNBC, while emphasizing that more money is needed to combat the pandemic, safely open schools and businesses and help Americans hurt by recession.
“When he’s ready to come back to the table we’re ready to have that conversation,” Pelosi said. “But he has to come back with much more money to get the job done.”
The sides have been at an impasse since August, and time is running out for a deal before the Nov. 3 election. Pelosi has been insisting that the White House agree to at least $2.2 trillion in new aid, including funds for cash-strapped state and local governments and $600 per week in supplemental unemployment benefits. But the Democratic demands have since grown to $2.4 trillion.
New ‘Proffer’
Trump has indicated he could support as much as $1.5 trillion in aid, higher than the $650 billion put forth in a “skinny” aid package by Senate Republicans.
On Sunday, Pelosi said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that she and House Democrats would be making a new “proffer” in the negotiations soon, and that details would be outlined in a draft bill they will be ready to vote on even if there is no deal.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. tech giant Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google has boosted its market power in the three years since EU antitrust enforcers ordered it to stop favouring its own price comparison shopping service, a study of 25 of its rivals showed on Monday.
Hit with a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.8 billion) fine three years ago by the European Commission for the offence, Google subsequently offered to allow competitors to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page to channel traffic to their sites.
Rivals however have said the proposal was ineffective and since then have urged EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager to sanction Google for not complying with her ruling.
The latest study by consultancy Lademann & Associates covered Axel Springer's  price-comparison shopping service Idealo, British company Kelkoo, France's LeGuide and others in 21 European countries.
""It (Google's proposal) has further strengthened Google's position on the national markets for comparison shopping services and has entrenched its dominance in general search,"" said Thomas Hoppner, author of the study and adviser to several Google foes.
""This is not because the Commission imposed the wrong remedy. It is because Google's chosen compliance mechanism fails to comply with the remedy imposed,"" he said.
Hoppner called the Commission to either force Google to come up with a more effective solution or warn the company for breaching its order.
The Commission said it was monitoring the market to assess the effectiveness of Google's proposal.
Google said the figures in the study ignore the facts and the Commission's reasoning in its decision. 
""The remedy has worked successfully for three years, generating billions of clicks for more than 600 comparison shopping services, and is subject to intensive monitoring,"" a spokeswoman said.

Investing.com -- United Airlines has reached a deal with pilots to avoid furloughs set to begin next month.
Shares were already trading higher and accelerated up 7.4%.The airline approved a pilot plan to avoid the furlough of 2,850 pilots starting Oct. 1, which is when $25 billion in federal aid expires.
United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) is still planning to cut more than 13,000 jobs next month, and  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) 19,000, according to CNBC.
United CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) has said he doesn’t expect demand to return to more than half of 2019 levels without a vaccine.
“While we still face a difficult path to recovery, your support of this creative and unique agreement puts us in an unparalleled position of strength when demand recovers,” a United executive wrote in a note to staff Monday. “This agreement greatly enhances our ability to bounce back – so we can welcome more passengers and return to the 2019 levels of seat and fleet advancement more quickly.”
Airline executives have gone to Washington to plea for more funding, but no package has been approved yet.
On Friday, American Airlines announced it had secured a $5.5 billion loan agreement from the U.S. government.
Under the terms of the U.S. Treasury facility, American may have an option to increase the loan in October by an additional $2 billion to an aggregate $7.5 billion.

FRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) - Shares in  Siemens  Energy  opened lower than expected on their first day of trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange, as Germany's biggest-ever spin-off gears up for a challenging future independent from parent Siemens (DE:SIEGn).
Shares in Siemens Energy - which makes gas turbines, power transmission systems and holds a 67% stake in Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN) - opened at 22.01 euros apiece on Monday, giving the company a market value of 16 billion euros ($18.6 billion).
A source had previously said estimates were for a market valuation of between 21-22 billion euros.
Shares eventually closed at 21.21 euros, down 3.6% from the first price, after trading in a range of 19.21-22.98 euros during the session. This puts Siemens Energy's market capitalisation at 15.4 billion euros.
""I have repeatedly pointed out that we expect volatility to be high in the first few weeks,"" Siemens Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told Reuters. ""It's not a situation specific to Siemens Energy, it's the same with every spin-off.""
Siemens Energy is Germany's largest spin-off ever, even surpassing  Lanxess  (DE:LXSG) and Covestro (DE:1COV), which were both spun off from Bayer (DE:BAYGn).
For Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) investors the deal has paid off: They have received one Siemens Energy share for every two shares they own in the former parent. Yet Siemens shares traded only 1.7% below Friday's closing price, a tiny discount given a substantial part of the conglomerate has been spun out in a separate listing.
Thomas said it would take until at least mid-October to get a first idea of how Siemens Energy, which competes with  General Electric  (N:GE) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011), will be valued.
Spun off from Siemens due to weak profit margins, the unit is expecting an adjusted margin of not more than 1% in 2020 on earnings before interest, tax and amortisation before special items, due to the coronavirus crisis and weaknesses in its onshore wind turbine business.
That should rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% in 2023, helped by more than 1.3 billion euros of cost cuts that a source said will include the shutdown of some of the group's production plants.
Siemens Energy expects sales to fall by as much as 1.4 billion euros to 27.4 billion euros this year, before growing again in a range of 2-12% in 2021.
""We are now doing everything in our power to seize the opportunities offered by the global energy transformation,"" Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch said.
Siemens AG has initially spun off 55% of Siemens Energy to shareholders but plans to reduce its remaining direct stake of 35.1% significantly within 12-18 months of the listing. The Siemens pension fund owns 9.9% in Siemens Energy.
Siemens CFO Thomas said the firm wanted to preserve a right to influence key decisions at Siemens Energy at least over the next five years, adding a stake of anywhere between 20% and 28% could achieve this.

""SPCE’s mission is to 'become the Spaceline for Earth,' expanding the opportunity to travel above the Earth’s atmosphere – an accomplishment achieved by fewer than 600 people throughout history.""
The market is untested, but the analyst sees Virgin Galactic's offering tapping into significant latent demand for space tourism. Positive earnings or free cash flow won't show up until 2023 and 2024, respectively, which serves as a fundamental risk.
""We do buy into the vision that SPCE’s future business opportunities can spread considerably wider than what is seen at the moment – ranging from public leisure and professional space travel to government contracting and future high-speed commercial travel,"" Minervino said.

KONOLFINGEN, Switzerland (Reuters) - Demand for plant-based foods has picked up during the coronavirus crisis as consumers try to eat more healthily and problems at some factories have hit meat supplies, the head of Swiss food giant Nestle (VX:NESN) said on Monday.
The world's biggest packaged food company is investing heavily in plant-based products as it looks to step up innovation and meet the challenge of trendy local food brands. 
In the coming days, it is launching a plant-based Nesquik milk drink and a new version of its vegan burger.
""The interest in plant-based alternatives has been on the rise for a number of reasons,"" Chief Executive Mark Schneider told Reuters, citing problems in the North American meat supply chain. 
In the spring, about 20 meat factories were closed in the United States after thousands of coronavirus cases.
""People also have a renewed interest in personal health and losing weight as COVID particularly affects those with pre-existing health conditions,"" Schneider said, following the inauguration of an R&D Accelerator at Nestle's dairy research facility in Konolfingen near Bern. 
The Accelerator will connect students and start-ups with Nestle scientists looking into new dairy products and plant-based alternatives. 
Nestle's sales of plant-based food jumped 40% in the first half of 2020, after reaching 200 million Swiss francs ($215 million) last year. That was still a fraction of its total 2019 sales of 92.6 billion francs.
Schneider said he expected prices for plant-based meat alternatives to fall over time, but added they reflected the higher cost of ingredients such as pea or soy protein.
""We want to lead in many of the segments and we’ll go as far as the market will take us,"" he said, noting Nestle was working on plant-based alternatives in other categories, including chocolate and ice cream. 
Chief Technology Officer Stefan Palzer said using plant-based ingredients across Nestle's vast product range, which spans KitKat chocolate bars, Gerber baby food and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, would offer economies of scale. 
Major players in plant-based food include Beyond Meat (O:BYND) and Impossible Foods in the United States.

Robust demand in the off-trade channel and the gradual reopening of the on-trade channel in most markets have shown robust demand, Chief Executive Officer Ivan Menezes said in a statement.
""Our U.S. business is performing strongly and ahead of our expectations, reflecting resilient consumer demand and the spirits category continuing to gain share within the total beverage alcohol market,"" Menezes said.

European off-trade demand is robust and the on-trade channel has largely re-opened with the easing of lockdown measures, although the risk of additional restrictions remains. In China, the on-trade channel continues to recover, although larger banqueting occasions are returning more slowly. While the on-trade has also begun to re-open in Africa, India and Latin America and the Caribbean, we expect the pace of recovery in those markets to be more gradual.

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) unveiled a new cloud platform on Monday aimed at enabling telecom operators to build 5G networks faster, reduce costs and sell customised services to business clients.
After banning China's Huawei from its telecom network, the U.S. government has been pushing big American companies such as Microsoft to get more involved with 5G - a technology which promises to enable everything from self-driving cars to remote surgery and more automated manufacturing.
The new platform will be on Azure, Microsoft's flagship cloud computing business, and the company says it will reduce infrastructure costs, give flexibility to add services on demand and use artificial intelligence to automate operations.
Yousef Khalidi, corporate vice president for Azure Networking, told Reuters that it could cut costs by 30%-40% in some cases.
The developer of Windows and Office software entered the 5G arena after its acquisition of cloud networking companies Affirmed Networks and Metaswitch earlier this year.
""The telco DNA was obtained through those acquisitions and we went from a small number of engineers in this space to literally hundreds of engineers,"" said Khalidi. ""On the other hand, the foundational pieces, including edge compute, we have had in a pipeline for many years.""
The company has already partnered with companies ranging from telecom operators such as Verizon (N:VZ) and AT&T (N:T) to network equipment firms such as Samsung (KS:005930) and Mavenir to either use or sell the new platform to clients.

Microsoft's move will increase competition for existing 5G service vendors like Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Ericsson (ST:ERICb), said CCS Insight analyst Nicholas McQuire.

""Why not?"", Piero Di Lorenzo told Italian newspaper Il Riformista, answering a question on whether the stock exchange could be in the company's future. 
""Many big companies would like to enter our capital. We are receiving interest from all over the world and I don't rule out any option,"" he said, adding however that such a decision was not currently a priority, given the focus on the vaccine. 
Italy could have its first shots of the vaccine by the end of November, IRBM said earlier this month.
The group has already produced tens of thousands of vaccine doses for the trial stage and has the potential to produce up to 10 million doses a year.
However, it does not have a production contract with AstraZeneca yet ""but it is likely to, in the future"", Di Lorenzo said. 
Earlier this month AstraZeneca resumed global trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine, which had been briefly put on pause due to a serious unexplained side effect in a participant in Britain.
It is still waiting for the U.S. drug regulator to approve the restart of the clinical trial in the United States.

(Reuters) - U.S. businesses with COVID-19 outbreaks are facing an emerging legal threat from claims that workers brought coronavirus home and infected relatives, which one risk analysis firm said could cost employers billions of dollars.
The daughter of Esperanza Ugalde of Illinois filed in August what lawyers believe is the first wrongful death ""take home"" lawsuit, alleging her mother died of COVID-19 that her father contracted at Aurora Packing Co's meat processing plant.
    The cases borrow elements from ""take home"" asbestos litigation and avoid caps on liability for workplace injuries, exposing business to costly pain and suffering damages, even though the plaintiff never set foot on their premises.
""Businesses should be very concerned about these cases,"" said labor and employment attorney Tom Gies of Crowell & Moring, which defends employers. 
The lawsuit against Aurora alleges that Ricardo Ugalde worked ""shoulder to shoulder"" on the company's processing line in April when Aurora knew it had a coronavirus outbreak at its facility and failed to warn employees or adopt any infection prevention measures.
Aurora did not respond to a request for comment.
    Between 7% and 9% of the roughly 200,000 U.S. COVID-19 deaths so far are believed to stem from take-home infections and the lawsuits could cost businesses up to $21 billion if the number of Americans fatalities reaches 300,000, according to Praedicat, a firm that evaluates risks for insurers. 
Rob Reville, Praedicat's chief executive, cautions that is a worst-case scenario and said the cases might cost far less, depending on how judges view the lawsuits.
    The U.S. workers compensation system generally makes it difficult for workers to sue for COVID-19. The system caps liability for businesses and bars costly lawsuits in return for quick payments to employees, who do not need to prove fault.
But Esperanza Ugalde was not an employee of Aurora, so her family can sue the company. Depending on the circumstances, a successful wrongful death case can top $1 million in damages.
Take-home cases have been around for decades in asbestos litigation and courts have split on whether a business has an obligation to members of the public who have never been on their premises.
In 2013, a California jury awarded Rose-Marie Griggs $27.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages after she contracted mesothelioma that her lawyers argued was caused by asbestos fibers carried home in the 1950s on the work clothes of her then-husband, who installed insulation for an affiliate of Owens-Illinios Inc.
The company appealed and two sides reached a private settlement before the appeal was heard.
CONTESTING THE 'CAUSAL CHAIN'
Attorneys for both plaintiffs and companies said successful cases require a strong ""causal chain"" linking the sick family member to the worker and then to the business and the business's alleged failure to adopt safety measures. 
    Miriam Alvarez Reynoso sued Byrne & Schaefer Inc, a manufacturer of electrical components in Lockport, Illinois, alleging negligence by the company led to her contracting COVID-19 and suffering ""serious injuries to multiple organs.""
Reynoso's lawsuit says she became infected while caring for her husband Servando Reynoso, a parts assembler at the company, who came home sick from work on April 8. It lists 18 categories of alleged shortcomings by Byrne & Schaefer, including failing to clean work areas and ignoring employees who said they had COVID-19 symptoms.
    Company owner Tim Byrne said his five employees wore masks routinely before the pandemic to protect against dust and regularly used gloves.
    ""He was sick before anyone else,"" said Byrne. ""It's difficult to prove after the fact.""
Lawyers said employers would likely be reluctant to settle the cases for significant sums until claims were vetted in the court system.
    Peter Wozniak, an attorney with Barnes & Thornburg who represents employers, said the cases will test juror attitudes toward the behavior of plaintiffs, who need to show they protected themselves from other sources of infection.
    ""Are you always wearing a mask? Are you staying six feet away? Are you washing your hands,"" he said. ""It will be interesting and unpredictable with regards to people's attitudes for individual responsibility."" 

    The best protection for business owners will be adopting and documenting measures to protect workers.
    ""If they had acted reasonably and if Aurora put these things in place prior to the death of Esperanza I don't know if I would have taken the case,"" said Bridget Duignan, who represents Ugalde's daughter. 
""But they did nothing.""

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Consumer goods group  Reckitt Benckiser  Group (L:RB) is preparing to sell some of its non-core personal care brands, including Veet hair removal cream and Clearasil acne cream, four sources familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
The package of brands up for sale - which also includes E45 skin cream and Scholl foot products - could be worth as much as 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in a sale, two of the sources said, based on estimates of annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation north of 120 million pounds.
The process comes as Reckitt is generating unusually strong sales in its hygiene business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as people snap up its Lysol and Dettol disinfectants. It is also a strategic step for its new chief executive, Laxman Narasimhan, who has been in the top job for one year. 
Veet hair removal creams may also be seeing a boost, another source said, as people curb salon visits and do more grooming at home. 
Reckitt is working with advisers and has already sent out information on the assets, two of the sources said. 
Reckitt declined to comment. 
The brands are likely to appeal to private equity players, the sources said, since they are cash-generative. 
They do not fit into the two main businesses Reckitt has been focusing on - health and hygiene. 
 Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNA),  Beiersdorf  (DE:BEIG) and Henkel (DE:HNKG_p) all sell personal care products and also therefore could be potential suitors, the sources said. Beiersdorf and Henkel, both based in Germany, are interested in parts of the package, two of the sources said. 
Henkel declined to comment. Beiersdorf and Unilever were not immediately available.
UK-based Reckitt, which started out as a home cleaning company, for years worked to build out its health-related business, which includes Enfamil formula, Durex condoms and Nurofen tablets. 
A strategy by previous management to separate the health and hygiene units into two stand-alone, in-house businesses, which led to speculation of a corporate break-up, was later scrapped.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets started the new week where they left off with the old one, rallying hard on the perception that the September sell-off has gone too far, too fast - albeit with little in the way of fundamental news to support much movement one way or the other over the weekend.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 338 points, or 1.2%, at 27.512 points. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite were both up 1.3%.
On a quiet day for economic data, attention is sliding more and more to the looming presidential election, which is now less than six weeks way. .The two candidates, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, hold their first debate on Tuesday, Biden having gained a nice attack line over the weekend with the New York Times's disclosure of Trump's tax returns. While the disclosure said little of substance that wasn't already widely known or assumed to be true, it underlined Trump's chronic lack of business success in any activity other than his career as a TV reality show host.  
Andreas Steno Larsen, a strategist with Nordea, noted that the traditional underperformance of equities ahead of the election is to be expected again this year.
""As the uncertainties are even larger than usually this time, the case for equity underperformance ahead of the vote is strong, while a clear result in early November would open the door higher for equities again, Larsen wrote in a note to clients.
The market was supported at the margins by some merger and acquisition activity that fed a narrative that corporates will continue to adapt to the changing circumstances and take advantage of the opportunities created by the market sell-off this year.
 Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) stock rose 3.4% and WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX) stock rose 4.7% after Devon announced an all-share offer for its rival, a move that will enable the two to operate more efficiently without Devon having to spend precious cash. 
In the same vein, bank stocks all rose on hopes that the Federal Reserve will not extend its current restrictions on stock buybacks at a meeting later Monday.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock rose 2.8%. while JPMorgan  (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 1.5% and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) rose 1.9%.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock, which had fallen nearly 20% over the last month, rose 3.1%.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>","As Brexit talks intensify, banks see sharply higher risk of no-deal exit","By Elizabeth Howcroft
LONDON (Reuters) - The chances of Britain leaving the European Union without a trade deal have risen dramatically in the last three months, according to major investment banks, most of which now see the probability of such an outcome at 50% or higher.
Britain left the EU in January but is currently in a status-quo transition period, which ends on December 31 irrespective of whether or not a deal is agreed. On Monday, the two sides started a decisive week of talks, with one diplomat noting an improvement in ""mood music"".
But all six banks which participated in a Reuters poll in June are more pessimistic, with most citing UK legislation that would breach parts of the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU in January.
The move has drawn threats of legal action from the EU. 
The most dramatic re-assessment was by Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), which said the bill ""gravely damaged"" trust. The probability of no-deal now stands at 80%, according to the bank, which had assigned a 17% chance in June.
Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), meanwhile, puts the probability of no-deal at slightly below 50%, versus 10% in June, a scenario which strategist Thu Lan Nguyen warns could hit the pound hard, possibly resulting in depreciation of ""something around 10%"". 
The currency has fallen around 5% this month but with three months still to go before the transition period expires, options markets are pricing in more volatility ahead.
ING now believes the risk of no deal is 50%, up from 40% three months ago. Only a small proportion of this risk premium is priced by sterling, according to economist James Smith, who sees the currency possibly heading towards parity versus the euro.

In a more detailed forecast, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) stuck with a one-in-two chance of an agreement by the end of the year but also saw a 20% chance of the transition period being extended and a 30% chance of exiting without a deal.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), not included in the Reuters poll, expects the worst-case outcome to wipe at least three percentage points off UK gross domestic product in 2021.
It puts the risk of no-deal at one-in-three but told clients that ""with brinkmanship part of the process it may appear higher than that before agreement is reached"".

FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Cerberus and a rival investment firm have told HSBC (L:HSBA) they would buy its French retail arm for a symbolic one euro provided the British bank ploughs more than 500 million euros ($582.70 million) into the business, sources told Reuters.
HSBC is working with Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) to sell its 270 retail branches in France as part of Chief Executive Noel Quinn's strategy to slash costs across the banking group.
The bank has been struggling to attract interest in the unit as bidders fret at the heavy restructuring assumed to be necessary and complex talks with local regulators.
Cerberus and the other investor are the only bidders left in the process while French banks, which initially studied the dossier, have all walked away, three sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They did not name the other investor.
Cerberus and HSBC declined to comment. 
HSBC has previously said the business is under a strategic review.
Both bidders want the business to be fully recapitalised with HSBC injecting at least 500 million euros before they can buy it for a symbolic amount of one euro, the sources said. 
""The price is going to be disastrous for HSBC,"" of the sources said.
While the British lender is still working to reach an agreement by the end of the year, the process could still fall through due to regulatory demands and the prospect of heavy job cuts, another source said.
The sale process is culminating just as European bank share prices come under fresh pressure due to concerns about the economic impact of a second wave of COVID-19, with the STOXX 600 bank index (SX7P) hitting a record low on Friday. 
HSBC France said in its first half results that its private banking and wealth management business posted a 225 million adjusted loss before tax.
Failure to complete the sale would be a significant hit to HSBC's restructuring, as the bank attempts to complete the latest of a series of asset disposals in recent years aimed at improving returns for long-suffering shareholders by shedding underperforming businesses.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co. (N:JPM), the country's largest lender, is stepping up payment fraud protections for its small and mid-sized business customers, which continue to be targeted by scammers - particularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Four-in-five small and mid-sized companies say they were targets of payment fraud last year, but that could be reduced if businesses use more tools to detect suspicious payments early, JPMorgan executives told Reuters. 
The bank's new self-service ""fraud hub,"" being introduced on Monday, will allow them to set alerts for unusually large payments and control who gets paid. The service supplements the current system in which customers call the bank to set controls.
""Fraud is a major concern and can be devastating for businesses,"" said Jennifer Roberts, chief executive of Chase Business Banking. ""We want to provide them with safeguards that are easy to set up and customize for their transactions.""
The measures come amid a broader industry campaign to get businesses to be more vigilant against a major source of payment fraud: legitimate-looking emails, often impersonating the chief executive, with bogus instructions for paying suppliers or other third parties.
These email scams cost companies $1.7 billion last year, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and have been on the rise as fraudsters attempt to exploit uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
While big companies are frequent targets of scammers, smaller companies tend to be more vulnerable because they have less sophisticated internal controls.
To help small businesses spot vulnerabilities, the bank is offering to add a ""safety meter"" to customer account dashboards which graphically shows how they score on setting safeguards, including suspicious transaction alerts.
Since the advent of paper checks, banks have encouraged customers to take steps to thwart fraud. That remains important because about 40% of business-to-business payments are still made by check, according to the Association for Financial Professionals.

But the move toward fast digital payments has increased the need for much stronger controls, said Jennifer Barker, a wholesale payments executive at JPMorgan. For JPMorgan, less fraud should make for happier customers and save the bank the cost and hassle of having to recover funds.

LONDON (Reuters) - Uber (NYSE:UBER) has won a legal bid to restore its London operating licence which was taken away over safety concerns, after a judge ruled on Monday that the company was a fit and proper operator despite ""historical failings"".
Transport for London (TfL) refused to grant the Silicon Valley-based company a new licence in 2019 due to what it called a ""pattern of failures"", including thousands of trips conducted where drivers other than those advertised picked up passengers.
Uber argued it has since assuaged concerns by improving insurance document verification systems and rolling out real-time identification. 
The U.S. company was also denied a licence by TfL in 2017, in a major blow in one of its most important markets, before it was restored on a probationary basis. 
""I am satisfied that they are doing what a reasonable business in their sector could be expected to do, perhaps even more,"" Judge Tan Ikram said on Monday.
""Despite their historical failings, I find them, now, to be a fit and proper person to hold a London... operator’s licence,"" he said, granting an 18-month right to take rides. 
Uber, which has apologised for mistakes it has made, has run into backlashes and regulatory challenges elsewhere, including in its home state of California.
Shares in Uber rose 6% in pre-market U.S. trading after the decision.
""This decision is a recognition of Uber’s commitment to safety and we will continue to work constructively with TfL,"" Jamie Heywood, Uber's boss for Northern and Eastern Europe, said. 
In London, it faces a number of rivals, including Ola, Freenow and Bolt. 
The city's traditional black cab drivers have blocked streets in protest at what they see as a threat to their livelihoods. 
London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who also chairs TfL, warned Uber on Monday to stick to its obligations. 

""I can assure Londoners that TfL will continue to closely monitor Uber and will not hesitate to take swift action should they fail to meet the strict standards required to protect passengers,"" he said in a statement.

The cash offer of $7.00 per share for Nasdaq-listed Perceptron (O:PRCP) represents a 71% premium to its closing price on Monday, and comes after Atlas bought German machine vision group Isra Vision (DE:ISRG) earlier this year in a $1.19 billion deal.

The proposed cash deal, approved by Perceptron's board, and supported by its biggest shareholder, is expected to close in the fourth quarter subject to majority approval by Perceptron's shareholders and regulatory approvals.
Atlas Copco's acquisition of Isra earlier this year has been seen by several analysts as a first building block to expand further in machine vision.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Three of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s top contract manufacturers plan to invest a total of almost $900 million in India in the next five years to tap into a new production-linked incentive plan, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron all plan to make investments under the scheme, said the sources, who asked not to be named as the discussions are private. 
India's new $6.65 billion production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme offers companies cash incentives on any increase in sales of locally-made smartphones over the next five years, compared with 2019-20 levels. The scheme aims to help transform India into an export manufacturing hub.
Foxconn has applied to invest about 40 billion rupees ($542 million), while Wistron and Pegatron have committed to invest close to 13 billion rupees and 12 billion rupees, respectively, under the PLI plan, the sources said. 
It is unclear whether all of the investment will be targeted at boosting manufacturing of Apple devices in India, but the sources and industry insiders said the vast majority would be focused on expanding iPhone manufacturing in the country.
Foxconn said that as a matter of policy it did not comment on specific operations or work for any customer. Apple, Wistron, Pegatron and India's technology ministry, which formulated the PLI scheme, did not respond to emails seeking comment.
While Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron make devices for companies other than Apple globally, Wistron's arm in India currently assembles only iPhones.
Wistron, which assembles roughly 200,000 second-generation iPhone SEs per month in India, plans to scale that up to 400,000 a month by the end of the year, one of the sources said, as it looks to cater to export demand for the device.
That plan is expected to create roughly 10,000 jobs, the source added.
Pegatron is yet to start Indian operations, but has been in talks with several states, with Tamil Nadu in the south emerging as a frontrunner for a planned plant to manufacture Apple devices, a third source said.
Foxconn, which also assembles devices for Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) in India, already has enough capacity to meet Xiaomi's needs and is likely to use the PLI plan largely to boost iPhone production, a fourth source said.
The commitments would help Apple diversify its supply chain beyond China, which is locked in a trade war with the United States. 
Apple started assembling in 2017 a low-cost iPhone model in India through Wistron's local unit in the tech hub of Bengaluru. It later ramped up production, with Foxconn beginning to assemble iPhones last year and Wistron widening operations. 
""India is key to Apple's global ambitions as it expands beyond China,"" said Tarun Pathak, an associate director at tech researcher Counterpoint. ""It offers a strategic market to them where skilled labour is cheaper as compared to other manufacturing destinations, the size of the internal market is huge and the export potential is enormous.""
Local manufacturing helps Apple save costly duties levied on imports of fully-built phones and components in India, where the Cupertino, California-headquartered tech giant accounts for just 1% of smartphone shipments.
Apple is looking to change that. It launched its online store in India last week, and is building its first company-run retail store in the financial hub of Mumbai.

Remington in July filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years as it faced financial troubles partly because some retailers placed restrictions on gun sales after school shootings in the United States.

LONDON (Reuters) - Five investors have been removed from the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, in the first such move by the group for those failing to meet its minimum requirements.
The PRI has amassed more than 3,000 signatories managing in excess of $100 trillion in assets since it was launched in 2006 and membership is increasingly seen as crucial for asset managers pitching for mandates from pension schemes.
But the PRI, whose members were told in 2018 they had two years to reach a new set of minimum requirements, said on Monday four asset managers and one asset owner would be delisted. 
BPE, the private banking arm of France's La Banque Postale, is the largest, with assets the PRI put at around $5 billion.
Stichting Gemeenschappelijk Beleggingsfonds FNV (GFB) which is part of the biggest Dutch labour union, Indonesia's Corfina Capital, U.S.-based Primary Wave IP Investment Management and French-based Delta Alternative Management, which reported assets of between $40 million to $310 million, were also removed, the PRI said.
BPE said in a statement that, for legal reasons, it had not been able to comply with one of the six fundamental principles of the PRI, regarding discretionary management, but was ""currently working on resolving this legal constraint in order to once again adhere to (the) PRI."" 
A spokeswoman for GFB was ""very disappointed"" by the PRI's decision.
The GFB holds a small part of the overall capital of the FNV union and the costs of meeting the new requirements exceeded the benefits, the spokeswoman said, adding that the majority of FNV's capital is managed separately and will still be listed.
A spokesman for Delta Alternative Management declined to comment. The two other firms did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.
The delistings follow criticism in recent years that the PRI was not doing enough to ensure members lived up to the principles, including to embed environmental, social and governance-related issues in their investment decision-making.
""We had signatories who just weren't doing enough, and were very much there for the marketing,"" PRI Chief Executive Fiona Reynolds told Reuters. ""They were sort of riding on the brand and riding on what other signatories were doing.""
This first round of exclusions may not satisfy all its critics given it affects mainly small firms, while some much larger signatories are being challenged for perceived inaction when engaging with companies on climate change. 
'WAKE UP CALL' 
The new standards require members to have a responsible investment policy covering at least half of all managed assets, staff responsible for implementing it and senior-level oversight. 
The PRI did not say which standard the delisted firms failed.
At the start of the process, 165 PRI members were warned they did not meet the new criteria, although most improved over the course of the two years.
""I think this was a bit of a wake-up call to some people ... 'I can't just sit here now; they're actually upping the game and they're taking this more seriously and I'd better get my act together',"" Reynolds said.
Of those firms originally warned, 23 chose to delist themselves for a variety of reasons, while four disputed the evidence that they had failed to meet the new requirements and successfully appealed, the PRI said, without naming them. 
The PRI said it now plans to toughen membership requirements further and will launch a consultation at a meeting on Oct. 21.

Proposed changes include requiring firms' responsible investment policies to cover 90% of assets and making that policy public. Engagement and voting would also be made mandatory for those managing equities.

The government plans to decrease an incentive to buy electric cars from 7,000 euros ($8,160) this year, to 6,000 euros next year and 5,000 euros in 2022, according to a budget plan unveiled Monday by Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. The state handout for hybrid rechargeable vehicles will be halved to 1,000 euros next year.
A separate incentive for low-income households switching to electric vehicles will be pegged at 3,000 euros, lower than the cash-for-clunkers subsidy that was offered for a couple of months earlier this year.
“We have backed the auto industry while at the same time accelerated the lowering of carbon emissions,” Le Maire said.
Electric vehicles made up 6.1% of the French market during the first eight months of the year, according to data from the industry group CCAF industry group, up from 1.9% in 2019. Rechargeable hybrids are also capturing a growing market share.
Government incentives in some European countries including France and Germany helped boost car sales earlier this year after lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus sent purchases into a tailspin. The French state’s policies on subsidies particularly affect  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and PSA Group (PA:PEUP), which rely on the domestic market."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Friday, bouncing back after the recent selloff with a series of M&A deals suggesting increasing corporate confidence despite rising coronavirus cases and political uncertainty. 
At 7:10 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 41 points, or 1.3%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 336 points, or 1.2%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 175 points, or 1.6%. 
The major U.S. cash indexes weakened last week, their fourth week of losses in a row. This selloff has largely been duplicated overseas, and companies are now seeing bargains to be snapped up.
Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF), the largest U.S. producer of iron ore pellets, has agreed to buy the U.S. assets of the world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) for about $1.4 billion in cash and shares.
Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment is in advanced discussions to buy the U.K. bookmaker  William Hill  (LON:WMH), while the Wall Street Journal reported that battered energy companies WPX (NYSE:WPX) and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) are in talks to merge.
However, despite this apparent corporate confidence there still remains a great deal of uncertainty over the political and economic landscape, as well as a rising number of coronavirus cases.
President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden square off on Tuesday in their first election debate, five weeks ahead of polling day, against the backdrop of a New York Times’ investigation into the president’s taxes.
The prospect of further U.S. stimulus remains a key focus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday said another coronavirus stimulus plan is possible with House Democrats planning an aid package of about $2.4 trillion. However, this is more than Republicans have indicated they are prepared to accept and a deal is unlikely.
Meanwhile, the United States recorded 58,461 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday, the highest one-day increase since Aug. 7, while New York City posted its first 1,000-case day since June.
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday. The key release this week will be Friday’s official employment report, which will be the final U.S. jobs report before the presidential election.
In corporate news, aside from the M&A news, the saga surrounding TikTok continued as a U.S. judge late on Sunday temporarily blocked a Trump administration order that was set to ban the video-sharing app from download on app stores at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Oil prices weakened Monday, with the major oil benchmarks on course to end the month lower, as rising coronavirus cases threaten hopes of a recovery in demand across the world. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $40.36 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $42.45. Brent is on track for its first monthly loss in six while WTI is headed for its first monthly drop since April.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,862.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1662.

Joe Biden in the White House and his party controling the Senate and House has been cited by some strategists as a potential downer for markets because it could lead to higher corporate tax rates. But to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, the chance of greater deficit spending under that scenario is “massively pro-growth” and outweighs other concerns for equities.
“The most positive outcome for risk markets is a Democratic sweep given the potential for significantly higher fiscal stimulus, and consequently, higher economic growth,” said Credit Suisse equity-derivatives strategist Mandy Xu. “Conversely, the most negative outcome is a Biden White House with a split Congress, in which case we see little prospect of further fiscal aid and increased probability of a stalled recovery/prolonged downturn.”
A Democratic sweep could lead to yields rising, cyclical stocks outperforming and a more pronounced rotation away from growth into value if there’s a bigger fiscal package, Credit Suisse said. On yields, that matches the view of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists led by Praveen Korapaty, who said on Sept. 25 that yields could jump in such a scenario.
That’s led Xu to recommend a bearish put-option spread on the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) ETF expiring in January, as well as wagers on small stocks beating larger ones, plus a rotation away from technology shares.
For the scenario where Biden wins but there’s a split Congress, she sees a broad macro sell-off with a bid for havens, and recommends buying a put spread on the S&P 500 while selling a call option."

Investing.com -- Nothing creates transparency like a conglomerate spinning units off, which makes the debut of  Siemens  Energy on Frankfurt’s stock exchange on Monday an interesting study in the outlook for the energy market.
Shares in the newly listed unit slumped in early trading, to give the company an implied valuation of some 15 billion euros, more than a quarter below what Siemens and its bankers had been hoping for.
Given that the company has a two-thirds stake in Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN), a builder of wind turbines, that had an implicit value of 10 billion euros, it’s clear that the market isn’t attaching too many hopes to the rest of its activities, most of which remain challenged by longer-term shifts away from fossil fuel-powered generation.
The creation of Siemens Energy was a chance for outgoing Siemens (DE:SIEGn) chief executive Joe Kaeser to unlock more value for shareholders by freeing the conglomerate of the dead weight that is its thermal power engineering business.
This outlook for this division has gone from mouth-watering to disastrous in the space of 12 years, as first the Great Recession, then the rise of renewables, severely dented global demand for expensive German gas and coal turbines.  According to a presentation for the capital markets prepared by the company earlier this year, earnings – which had taken another hit as President Donald Trump’s trade wars stunted demand – had stabilized before the pandemic, but the most recent financials show that any hope of a turnaround is still largely just that: a hope.
Free cash flow for the nine months through June fell to 133 million euros, from a full-year total of 651 million over the whole of fiscal 2019. Before interest, taxes and amortization, the business made a loss of over 1 billion euros. It hasn’t helped that Gamesa during this period has been hit by a costly restructuring in India (a familiar example of Siemens’ hopes outrunning reality).
The company is promising big further reductions in costs and working capital over the next few years, but it acknowledges that past rationalizations haven’t been enough to make costs fall faster than revenues. Moreover, the new company has a gap of over 1 billion in pension liabilities that it will have to fund somehow (and the current discount rate of 1.8% for its liabilities looks high, given that the yield on 10-year German debt is below -0.5%).
It’s to Kaeser’s credit that, up until to the end of his tenure at Siemens, he has streamlined the parent company to be a much more focused and forward-looking company. Even so, the burdens of the past cannot be shaken off so easily: the company still has nearly half of the company and is only planning to sell down to 25%. That explains why Siemens has come out of the last decade in better shape than  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), its long-standing rival. Even so, this is an incomplete unlocking of value: the conglomerate discount will continue to dog Siemens stock for the foreseeable future, while the presence of the fossil fuel division is likely to weigh on Siemens Energy for just as long."

(Reuters) - Caesars (O:CZR) is in advanced takeover talks with  William Hill  (L:WMH) that value the British bookmaker at 2.9 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) and would give the casino operator full control of a quickly expanding U.S. sports-betting and online business.
Caesars was considering offering 272 pence per share and William Hill's board was inclined to recommend such an offer to shareholders, the companies said on Monday. 
William Hill shares on Friday surged to more than 312 pence each after it said it had received separate offers from Caesars and buyout group Apollo (N:APO).
Those gains were handed back on Monday, however, leaving the stock at 273 pence, suggesting that even if Apollo counters, investors now expect the price to be far lower.
Caesars only holds 20% of its U.S. joint venture with William Hill but the business is built on a presence in Caesars casinos and its brand name, which the casino owner said it would have the right to terminate in the event of an Apollo buyout.
The bid significantly undervalues the company but there seems limited scope for bid competition due to the joint venture terms and also since William Hill's board said it would be minded to recommend the offer, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said.
Apollo did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment outside usual business hours.
Stifel analyst Bridie Barrett said the brokerage's valuation range for William Hill is 270 pence to around 400 pence. 
""While a termination of the relationship with William Hill under new ownership makes little business sense, it does add risk for a private equity acquisition...a price at the upper end of our range is unlikely,"" Barrett said.
William Hill's shares were already trading close to two-year highs before news of the proposals, having fallen to their lowest in 20 years in March.
It has offset regulatory pressure at home by expanding in the U.S. and partnering with CBS Sports and ESPN to cash in on the relaxation of sports betting rules there.
To fund the deal, Caesars said it was raising equity and would take out $2 billion of new debt secured against William Hill's non-U.S. businesses.
Caesars said the enlarged sports and online gaming business in the U.S. could generate between $600-$700 million in net revenue in FY2021.
The offer comes soon after Eldorado Resorts (NASDAQ:ERI) completed buying bigger rival Caesars for about $8.5 billion, creating a new competitor for larger sector players like  Las Vegas Sands  (N:LVS) and Wynn Resorts (O:WYNN).

738,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",Poland expects EU to approve more public aid for coal mines,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland expects the European Commission to approve a plan to gradually close mines owned by its biggest coal producer PGG and provide more public aid for the industry, although experts voiced doubts. 
The spread of COVID-19 among miners has added to problems facing the country's mining industry as demand for coal falls and costs rise. 
Ending weeks of negotiations on the restructuring of troubled PGG, Poland's government struck a deal with the company's trade unions on Friday to gradually close its coal mines by 2049.
The agreement is pending European Commission approval and Poland will ask the EU executive to allow public aid, ""especially for financing ongoing production, to guarantee the stability of coal companies' operations.""
""I would be surprised if the European Commission, considering the social approval for phasing out mining, said no,"" Deputy Assets Minister Artur Sobon tolf private radio TOK FM on Monday. 
European Commission representatives did not immediately responded to an e-mailed request for comment.
Analysts and environmentalists have criticised the deal saying it is detached from the EU's climate neutrality goal and contradicts Poland's latest proposal to accelerate the phasing out of coal so that its share in power production falls to 11%-28% in 2040 from more than 70% now.
They said the European Commission is unlikely to approve more public aid for Polish coal mines having previously agreed to some help. 
""There will be no such approval. Granting public aid for the operating of coal mines is prohibited according to the EU regulations,"" said Joanna Flisowska, head of climate and energy at Greenpeace Poland.
Polish daily Rzeczpospolita said that initially PGG would be receiving around 1 billion zlotys a year from the state budget, which would be repaid when it starts to generate a profit. PGG, which employs around 40,000 people, spends 300 million zlotys ($76.74 million) on salaries per month. 
Following the agreement with the trade unions, shares in Polish utilities including PGE (WA:PGE), Enea (WA:ENAE) and Tauron (WA:TPE) jumped on Friday and continued to rise on Monday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Nikkei 225 share average, Japan's best-known stock benchmark, on Monday still stood 40% below its historic peak hit three decades ago, while its lesser-known sibling, the Nikkei 500, surged past its previous peak to a record high.
The Nikkei 500 (N500) has gained 7.7% so far this year, compared with a 0.6% fall in the Nikkei 225 (N225). In dollar terms, the 500 has risen more than 11%, handily beating 2.1% gains in the U.S. S&P 500 (SPX). 
""The Nikkei 500 is showing one of the greatest performances among the world's major stock indexes. Its chart shows that if you invest carefully in Japanese stocks, you can actually outperform the S&P 500,"" said Richard Kaye, portfolio manager at French asset management firm Comgest.
(Graphic: Nikkei 500-hidden star performer - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqnoqdvx/200928N.png)
Japanese equities in general lag behind their Wall Street peers, with many foreign investors staying away from the market because of a perception of lacklustre performance. 
But the Nikkei 500 looks much different, and trails only the likes of tech indexes, such as the Nasdaq (IXIC). 
The 500-company index includes many firms that are popular with investors and have solid earnings growth - such as game company Nintendo (T:7974), motor maker Nidec (T:6594), electronic parts maker Murata (T:6981), factory automation product company  Keyence  (T:6861) and furniture store chain operator Nitori (T:9843). 
Comgest's Kaye says the index is ""biased towards good companies"" and tends to include companies that are innovative, have high return-on-equity (ROE) and a high percentage of overseas sales. 
Some fund managers say it may be a superior benchmark compared with the better-known Nikkei average.
""It might be the best index that reflects the Japanese market,"" said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. 
Compared to the Nikkei 225, which still includes a lot of old economy firms, the 500 index better reflects changes in Japan's industrial structure and the economy's shift to the service industry. 
The strong performance of the Nikkei 500 shows the market is now driven by companies that can grow profits without a weaker yen, rather than by exporters such as carmakers, Sakuma said.
""Looking ahead, I think the Nikkei 500's outperformance will continue because its advantage could grow even bigger if regulation reforms and digitalisation progresses under Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.""

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled in July that the data arrangement set up in 2016, called Privacy Shield, was invalid under Europe's privacy framework because of concerns about U.S. surveillance.
The ruling effectively ends the privileged access that U.S. companies such as Facebook had to personal data from Europe. It puts the country on a similar footing to other nations outside the EU, meaning data transfers are likely to face closer scrutiny.
The survey, conducted by Schrems' digital rights group NOYB - short for None of Your Business - covered 33 companies. Most were American, but some were based in the EU and Britain.
Exercising the right of customers to ask companies how their data is handled under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the survey drew a mixed bag of responses - some firms did not respond and others gave misleading answers. 
""The responses ranged from detailed explanations, to admissions that these companies have no clue what is happening, to shockingly aggressive denials of the law,” said Schrems.
NOYB said that rental platform AirBnB, streaming service Netflix and Facebook chat app WhatsApp didn't reply, while other companies referred to privacy policies that did not address the questions asked.
Business collaboration platform Slack said it would not ""voluntarily"" pass on user data to the U.S. authorities, failing to address concerns that Washington has the legal power to conduct targeted surveillance of non-U.S. citizens overseas.
“Overall, we were astonished by how many companies were unable to provide little more than a boilerplate answer,"" said Schrems.

""The companies that did provide answers largely are simply not complying with the CJEU judgment. It seems that most of the industry still does not have a plan as to how to move forward.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nov. 3 presidential election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden could have dramatic effects across markets, and investors are already trying to identify potential winners and losers.
Broadly speaking, analysts say Biden’s plan to raise corporate taxes could pressure company earnings. But they expect him to support infrastructure projects and renewable energy. 
A second Trump term, meanwhile, may bring more tax cuts and extend de-regulation that could benefit the energy and financial sectors, while risking continued tensions with China. 
With the Senate majority also at stake, the election could allow one party to control the presidency and Congress, making it easier to enact legislation such as the additional fiscal stimulus currently being held up in a political standoff. 
Here is a look at stocks that might fit best in a Biden or Trump portfolio:
BIDEN BASKET
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: A stronger expected ""green energy"" push under a Biden administration could support alternative energy stocks. For example, tax credit extensions would provide a boost for solar stocks such as Sunnova Energy International (NYSE:NOVA), SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) Corp and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
ELECTRIC VEHICLES: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares already have had a mammoth run during the Trump administration, but some believe a Biden presidency could further fuel the electric vehicle company's shares.
""Biden has proposed new tax incentives, government purchases, and other measures to benefit EVs in particular,"" CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said in a report. 
Other potential winners from a Biden victory would be auto suppliers focused on electrification and green, emission-free technologies, such as Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) and  Visteon  (NASDAQ:VC), Nelson wrote.
INFRASTRUCTURE: A large infrastructure spending package ""may be an early priority for a Biden administration as it seeks a bipartisan win,"" according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA).
Biden's plan would boost a broad group of engineering and construction companies, with AECOM, Jacobs Engineering Group (NYSE:J) and MasTec (NYSE:MTZ) among the biggest beneficiaries, according to Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz.
TARIFF TRADE: A Biden administration could see a calming of the U.S.-China tariff war. ""Should trade policy be less-focused on the use of tariffs, both importers and exporters may benefit,"" according to David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP).
JP Morgan in a July report listed Procter & Gamble, Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) and 3M among a number of stocks that could outperform should a Biden presidency lead to a ""de-escalation"" in U.S.-China tariff tensions.
TRUMP TRADE
TAX RELIEF: A Biden loss could spell additional relief for companies that benefited from the president's corporate tax cuts.
In its July report, JP Morgan listed AT&T,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Waste Management (NYSE:WM) among companies that benefited from Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could underperform in a Biden presidency.
BANKS: Along with higher corporate taxes, banks could face concerns over more regulations under a Biden administration, particularly if a progressive such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes a high-profile role. 
Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods say a Trump win with Republicans retaining the Senate is the best election scenario for banks, noting ""the Republican agenda of reduced regulation remains intact."" Stocks to own in that scenario include  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), KBW wrote.
DEFENSE: Trump would probably ""succeed in maintaining large defense spending, despite a Democratic House, given the reality of great power struggle with China and Russia,"" BCA Research strategists said in a recent report. 

FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES: ""Support for energy companies and specifically fossil fuels appears to be an ongoing objective for Trump,"" according to LPL's Detrick. He added that most companies in this sector, excluding those in renewable energy, will likely benefit from a Trump victory.

The deal, announced by the two companies on Monday, will make Cleveland-Cliffs the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America and, for ArcelorMittal, give it up to a quarter share of Cleveland-Cliffs' business and allow it to reward shareholders with a share buy-back. 
ArcelorMittal shares were up 8.3% in early trading, although had still not made up for losses last week, when markets tumbled over concerns that rising coronavirus cases would hinder the economic recovery.
Reuters reported on Sunday, citing sources, that ArcelorMittal was in talks to merge its U.S. operations with Cleveland-Cliffs, which bought U.S. steel producer AK Steel for $3 billion in March.
ArcelorMittal will receive $505 million upfront in cash and the remaining roughly two-thirds in the form of equity.
The equity arrangement will give ArcelorMittal an initial stake of 16% in Cleveland-Cliffs, which could rise to 25.5%.
The deal will include $2 billion of liabilities, including linked to pensions, putting the overall deal value at $3.4 billion. 
ArcelorMittal said it had now passed its target of offloading $2 billion of assets to reduce its debt, allowing it to carry out a $500 million share buy-back. 
It has previously agreed to sell stakes in its shipping business and in Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau.
ArcelorMittal said it would continue to serve the North American market through operations in Canada and Mexico, which together made 9 million tonnes of steel last year, and its steel processing facility in Calvert, Alabama, a joint venture with Nippon Steel (T:5401).

ArcelorMittal's U.S. business has more than 18,000 employees and 25 facilities, including mines, steel-making facilities and finishing operations. They produced 12.9 million tonnes of steel in 2019.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian markets were powered on Monday by signs China's economic recovery was gaining momentum with pent-up demand, fiscal stimulus and surprisingly resilient exports boosting sentiment across the region.
The brighter mood was seen extending to Europe, with eurostoxx 50 futures and Germany's DAX futures jumping 1.7% each at the open, while London's FTSE futures climbed 1.3%. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.7% to 551.48, but stayed within striking distance of a two-month low of 543.66 hit last week. 
The index is set to end the month deep in the red after three straight monthly gains as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak economic havoc around the world and raises investor anxiety about sky-high valuations. 
Traders also remain cautious ahead of a U.S. Presidential debate on Tuesday and on fears a spike in new coronavirus cases in Europe could dent the global economic recovery.
On the day, Chinese shares opened higher and helped to underpin Asian markets after a tentative start. The blue-chip CSI 300 index was last up 0.3%, paring some of the early gains. 
Sentiment in Asia was supported by weekend data that showed profits at China's industrial firms grew for the fourth straight month in August buoyed in part by a rebound in commodities prices and equipment manufacturing.
Economic indicators in August, ranging from exports to producer prices and factory output, have all pointed to a further pickup in the industrial sector thanks to a slew of measures to kick-start the world's second-biggest economy. That has in turn has lent support to the global recovery, though the spike in worldwide COVID-19 cases has raised fresh risks.
Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei was 1.3% higher, partly on a lower yen, while South Korea's KOSPI index gained 1.35%. 
Australia's main share index reversed early losses to finish flat.
The broad gains in Asia follow a Wall Street rally on Friday though analysts expect the gains to be short-lived as expectations for economic growth start to falter.
Particularly worrying is a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Europe, dousing earlier hopes that authorities might have started to exert some control on the outbreak and raising further strains on businesses already grappling with losses.
""Clouds have started to gather over the developed world as political uncertainty increases in the U.S. and Europe grapples with a resurgence in COVID-19 cases,"" Kerry Craig, Global Market Strategist, J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
COVID-19 cases are edging closer to 33 million around the globe with 992,470 reportedly dead with Europe seeing a surge in new infections.
""While governments are loathe to re-introduce nationwide lockdowns, localised and sector based restrictions may last for some time, restraining economic activity,"" Craig added.
Investor focus will next be on the first debate between U.S. President Donald Trump and rival Joe Biden on Tuesday ahead of the November election.
A strong performance in Tuesday's debate by Biden, who currently has a modest lead in betting odds and polls, might boost stocks related to global trade and renewable energy, while a perceived victory by Trump could benefit fossil fuel and defense companies.
Market focus will also be on progress on a new fiscal support package in the United States while investors will be closely watching UK-Europe post-Brexit trade talks as they continue this week.
In currencies, the dollar slipped from a near a two-week high against the Japanese yen to 105.32.
The euro was last at $1.1629, not far from a two-month trough of $.1611 touched on Friday. 
The British pound rose 0.3% to $1.2774. 
The risk sensitive Australian dollar was slightly firmer at $0.7052 after falling for six consecutive sessions as odds narrowed over the prospect of further monetary policy easing in the country.
In commodities, oil prices came under pressure as renewed mobility curbs in various countries to contain a resurgence of coronavirus cases cloud the outlook on fuel demand recovery.
U.S. Brent crude slipped 37 cents to $41.55 a barrel while U.S. light crude was down 39 cents at $39.86. 

Gold was a shade weaker at $1,858.2, drifting away from an all-time peak of above $2,000 an ounce touched in August.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank's robotics arm said on Monday it will bring a food service robot developed by California-based Bear Robotics to Japan as restaurants grapple with labour shortages and a new socially distanced norm as a result of the novel coronavirus.
The robot named Servi will act as a sort of waiter, using its layers of trays to carry food and drinks and its 3D cameras and Lidar sensors to navigate between kitchen and tables.
Servi will be launched in Japan in January and will cost 99,800 yen ($950) per month excluding tax on a three-year plan, SoftBank Group Corp said. 
The start up first showed a prototype to Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) chief executive Masayoshi Son last year and SoftBank led a $32 million round of investment in the startup in January. 
The launch leverages SoftBank's long experience in bringing overseas technology to Japan but reflects the shift away from Son's earlier focus on humanoid robots.
Servi has been tested by Japanese restaurant operators, including Seven & i Holdings at its Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN) chain, as the sector grapples with an aging workforce and deepening labour shortages.
The launch comes as companies are scrambling to employ technology to offer contactless service and ensure social distancing. 
SoftBank's humanoid Pepper robot became the face of the company following its 2014 unveiling but failed to find a global customer base. 
The firm in 2018 announced cleaning robot Whiz, which employs technology from group portfolio company Brain Corp and has sold more than 10,000 units worldwide. 
SoftBank is touting the use of Whiz as a coronavirus countermeasure, and said on Monday that Pepper can be used in conjunction with thermal sensors to monitor customers.
Son has shifted from operating businesses to making investments in recent years. This month, SoftBank announced the sale of cellphone distributor Brightstar as it cuts links to the telecoms industry. 
The group also owns Boston Dynamics, which developed the four-legged robot Spot.
SoftBank has a history of troubled investments in the robotics sector.

746,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 04:09AM ET</span>",HSBC Posts Biggest Intraday Jump Since 2009 After Selloff,"(Bloomberg) --  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) rose the most since 2009, recovering from a 25-year low, as its biggest shareholder raised its stake in a bet the embattled lender will return to paying dividends.
China’s Ping An Insurance Group Co., which last week bought 10.8 million shares to boost its stake to 8%, remains confident in HSBC’s long-term prospects, a spokesperson said. The recent slump in the share and the valuation only increases HSBC’s appeal, the spokesperson said.
“Ping An believes HSBC’s suspension of dividend payments is a short-term issue and has been actively communicating with the lender about the possibility of restoring dividends in the future,” the spokesperson said.
HSBC shares in Hong Kong on Monday rose as much as 9.9%, the biggest intraday gain since April 2009. They were up 10.6% to HK$31.20 as of 3:19 p.m. in Hong Kong, clawing back last week’s tumble. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng index rose 0.9%.
In London, HSBC rose as much as 11.5% at the start of trading -- also the most since April 2009. The U.K.-listed shares were up 9.8% as of 8:15 a.m. local time, although they’re still down by almost half this year.
The bank last week plunged to a 25-year low in part on speculation its massive push into China could be thwarted. The ruling Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper reported that the bank could be put on an “unreliable entity” list that aims to punish firms, organizations or individuals that damage national security. HSBC has rankled China over its participation in the U.S. investigation of Huawei Technologies Co.
At the behest of U.K. regulators, the bank suspended its dividend payments earlier this year, alienating its Hong Kong retail investor base. The lender’s shares have trailed the Hang Seng Index in five out of the past six years once dividends are excluded.
HSBC has pledged to review the payout once the impact of the pandemic becomes clearer.
Ivan Li, director of investment research at Convoy Global Holdings Ltd., said the surge is an indication that “that investors are less worried about its inclusion on China’s unreliable entity list as they believe China wouldn’t risk doing so before the U.S. elections.”
Shenzhen-based Ping An, which has owned a major stake in HSBC since late 2017, has seen the value of those shares tumble by more than $8 billion over the past three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. According to filings to the Hong Kong exchange, it last increased its holdings in late 2018, when it bought more than 5 million shares at an average price of HK$65.12.
“Ping An boosting its stake is also a vote of confidence in HSBC’s long-term fundamentals,” Li said. “However, it’s hard to say whether HSBC’s share price has bottomed out since banks globally are still hurt by low interest rates and narrowing margins.”
HSBC was among global banks named in a report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists on lenders that “kept profiting from powerful and dangerous players” in the past two decades even after the U.S. imposed penalties on the institutions.
Facing difficulties in navigating low interest rates and surging loan losses sparked by the global pandemic, the bank’s profit halved in the first half. HSBC Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn last month warned bad loans could swell to $13 billion this year. Quinn said the bank would attempt to hasten a shakeup of its global operations, accelerating a further pivot into Asia as its European operations lose money.
In response to the ICIJ report last week, the bank said that “starting in 2012, HSBC embarked on a multi-year journey to overhaul its ability to combat financial crime across more than 60 jurisdictions. HSBC is a much safer institution than it was in 2012.”
“The overall environment is still challenging as interest rates are low and there’s no visibility when HSBC will be able to distribute dividends again, as well as the tensions between China and the U.S,” Steven Leung, an executive director of Uob Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd., said by phone.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou will be back in a Canadian courtroom on Monday as her lawyers resume their fight to block the United States' efforts to extradite her.
Meng, 48, was arrested in December 2018 on a warrant from the United States charging her with bank fraud for misleading HSBC (L:HSBA) about Huawei's business dealings in Iran and causing the bank to break U.S. sanction law. 
Huawei lawyers will argue that the U.S. extradition request was flawed because it omitted key evidence showing Meng did not lie to HSBC about Huawei's business in Iran.
Meng, the daughter of billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition from her house arrest in Vancouver.
The arrest has strained China's relations with both the United States and Canada. Soon after Meng's detention, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, charging them with espionage.
Meng will appear in British Columbia's Supreme Court on Monday for five days of Vukelich hearings - in which the judge will ultimately decide whether to allow the defence to admit additional pieces of evidence in their favour.
In this case, Huawei lawyers will use a PowerPoint presentation to show HSBC knew the extent of Huawei's business dealings in Iran, which they say the United States did not accurately portray in its extradition request to Canada.
In previously submitted documents, Meng's lawyers claim the case that the United States submitted to Canada is ""so replete with intentional and reckless error"" that it violates her rights.
The argument is part of Meng's legal strategy to prove that Canadian and American authorities committed abuses of process while arresting her.
Lawyers representing the Canadian attorney general are arguing for her extradition to the United States.
Vukelich hearings are rare in extradition cases, said Gary Botting, an extradition lawyer based in Vancouver, but given the complexity of Meng's case it is not surprising.
The defence's success ""depends entirely on the nature of the evidence… and whether or not there is any substance to their allegations,"" Botting added.

Meng's extradition trial is currently set to wrap up in April 2021, although if either side appeals the case, it could drag on for years through the Canadian justice system.

Data over the weekend showed an increase in profits at China’s industrial companies for the fourth consecutive month in August, suggesting that the economic recovery in the second-largest economy in the world was well entrenched.
Adding to the optimism was news of more M&A deals within the region.
ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) stock rose 5.7% after Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF), the largest U.S. producer of iron ore pellets, agreed to buy its U.S. assets for about $1.4 billion.
 William Hill  (LON:WMH) stock fell 12% to 272 pence, after soaring over 40% on Friday when it confirmed it had received proposals from U.S.-based private equity firm Apollo and casino giant Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment. Caesars said Monday that it may offer 272 pence per share, valuing the company at £2.9 billion. 
HSBC (LON:HSBA) climbed 10% after China’s Ping An Insurance increased its stake to 8% from 7.95%, seeing a bargain after the bank’s stock last week fell to the lowest since 1995.
Elsewhere,  Diageo  (LON:DGE) rose 5.5% after the world's largest liquor maker said performance has improved across the board, driven in large part by its U.S. business. Siemens Energy, meanwhile, got off to a sluggish start as the German engineering giant spun off its turbine business, which combines both renewables and its struggling thermal power division.
Broader market gains could quickly come under pressure again as expectations for economic growth in Europe and further afield falter on the back of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.
“It is visible from card data and other high frequency measures that the case count is important for consumption, no matter whether it is rational or not,” Nordea analysts wrote in a research note. “We have another 4-6 challenging weeks ahead of us in Europe since the virus spread could further accelerate when gatherings tend to move indoors during the autumn.”
Investors will also be keeping a wary eye on the latest Brexit talks, with the final round of scheduled discussions between the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his British counterpart, David Frost, beginning in Brussels on Tuesday.
Oil prices weakened Monday, with the major oil benchmarks on course to end the month lower, for the first time in many months, as rising coronavirus cases threaten hopes of a recovery in demand.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>",Sterling traders not panicked yet by new Brexit brinkmanship,"By Tommy Wilkes and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain may be heading for a no-deal Brexit in three months, but among traders in London the feeling so far is one of deja vu rather than a panicky rush to dump UK assets.
After Britain threatened to ditch parts of its European Union divorce deal this month, markets are pricing in a 40%-45% chance of exiting the EU trading bloc without any alternative arrangements at the end of 2020. Some banks see it higher.
Yet as the four-year political crisis between London and Brussels enters what may be its final stretch, investors and companies are not stampeding as heavily to sell sterling or hedge against volatility as they did when no-deal Brexit risks intensified in the past. 
""Brexit fatigue is definitely there. Coronavirus has overwhelmed Brexit. Participation levels are still relatively light and it's generally opportunistic,"" said Ian Tew, a sterling trader at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in London.
Cash sterling weekly turnover rose 35% in the third week of September from late August, Refinitiv data shows -- but is below most weeks in September and October in 2019 and 2018, when worries about a no-deal Brexit intensified before deadlines to reach earlier agreements with the EU.
True, sterling has fallen 5.8% this month from $1.3481  on Sept. 1 to $1.27, reversing August's gains. But analysts say that move has been exaggerated by a general bout of risk aversion favouring the dollar rather than just Brexit fears.
The pound is well above last September's low of $1.1959.
Against the euro, sterling's drop has been more measured, with the euro rising 2.8% to 91.50 pence (EURGBP=D3) this month.
Derivatives are pricing in more choppiness ahead, with implied volatility jumping to the highest level since the coronavirus panic of March and April  . But it remains 15%-25% below late 2018 and 2019 highs. 
That rise must be seen also in the context of higher market-wide volatility in 2020 <.DBCVIX>.

LESS GROUP THINK
Richard Benson, head of portfolio investments at currency asset manager Millennium Global Investments, is short sterling and thinks trading activity is being dampened by more investors and traders working from home.
""There's slightly less group think. Less of the group endorsement of 'Oh, we are all doing this, this is the trade',"" he said, adding that at a recent virtual industry roundtable the numbers of people short sterling were balanced by those long.
Another explanation, traders say, is that COVID-19 is overshadowing Brexit in the minds of investors and company executives.
For instance, exporters who would usually adjust currency hedges after a pound slump have seen those strategies upended by collapsing revenues. Coronavirus uncertainty could even force a change to the Dec. 31 deadline.
""The market has become very jaded with the political process,"" said Simon Manwaring, head of currencies trading at NatWest Markets, and ""is looking for something more definitive"" before clients hedge or take speculative positions.
Aaron Hurd, senior currency portfolio manager at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, believes the two sides will reach a Brexit deal and wants to buy more pounds. But he is holding off as everyone tries to discern ""how much of the political noise and the headline noise is posturing...And how much of it is real disagreement behind the scenes.""
NERVES GROW
Still, while activity levels suggest there is not the panic of previous years, nerves are beginning to jangle. 
Demand for put options - the right to sell sterling - has increased significantly, with three-month risk reversals  at similar levels to late 2018 when London and Brussels struggled to clinch their withdrawal agreement.
That suggests investors are increasingly worried about further drops in the British currency.
For traders wanting protection from a falling pound, a price move probability of 11% is now priced into option contracts with a November and December expiry, up from 9.4% in early September, according to CME data.
The question is whether such nervousness translates into more aggressive selling.

""Brexit was front and centre of everything in the past. Now it's not,"" said Barclays' Tew, although it remained a ""differentiating factor"" that would keep the pound vulnerable.

 Alibaba  Group's (N:BABA) fintech arm Ant Group aims to raise about $35 billion in a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai's STAR Market, expected in October, in what could become the world's largest IPO.
Two of the five new funds launched on Friday to give Chinese retail investors access to strategic stakes in Ant's IPO had already reached their fundraising target and stopped accepting new investments, their fund managers said.
The five funds are targeting a combined 60 billion yuan ($8.80 billion), with each fund aiming to raise up to 12 billion yuan over a two-week subscription period.
The early interest shows appetite for Chinese tech shares remains strong despite recent stock market corrections. It also comes at a time when the U.S. administration is cracking down on Chinese tech firms on national security grounds.
E Fund Management Co said its fund reached its target on the day of the launch, while Penghua Fund Management Co said on Sunday investor subscription exceeded its target on Saturday.
The other three funds, to be managed by China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC), China Universal Asset Management and Zhong Ou Asset Management Co, are widely expected to be sold out this week.
Retail investors could buy into the five funds directly or through Ant's online payment platform Alipay. The funds will then use up to 10% of the money to buy Ant shares. 
As of lunch time on Monday, an advertisement on Alipay promoting the new funds attracted attention from over six million retail investors, according to Alipay data.
But some were reluctant to become strategic investors in Ant due to the 18-month commitment it entails.

""It's ok to subscribe to new shares of Ant, but we dare not hold the stock for 18 months given the uncertainties brought by a second wave of coronavirus infections globally,"" said Zhang Chengyu, vice general manager of Beijing-based Shiji Hongfan Asset Management Co.

752,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 01:51AM ET</span>",U.S. judge blocks Trump administration's ban on new TikTok downloads,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration order that was set to bar Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google from offering Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok for download at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday.
U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued the preliminary injunction in a brief order late on Sunday. He declined ""at this time"" to block restrictions set to take effect on Nov. 12 on technical and business arrangements which are crucial for the app to function properly.
Nichols' detailed written opinion is expected to be released as soon as Monday.
The Commerce Department said in a statement it ""will comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so.""
The statement, which defended the TikTok order and Trump's executive order demanding owner ByteDance divest its TikTok U.S. operations, did not specify whether the government would appeal.
The injunction comes at a time when negotiations are underway to hammer out terms of a preliminary deal for Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations. Trump has said he had given the deal his ""blessing."" 
But key terms of the deal - including who will have majority ownership - are in dispute. ByteDance has also said any deal will need to be approved by China and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal. 
TikTok said it was pleased with the injunction and added it would maintain its ""ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the president gave his preliminary approval to last week, into an agreement."" 
John E. Hall, a lawyer for TikTok, argued earlier on Sunday that the ban was ""unprecedented"" and ""irrational"".
""How does it make sense to impose this app store ban tonight when there are negotiations under way that might make it unnecessary?"" Hall asked during a 90-minute hearing. ""This is just punitive. This is just a blunt way to whack the company. ... There is simply no urgency here.""
Representatives for Chinese state media welcomed the ruling.
""I think it is in line with morality, justice and common sense,"" Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper said on Twitter on Monday.
Chinese state media have said they see no reason for China to approve the deal, describing it as based on ""bullying and extortion”.
Trump's administration contends that TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China's government. Any deal will also still need to be reviewed by the U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).
The Justice Department said a preliminary injunction would be ""interfering with a formal national security judgment of the president; altering the landscape with respect to ongoing CFIUS negotiations; and continuing to allow sensitive and valuable user information to flow to ByteDance with respect to all new users."" 
Another U.S. judge, in Pennsylvania, on Saturday rejected a bid by three TikTok content creators to block the ban, while a judge in California has blocked a similar order from taking effect that would ban Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY)' WeChat from U.S. app stores.

Investing.com – Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) saw its Hong Kong shares (HK:0981) slide to four-month lows after the U.S. slapped export restrictions on the Chinese chipmaker.
The shares fell 5.81% to HK$17.50 ($2.26) by 12:44 AM ET (4:44 AM GMT), after sliding as much as 7.9% earlier in the session. SMIC’s Shanghai shares (SS:688981) slumped 6.33% to CNY50.30 ($7.37), its lowest levels since debuting on the bourse in July.
The restrictions mean that U.S. firms will now need to apply for a license to export certain products to SMIC, according to a Sept. 25 letter from the U.S. Commerce Department. The letter also reportedly added that SMIC and its subsidiaries present “an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end use.”
The restrictions do not put SMIC on the ""entry list"", meaning that they are not as severe as those imposed on companies that have been placed on the list, such as compatriot Huawei Technologies Co. The restrictions were a compromise between the Commerce and Defence departments and Trump administration moderates, with more severe restrictions, such as those on Huawei, reportedly possible.
SMIC is now the latest Chinese tech company, alongside Huawei, ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd., to be caught in the crossfire between the U.S. and China.
“The restrictions, once implemented, will severely damage SMIC’s existing and future manufacturing capabilities, and customer trust,” Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li said in a note.
“Without steady supply and service from the U.S., the yield and quality of SMIC’s capacity will degrade, as early as in a few months for more advanced nodes,” the note added.
The company claims that it does not have a relationship with, not manufactures goods for, the Chinese military. SMIC has reportedly not received an official notice of the restrictions, but a formal statement with more details could be released later in the day. There will be a 30-day comment period before the restrictions come into effect. Semiconductor equipment companies and industry groups are expected to express opposition to the restrictions,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts, including Atif Malik, said in a note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mornings have been lacking in joy this month for investors seeking returns in U.S. stocks.
So far in September, regular-hours trading has featured consistent selling, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. On average, losses on the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) have been steepest between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. Eastern (1400-1500 GMT), and every hour thereafter during the session has registered declines.
Overall, the S&P 500 has registered losses for four straight weeks, its longest such streak in a year.
""Besides some ever so modest gains in the opening half-hour, the rest of the day consists of investors hitting bids and unloading stocks,"" Bespoke's strategists wrote in a note on Friday.
September's activity returned U.S. stocks closer to their long-term trend of outperforming in after-hours trading versus regular-session trading, in contrast with most of 2020, when they outperformed during the regular session.
Since the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (P:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500, launched in 1993, it has posted a 722% return in after-hours trading but an 8.5% loss in trading during the regular session, according to Bespoke.
However, geopolitical and macroeconomic developments have led to after-hours underperformance in several recent instances, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. One such period was in spring 2019, when U.S.-China trade tensions reached a peak. In February this year, after-hours returns fell as concerns about the coronavirus pandemic focused largely on Asia, where trading begins after U.S. trading ends.
""A lot of the market-moving stuff is happening after hours, and that's generally why you see the market rallying overnight,"" Murphy said. ""When there's an outside-U.S. shock … those are the few times we see overnight underperformance.""
After-hours underperformance may not last much longer, however, given recent activity.
""After dipping way in the hole earlier in the year,"" after-hours performance is ""getting closer and closer to taking the lead in 2020 as well,"" Bespoke's strategists wrote last week.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Monday morning on the back of positive Chinese data, but caution remained ahead of Tuesday’s U.S. presidential debate and the ever-increasing number of COVID-19 cases.
The current COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, and uncertainty over the latest fiscal stimulus measures in the U.S., could see global stocks’ first month of losses since March.
“Clouds have started to gather over the developed world as political uncertainty increases in the U.S. and Europe grapples with a resurgence in COVID-19 cases,” J.P. Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Kerry Craig told Reuters.
However, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday she thinks a deal can be reached over the package and that talks were continuing.
“We are having our conversations. And when I have a conversation with the administration, it is in good faith … I trust (Treasury) Secretary (Steve) Mnuchin to represent something that can reach a solution. And I believe we can come to an agreement,” she said.
In China, Sunday’s data showed an increase in profits at industrial companies for the fourth consecutive month in August, with Chinese industrial profit up 19.10% year-on-year.
“The data augurs well for the China growth story,” AxiCorp global markets strategist Stephen Innes told Bloomberg.
However, with the figure down from July’s growth of 19.60%, investors are looking to the release of the country’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs), as well as the Caixin manufacturing PMI, on Wednesday for more clues on the Chinese recovery from COVID-19.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.05% by 11:08 PM ET (3:08 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.19%, with both benchmarks reversing earlier gains.
Meanwhile, investors continue to monitor Oracle’s acquisition of TikTok’s U.S. operations after U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols temporarily blocked U.S. President Donald Trump’s ban on the app that was due to come into force on Sunday. But Nichols declined “at this time” to block additional Commerce Department restrictions, due to take effect on Nov. 12, that would make the app impossible to use in the U.S.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.37%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.71%. South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.37%, with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reporting 50 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, the lowest since Aug. 11.

SMIC's shares fell as much as 7.9% to HK$17.12 ($2.21), the lowest since May 29, and were last down 6.7%.
The company said it had not received any official notice of the restrictions and added it has no ties with the Chinese military.
Suppliers of certain equipment to SMIC will now have to apply for individual export licenses, according to a letter from the U.S. Commerce Department dated Friday and seen by Reuters.
Earlier this year SMIC raised $6.6 billion in a secondary listing on Shanghai's tech-centric STAR market.
The company said it intended to use the funds to build out additional capacity for producing advanced chipsets.
SMIC recently began manufacturing chips at the 14 nanometer process node, about two generations behind the technology used by rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd.
The restrictions, however, throw a wrench in SMIC's plans as it relies on equipment produced by companies hailing from the U.S. or U.S-allied nations.

Following news of the restrictions, an op-ed published on Sunday in the Global Times, a tabloid owned by state-backed media outlet People's Daily, called for China to embark on a ""long tech march"" to counter the U.S.' high-tech suppression against China.

The U.S. stopped short of placing SMIC on the so-called entity list, which means the restrictions are not yet as severe as those imposed on China’s Huawei Technologies Co. Still, the ruling against the chipmaker marks a further escalation in the tensions between the world’s two most powerful countries that have already ensnared other Chinese tech companies including ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.
“The restriction, once implemented, will severely damage SMIC’s existing and future manufacturing capabilities, and customer trust,” Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a note. “Without steady supply and service from the U.S., the yield and quality of SMIC’s capacity will degrade, as early as in a few months for more advanced nodes.”
SMIC has not received an official notice of the sanctions, has no relationship with the Chinese armed forces and does not manufacture goods for any military end-users or uses, the Shanghai-based company said in an emailed statement over the weekend. The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing didn’t immediate respond Monday to a request for comment on the latest U.S. export restrictions.
The SMIC ruling was a compromise between the Departments of Defense and Commerce and moderates in the Trump administration, according to one person familiar with the negotiations. The U.S. has reportedly said it was mulling a more severe blacklisting on SMIC -- akin to the ones imposed on Huawei -- that would affect exports from a broader set of companies.
“If SMIC is not included in the Entity List, this could merely be confirmation of the rule change announced on April 27 for ‘civilian end-users’ in U.S.-unfriendly countries,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Edison Lee wrote in a note. “Instead of a blanket ban, the U.S. will have sole discretion on what US companies can sell to SMIC.” The brokerage had previously estimated that as much as 50% of SMIC’s equipment is from the U.S.
A formal statement that includes details of the restriction may be released by the U.S. Commerce Department Monday,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said. There will be a comment period of 30 days before the ruling takes effect, with semiconductor equipment companies and industry groups expected to push back against the restrictions, analysts including Atif Malik wrote in a note.

LONDON (Reuters) - A judge is set to tell Uber (N:UBER) on Monday whether it has won back its London operating licence after it was removed over safety concerns, the latest stage of a long-running battle with the regulator in one of its most important markets. 
Transport for London (TfL) refused in 2019 to grant the Silicon Valley-based company a new licence due to what it called a ""pattern of failures"", including thousands of trips conducted where drivers other than those advertised picked up passengers.
The taxi app, which was also denied a licence by TfL in 2017 before a judge restored it on a probationary basis, appealed the decision and says it has improved insurance document verification systems and rolled out real-time identification.
Uber's 45,000 drivers in London are still able to operate until the appeals process is exhausted, which could go on for many more months depending on any further legal action after Monday's verdict.
Senior District Judge Tan Ikram is set to hand down his decision from 1000 BST (0900 GMT) at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
TfL did not take a formal position during hearings earlier this month on whether Uber should now obtain a licence.
Instead the regulator submitted evidence, questioned witnesses and asked the judge to bear in mind a number of factors, including whether the firm could be trusted going forward.
Uber, which apologised for mistakes it has made, has run into regulatory barriers and a backlash in other countries, forcing it to withdraw from some markets. 
In London, it faces a number of rivals, including Ola, Freenow and Bolt, and traditional black cab drivers have previously blocked streets in protest at what they see as a threat to their livelihoods.

Their trade body, the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association, urged the judge to block a new licence, saying in a legal submission that Uber is ""not fit and proper.""

(Reuters) - ArcelorMittal SA (LU:MT), the world's largest steelmaker, is exploring a deal to merge its U.S. operations with Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (N:CLF), the largest U.S. producer of iron ore pellets, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. 
The combination would signal a new push among steelmakers to consolidate and diversify their business, making it less vulnerable to swings in demand. It would come after Cleveland-Cliffs acquired AK Steel, a U.S. maker of flat-rolled carbon steels, including stainless steel, for $3 billion, including debt, last March.
The latest deal could result in the merger of U.S. assets of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal that are worth between $2 billion and $3 billion with Cleveland-Cliffs, one of the sources said. It would be transformative for Cleveland-Cliffs, which has a market value of $2.3 billion and had total long-term debt as of the end of June of $4.5 billion.
There is no certainty the negotiations will lead to a deal, the sources said. If, however, the talks prove successful, a deal could be announced in the coming days, one of the sources added.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. ArcelorMittal and Cleveland-Cliffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
ArcelorMittal's U.S. business has more than 18,000 employees and 25 facilities, including mines, steelmaking facilities and finishing operations, according to the company's website. Headquartered in Cleveland, Cleveland-Cliffs employs about 11,000 people across mining and steel manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada.
ArcelorMittal said last year it was aiming to offload $2 billion of assets by the middle of 2021 to reduce its debt. In December, it agreed to sell a 50% stake in its shipping business, and has also sold its stake in Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau. 

After it acquired AK Steel, which derived 66% of its revenue in 2019 from the automotive market, Cleveland-Cliffs experienced a drop in demand from its car manufacturing clients, which were forced to temporarily halt production earlier this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Richard Fleming and Ben Cairns of Alvarez & Marsal have been appointed as joint administrators, the firm said in an emailed statement, adding the administration process would address the ""high levels of debt in the businesses"".
NMC Healthcare's London-listed holding company NMC Health Plc is already being run by Alvarez & Marsal after going into administration in April following months of turmoil over its finances.
The turnaround specialist said on Sunday the appointment related directly to 36 operating businesses in the United Arab Emirates, but did not apply to businesses outside the country.
The appointment ""will also allow the group of entities to secure an additional $325 million financing facility whilst protecting the businesses from creditor action,"" Alvarez & Marsal said.
The administrators would lead the financial restructuring of those businesses while the existing NMC management team remained in operational control of the day-to-day running of medical and clinical activities, it said.
NMC Health is the largest private healthcare provider in the UAE, operating more than 200 facilities including hospitals, clinics and pharmacies.
Its implosion this year amid allegations of fraud and the disclosure of more than $4 billion in hidden debt has left some UAE and overseas lenders with heavy losses and prompted legal battles to try and recover money owed.

Zetsche, 67, a former head of the Mercedes-Benz brand, was due to take a seat as chairman of the board of directors at the Stuttgart-based company after a two-year cooling off period.
In a surprise move, he announced in an interview in Sunday newspaper the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung that he would renounce his position, breaking a decades-old practice among German companies of promoting board members to directors.
Now Manfred Bischoff, Daimler's current chairman needs to find a new successor candidate before he retires on March 31, 2021. 
""This enables Daimler to reorient itself under new management, a step which from our point of view is necessary,"" Michael Muders, a fund manager at Germany's Union Investment, told Reuters. 
Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment, said that given the unresolved questions about Daimler's involvement in a diesel emissions scandal, ""the new chairman or chairwoman should be free from conflicts of interest"".
Daimler agreed to pay $2.2 billion to resolve a U.S. government diesel emissions investigation and claims from 250,000 U.S. vehicle owners earlier this month.
Zetsche's recusal comes after some investors, including Harris Associates, which owns a 5% stake, spoke out against Zetsche's elevation to the supervisory board. Harris Associates was not immediately available for comment.
Joe Kaeser, the outgoing chief executive of German engineering giant  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), who is a member of the Daimler supervisory board, could emerge as a candidate for the chairman role, sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Siemens's ability to placate international shareholders, when its rival  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) drew criticism for its conglomerate structure and underperforming assets, and Kaeser's openness to Chinese investors, make him a suitable candidate.
Chinese investors Geely [GEELY.UL] and BAIC (HK:1958) control almost 20% in Daimler through direct stakes and share options. 
Siemens declined to comment. Daimler also declined to comment on succession. 
In his newspaper interview, Zetsche said that although Daimler's top investors would have backed him to succeed Bischoff, opposition from other shareholders was likely.
""The fact that after 40 years of work, I am not regarded by some as an asset, but as a burden, I do not need that,"" Zetsche is quoted as saying.
Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, who heads the Center for Automotive Research, lamented Zetsche's final exit from the carmaker.

""It's a shame,"" Dudenhoeffer said, saying Zetsche had led the reinvention of Mercedes-Benz, attracting more youthful buyers and turning it into the best selling luxury car brand. ""Where would Daimler be without Zetsche? Nowhere,"" Dudenhoeffer said.

767,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Trump-Biden debate could spark stock volatility,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Some U.S. stocks could face more volatility next week as President Donald Trump and rival Joe Biden face off in their first debate ahead of a November election that betting services currently view as almost a coin flip.
A strong performance in Tuesday's debate by Biden, who currently has a modest lead in betting odds and polls, might boost stocks related to global trade and renewable energy, while a perceived debate victory by Trump could benefit fossil fuel and defense companies.
The first of three scheduled debates comes at a fraught moment on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 tumbled around 10% from record highs in recent weeks before paring some of those losses on Friday, as investors worry about a prolonged recovery from the coronavirus and uncertainty related to the Nov. 3 presidential vote, including the possibility of a delay in announcing a winner. 
If one candidate emerges stronger on Tuesday, ""the debate could be an individual stock and sector play,"" said Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors.
""For example, I think life under Biden would be a lot simpler for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) than life under Trump,"" Ablin said, referring to Trump's trade conflict with China. 
Individual stocks and other assets have been susceptible to market moves as a result of debates, even as broader markets have generally shrugged them off. 
The Sept. 26, 2016 debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, for example, sparked a 2% surge in the Mexican peso, as well as moves in oil, gold and Treasuries, according to a University of Michigan and Dartmouth College study.
Many investors view Biden as more likely to raise taxes, and see a second term for Trump, who favors deregulation, as better for the overall stock market. At the same time, a Trump win could spark concerns over ramped up tensions between Washington and Beijing.
With expectations of a delayed vote count, the options market shows investors are bracing for volatility in November and December. Trump declined on Wednesday to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses, and said he expected the election battle to end up before the Supreme Court.
Adding to political uncertainty, betting websites are offering odds giving Biden a 53% chance of beating Trump, down from as much as 61% in early August, according to RealClearPolitics.
A Biden win could boost the S&P 500 by about 1% the following day, while a Trump re-election would push the index down about 4%, according to an analysis by Cornerstone Macro based on a statistical comparison of recent asset prices and election betting odds.
""A possible interpretation of this result is that markets have increasingly priced in a Biden win and view the alternative as posing some risks, possibly stemming from potential escalating trade tensions or similar factors,"" Cornerstone Marco wrote.
Gullane Capital Partners LLC, a hedge fund in Memphis, Tennessee, is focusing on each presidential candidate's likely effect on specific stocks it owns, rather than what each candidate might mean for Wall Street as a whole, said Managing Partner Trip Miller.
""Biden is good for some of our businesses, like solar, and Trump is better for some of our other businesses that benefit from lighter regulation,"" Miller said.
UBS in a report this week predicted that a second term for Trump would have little effect on healthcare. On the other hand, a Biden victory would lead to only modest changes, rather than a major overhaul of health insurance, even if Democrats took control of the Senate. 

""We believe that the rhetoric on changes to healthcare policy exceeds the reality of what can be accomplished,"" UBS analysts wrote.

768,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Focus shifts to Commerzbank's strategy after CEO named,"By Tom Sims and Patricia Uhlig
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The nomination of Manfred Knof as chief executive of Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) paves the way for an overhaul that could close hundreds of branches and shrink its foreign operations, though any major changes may still take months to formalise.
Germany's No. 2 lender, partially-owned by the state, has been in turmoil following the sudden resignation of its CEO and its chairman in early July. Remaining board members' hands were tied from moving forward even as the bank's outlook darkened.
That hurdle was removed after the bank's new chairman, appointed in August, unexpectedly convened the supervisory board with less than 24 hours notice on Saturday to inform it of his CEO candidate. Knof, a top manager at rival  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), won its endorsement.
The decision clearly puts the focus on the unprofitable lender's strategy discussions, bankers and big investors say. 
But formal decisions on any changes under discussion could take months because Knof joins Commerzbank only on Jan. 1, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Leadership will need to digitize and standardize processes to cut costs, said Andreas Thomae, a portfolio manager at Deka, a top-10 investor in Commerzbank. ""It sounds simple but the last management team failed,"" he said.
Thousands of the bank's nearly 48,000 jobs are on the line. The lender is considering slashing its network of 800 branches, following the recent closure of 200, people with knowledge of the matter have said. 
A further cull to the bank's already slimmed-down international operations is also on the agenda.
Knof, educated as a lawyer, spent the bulk of his career at insurance giant Allianz (DE:ALVG) before joining Deutsche in 2019, where he has been head of retail operations in Germany. Commerzbank chairman Hans-Joerg Vetter told employees he wanted someone who would ""question the status quo"".
At Commerzbank, Knof will have to balance the desires of the German government - which owns more than 15% of the bank - as an election approaches, with those of other disappointed investors. Its shares have tumbled almost 90% during the last decade.
Over the past two years, employees have also been on a wild ride, with on-again-off-again talks to merge with Deutsche and then later to sell a big Polish subsidiary. Knof has the ""human leadership skills for the tasks that lie ahead of the bank"", Vetter said.
While many of Europe's biggest banks have said they were bracing for a wave of mergers, executives and investors say Commerzbank must first get its own house in order before looking for tie-ups.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy is ready to revoke motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia's (ASPI) lucrative concession if its parent company  Atlantia  fails to agree a deal over ASPI's future by Wednesday, a government source familiar with the matter said on Sunday. 
Infrastructure group Atlantia, (MI:ATL) which is controlled by the Benetton family, has been embroiled in a legal dispute with Rome since the deadly collapse of a bridge in Genoa run by ASPI in 2018. 
The government has been threatening to strip ASPI of its concession. The dispute appeared to have been resolved on July 14 when Rome approved a plan that would see Atlantia cede control of Autostrade to state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP).
But the parties have failed to hammer out a deal that met conditions set by the government and win the support of minority investors in both Atlantia and Autostrade, accusing each other of unreasonable requests, sources familiar with the matter said.
""The government is ready to revoke the concession if Italy's state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and Atlantia do not reach an agreement on plans to spin-off the infrastructure group's toll-road assets by Wednesday"", the government source said.
Atlantia was not immediately available for comment.
After weeks of tense negotiations, Atlantia said on Thursday it would press ahead with the sale of its 88% stake in Autostrade through a competitive process or, as an alternative, demerger of the stake with a view to listing the company.
Atlantia says the dual-track process is open to both CDP and other Italian and international institutional investors and has set a Dec. 16 deadline for non-binding offers.
For its part, CDP accuses the group of closing any possibility of continuing the negotiations, according to a source close to the state lender.
The latest flashpoint for tensions is CDP's request for a legal indemnity, the so-called ""manleva"".
Atlantia is unwilling to offer any legal safeguard to CDP for possible direct or indirect damages or disruptions that might occur on the motorway network after CDP takes over control of Autostrade, something that the state lender says is unacceptable, according to the sources.
Sources close to the group said that CDP does not take into account the rights of minority shareholders in both Atlantia and Autostrade. 

Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) , China's Silk Road and France's EDF (PA:EDF) Invest bought stakes totalling 12% in Autostrade in 2017 and have the power to veto transactions on the motorway unit.

Several countries, including the United States, have stepped in to help airlines hammered by the coronavirus crisis that brought global travel to a near-halt earlier this year. 
The lifeline was provided to Qatar Airways after annual losses exceeded 50% of share capital and was later converted into new shares, said the airline's financial statement.
Qatar Airways, which has slashed jobs and delayed new aircraft deliveries due to the pandemic, flagged in March that it would seek state support but had not until now disclosed the funding.
The airline said the 2019-20 financial year had been one of the most difficult in its nearly three-decade history, with losses widening from a restated 4.5 billion riyal loss in the previous year.
The airline saw revenue increase 6.5% to 51.1 million riyal. Passengers carried rose 10% to 32.4 million. 
The true impact of the crisis on Qatar Airways is unclear as global lockdowns continued beyond its financial year-end.
Qatar Airways Group includes the airline, management of Qatar's international airport and other aviation assets.
Since mid-2017, the airline has been banned from the airspace of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates due to a regional political dispute that forces it to fly longer routes.
It is also banned from Egyptian and Bahraini airspace. 

Air Italy, in which Qatar Airways held a minority stake, went into liquidation in February.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. shale producer  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN) is in talks to acquire rival WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX) Inc in an all-stock transaction that would create a company worth around $6 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.
The deal talks show how consolidation in the oil and gas industry is picking up, as low energy prices drive some independent producers to seek scale through mergers. In July,  Noble Energy  Inc (NASDAQ:NBL) agreed to be acquired by  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) for $5 billion in stock.
The deal, which would value Tulsa, Oklahoma-based WPX at a small premium to its current share price, could be announced as soon as next week, according to one of the sources.
The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the private talks, cautioned that an agreement was not guaranteed.
Devon and WPX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Buffered by reduced demand for hydrocarbons amid coronavirus lockdown measures, which helped push U.S. crude prices briefly into negative territory for the first time earlier this year, U.S. oil and gas producers are seeking out combinations.
Such mergers allow companies to remove duplication and create economies of scale, while structuring them at a small premium or none to existing valuations to retain as much cash as possible.
Oklahoma City-based Devon was valued at $3.4 billion as of the end of Friday. WPX shares closed on Friday at $4.44, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.5 billion.
Both companies have substantial operations in the Delaware portion of the Permian basin, the heart of the U.S. shale revolution across parts of Texas and New Mexico.
Devon also holds acreage in the Eagle Ford play of south Texas, Oklahoma and Wyoming. Outside of the Permian, WPX has land in North Dakota.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Turnaround and restructuring firm AlixPartners is boosting its headcount in the Middle East as corporates seek to cut costs and restructure debt amid the double shock of low oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic.
The New York-headquartered firm has recently hired six people in Dubai from one of its competitors, Alvarez & Marsal, and is looking to hire eight to 10 more restructuring specialists next year, said Gabriel Chahine, a Dubai-based managing director.
""We are hiring. We took a decision to double down on our restructuring team,"" said Chahine, adding the firm now has around 40 people working in the region, where its main focus is the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
Low oil prices are straining the two largest economies in the oil-rich Gulf while sectors such as tourism and real estate, particularly important for Middle East business hub Dubai, are suffering because of the pandemic.
Chahine said he expected more business to come from firms in oil services, real estate and construction, commercial aerospace, healthcare and consumer retail.
In Dubai in particular, requests for financial advice from companies in the tourism and hospitality industry have increased.
""For hospitality in Dubai, requests are not so much on debt restructuring, but more on the cost side and cash management, to be ready to navigate the crisis, as companies are struggling for survival,"" he said.
The UAE central bank said last week the UAE economy would likely contract by 5.2% this year, revising a previous 3.6% contraction forecast, as virus containment measures hurt sectors such as trade and tourism.
Business conditions in the non-oil private sectors in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been subdued over the past few months, and firms continue to cut jobs amid slow economic activity. 
Cost take-outs are the focus of Saudi firms AlixPartners is engaging with, Chahine said. “Everyone is coming in, asking how can we trim costs, reset the business, resize companies.”

Suppliers of certain equipment to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation will now have to apply for individual export licenses, according to a letter from the Commerce Department dated Friday and seen by Reuters.
The latest move marks a shift in U.S. policy from earlier this year, when applicants seeking “military end user” licenses to sell to SMIC were told by the Commerce Department that the licenses weren't necessary, according to three people familiar with the matter. 
SMIC said it had not received any official notice of the restrictions and said it has no ties with the Chinese military.
""SMIC reiterates that it manufactures semiconductors and provides services solely for civilian and commercial end-users and end-uses,"" SMIC said. 
""The Company has no relationship with the Chinese military and does not manufacture for any military end-users or end-uses.""
SMIC is the latest leading Chinese technology company to face U.S. trade restrictions related to national security issues or U.S. foreign policy efforts. Telecoms giant Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] had its access to high-end chips curtailed by its addition to a Commerce Department blacklist known as the entity list.
""There's been a lot of coverage on the Trump administration's actions regarding TikTok, but the more significant action - from a global economic standpoint and that will have considerable ripple effects through global supply chains - are the increasing restrictions on SMIC and other Chinese national champions like Huawei,"" said Nicholas Klein, a Washington lawyer who specializes in international trade. He said these actions are more likely to draw a retaliatory response from Beijing.
The United States has moved to ban the popular short video app TikTok, citing national security concerns stemming from its Chinese ownership.
SMIC's new designation is not as severe as being blacklisted, which makes it difficult to get any export license approved.
The Pentagon earlier this month, Reuters was first to report, said it was working with other agencies to determine whether to blacklist SMIC for its purported links to the Chinese military.
U.S. companies including Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), KLA Corp and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), which supply chipmaking equipment, may now need to get licenses to ship certain goods to SMIC.
It is unclear which suppliers received the letter, but typically once the Commerce Department comes to the conclusion that there is a risk of military use or diversion, it sends that information to the companies.
The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security declined on Saturday to comment specifically on SMIC, but said it was ""constantly monitoring and assessing any potential threats to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests"".

The administration has increasingly trained its focus on Chinese companies that bolster Beijing's military. Last month, the United States blacklisted 24 Chinese companies and targeted people it said were part of construction and military actions in the South China Sea, its first such sanctions against Beijing over the disputed strategic waterway.

Nikola One, the company's flagship hydrogen-powered truck truck, is at the centre of a design patent infringements lawsuit that Nikola filed against Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) in 2018. Nikola claimed, Tesla's Semi, its first electric heavy duty truck, is ""substantially"" similar to Nikola's design.
According to the FT report, citing people with knowledge of the deal, Milton purchased the designs of the vehicle for several thousand dollars from Rimac Automobili's designer Adriano Mudri in 2015.
""The Nikola One truck was designed and patented by Nikola,"" Salt Lake City, Utah-based Nikola said in a statement. ""It is commonplace to license third party designs during vehicle development, and although early in the process Nikola purchased a license to Adriano Mudri's designs, he was not part of the design team and his designs are materially different from the design invented by Nikola for the Nikola One."" 
The FT report comes after Tesla denied the design patent infringement charges in a filing last week, and said that Adriano Mudri was the designer of the hydrogen-powered concept truck, dubbed ""Road Runner"", and Milton was aware of the concept before filing design patent application.
Tesla and Rimac Automobili were not immediately available to a Reuters request for comment.
In a scathing report earlier this month, short-seller Hindenburg Research said it had enough evidence to show Nikola and its founder Trevor Milton had made false claims about the company's proprietary technology to form partnerships with automakers. Following the allegations, Milton stepped down.
Nikola, a competitor of Elon Musk's Tesla, in the trucks space, said it was discussing the claims with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Nikola has publicly rejected the accusations and threatened to take legal action against Hindenburg.

Manfred Knof, head of Deutsche Bank's retail business in Germany, will assume the top spot at Germany's No. 2 lender on Jan. 1.
He succeeds Martin Zielke, who resigned this summer in the wake of a revolt led by the private equity investor Cerberus, one of the lender's largest shareholders who was pressing for big changes at the bank.
The appointment allows Commerzbank to move forward with a new strategic plan that was put on hold until a new leader was found. The bank is looking at branch closures and shedding international staff to save costs.
Hans-Joerg Vetter, chairman of Commerzbank's supervisory board since last month, has told employees that the lender is not a ""restructuring case, but Commerzbank must become more efficient"".
""It needs to increase its revenues, reduce costs, and to question the status quo,"" Vetter told employees, according to a transcript seen by Reuters.
In choosing Knof, Vetter overlooked two current Commerzbank board members who had been in the running. 
Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank were in merger talks last year but called them off. Since then, Deutsche Bank launched a broad restructuring that sought to cut nearly 18,000 jobs, while Commerzbank has largely marked time.
The initial reaction from one top investor was cautiously optimistic. The focus is now on implementing change, and success will very much depend on the relationship between Vetter and Knof, said the person with knowledge of the investor's position.
Knof will assume office subject to approval from its regulator, the European Central Bank.
Knof is an ""experienced and highly effective top manager who has proven himself in a wide range of tasks in the financial services industry"", Vetter said.
Deutsche Bank's deputy CEO, Karl von Rohr, will take over Knof's responsibilities, Deutsche Bank said.

776,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 26, 2020 01:46PM ET</span>","SmileDirectClub Sees Profit, Growth Ahead: Exclusive","By Christiana Sciaudone 
Investing.com -- SmileDirectClub's (NASDAQ:SDC) reputation took a hit earlier this year when NBC published a report on users who didn't have a great experience with the company. 
Customer experience is a key component of SmileDirect's teledentistry business, as its product aims to improve peoples' smiles. The negative news report should have hurt -- the shares tanked after the report came out on the air and online. But sales rose despite the bad press, and the company expects to turn a profit. 
""We remain committed to being profitable this year,"" said Chief Financial Officer Kyle Wailes in a phone interview. ""Expectations are for an annualized growth rate of 20% to 30% for the next five years.""
SmileDirectClub sells doctor-prescribed at-home kits of aligners to improve crooked or spaced-out teeth for a better smile. The aligners are printed out at a facility in Tennessee, where the company is headquartered. 
The company says it has served more than 1 million people and doesn't get more specific than that. It has identified 500 million people worldwide with the need, and who can afford to pay $89 a month for the product. Of this potential market, 125 million are in the United States.
""It's a massive market opportunity,"" Wailes said. The U.S. market is the focus, but SmileDirectClub is also positioning itself abroad, and already operates in the U.K., Australia and Hong Kong, among others. Wailes said SmileDirectClub's brand awareness is already at 50%, with one of two people familiar with the brand in the U.S.
It doesn't hurt that SmileDirectClub is now selling oral care products via Walmart (NYSE:WMT), a deal that kicked off early this year. Wailes said the company is eyeing other retailers for similar agreements. SmileDirectClub has also recently begun selling directly to dentists. Wailes said of 200,000 dentists in the U.S., only 30% prescribe clear aligners -- and it's a lucrative deal for the doctors.
Of course, it all depends on people being willing to spend on vanity at a time when so many Americans are unemployed, federal stimulus is elusive, and the outlook uncertain.
Last September, SmileDirectClub debuted as a public company when its shares opened some 11% below the IPO price. They have recovered some, and more than doubled since March. And analysts tend to be fans. The stock has five buy ratings, two holds and no sells.
Like any disruptive company entering a traditional industry, SmileDirectClub hasn't always been welcomed with open arms. It faced lawsuits from orthodontists and consumers, at least some of which have been dismissed. In February, the NBC story cited ""dozens"" of complaints to the Better Business Bureau regarding treatment and quoted two unhappy former clients. 
The distractions didn't seem to deter would-be clients, as revenue for the first quarter increased 11% from a year earlier, to $197 million. That included the first few weeks of Covid-induced lockdowns. The second quarter wasn't as rosy, with sales coming in at $107 million. Like most companies, SmileDirectClub pointed to the pandemic as the main culprit and noted the decrease was driven by a 53% year-over-year drop in aligner shipments.    
Earlier this month, Stifel maintained its buy rating on the stock and raised its price target to $14 from $11.
""Despite strong top-line growth and a solid leadership position in an underpenetrated (direct-to-consumer) clear aligner market, our multiple accounts for ongoing lack of profitability and legal / litigation risks that likely remain part of the story in the interim,"" Stifel analyst Jonathan Block said.    
In May, SmileDirectClub sued NBC, seeking $2.8 billion from the company and the reporter for knowingly and intentionally making factually inaccurate, misleading and defamatory claims about the company. An NBC spokesperson said, ""We stand by our reporting and believe this is a meritless claim.”
SmileDirectClub said it cannot comment on the ongoing litigation regarding NBC, but Susan Greenspan Rammelt, chief legal officer, said in a statement: “We felt it was necessary to file the suit for the benefit of the millions of consumers who, without teledentistry, would not be able to afford or or obtain quality teeth straightening. We will continue to vigorously defend our company against false claims made by the media and pursue our mission to increase access to premium oral care.”    
Other challenges include competition. SmileDirectClub isn't the only game in town; rivals include Invisalign and byte. But Wailes argues that SmileDirectClub has the competitive advantage of doing the entire process, from start to finish, itself. It outsources nothing, and as result can quickly turn around any necessary changes. That also ensures the company can efficiently and rapidly address any customer service issues -- the heart of the business.   
""There's no one out there today that controls the entire member experience in the way that we do,"" Wailes said.

Veolia last month offered to pay energy group Engie 2.9 billion euros ($3.37 billion) for a 29.9% stake in Suez, with a view to subsequently taking full control of its rival by buying up more shares, a move Suez views as hostile.
Veolia's offer remains valid until Sept. 30. 
""There have been multiple conversations ... The goal remains to find a middle ground and to end the conflict, the source told Reuters. 
The French state holds a 23.6% stake in Engie and has tried to ease tensions. Engie, which owns almost 32% of Suez, rejected Veolia's initial advance but has said it would consider a higher offer.

Zetsche, 67, a former chief executive of the company which owns the Mercedes-Benz brand, was due to take a seat as chairman on the board of directors, which in Germany is known as the supervisory board.
""Naturally I would like to have done the job. I also believe I would have done it well. But in the end I decided that I do not want it, that I renounce this opportunity,"" Zetsche is quoted as telling the paper. 
""We acknowledge Dr. Zetsche's decision with great respect,"" a Daimler spokesman said.
Zetsche says Daimler's top investors would have backed him to succeed Manfred Bischoff but that there may have been opposition from other shareholders.
""The fact that after 40 years of work I am not regarded by some as an asset, but as a burden, I do not need that,"" Zetsche is quoted as telling the paper. 
Zetsche, who aside from being chief executive of Daimler, was also head of Mercedes-Benz, was due to succeed Bischoff at Daimler's annual general meeting on March 31, 2021.

Administrators took control of SAA in December after almost a decade of financial losses, and have been trying to keep it afloat as the coronavirus pandemic compounds its problems. 
Tlali said SAA Technical, a subsidiary of SAA that provides critical maintenance services including inspections required before a flight can take off, said in a letter it had taken the decision after the national carrier did not pay for services rendered. 
""SAA Technical... as a company registered on its own is pursuing its commercial interests,"" Tlali said, adding meetings would take place over the weekend to try and resolve the issue.
He added that while SAA was not operating commercial flights, it has been doing repatriation flights for South Africans that have been stuck overseas due to the coronavirus pandemic as well as some charter flights that could be interrupted if SAA Technical does not restore its services. 
Another SAA subsidiary, Mango, is currently operating domestic commercial flights, which eNCA said would be grounded from midnight on Saturday due to SAA Technical's decision. 
Mango could not immediately be reached for comment. 
SAA's administrators published a rescue plan in June that requires more than 10 billion rand ($584.16 million) to work. The Department of Public Enterprises has said it is in the process of finalising funding and the airline would not be liquidated. 
""As matters stand, we are waiting from the shareholder (government) to give us an indication as to when funds will be made available,"" Tlali said, adding funding in the short-term was needed.

780,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 26, 2020 08:21AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Peloton,"By Geoffrey Smith  and Peter Nurse
Investing.com -- Peloton Interactive is that rare thing - a disruptive company that is truly changing its sector from a very early stage in its life, and a company that is both fast-growing and profitable.
This popularity has come at a cost, however. Shares of  Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON) have more than tripled in price this year. Its market value is now above $25 billion, which, to put into perspective, makes it more valuable than Nasdaq.
There may be more gains in the short term as the coronavirus bares its teeth once more. But while Peloton may well have growth potential, its sky-high valuation might not make it the best buy right now.
Investing.com's Geoffrey Smith argues the bull case for Pelton, while Peter Nurse explains the bear argument. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
Peloton does for exercise what  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) does for brainstorming at the office: Its equipment and app take away all the inconvenience of having to leave your home, and yet still provide an acceptable substitute for the traditional shared experience of working in an office, or working out in a gym. The concept may not be equally attractive to everyone, but it is powerfully attractive to many, and that is all it needs to be, in order to succeed.
The figures bear this out: the midpoint of its latest guidance expects 90% growth this year in its Connected Fitness Subscriptions, under which customers both buy the hardware and then subscribe to classes that use the software. That’s going to generate 96% revenue growth and a gross profit margin of 41%.
It’s already gone from having 1.4 million such subscribers to 3.1 million in the last year. That’s a high enough number for the extraordinarily low churn rate of under 1% to be meaningful.
Neither of the two concerns most often raised about Peloton, price and the time-limited benefit of the Covid-19 pandemic, essentially undermine the thesis. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has proved beyond any reasonable doubt that a superior, focused product can command premium pricing well into its life cycle, and the Echelon fiasco this week has only underlined that fact.
Likewise, the trend toward exercising from home – for those with the space to do so – will remain intact because the gains in convenience will still exist even after people lose their fear of infection.
As with Zoom, adoption of the technology is being accelerated above trend, but the fundamentals are compelling even without the distraction of the pandemic.
Naturally, the stock looks expensive, having quadrupled since March. But at Thursday’s closing price of $88.56, Goldman Sachs’s 12-month target price of $110 still represents 24% potential upside. Profitable growth is not cheap in today’s market, but at least with Peloton it looks reasonably well underpinned.
The Bear Case
There’s no doubt Peloton has been one of the success stories of the Covid-19 pandemic. Demand for the company’s expensive stationary bikes has soared as well-heeled Americans have tried to keep fit despite being barred from their gyms.
This popularity pushed Peloton's market value above $25 billion, and more gains may be ahead. While Peloton may well have growth potential, its stock is currently valued as if it has stunning long-term prospects.
Yet how much longer is this coronavirus pandemic going to last? 
On Wednesday, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announced that it was entering the final stage of its clinical trial to determine if its experimental single-dose Covid-19 vaccine can protect against the virus. This could receive emergency approval by early 2021 if data shows it is safe and effective.
And J&J is only one of a number of companies striving around the clock to develop a workable vaccine.
Turning to the company’s growth potential: When reporting its fiscal fourth quarter results earlier this month Peloton offered up guidance of sales of between $3.5 billion and $3.65 billion for fiscal 2021. The mid-point of that range would result in sales being up 96% from a year earlier -- quite a leap.
Yet is that growth really that likely for what is essentially a niche market? After all, how many families can afford a $2,000-plus bike, on top of a $40 per month fee for fitness classes in these straitened times, as well as the space to fit such a bulky item?
Then there is competition. When Peloton went public it listed a saturated fitness and wellness market as being one of the key risks potential investors should consider. Covid-19 quickly diluted the market, but, as discussed before, hopefully it won’t be long before competition heats up again.
On top of gyms physically opening again, a number are establishing a virtual presence,  either through their own apps or on YouTube. And these don’t cost $2,000. 
Additionally, Peloton’s stock climbed more than 5% earlier this week after Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) distanced itself from Echelon Fitness, which makes a stationary bicycle similar to Peloton's at a fraction of the cost.
Peloton might have dodged a bullet this time round, but if the market for this type of product is as valuable as it projects then it won’t be long before Echelon does receive some hefty backing.
With Peloton’s stock at these lofty levels, the company is likely to have to pedal very hard in the near future just to stand still.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2020 07:17AM ET</span>","Beijing autoshow: China's back, EVs booming, outlook uncertain","By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's auto market has rebounded smartly from the COVID-19 crash in recent months, executives said on Saturday, as a rare in-person trade show was dominated by talk of recovery in the world's biggest car market.
While conditions have improved vastly from lockdowns that froze economic activity in the country where the pandemic erupted, the Beijing autoshow is a far cry from the usual ebullience as fewer attend, new models are scant and prospects remain uncertain.
Doubts remain over the durability of the recovery, but the focus for now is on bright spots such as strong demand for mid-sized to large luxury vehicles and a flood of interest - and investment - in electric vehicles.
""The recovery in the Chinese market has been very remarkable, and our key segments have returned to the previous year's level if not slightly better,"" Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) CEO Makoto Uchida told a news conference via a video link from Japan.
""I expect this rebound to continue, but we need to watch for signs of trouble,"" said Uchida, who announced Japan's second-biggest carmaker would launch a number of new vehicles in China over the next five years as it struggles to return to profit.
China's auto sales rose 11.6% in August from a year earlier, the fifth straight monthly rise after plunging during the lockdown.
When almost all residents were told to stay home in February, sales collapsed by a record 79% to their lowest since 2005.
Executives at Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG) and Guangzhou-based GAC (SS:601238), which has partnerships with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267), forecast full-year sales growth in China, while Chongqing Changan Automobile (SZ:000625) predicted the same for its local joint venture with  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
Great Wall Motor Co (SS:601633), China's top pickup truck maker, aims to boost overseas sales this year, helping to ease an overall drop caused by COVID-19.
Germany's  Audi AG  (DE:NSUG) is in talks with long-term partner China FAW Group Corp [SASACJ.UL] about creating a second joint venture to build electric cars on its PPE platform in China, Germany's Automobilwoche reported.
LIMITED UPSIDE
China's typically busy car-buying season, ""Golden September, Silver October"", is off to a good start, according to preliminary data, with passenger car sales up 12% in the first 20 days of September.
The rebound means this year's sales will fall less than 10%, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers estimates, better than its May forecast of a 15% to 25% decline.
Much of the upturn is driven by sales of larger passenger cars by makers such as  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW, boosted by new models, automakers' discounts and a broader recovery in the world's second-largest economy.
Premium vehicles accounted for a record 15% of the Chinese market in August, up from around 10% for all of last year, the China Passenger Car Association said.
Electric vehicles are also providing buzz to the Beijing show, as a boom in Tesla (O:TSLA) shares has propelled interest in China.
EV startups such as Nio (N:NIO), Xpeng (N:XPEV), Li Auto (O:LI) and WM Motor have together raised more than $8 billion this year.
But the recent improvement reflects Chinese carmakers making earlier model launches as they could not wait for the usual hype from the delayed autoshow before going to market. That suggests a more limited upside to the current sales rise.
""This year's auto sales are very different from previous years,"" said LMC Automotive senior analyst Alan Kang. ""Many cars were sold during summer because customers delayed purchases after the lockdown.""
Sales of larger sedans and sport-utility vehicles have returned to last year's levels, but competition among mass-market brands is intensifying, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.
That's a key battle ground for international and domestic brands including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Toyota (T:7203), and Geely (HK:0175).

""Sales performance in these two months will give us a clue of what will happen next,"" said Zhang.

782,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>","Nissan to launch slew of new vehicles in China over next five years, CEO says","By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor's chief executive (T:7201) said on Saturday he planned to launch a number of new vehicles in the growing Chinese market over the next five years, including electrical cars, that could help the struggling Japanese automaker return to profit.
""The recovery in the Chinese market has been very remarkable, and our key segments have returned to the previous year's level if not slightly better,"" CEO Makoto Uchida said at a press conference at the Beijing auto show via a video link from Japan. ""I expect this rebound to continue, but we need to watch for signs of trouble,"" he added. 
Uchida and the company's China boss, Shohei Yamazaki, said Nissan will launch nine new and re-designed electric models in the world's biggest auto market by 2025, including plug-in electric vehicles and hybrid electric cars that charge with a gasoline engine.
Uchida's remarks come as investors express concern about Japan's second-largest carmaker, which has warned of a record $4.5 billion loss this year as the pandemic hampers its turnaround.
Growth in China is a key part of Nissan's effort to recover from rapid expansion that left it with dismal margins and an ageing portfolio that the automaker says is a result of a mismanagement by former boss Carlos Ghosn, who was arrested for financial misdeeds which he denies.
Nissan has pledged to cut 300 billion yen ($2.84 billion)from annual fixed costs and focus on each of the company’s three biggest markets: China, the United States and Japan.
Yet, while China’s automotive market continues to recover strongly, Nissan last month saw its business shrink 2.4% after showing modest growth every month since April.
That sales contraction was in stark contrast to Japanese rivals Toyota and Honda, which have both seen rapid sales growth since the pandemic’s effects began easing in China over the summer. 
In August, Toyota vehicles sales in China rose 27.2% from last year, while Honda's grew 19.7%.
To bolster its finances, Nissan this month said it plans to issue $8 billion in dollar-denominated bonds and is considering euro-denominated debt. The bond sale is its first dollar-denominated issuance since its tie-up with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) in 1999, a Nissan representative said.
A Nissan spokeswoman said some of that money would be used to repay other debt. 
""Although Nissan continues to have sufficient levels of liquidity, we are seeking to strengthen our liquidity position in order to ensure smooth implementation of our business transformation plan,"" she said.

International sales make up around 7% of Great Wall's overall sales, and Great Wall plans to increase that gradually, Sun said.
Sun said the Baoding-based automaker plans to start building vehicles in Thailand and India next year, but did not offer detail. Great Wall said earlier this year that it would buy two plants in these countries from General Motors (N:GM).

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) will seek voluntary retirement from 500 to 600 employees, mostly in management, in Japan from mid-November to cut costs, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday.
The auto company is expected to post a net loss of 360 billion yen in the financial year to March 2021, hurt by a plunge in sales due in part to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mitsubishi has already embarked on a plan to cut 20% of fixed costs in two years by shrinking its workforce and production and closing unprofitable dealerships.
The company plans to solicit voluntary retirement from management employees aged 45 years and over in Japan at its headquarters and other sites, such as its Okazaki plant in Aichi prefecture and Mizushima plant in Okayama prefecture, the sources said.
A spokesman for the company declined to comment.
The coronavirus crisis has worsened conditions at the company, which is already battling falling sales in its largest markets of China and Southeast Asia, which account for a quarter of its sales.
As part of its restructuring plan, Mitsubishi, a junior member of the Nissan-Renault automaking group, has said it would stop making the Pajero SUV crossover model next year and close the plant in Japan that makes the vehicle.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department asked a federal judge in San Francisco on Friday to allow the government to bar Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) from offering WeChat for download in U.S. app stores pending an appeal.
The filing asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler to put on hold her preliminary injunction issued Saturday. That injunction blocked the U.S. Commerce Department order which was set to take effect late on Sept. 20 and that would also bar other U.S. transactions with Tencent Holding's (HK:0700) WeChat, potentially making the app unusable in the United States.
Beeler responded late on Friday by setting a hearing for Oct. 15 on the motion but said she could potentially hold it on ""a tighter time period.""
The Justice Department filing said Beeler's order was in error and ""permits the continued, unfettered use of WeChat, a mobile application that the Executive Branch has determined constitutes a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.""
Tencent had put forward a ""mitigation proposal"" that sought to create a new U.S. version of the app, deploy specific security measures to protect the new apps source code, partner with a U.S. cloud provider for user data storage, and manage the new app through a U.S.-based entity, the filing said. 
However, its proposal still allowed Tencent to retain ownership of WeChat and did not address U.S. concerns over the company, it added. 
Tencent declined to comment.
Lawyers for U.S. WeChat Users Alliance, the group behind the legal challenge to the WeChat ban, questioned the urgency of the government's request, noting the time it took for the government to seek a stay.
""The government’s decision to sit tight for five days shows that there is no emergency,"" they wrote.
In support of its argument, the Justice Department made public portions of a Sept. 17 Commerce Department memo outlining the WeChat transactions to be banned. ""The WeChat mobile application collects and transmits sensitive personal information on U.S. persons, which is accessible to Tencent and stored in data centers in China and Canada,"" the memo said.
Beeler said WeChat users who filed a lawsuit ""have shown serious questions going to the merits of the First Amendment claim."" 
The Justice Department filing said ""the First Amendment does not bar regulation of WeChat simply because it has achieved the popularity and dependency sought by (China), precisely so it can surveil users, promote its propaganda, and otherwise place U.S. national security at risk.""
WeChat has had an average of 19 million daily active users in the United States, analytics firms Apptopia said in early August. It is popular among Chinese students, Americans living in China and some Americans who have personal or business relationships in China. 
Beeler wrote ""certainly the government’s over-arching national-security interest is significant. But on this record — while the government has established that China’s activities raise significant national security concerns — it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns.""
WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), WhatsApp, Instagram and Venmo. The app is an essential part of daily life for many in China and boasts more than 1 billion users.

TikTok on Wednesday sought a similar preliminary injunction from a U.S. judge in Washington. A judge on Friday said he would hold a hearing Sunday morning about whether to halt the U.S. app store ban on new TikTok downloads set to take effect Sunday night.

(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google will block election-related ads on its platforms after polls close in the U.S. election on Nov. 3, the company told advertisers in an email on Friday.
The email, seen by Reuters and first reported by Axios, said that ""advertisers will not be able to run ads referencing candidates, the election, or its outcome, given that an unprecedented amount of votes will be counted after election day this year.""
Experts warn that the election results could be delayed due to increased mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
The email said the company would ban election ads, including those that mention state or federal office-holders, candidates, or political parties, as well as ads running on election-related search queries. 
Social media companies have been facing growing pressure to police misinformation in political ads.  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) recently said it would stop accepting new political ads in the week before the election and would reject ads that seek to claim victory before the results of the election are declared.
A Google spokeswoman said the ban was expected to be in place for a minimum of a week but that it was not decided when the ban would be lifted. She said the company would consider factors such as the time taken for votes to be counted or whether there was civil unrest. 
The ban forms part of Google's 'sensitive events' policy, she said. Google has blocked some ads relating to COVID-19 under the same policy, which seeks to prohibit content that potentially capitalizes on or lacks reasonable sensitivity towards events like public health emergencies or natural disasters. 
The ban will apply to all ads on Google's ad-serving platforms, including its video-streaming service YouTube and Google Ads.

 Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) banned political ads last year, while Google has previously limited the ways election advertisers can micro-target voters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A judge will hold a hearing on Sunday on whether to allow a Commerce Department ban on new TikTok downloads from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Google app stores from taking effect.
The Justice Department faced a 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) Friday deadline to either delay the ban or oppose TikTok's preliminary injunction. It filed its objection under seal, citing submissions made by TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, that include confidential business information. 
ByteDance has said it made a preliminary deal for Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to take stakes in the short video sharing app, but the exact terms of the agreement remain unclear.
The Commerce Department gave the companies an additional week to finalize a deal before an order banning TikTok from U.S. app stores takes effect, citing ""recent positive developments.""
U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington set a 9:30 a.m. EDT Sunday hearing on the preliminary injunction request. 
Another U.S. judge, in Pennsylvania, is also considering issuing a preliminary injunction after three TikTok content creators filed suit last week arguing they would ""lose access to tens of thousands of potential viewers and creators every month, an effect amplified by the looming threat to close TikTok altogether.""
On Sept. 20, a judge in California issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a similar order from taking effect on Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY)' WeChat app. The Justice Department has asked the judge to allow the ban to take effect pending appeal.
TikTok has said the restrictions, amid rising U.S.-China tensions under the Trump administration, ""were not motivated by a genuine national security concern, but rather by political
considerations relating to the upcoming general election.”
ByteDance, Walmart and Oracle said last Saturday that their agreement would to allow TikTok to continue to operate in the United States. But U.S. officials have expressed serious concerns that the personal data of as many as 100 million Americans who use the app was being passed on to China’s Communist Party government.

ByteDance has said its deal with Oracle and Walmart will see the creation of a standalone U.S. company and does not involve any transfer of technology, though Oracle will be able to inspect TikTok U.S. source code. It has also said the deal needs approval from both China and the United States.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) said on Friday it has secured a $5.5 billion government loan and could tap up to $2 billion more in October depending on how the U.S. Treasury allocates extra funds under a $25 billion loan package for airlines.
Airlines have until Sept. 30 to decide whether to take the U.S. Treasury loans, which were authorized under the CARES Act coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress in March.
American Airlines was originally allocated $4.75 billion, but carriers including Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) have already said they do not intend to take their share of the package, opening the door for the funds to be used by other airlines.
Fort Worth, Texas-based American said it has already drawn down $550 million of the Treasury loan, which is backed by its loyalty program. The loans also require airlines to issue warrants and carry restrictions on executive compensation and buybacks.
Among other carriers, United Airline (O:UAL) said this week it will tap the Treasury loans, but it was not clear whether the airline would only seek its $4.5 billion share or more.
U.S. airlines received a separate $25 billion in March under the CARES Act primarily in the form of grants to keep employees on payroll through the end of this month and avoid furloughs while the industry battles a deep downturn from the coronavirus pandemic.
The have also tapped capital markets to bolster liquidity, but with passenger traffic still down about 70% from pre-pandemic levels, the industry is urging Washington to extend another $25 billion in payroll support through March, 2021.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq snapped a three-week losing streak on Friday, as tech rebounded with a strong showing from Apple ahead of its iPhone 5G launch widely expected to be just weeks away.
The Nasdaq Composite gained 2.26%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.34%, or 155 points and the S&P 500 added 1.65%.
Tech continued to ride the wave of bargain-seeking investors scooping up beaten-down blue chips in the sector, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), in particular, seeing strong gains, up 3%. The rise in Apple comes as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said the stock's recent weakness provides a ""compelling entry point.""  Recent checks suggest that Apple is taking market share in Europe and China ahead of its iPhone 5G launch, the bank added.   
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which together make up a quarter weighting of the S&P 500, ended 1% higher.
Industrials were not far behind thanks to gains in  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), Boeing (NYSE:BA), and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), with the latter two rising on hopes the aviation industry could receive federal funding if the Democrats' proposed $2.4 trillion bill, which is expected to be voted on next week, is passed.
As well as aid for airlines, the bill is expected to include funding for direct payments to households and small business loans. The move on a new fiscal stimulus comes as the Democrats seek to restart stimulus talks with the White House after negotiations broke down last month.
An 11% rally in  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), meanwhile, pushed up healthcare stocks after the drugmaker said it had started a late-stage trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate in the U.K.
On the earnings front, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped estimates. The shares fell 2%, but some Wall Street analysts said the weakness was a buying opportunity.
""We'd take advantage of the weakness as we see a strong case for outperformance driven by continued market share gains and a special dividend, which could potentially come next year. However, EPS upside seems less likely from here as premium wages could continue going forward,"" Oppenheimer said.
Energy proved an exception to the broader market rally, ending the day flat as oil prices fell for the third week in four amid worries about demand when many are concerned about further coronavirus lockdowns."
793,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>",FAA chief set to conduct 737 MAX evaluation flight next week,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Aviation Administration Chief Steve Dickson is set to conduct an evaluation flight at the controls of a Boeing 737 MAX (N:BA) next week, a key milestone as the U.S. planemaker works to win approval to resume flights, the agency told lawmakers.
The Boeing 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. Dickson, who was previously a commercial airline pilot, plans to undergo simulator training before the flight and will then share his observations with FAA technical staff.
It is not typical for an FAA administrator to fly an airplane before it returns to service. Dickson has repeatedly said he would not sign off until he flew it himself and was ""satisfied that I would put my own family on it without a second thought.""
The FAA told U.S. lawmakers in an email Friday that Dickson and FAA Deputy Administrator Dan Elwell ""will be in Seattle next week to take the recommended training."" The flight by Dickson will fulfill ""his promise to fly the aircraft before the FAA approves its return to service.""
Boeing shares were up 6.7%.
The FAA and regulators from Canada, European Union Aviation Safety Agency Brazil earlier this week concluded the Joint Operations Evaluation Board (JOEB) assessing Boeing’s proposed 737 MAX training.
A draft Flight Standardization Board report including the JOEB findings will released for public comment in the ""near future,"" the FAA said, and it must still finalize a directive outlining software upgrades and other changes that all 737 MAX planes must undergo before resuming flights.
Given required time for public comments, it appears MAX could get final FAA approval to return to service sometime in November, sources briefed on the matter said.
Earlier Friday, Europe's chief aviation safety regulator said the MAX could receive regulatory approval to resume flying in November and enter service by the end of the year. 
""For the first time in a year and a half, I can say there's an end in sight to work on the MAX,"" said Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

Ky said Boeing had agreed to install the computerized third-sensor system on the next version of the plane, the 230-seat 737 MAX 10, followed by retrofits on the rest of the fleet later.

(Reuters) - A single dose of Johnson & Johnson's (N:JNJ) experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced a strong immune response against the novel coronavirus in an early-to-mid stage clinical trial, according to interim results published on Friday.
The vaccine, called Ad26.COV2.S, was equally well-tolerated at two different doses, the results showed. A single shot, versus a rival two-dose approach being tested by  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE), could simplify distribution of the vaccine. 
However, it is unclear whether elderly people, one of the populations most at risk from the virus, will be protected to the same degree as younger people with the J&J vaccine.
The trial in close to 1,000 healthy adults, which is backed by the U.S. government, began after the J&J vaccine was found in July to offer strong protection in a single dose to monkeys.
Based on the current results, J&J on Wednesday kicked off a final 60,000-person trial, which could pave the way for an application for regulatory approval. The company said it expects results of that so-called Phase 3 trial by the end of the year or early next year.
The results, released on the medical website medRxiv, have not been peer-reviewed. (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.23.20199604v1.full.pdf)
Researchers, including those from J&J's unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals, said 98% of participants with data available for the interim analysis had neutralizing antibodies, which defend cells from pathogens, 29 days after vaccination. 
However, immune response results were available from only a small number of people - 15 participants - over 65 years old, limiting the interpretation.
In participants older than 65, the rate of adverse reactions such as fatigue and muscle aches was 36%, much lower than the 64% seen in younger participants, the results showed, suggesting the immune response in older people may not be as strong. 
The researchers said more details on safety and effectiveness will follow when the study is completed. 
For now, the results justify why more studies are needed in larger numbers to look for serious adverse effects, Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who was not involved in the J&J trial, told Reuters. 

""Overall, the vaccine is doing what you would expect it to do if you were to move it to Phase 3 trials,"" Bloom said.

(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) on Friday settled a shareholder lawsuit that accused the Google parent of covering up lavish exit packages to executives found responsible for sexual misconduct, saying it would overhaul workplace policies and increase oversight of its diversity efforts.
The company will prohibit severance packages to employees who are subject to any pending investigation for sexual misconduct or retaliation. Sexual misconduct accusations against senior executives will be investigated by a ""rapid response"" team, and they will be barred from amending their stock-selling plans while under investigation.
Penalties and training will be made more consistent. And Google employees will be able to publicly discuss the facts of their cases. 
A new council to oversee diversity efforts will include executives including CEO Sundar Pichai as well as independent experts such as a retired judge and outside attorneys. The council will report quarterly to the leadership development committee of Alphabet's board. 
The company will spend $310 million over a decade on diversity initiatives, such as computer science training for minorities, and Google will expand globally its U.S. policy of not considering prior salaries in setting wages for new hires.
Julie Goldsmith Reiser, an attorney who handled the case for shareholders, said the commitments raised the bar beyond what any other company facing diversity and sexual harassment challenges has agreed to.
""It is a lot of tools that Alphabet will have in the toolbox to make its workplace better,"" she said. 
Several changes that already applied to Google also will be enforced Alphabet-wide, including making arbitration optional for employee and contractor sexual harassment claims. 

The lawsuit from last year in Santa Clara County Superior Court in California accused Alphabet leadership of making misguided decisions around sexual misconduct issues that hurt the company's reputation and share price, as Google and other companies faced a reckoning during the Me Too movement.

PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s grounded 737 MAX could receive regulatory approval to resume flying in November and enter service by the end of the year, Europe's chief aviation safety regulator said on Friday.
""For the first time in a year and a half I can say there's an end in sight to work on the MAX,"" said Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
EASA expects to lift its technical ban ""not long"" after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), probably in November, but national operational clearances needed for individual airlines to resume flying in Europe could take longer, he said.
""We are looking at November,"" he said when asked when the technical ban would be lifted. China is expected to take longer to give its own approval, he said, without elaborating.
Boeing shares were up 3.3% in mid-session trading, against a fractionally higher market.
Cologne-based EASA, which regulates air safety in 32 mainly European Union countries, has locked horns with the FAA and Boeing over the scope of an international review into 737 MAX systems following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.
All but one of the differences has been resolved, Ky said, with EASA, supported by some unions, calling for pilots to be able to manually cut power to a ""stick shaker"" alarm system suspected of distracting Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crew. 
The main focus of the review has surrounded black-box evidence that bad data from a single faulty flight-angle sensor triggered a cockpit software system that repeatedly pointed the aircraft's nose down and overwhelmed the crew on both flights.
Boeing has said inputs from both ""angle of attack"" sensors on the MAX will be used in the modified aircraft, instead of just one in the past, but EASA has called for a third ""synthetic"" sensor to provide independently computed data.
Ky said Boeing had agreed to install the computerised third-sensor system on the next version of the plane, the 230-seat 737 MAX 10, followed by retrofits on the rest of the fleet later. 
Boeing declined detailed comment on the additional sensor.
""We are committed to addressing all of the regulators’ questions and meeting all certification and regulatory requirements,"" a spokesman said
Turning to Boeing's next development, Ky warned EASA would examine the 400-seat 777X development ""much more closely"" than it would have done if the MAX grounding had not happened and pay particularly close attention to flight control systems.
The MAX crisis has shaken a system of co-operation between regulators and thrown into question the practice of routinely accepting decisions by the lead regulator, in this case the FAA.

EASA and the FAA - the world's largest aviation regulators - will continue to recognise each other as the leader when certifying aircraft built in their respective countries, but are expected to get more involved in checking each other's homework.

(Reuters) - An Oklahoma pension fund has sued  Cannae  Holdings (NYSE:CNNE) Inc, including its chairman, Bill Foley, accusing it of self-dealing in an arrangement that outsourced management of Cannae to a company also owned by Foley, according to a legal complaint filed this week.
The decision by Cannae's managers and board members to hire Trasimene Capital Management LLC to manage the Las Vegas-based investment firm was designed to ""generate windfalls"" for him and his management team, the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension & Retirement System said in a complaint filed in Delaware Chancery Court on Wednesday.
The move was done through an unfair process, without setting up a special committee of the board, according to the complaint.
""The board of directors of Cannae determined that the external management agreement was in the best interests of Cannae and all of its shareholders, which has proven to be the case. Cannae will vigorously defend this suit,"" a Cannae spokeswoman said.
She noted that the company's shares have outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 220% since the management agreement with Trasimene was reached in August 2019. 
The Oklahoma pension fund, which represents firefighters and is an owner of Cannae shares, said the management contract imposed significantly increased costs on Cannae, and that it was seeking damages. 
Cannae's main holdings include data and analytics provider Dun & Bradstreet Holdings Inc and human capital management company Ceridian HCM Holding (NYSE:CDAY) Inc. 
Cannae also holds shares in property information provider CoreLogic Inc. CoreLogic this month rejected a sweetened $7.1 billion takeover bid from Cannae and hedge fund Senator Investment Group LP, saying it significantly undervalued the company.
Cannae and Senator on Friday sent a letter to CoreLogic's shareholders making their case as to why investors should elect nine new independent directors to the board to ensure that the company runs a sales process.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Los Angeles-based maker of Exploding Kittens and Throw Throw Burrito board games ordered 1 million extra units from its factory in China with the hope of preventing coronavirus from ruining its Christmas sales.
The move from the company, which sells product through  Target  (NYSE:TGT) , Walmart (N:WMT), and Amazon.com (O:AMZN), comes as  U.S. suppliers and retailers have been rebuilding depleted inventories and battling uncertainty by stockpiling pandemic sellers such as toys, refrigerators, home furnishings and booze.
In the last few months, ""I started getting the games out of China as fast as possible,"" said Carly McGinnis, chief operating officer at Exploding Kittens.
U.S. imports leapt 5.9% to a record in August, the first year-over-year rise since September 2019, according Panjiva, the supply chain research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. It said imports of household appliances jumped 79.7%, and furniture imports increased 38.1%, fueled by orders from retailers like IKEA and Target. 
The Port of Los Angeles, the nation's busiest seaport, unloaded thousands of containers from seven unscheduled cargo ships in August. 
President Donald Trump's trade war with China makes many imports costlier, but retailers said they don't want to risk running out of merchandise if COVID-19 infections upend supply chains again. 
Chicago-area retailer Abt Electronics is snapping up brand-name refrigerators from suppliers in countries like South Korea and building reserves of flat-screen TVs. 
Appliance makers are still catching up from factory closures earlier this year, said co-President Mike Abt, who is carrying about 20% more of those items than last year. 
""My inventory is up, finally, in appliances but my business is up more"" because stay-at-home recommendations mean refrigerators, stoves, and washing machines get more use, Abt said.      
The family-owned retailer also has 27% more flat-screen TVs in stock.  
""What if we have another spike in COVID cases and things lock back down again this fall?"" said Tim Jordan, who  sells home decor products on Amazon. He is trying to get six months' worth of inventory, versus his typical three. 
At the port serving the greater New York area, shipments linked to IKEA soared 380%, while those for spirits maker  Diageo  (L:DGE) and cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) rose 91% and 25.5%, respectively, Panjiva said. IKEA, Target, Diageo and L'Oreal, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The holiday lineup at Walmart includes evergreen products for homebound shoppers: loungewear, outdoor grills, pet beds, laptop computers, and exercise equipment. The world's biggest retailer did not immediately respond to a question about details of import strategy. 
Many large retailers are starting holiday promotions before Halloween as a hedge against upheavals that could cause consumers to snap wallets shut.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on Friday the social media platform plans to expand its labeling of state-affiliated accounts worldwide, even as he defended its policy of allowing leaders of countries like Iran and China to use Twitter.
During the virtual Oslo Freedom Forum, hosted by New York-based nonprofit the Human Rights Foundation, Dorsey said Twitter would label accounts in more countries to give users more context for information tweeted by state-affiliated accounts and ""if there's an agenda behind it.""
Twitter first announced the labeling last month, but only initially applied it to accounts from China, France, Russia, the UK and the United States.
Twitter has been used widely by activists, sometimes using pseudonyms, to broadcast human rights abuses from countries like Saudi Arabia and China, but has been criticized for failing to prevent bad actors from using so-called ""bot"" accounts to spread disinformation.
Dorsey said the company is using signals such as when batches of new accounts are created, and how quickly they begin tweeting about certain topics, to crack down on disinformation campaigns, while protecting activists under pseudonyms.
""Pseudonymity is a built identity, and that's what we want to value and protect,"" he said. 
Asked if it was hypocritical of Twitter to allow leaders from Iran and China to use the platform despite the governments blocking access to citizens, Dorsey said there was value in ""understanding how they're thinking.""

""It's important ... to know how the story of the regime is being told to the rest of the world,"" he said.

BRUSSELS/MILAN (Reuters) -  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA (PA:PEUP) has offered to boost Japanese rival Toyota (T:7203) to try to address EU antitrust concerns about its plan to create the world's fourth-biggest carmaker with  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA), people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
PSA has offered to increase the production capacity for Toyota in their van joint venture, one of the sources said. Another source said the French company would sell the vans at close to cost price.
PSA makes vans for Toyota in its Sevelnord plant in northern France. The van collaboration started in 2012.
PSA submitted its offer to the European Commission earlier on Friday, three months after the EU enforcer opened a full-scale investigation into the deal with FCA (MI:FCHA) on concerns that it would hurt competition in small vans in 14 EU countries and Britain.
""As of now, the transaction has obtained merger clearance in fourteen jurisdictions. As previously stated, closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2021,"" PSA and FCA said in a joint statement.
The Commission, which temporarily halted its investigation into the deal in July while waiting for the companies to provide requested data, did not set a deadline for its decision.
""The deadline is still suspended. This procedure in merger investigations is activated if the parties fail to provide, in a timely fashion, an important piece of information that the Commission has requested from them,"" the EU executive said.

It is now expected to seek feedback from customers and rivals before deciding whether to demand more concessions, or either clear or block the deal.

807,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",‘Complete Mess’: Traders Fear Volatility Long After Election Day,"(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump has all but promised to dispute the election outcome if he loses. Wall Street’s taking him at his word.
Volatility markets from stocks to currencies and bonds show investors bracing for turbulence not just on election day, but for the ensuing weeks as well. The fear is that results from the Nov. 3 vote -- already the most expensive event to hedge against ever -- won’t be clear enough that a winner emerges without a protracted legal battle.
If that happens, the potential for political chaos and prolonged uncertainty is seen as a bigger risk for equity markets than who actually wins the vote, according to UBS AG.
“The election outcome itself, once you know it, that would have meaningful but not an oversize impact on the market,” said Stuart Kaiser, the bank’s head of derivatives research. “But the prospect of it becoming a complete mess is another element that people don’t really know how to price.”
The upshot is a rush for protection well into December. Contracts on the Cboe Volatility Index -- known as the VIX -- typically rise in the days around an anticipated event that could disrupt markets, such as a Federal Reserve meeting or an election. That happened earlier this year on VIX contracts that cover Nov. 3, but now the volatility futures curve remains elevated past the election.
It’s a similar story across asset classes: interest-rate options are increasingly pricing in risk throughout November, while expectations of future swings in the price of the largest gold-back exchange-traded fund spiked that month and stays lofty through the end of the year. A measure of anticipated risk in the classic haven trade of the dollar-yen pair is at the highest in two decades.
There’s reason for concern, Wall Street says. Trump this week wouldn’t commit to a peaceful transfer of power. A potential increase in mail-in voting could delay ballot counting, making it difficult to declare a winner on Nov. 3. During the 2000 Florida recount battle, the S&P 500 lost over 4%, yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell 52 basis points and gold prices soared over 12% as investors piled into haven assets.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cautioned Friday that a delayed outcome is only a “tail risk” and not the most likely outcome, but markets have even more to worry about right after the vote. The Fed will meet the week of the election for the first time since 1984, while October’s jobs report will be released that Friday.
Staying Expensive
Together, the uncertainty has forced traders to protect against volatility weeks after the election passes. November VIX futures -- which reflect the market’s expectations for volatility through Nov. 18 -- are more expensive than October, whiel December futures prices have been creeping higher as traders increasingly anticipate a delayed result.
“We’ve definitely seen -- from a flows perspective and a client interest perspective -- people moving out and into December,” Kaiser said. “They’re worried if they own November options, those will expire before the actual outcome is known.”
FX on Edge
Currency traders have long been on edge over the prospect for election-fomented turbulence. Since June, they’ve been using the yen to protect against volatility as far out as the January inauguration. And a JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. measure of swings for more than 20 global currencies -- based on three-month at-the-money forward options -- has clawed back to the highest since the March meltdown.
The defensive crouch is a shift from the 2016 election, when traders had to rush to avoid swings created by Trump’s surprise victory. Four years later, they’re wasting no time in putting on hedges.
“FX is generally the most liquid asset class and tends to quickly reflect political uncertainty and event risk,” said Win Thin, chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. “It’s a 24-hour market.”
Treasuries Tremble
Even the Treasury market, where unprecedented Fed support has muted swings for months, is showing signs of anxiety. Expectations for price volatility in three months versus four weeks are at a level only exceeded once in the past decade. Some traders have been buying options to hedge a potential rush of capital from investors fleeing stocks.
“Rate options appear to be putting increasing weight on events after the November 3 U.S. election date,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysts Michael Schumacher, Zachary Griffiths and Erik Nelson wrote in a note. “If the lion’s share of vol were associated with the election, then the vol difference should have collapsed on Sept. 4, when the two-month expiry began to include Election Day.”
Even the subdued swings, with volatility near record lows, can be seen as a signal that traders expect political turmoil. An uncertain outcome would force the Fed to keep rates near zero and delay any major policy changes.
Going for Gold
It’s gotten more expensive to protect against swings in the price of gold, a traditional haven not known for wild moves. Implied volatility on the $78 billion SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) fund, ticker GLD, jumps in November and stays elevated through December’s contract.
Buying protection against GLD swings is a “direct” way to hedge for the prospect of a delayed election, according to Tallbacken Capital Advisors’s Michael Purves.
Election turmoil “raises questions about the quality of governance in this country, it raises questions about the dollar and it’s one of the reasons why people are paying up for gold vol in this period,” said Purves, Tallbacken’s chief executive officer. “Gold may be the cleanest way to play this election.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Global banking regulators said on Friday they stand ready to offer more relief to lenders as a second wave of the pandemic and prolonged remote working test their resilience.
The Basel Committee of banking regulators from the world's main financial centres said the outlook for global financial stability continues to be uncertain.
It said a protracted recovery from the pandemic and the unwinding and expiration of government and other support measures introduced during lockdowns, such as repayment holidays on credit cards and mortgages, could heighten risks.
""The banking system's operational resilience will continue to be tested in light of the increase in remote working and banks' reliance on technology and third-party service providers,"" the committee said in a statement after three days of meetings this month.
""The Committee will continue to monitor the risks to the global banking system from Covid-19 and will pursue additional measures if needed.""
It reiterated encouragement to banks to tap some of their capital and liquidity buffers to cushion themselves against the rise in bad loans due to the pandemic so that lending continues to the economy.

""Supervisors will allow banks sufficient time to restore buffers, taking account of economic and market conditions as well as the circumstances of individual banks,"" the committee said.

812,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",Housing Boom in U.S. Threatened by Shortage of Available Homes,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. housing market, which has been a bright spot in the pandemic-battered economy, is running out of fuel.
With buyers eager to take advantage of low mortgage rates, the inventory of homes to buy is scarce. That’s driving up prices and threatening to derail the boom by pushing homeownership out of reach for many Americans.
For homebuilders, the huge demand for housing is an opportunity to crank up construction and solve the inventory crisis. Instead, some are deliberately slowing things down as they grapple with supply shortages, surging lumber costs and intense competition for labor and land.
“It’s smart business,” said Gene Myers, chief executive officer of Thrive Home Builders in Denver. “But that means continued shortages and higher prices.”
After the Covid-19 lockdowns in March brought sky-high unemployment, most builders expected a crash. What they got was a brief pause followed by a crush of buyers armed with the lowest interest rates on record and a burning desire for more space in the suburbs.
Inventory Shortage
There was pent-up demand for housing when the pandemic hit, after a decade when builders mostly focused on the higher-end of the market, constructing fewer, more expensive homes. Recently, they’d shifted focus to cheaper properties for the massive millennial generation now aging into homeownership.
But with higher costs eating into profit margins, builders may once again chase the wealthy who want bigger homes with backyards and home offices. That comes as the inventory shortage has gotten even more acute.
The supply of existing homes, shrinking for years, is at an all-time low. At August’s sales pace, it would take a little more than three months to run out of new homes for sale, the lowest level on record, according to government data dating back to 1963. That’s down from almost six months in February.
New home construction this year will hold steady at just under 900,000, about the same pace as in 2019, according to a projection by the National Association of Home Builders. For 2021, the industry group forecasts that starts will increase slightly but will be held back by the cost and availability of building materials.
Lumber Spike
The trouble for builders is that vacant land takes about two years to be developed, a process slowed by local government regulations. Meanwhile, lumber prices are expected to add $16,000 to the cost of a typical house, according to the NAHB.
They’ve risen because producers idled saw mills in the U.S. and Canada in March and still face timber shortages resulting from a beetle infestation and wildfires, said Joshua Zaret, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
Homebuilders aren’t the only ones bidding up the price of wood. Quarantined families have been especially busy remodeling during the pandemic. This summer’s hurricanes and wildfires will also add to demand once the insurance checks start coming in.
Slowing Sales
Builders can keep raising prices to stay ahead of costs, to a point, said John Burns, an Irvine-based real estate consultant. But some are raising them by as much as 2% a month, he said.
“If that went on for two or three years, we’d be very concerned about affordability,” Burns said. “Every time prices go up, it’s great for homeowners and bad for the renter who aspires to be a homeowner.”
Stocks of homebuilders have climbed in recent months as orders for new homes surge. The looming issue is that the demand for housing is outstripping supply at a time when construction has gotten more expensive.
 Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN)., the biggest builder by revenue, said it’s intentionally limiting sales to homes already under construction to avoid buying lumber at today’s high prices. The company says it’s trying to be patient, betting it can continue to hike prices to help offset the higher costs.
“Sales could have been stronger with a singular focus on volume,” Stuart Miller, the company’s chairman, said on an Sept. 15 earnings call. “It is challenging at best to materially ramp production in this labor-constrained market, and it’s even more challenging to replace entitled land.”
Wood Shortage
Alan Gerbus, a second-generation Cincinnati custom builder, is already in the hole on a house before he’s even started. He submitted a contract to his buyer in late June for an $800,000 house but his costs just for wood products jumped $25,000 by the time it was signed 40 days later.
“The lumber supplier said he can’t honor that price,” Gerbus said. “I’m praying for the lumber prices to start falling by the time I’m ready for delivery.”
Even if builders wanted to plow ahead, it’s hard to get wood these days. Robert Pool (NASDAQ:POOL), co-owner of Main Street Lumber, a family business in Denison, Texas that sells products to builders, said he had to turn down some new customers early in the lumber supply crisis because he wanted to be sure he’d have wood for his existing customers.
His price for oriented strand board, widely used for roofs and siding, more than doubled to $24 a sheet in March, he said.
“It hurts when you have to tell somebody no,” he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Vodafone  Group Plc (L:VOD) said on Friday it had won an international arbitration case against the Indian government, ending one of the most high-profile disputes in the country involving a $2 billion tax claim. 
An international arbitration tribunal in The Hague ruled that India's imposition of a tax liability on Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), as well as interest and penalties, were in a breach of an investment treaty agreement between India and the Netherlands, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
India had claimed a total of 279 billion rupees ($3.79 billion) including about $2 billion in tax, as well as interest and penalties, one of the sources said.
The tribunal, in its ruling, said the government's demand is in breach of ""fair and equitable treatment"" and it must cease seeking the dues from Vodafone. It also directed India to pay 4.3 million pounds ($5.47 million) to the company as compensation for its legal costs, one of the sources added. 
Vodafone said in a statement the amount of the award was confidential. Shares in the company's India unit, Vodafone Idea (NS:VODA), ended 13% higher on Friday. 
""The tribunal held that any attempt by India to enforce the tax demand would be a violation of India's international law obligations,"" Vodafone said in its statement. 
India's finance ministry said it will carefully study the award, together with its lawyers. ""After such consultations, the government will consider all options and take a decision on further course of action including legal remedies,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
""Vodafone has finally got justice first from the Indian Supreme Court and now from an international arbitral tribunal,"" said Anuradha Dutt, senior partner at DMD Advocates, an Indian law firm representing the company. 
The ruling brings an end to one of the most controversial disputes in India under international treaty agreements that it enters into with countries to protect foreign investments. 
India is entangled in more than a dozen such cases against companies, including  Cairn Energy  (L:CNE), over retrospective tax claims and cancellation of contracts. The exchequer could end up paying billions of dollars in damages if it loses.
To reduce future arbitration claims, India has ended such agreements with over 50 countries and is working on a new law to protect foreign investors by offering relief from possible policy changes even as it upholds the right to tax them, Reuters reported.
Vodafone's tax dispute stems from its $11 billion deal to buy the Indian mobile assets from Hutchison Whampoa in 2007. The government said Vodafone was liable to pay taxes on the acquisition, which the company contested.
In 2012, India's top court ruled in favour of the telecom provider but the government changed the rules to enable it to tax deals that had already been concluded. 

In 2014, Vodafone initiated arbitration proceedings against India.

Investing.com --  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) is up 13% Friday after saying it will begin a late-stage trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate. 
The Phase 3 study to evaluate NVX-CoV2373 is expected to enroll and immunize up to 10,000 individuals between 18 and 84 over the next four to six weeks in the U.K.
“With a high level of SARS-CoV-2 transmission observed and expected to continue in the UK, we are optimistic that this pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial will enroll quickly and provide a near-term view of NVX-CoV2373’s efficacy,” said Novavax President Gregory M.

Investing.com -- Buy cruise lines. No, really. That's according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC), which said that even if the companies keep pushing back a return to sailing, that's no deterrent. 
Analyst Felicia Hendrix upgraded the bank's outlook on the sector, citing a return to the seas in Germany and Italy without incident, and booking data for all of the companies showing pent-up demand. Near-term ship deliveries are being delayed, and that will allow ""the industry to recover over the next several years against a slower supply growth backdrop,” the analyst wrote, according to StreetInsider. 
Carnival (NYSE:CUK),  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) and Norwegian got bumped to overweight from equal weight, and shares were rising 4.7%, 4.4% and 8.75%, respectively.
The analyst says Covid-19 testing has become more pervasive and vaccine-related news is mostly positive. The worst in over, she said. 
Cruise lines stopped sailing in March as the world shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which is very much still with us. There is no vaccine, and second waves are popping up in Europe. There are reports of a more contagious strain of the virus. The U.S. hit 7 million cases this week.
Even if the Centers for Disease Control extends the no-sail date in the U.S., it should have positive comments and could signal a near-term return to cruising, which could be a catalyst for shares, Hendrix said.  
By 2022, the companies will be operating full fleets, and Hendrix as a result bumped profit estimates for that year and the following above consensus. 
Risks are high, but so are potential rewards, Hendrix said.
""We believe current stock prices largely reflect these risks, while the upside is significant,” she wrote.
Hendrix upgraded Carnival's price target to $31 from $18, Norwegian's to $26 from $17 and Royal Caribbean's to $68 from $50.

State aid could come in the form of subsidized storage of unsold pork or financial support for farms, Kloeckner told an online press conference after a meeting regional agriculture ministers.
Aid for subsidized storage would need approval from the European Union, Kloeckner said. 
China and a series of other pork buyers banned imports of German pork in September after the first ASF case was confirmed in Germany. 
The disease is not dangerous to humans but is fatal to pigs and a massive outbreak in China has led to hundreds of millions of pigs being culled. 
A total 32 cases of ASF were confirmed in Germany since the first one on Sept. 10, all in wild animals with no farm pigs affected. All have been found in Germany’s eastern state of Brandenburg.
German pig prices slumped after the initial discovery but remained stable this week on hopes of increased exports to the EU as other European exporters raised sales to China and elsewhere in Asia to fill the sudden gap left by the German import bans. 
A series of permanent fences are to be built along Germany’s border with Poland by regional state governments with the EU set to give financial aid, Kloeckner said.
But was not possible to build fences without gaps because of roads and built up areas along the border.

It is Germany’s goal to prevent ASF spreading to other areas and get the country ASF-free again, she said. Efforts are being made to contain the disease, with intensified hunting of wild boar and testing of all dead boars.

Shares are down 3% on Friday even as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised their price targets on the big box membership retailer.
Costco reported earnings per share of $3.51 versus the estimated $2.83, on sales of $53.4 billion compared to the expected $52 billion, according to data compiled by Investing.com. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by incremental expenses related to Covid-19 premium wages and sanitation costs of $281 million pretax.
Nonetheless, Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman raised the price target on Costco to $360 from $330, reiterating an overweight rating, according to StreetInsider. The shares are currently trading around $336.
""The stock screens favorably relative to the broader market (currently trades at a ~1.6x premium to the SPX vs. ~2x historically), presenting a reasonable entry point for longer-term oriented investors,"" Gutman said. ""We expect the stock to steadily grind higher with top-line strength set to continue in the near-term amidst manageable compares, alongside a favorable skew of earnings outcomes regardless of the macro/virus backdrop.""

The British group recently completed its purchase of CG Technology, a sports-betting outfit spun off from Cantor Fitzgerald LP, in a deal that gave it sports book assets in Nevada.
“The U.S. is the key attraction with William Hill” and “a value of about 300p per share is easily reached at present,” Gavin Kelleher, an analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers, wrote in a note to clients Friday. “Another interesting angle is the plans Apollo and/or Caesars have for the non-U.S. part of William Hill.”
Apollo made an initial written proposal on Aug. 27, and then both the buyout firm and Caesars made further approaches, William Hill said in Friday’s statement. Both suitors have until Oct. 23 to announce the intention to make a firm offer or walk away under U.K. takeover rules.
Founded in 1934, William Hill is one of the world’s largest sports betting companies with offices in 10 countries, according to its website. Under Chief Executive Officer Ulrik Bengtsson, who took over a year ago, the company is focused on building its online businesses. Bengtsson was previously William Hill’s chief digital officer."

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks drifted lower again on Friday, on course for a fourth straight weekly loss, although tech stocks outperformed amid selective bargain-hunting.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 136 points, or 0.5%, at 26,680 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% but the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%
The day's only major economic data, if anything, reinforced the sense of unease over the outlook, with core durable goods sales rising only 0.4% in August, a clear slowdown from the summer months in which they rebounded vigorously from the first wave of the pandemic. 
The U.S. economic data continues to weaken. This means there is more need for stimulus,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with Avatrade, ""In the absence of such, the stock market selloff is likely to become intense.""
Among the first stocks out of the blocks, Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) rose 7.0% and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose 3.0%, at the end of a week that has seen heavy selling in both. Exercise bike-maker Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON)'s stock also bounced sharply after a negative week in which it was shaken, temporarily, by reports that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) wanted to break into the market for connected exercise appliances. There was no sign of a rival to Peloton's products in Amazon's big reveal of new devices and services on Thursday, which included a Cloud gaming service and new speaker and security camera products.
Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell 2.5%, despite reporting earnings after the bell on Thursday that beat expectations. The wholesaler reported late on Thursday that it saw signs of stockpiling returning to customer behavior.
Biotech group  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock rose 8.8% after it began a final phase 3 test of its experimental Covid-19 drug in the U.K., while in over-the-counter markets, ADRs in U.K. bookmaker William Hill (OTC:WIMHY) rose over 30% after a report saying that Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) and Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment had approached it with regard to a buyout. William Hill and Caesars have already announced a major strategic partnership to exploit the gradual liberalization of gambling in the U.S.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock rose 2.5% after Europe's chief aviation safety regulator said its grounded 737 MAX could receive regulatory approval to resume flying in November and enter service by the end of the year. However, that will come too late for one of its privately-held parts suppliers, Impresa Aerospace, which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on Thursday."
820,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>","U.S. auto sales gain pace in September as demand recovers: JD Power, LMC","(Reuters) - The pace of U.S. auto sales is expected to rise 3.3% in September from the prior month, helped by strong consumer demand and the Labor Day holiday, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Friday.
The seasonally adjusted annual sales pace for September is expected to be 15.7 million vehicles, up from 15.2 million vehicles in August, but down from 17.3 million units a year earlier, the consultants said.
U.S. auto sales have bounced back since hitting a pandemic-fueled bottom in April, leading major automakers to ramp up production and boost weak inventories at dealerships.
However, rising COVID-19 cases in the U.S. states have increased the uncertainty over a speedy economic recovery.
""Lockdown measures are now fairly loose in many parts of the world, but a risk of the reintroduction of more restrictive and widespread measures certainly cannot be ruled out,"" said Jeff Schuster, president of the Americas operations and global vehicle forecasts at LMC Automotive.

Total sales in September are projected to reach about 1.29 million units, compared with about 1.33 million units in August, and about 1.28 million units a year earlier, the consultants said.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Poland to close coal mines by 2049 in deal with unions,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's government struck a deal with trade unions on Friday to gradually close its coal mines by 2049, the two sides said, confirming a Reuters report.
Poland generates most of power from coal and is the only European Union state that hasn't pledged to be carbon neutral by 2050, with the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party saying it needs more time and money to switch to cleaner energy sources.
Also, mindful of violent miners' protests in the past, PiS has been wary of falling out with powerful unions.
However, the coronavirus crisis, coupled with EU climate policies, has pushed Warsaw to take more decisive steps over the loss-making sector.
The closure plan for the mines in the southern Silesia region ends days-long talks between unions, the government and top coal producer PGG on the industry's restructuring and also miners' underground protests against the closures.
It was agreed as hundreds of mostly young Poles took to the streets of Warsaw as part of global protests calling for more steps to tackle global warming. 
Shares in PGE (WA:PGE), Poland's biggest power producer and one of PGG's shareholders and customers, jumped more than 20% on the news, which ends the uncertainty over the sector.
The unions and government said there would be no compulsory redundancies, with workers moving to mines that remain open until they retire. 
The details of the closures have not been revealed, but a list seen by Reuters shows Pokoj mine in Ruda Slaska - where the unions had planned massive protests on Friday afternoon and which were cancelled following the deal - will shut in 2021.
Wujek mine - which was the site of one of the bloodiest protests during Communist rule and is a symbol of the nation's ties to coal - will become a part of another PGG mine next year.
The last mines to be closed in 2049 will be Chwalowice and Jankowice in the town of Rybnik, considered PGG's most efficient. 
""This is the direction of Poland's mining and energy sector transformation. We are following the EU policies,"" said Artur Sobon, an official at the state assets ministry. 

PGG owns eight mines, some of which consist of up to three smaller units.

The International Air Transport Association, which had already postponed its annual general meeting from June to November, said late on Thursday it had cancelled the accompanying ""World Air Transport Summit"" meeting.
IATA, which said the decision to scrap the Amsterdam meeting had ""not been taken lightly"", has urged governments to drop quarantines that it views as disproportionate to health risks. The industry is also pressing for airport COVID-19 tests for departing international passengers.

""When we postponed this year's AGM from June until November, it was with the expectation that government restrictions on travel would have been sufficiently eased to enable a physical meeting,"" IATA said. ""That now seems unlikely.""

823,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",Rise of the zombies? Europe faces insolvency balancing act,"By Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Even as the European economy slumps into its deepest recession in modern history, the number of bankruptcies across the continent has fallen sharply as government subsidies and a temporary loosening of insolvency rules keep companies afloat.
During the first half of 2020, countries including Britain, France and Spain saw insolvencies fall by an estimated 20-40%year-on-year, official and private sector data show.
But as the region implements new restrictions to control a fresh rise in COVID-19 infections, the question for governments is whether to preserve jobs at the risk of creating a generation of debt-laden ""zombie"" firms with no real future. 
For now, it seems a risk they believe worth taking. 
In Germany, Europe's biggest economy, there was a 6.2% year-on-year drop in insolvency filings in the first half after the government temporarily waived a filing obligation. By contrast, U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings rose 26%, according to legal-services firm Epiq Systems Inc.
Now, Berlin plans to give troubled firms yet more leeway.
    Local critics say the first-half fall in insolvencies is proof in itself the state has done more than enough and now risks impeding what economic liberals hail as ""creative destruction"", the term popularised in the 1940s by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter to describe unviable firms folding to make way for more dynamic newcomers.
    But the issue is knowing how to distinguish the zombies – generally defined as companies which would anyway struggle to cover their interest payments – from basically healthy firms that have run into temporary trouble.
Jan-Marco Luczak, legal and consumer spokesman for Angela Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU, said it was ""good and right"" that the government helped businesses quickly and without red tape.
    ""But it is also clear that we must not permanently switch off the self-cleaning process of the market,"" he told Reuters. ""Companies that are not healthy and have no economic prospects independently of corona must exit the market.""
Germany's Federal Statistics Office confirms the drop in insolvencies was directly facilitated by government measures, including allowing firms to delay filing for bankruptcy until the end of September, now extended to the end of the year. 
A new draft reform, which would take effect at the start of 2021, envisages extending the deadline for firms to file for insolvency to six from three weeks while also giving them the opportunity to terminate onerous contracts.
    ""The company is given a wide margin of manoeuvre in drawing up the restructuring plan, organising the negotiations and conducting the vote on the restructuring plan,"" the Justice Ministry said of the proposals in a written statement sent to Reuters.
    That has raised alarm bells with the IDW Institute of Public Auditors, which is calling on the government to press struggling companies to restructure earlier, rather than when they face a real threat of insolvency.
(Graphic: German insolvencies fall during lockdown - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/jbyprmmdbve/chart.png)
    
    STRUCTURAL CHANGE
Jens Weidmann, president of Germany's national central bank and a known fiscal hawk, also has concerns. 
He acknowledges the ""balancing act"" involved in countering the pandemic's economic fallout with state support measures but, in a speech this month, highlighted the potential to kick-start what many would see as a long overdue structural change in Germany's economy away from its reliance on the industries of the last century. The auto sector is one such example.
    ""Digital transformation could get a real boost"", he said, giving one example of the creative destruction that pro-market advocates are seeking. 
    Berenberg Bank economist Holger Schmieding said the government was not yet impeding corporate renewal, but was at risk of doing so.
""In this unusual and unusually deep recession, it makes sense to slow down the process of destruction.""
    ""Over the course of next year, the balance will shift,"" he added. ""Extending the moratorium on insolvency proceedings into next year would be wrong, in my view.""
REDUCED PROSPECTS
    Credit insurance and debt collection group Atradius estimates a 26% rise in insolvencies globally this year as governments start to phase out support schemes. However it predicts that any increase in the second half will be much lower in Europe than elsewhere.
    The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) last week urged governments to review and refocus pandemic support measures as the recovery progresses.
Failure to do so could hinder the recovery by trapping resources in non-productive firms and jobs, reducing prospects for shifting jobs to more productive and higher-paid ones, it said. 
    In Spain, one of hardest hit European countries both economically and in health terms, some 130 leading economists are urging the government to fine-tune employment protection schemes to avoid non-viable companies being subsidised. 
    ""It is key to avoid problems of incentives that could delay the revival of the economy and the reallocation of workers towards more productive enterprises,"" they wrote.
Britain is taking a different tack. While it has announced a wage subsidy scheme modelled loosely on Germany's long-running 'Kurzarbeit"" short-time work programme, Finance Minister Rishi Sunak has made it clear the initiative – a much less costly replacement to furlough measures expiring next month - was not intended to save jobs that were not viable in the long term.

The Social Democrat government wants to see at least 500,000 electric cars on Denmark’s roads by 2030 to help reach the goal of cutting carbon emissions by 70% compared to 1990 levels.
The plan put forward by the government on Thursday includes a series of tax hikes on fossil fuels, trucks and conventional vehicles. But in the name of equality, taxes are also set to rise for the more expensive electric cars.
According to the government’s own calculations, the price of a premium Model S would rise from 830,000 kroner ($130,000) to nearly 1.1 million kroner, an increase of 31.4%.

Money was sucked out of sectors which have been the main beneficiaries of the rebound in the wake of the Covid19 March crash, said BofA analysts, citing data for the week to Sept. 23 from financial flow tracking firm EPFR.
Technology stock suffered $1 billion of outflows, the largest since June 2019, while U.S. blue chips haemorrhaged $11.6 billion. 
The S&P 500 has lost 7.2% so far in September, its first negative monthly performance since March with the Nasdaq pulling back more than 10%. 
""We don't expect big bear move when Fed so easy, Wall Street flushed with cash, vaccine expectations strong"", BofA analysts however commented, adding a correction in September and October typically corresponded to a ""midlife crisis phase of the investment year"". 
Other big movements in investment flows this week included high-yield bond funds suffering their largest outflows since March, losing $5.4 billion. 
It was also the 12th straight week of inflows for emerging market debt funds while bond funds more broadly added $1.3 billion.

 Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc. won a crucial victory in a years-long tax dispute with the Indian government, a development that could potentially save the U.K. wireless carrier almost $3 billion.
An international arbitration tribunal ruled Friday that India’s efforts to claim 200 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) in past taxes were in breach of fair treatment under the bilateral investment protection pact between the south Asian nation and the Netherlands, according to a lawyer representing the company in the case. The tribunal has also asked India to halt its efforts to claim the tax dues. India can appeal.
Shares of Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea Ltd., Vodafone’s money-losing India unit, jumped 14% in Mumbai after CNBC-TV18 reported the ruling, the biggest gain since Sept. 3.
The ruling may ease the burden on Vodafone’s India venture at a critical time when it is already facing a demand for billions of dollars in back-fees India’s Supreme Court ordered it to pay last October in a separate case. The joint venture between Vodafone and billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s conglomerate has been weighed down by a $7.8 billion bill from the government -- biggest among peers -- eight straight quarterly losses and over $14 billion of debt.
“Vodafone has finally got justice,” said Anuradha Dutt, managing partner of DMD Advocates, a New Delhi-based firm which argued for Vodafone. “They have held that the government trying to recover from Vodafone the tax, interest, and penalty, is unfair and it breaches the fair and equitable standards laid down by international law.”
A Vodafone spokesman in London confirmed the tribunal has ruled in the company’s favor. “The award is confidential,” he said. “We are studying the lengthy documents and can make no further comment at this time.”
A spokesperson for India’s finance ministry did not answer calls seeking comment on the arbitration court ruling.
This marks the latest twist in over a decade-long tax dispute that started when Vodafone entered India by acquiring Hutchison Whampoa’s Indian operations in 2007 and was slapped with this tax bill. Vodafone disputed this tax demand and the country’s Supreme Court agreed that no local law supported the levy of this tax. But the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee amended the tax rules to apply retrospectively, triggering a legal battle that ended up in the Hague arbitration court.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Friday, continuing the recent selloff with investors' confidence hit by a combination of pandemic, economic and political worries. 
At 07:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 23 points, or 0.7%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 223 points, or 0.8%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 41 points, or 0.4%. 
Stocks are poised to end the fourth consecutive week in the red, thus likely snapping a five-month win streak. September has seen the S&P 500 drop nearly 7% so far. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has fared even worse, giving back more than 10%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off more than 5%.
Investors pulled a massive $25.8 billion out of U.S. equity funds in the week to Wednesday, the third biggest outflow ever from the asset class, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s weekly fund flow report showed on Friday.
The prospect of further U.S. stimulus remains a key focus, after a plethora of Federal Reserve speakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell, highlighted the need for more aid to keep the recovery going.
This received a boost Thursday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressing willingness to resume talks, while the House Democrats started work on a new stimulus proposal that would total around $2.4 trillion.  
The only problem is this proposal is roughly in line with the Democrats’ last offer, which was rejected by the Trump administration. Little has changed to suggest that this new submission will receive a more favorable welcome.
The key data release Friday will be the August  durable goods number, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). This will show how U.S. factories are contributing to any economic rebound, with expectations pointing to a 1.4% gain, a big comedown from the massive 11.4% jump the previous month.
In corporate news, the tech sector is likely to be in focus once more, following news that a Senate panel is set to vote next week on whether to subpoena Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) CEOs over the industry’s liability protections.
Oil prices traded lower, with persistent concerns over demand growth likely to result in a losing week for the oil complex.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $39.83 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract was down 0.8% at $41.59. Brent is heading for a drop of over 2% this week, while U.S. crude is on track for a decline of around 1.5%.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.8% to $1,861.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1636.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",Chinese fintech Ant sidelines banks in distribution of funds targeting its IPO,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As five Chinese mutual funds targeting Ant Group's hotly-anticipated IPO kicked off subscriptions on Friday, retail investors found the only non-direct channel through which to buy the products was online payment platform Alipay.
Alipay is controlled by the Chinese fintech giant itself, so the unprecedented arrangement, which sidelines banks and brokerages, highlights Ant's clout in online sales and threatens to disrupt traditional fund sales models.
""This is the first time banks are being excluded from mutual fund sales,"" one bank official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""For banks, it really hurts. Ant is attempting to break the dominance of banks in fund sales."" 
Ant , backed by  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA), plans a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai's STAR Market to raise about $35 billion in what could be the world's largest initial public offering. 
On Friday, money managers including China Asset Management Co, E Fund Management Co and Penghua Fund Management started raising as much as a combined 60 billion yuan in five funds that will participate in the Ant IPO as strategic investors, with a lock-up period of 18 months. 
But Ant's fund sales subsidiary is the sole distributor of the five funds, according to the sales documents. 
Ant did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. 
By bypassing traditional sales channels, Ant is throwing down the gauntlet to banks, analysts said. 
""Increasingly, tech-savvy young people are moving money away from bank deposits, into wealth management products being sold online,"" said Liu Yun, an analyst at Chasing Securities.
By the close of business, Ant's advertisement promoting the newly-launched funds drew more than 3 million clicks on its super-app Alipay.
An investor who gave only his surname, Han, bought 10,000 yuan worth of the Penghua fund, saying investing in Ant entailed little risk. 
But others balked at the funds' 18-month lock-up period.

""If I buy the funds now, I can only take out the money in 2022,"" said retail investor Liu Xiaobing. ""That's not efficient use of capital.""

Long-simmering doubts about the property giant’s financial health exploded to the fore on Thursday, following reports it had sent a letter to Chinese officials warning of a potential cash crunch that could pose systemic risks. The news sparked a bondholder exodus that continued into Friday, sending the price of Evergrande’s yuan note due 2023 down as much as 28% to a record low. Losses in the company’s dollar bonds spread to high-yield debt across Asia.
Evergrande said in a statement that rumors and documents circulating online were “fabricated” and “pure defamation,” without commenting directly on whether it had warned officials of a potential cash crunch. The developer, controlled by billionaire Hui Ka Yan, said it generated 400 billion yuan from project sales in the first eight months and maintains healthy operations. Evergrande won approval from Hong Kong’s stock exchange to spin off its property management unit, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday, paving the way for it to raise much-needed capital.
That did little to buoy investor sentiment, however, with Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd (HK:3333) shares falling 9.5% to the lowest level since May at the close of trading in Hong Kong.
The market’s biggest near-term worry relates to an agreement Evergrande struck with some of its largest investors. It gives them the right to demand their money back if the company fails to win approval for a backdoor listing on the Shenzhen stock exchange by Jan. 31. The repayment could amount to 130 billion yuan ($19 billion), or about 92% of Evergrande’s cash and cash equivalents. At least one of the investors has signaled it would be unwilling to extend the deadline.
Asia’s Junk Bond Giant Is Threatening Already Fragile Market
In another sign of mounting concern among creditors, at least five Chinese banks and two trust firms held emergency meetings on Thursday night to discuss their Evergrande exposure and access to collateral, people familiar with the matter said. Among them was  China Minsheng Banking  (HK:1988), whose exposure to Evergrande exceeds 29 billion yuan, one of the people said.
At least two of the banks that convened meetings on Evergrande decided to bar the company from drawing unused credit lines, according to people familiar. The developer had credit lines of 503 billion yuan as of June 30, of which 302 billion yuan were unused.
Minsheng Bank declined to comment. The lender’s shares dropped 1.4% in Hong Kong to the lowest level since 2012.
“Regardless of the authenticity of the letter, we think the situation may have prolonged negative impact,” Manjesh Verma and Stella Li, credit analysts at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., wrote in a report. “It increases concerns among various investors and lenders and hence increases difficulty in funding access and refinancing.”
Evergrande has long been viewed as a poster child for highly leveraged companies in China, where corporate debt swelled to a record 205% of gross domestic product in 2019 and has likely climbed further this year as firms increased borrowing to tide themselves over during the pandemic. Evergrande has tapped banks, shadow lenders and the bond market in recent years to expand beyond the property industry into businesses ranging from electric cars to hospitals and theme parks –- areas that often align with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s policy priorities.
Though it’s unclear why Evergrande has yet to win approval for its listing plan, some analysts have speculated it may relate to China’s efforts to tame sky-high home prices and restrain fundraising by developers. Regulators have been using a wide range of policy levers since 2016 to deter speculative home-buyers, curb expensive land prices and restrict lending to residential builders.
Evergrande has said it won’t raise new funds through the listing in Shenzhen, but the transaction could allow the company to achieve a higher valuation and thus easier access to future financing. Its stake sale to strategic investors in 2017 implied a valuation of about 425 billion yuan for the unit, which holds most of Evergrande’s real estate assets. That’s almost three times higher than the market value suggested by the developer’s existing shares in Hong Kong. Chinese property developers trade at about 12 times projected earnings on average in Shanghai and Shenzhen, compared with about 5 times in Hong Kong.
One big unanswered question surrounding Evergrande is whether authorities would step in to support the developer if it struggles to repay creditors. While the Chinese government has a long history of bailing out systemically important companies to maintain financial stability, policy makers have in recent years sought to instill more market discipline and reduce moral hazard.
As part of efforts to rein in financial risk, authorities have taken control of indebted conglomerates including HNA Group Co., Anbang Insurance Group Co. and Tomorrow Group. They’ve also introduced new rules for financial holding companies, including Evergrande, that impose minimum capital requirements and other restrictions meant to reduce the threat of systemic blowups.
S&P Global Inc. cut its outlook on Evergrande’s B+ credit rating to negative from stable on Thursday, but downplayed the threat of a liquidity crunch. The ratings company said Evergrande is trying to convince strategic investors to stay put and is an “asset-rich” company with multiple fundraising channels.
Evergrande has vowed to increase sales as part of its effort to meet an aggressive deleveraging target -- cutting borrowings by about 150 billion yuan each year from 2020 to 2022, or about half its current debt load.
But so far, the company has fallen short of the pledge. Evergrande’s total debt rose 4% in the first half to 835 billion yuan, while short-term debt was almost triple cash, equivalents and short-term investments combined, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Here are some of the biggest Evergrande-related market moves on Friday:"

ANA however said in an email it was not considering issuing shares.
Like other airlines, ANA has had to slash flights as countries around the world imposed travel restrictions to halt the spread of the coronavirus. So far the carrier has relied on loans from its banks and the government to help it cope with the slump in air travel.
In the three months to June 30, ANA posted a loss of 159 billion yen and said it did not expect a full recovery in demand for international flights until at least 2023.

Frerot also told reporters that Veolia would not ask for a seat on Suez's board if the company buys Engie's stake.
He did not specify by how much Veolia would increase its offer.
Veolia last month offered Engie 2.9 billion euros ($3.39 billion) for a 29.9% stake in Suez, with a view to subsequently taking full control of its rival by buying up more shares.
Engie, which owns almost 32% of Suez, rejected Veolia's initial advance but has said it would consider a higher offer.
Engie is due to hold a board meeting on Friday.
Suez sees Veolia's bid plan as hostile and is working on finding a consortium of investors to put together a rival bid for Engie's stake.
The company also set up a foundation to protect its water business in France that Veolia plans to sell to Meridiam Infrastructure.
Frerot said he was hoping to find a way to fend off the foundation that Suez put in place. 
He said that the foundation was ""disabling"" for Veolia's offer which remains valid until Sept. 30.
Suez shares were up 3.9% at 0944 GMT.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India plans to offer $4.6 billion in incentives to companies setting up advanced battery manufacturing facilities as it seeks to promote the use of electric vehicles and cut down its dependence on oil, according to a government proposal seen by Reuters.
A proposal drafted by NITI Aayog, a federal think tank chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said India could slash its oil import bills by as much as $40 billion by 2030 if electric vehicles were widely adopted.
The proposal is likely to be reviewed by Modi's cabinet in the coming weeks, said a senior government official, who was not authorised to comment on the matter and declined to be identified. NITI Aayog and the Indian government did not respond to requests for comment.
The think tank recommended incentives of $4.6 billion by 2030 for companies manufacturing advanced batteries, starting with cash and infrastructure incentives of 9 billion rupees ($122 million) in the next financial year which would then be ratcheted up annually.
""Currently, the battery energy storage industry is at a very nascent stage in India with investors being a little apprehensive to invest in a sunrise industry,"" the proposal said.
India plans to retain its import tax rate of 5% for certain types of batteries, including batteries for electric vehicles, until 2022, but will increase it to 15% thereafter to promote local manufacturing, the document said.
Though keen to reduce its oil dependence and cut down on pollution, India's efforts to promote electric vehicles have been stymied by a lack of investment in manufacturing and infrastructure such as charging stations. Just 3,400 electric cars were sold in the world's second-most populous nation during the last business year, compared to sales of 1.7 million conventional passenger cars.
The policy could benefit battery makers such as South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910) and Japan's Panasonic Corp (T:6752) as well as automakers which have started building EVs in India such as Tata Motors (NS:TAMO) and  Mahindra & Mahindra  (NS:MAHM).
While China accounts for 80% of the world's lithium-ion cell production, India has introduced stricter investment rules for Chinese companies. It has also slowed down the approval processs for some proposals after a deadly border clash between the two countries in June.
The draft proposal said annual domestic demand for battery storage and market size - currently less than 50 gigawatt hours and worth just over to $2 billion - could grow to 230 gigawatt hours and more than $14 billion in ten years time.
It did not offer an estimate of how many electric cars it expected to be on the road by 2030.
The proposal estimates it would cost firms some $6 billion over five years to set up manufacturing facilities with the support of government subsidies. 
NITI Aayog has been the driver of several key India government policies including the planned privatisations of a swathe of state-owned companies.

LONDON, NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stretched valuations and the resulting pullback in equities have prompted more interest in long/short fund strategies that can provide some protection against market declines and wild swings, hedge fund and asset managers say.
The S&P 500 index is down nearly 10% from its Sept. 2 peak, and the burst of selling has prompted some managers to seek more protective strategies. The recent selling followed a run-up in stocks, which regained all their coronavirus-induced losses after unprecedented support from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Long-short equity hedge funds, which bet on stock prices rising and falling, lost an average of 5.75% in March when markets plunged. But they went on to gain an average of 13.67% in the first eight months of 2020 and were the best-performing strategy in August, according to data from investment bank Nomura.
""We see great demand for strategies that protect from great volatility,"" Philippe Ferreira at fund of hedge fund Lyxor Asset Management told Reuters.
Part of the protection long-short funds offer is by ""shorting"" -- borrowing a stock or security from an institutional investor, then selling it back when the price falls, pocketing the difference.
Fund research firm Preqin said that hedge fund equity strategies, which includes long/short strategies, accounted for $929 billion of assets under management at the end of June, of $3.6 trillion in total global hedge fund assets. 
""We are seeing flows into strategies that bring some form of protection,"" said Ferreira. ""We are not seeing flows into strategies that are highly correlated to the market environment.
""There are many long-short that have a long bias and they are left by the sidelines at the moment. Long-short equity that is less correlated is in high demand.""
Data from industry tracker eVestment shows searches for long-short equity hedge funds on their database rose to a seven-month high in August, making up 17% of all hedge fund searches, compared with 11.1% in July.
Rob Christian, co-head of research and investment management at hedge fund solutions group K2 Advisors, part of Franklin Templeton Investments, said it's a ""great time"" for long-short investing and that clients had been looking to get more defensive.
""Broadly, equity investors are trying to reduce their equity risk using long-short managers,"" Christian said.
For their part, hedge funds running long-short funds say they are seeing renewed interest in the strategy. 
""My view overall is that long-short equity generally fell out of fashion a few years ago and there is just starting to be a little bit more interest, from our experience,"" said Nigel Gliksten, partner at Toscafund Asset Management.
Gliksten said Toscafund, which runs a $400 million long-short fund, was receiving more interested calls from investors since the pandemic hit.
""We have seen a big increase in inbound enquiries from family offices, institutional investors and banks, to layer in long volatility risk-reducing positions that would effectively create a long-short trade,"" said Matt Rowe, chief investment officer at asset-management firm Headwaters Volatility.
While many of the hedge funds said investors were at the early stage of their enquiries, some funds were already seeing inflows.
BlueBay's credit long-short fund almost doubled, to $219 million in July from $126 million in October 2019, with the increase due to investor inflows as well as performance, confirmed a spokesman.
The U.S.-based long-short credit fund Aristeia International rose to $1.3 billion in July from $1.242 billion in December, according to data compiled by HSBC and seen by Reuters.
In long-short equity, Lee Ainslie's Maverick Fund rose to $1.5 billion in July, from $1.4 billion in November 2019, showed the data.

Aristeia Capital and Maverick Capital did not respond to requests for comment on whether the asset growth was due to more investors.

Investing.com --  Boohoo .com (LON:BOOH) is investable again.
The U.K. fashion chain’s stock rose 8.8% on Friday after an independent review of its supply chain practices by leading lawyer Alison Levitt concluded that it hadn’t committed any criminal offenses in turning a blind eye to low pay and unhygienic and exploitative conditions at its suppliers’ factories in Leicester in England’s East Midlands.
As a result, the company looks likely to avoid expensive remedial action or the resignation of key management figures, the threat of which has weighed on the stock since the summer, when the Sunday Times revealed how Boohoo’s suppliers treat their workforce, which consists largely of immigrants from the Indian sub-continent.
Ms Levitt’s review, published on the company’s website, has some strong criticisms of how management ignored the plight of those who stitch together its five pound party dresses, but it also found that the company had already started to address the issues by the time they were revealed.
“The allegations of unacceptable working conditions and underpayment of workers are not only well-founded, but are substantially true,” Levitt wrote. “Commercial concerns such as growth and profit were prioritized in a way which made substantial areas of risk all but invisible at the most senior level.”
She noted weak corporate governance had allowed the problem to be hidden from senior management “for many years” – although the practices were an open secret to anyone with an interest in the matter. Textiles is a business that famously “follows the cheapest needle”, and the ethnic and social profile of its suppliers’ workforce screamed “vulnerability!” to anyone with an eye to see.
Levitt rightly reserves some blame for authorities who also chose to look the other way, saying their inaction “contributed significantly to the deficiencies…If the law is not enforced, this sends a clear message that the violations are not important and the people affected do not matter.”
Most encouragingly for investors, Levitt acknowledged that the company had already taken steps to correct the injustices before they were publicly exposed, a powerful defense against any accusations of bad faith. She also endorsed the analyst consensus that Boohoo’s business model doesn’t depend on abusive practices, for all that it relies on cheap labor.
That’s a relief because the business model is undeniably successful. The group is forecasting 25% revenue growth in the current fiscal year, and the performance of online-only fashion this year has surely raised the chance of an upside surprise when the company releases its interim results next Wednesday.
“The adaptations which Boohoo should make involve a relatively easily-achieved realignment of its priorities and governance systems,” Levitt said. “The Board should not feel discouraged. It has already made a significant start on putting things right.”
Even after this morning’s rise, Boohoo shares are still 11% below where they were before the Sunday Times’ revelations, suggesting that there is still a performance gap to close. Its chief rival in the U.K., ASOS (LON:ASOS), has risen some 60% in that time, helped by switches out of Boohoo, so expect that trade to be at partially reversed too.
If you can turn a blind eye to screamingly expensive multiples as well as Boohoo management did to sweatshop exploitation, then this one is probably for you."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) is in advanced talks with India's  Hero MotoCorp  (NS:HROM) for a distribution deal which will allow the U.S. firm's iconic motorcycles to be sold in India, after it stops local manufacturing there, three sources told Reuters.
The Milwaukee-based company said on Thursday it will stop sales and shut its manufacturing plant in India, effectively abandoning the world's biggest motorcycle market after a decade of unsuccessful efforts to gain a foothold.
Harley however is in talks with Hero MotoCorp to enter into a distribution arrangement that will allow the Indian company to import and sell Harley bikes as its sole distributor, two sources with familiar with the talks said.
""Hero will be the master distributor for Harley bikes in India ... This will be a partnership, a strategic alliance,"" said one of the sources, all of whom declined to be named as the discussions were private.
Discussions are also ongoing to let Hero become a contract manufacturer for at least one Harley motorcycle with 300-600 cc engine capacity, which it will launch later, the first source added.
The financial details of the deal were not immediately clear.
Asked about talks with Hero, a Harley spokeswoman said the company can't comment on ""rumours or speculation"". On Thursday, it said it was ""changing its business model in India & evaluating options to continue to serve customers.""
Hero MotoCorp, which is the India's largest two-wheeler manufacturer by sales, said it doesn't comment on market speculation. It produced 6.4 million two-wheeler scooters and motorcycles in the fiscal year ending March 2020, a third of India's total output.
Harley manufactured just 4,500 motorcycles during that period, largely assembled from imported knock-down kits at its plant near New Delhi, which it will shut as part of its announced restructuring.
Harley's decision to stop direct manufacturing marks another major exit by an automotive player in India and is a setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has been inviting foreign firms to ramp up local production. Ford Motor (N:F) and General Motors (N:GM) have both pared their India operations in recent years.
Harley, known for its heavy touring motorcycles, struggled in India mainly because of high import duties - which U.S. President Donald Trump often criticized India for - and also because its locally assembled bikes faced high taxes.
Hero typically sells motorcycles with engine capacities of under 200 cc and a deal with Harley will help speed up its entry into the mid- and high-engine segments favoured by biking enthusiasts and young leisure riders, the second source said.
""In that segment, biking is moving to a fashion purchase for leisure, weekend rides and Harley bikes will do well with higher local content,"" said the source, adding Harley was also likely to provide technology know-how and inputs on quality standards to Hero.

Harley's 33 dealerships will likely come under Hero's management under the new arrangement, said one of the sources.

LONDON (Reuters) - After the slide it was the see-saw for markets on Friday, as stocks in large parts of the world, the euro and Dr Copper all headed for their worst weeks since peak coronavirus panic, and the dollar cemented its best run since April.
Asia had managed to end its worst week since the global March meltdown with a modest gain and Europe's main bourses started broadly steady, but with both France and Britain now notching up almost record numbers of new virus cases the mood was jittery. 
London's FTSE clawed up 0.2% but Frankfurt's Dax and the CAC40 in Paris were down 0.2% and 0.4% leaving the pan-European STOXX 600 index down more than 3%, and travel stocks down over 6% for the first time since June. 
There had been a flicker of hope overnight after squabbling U.S. political parties rekindled talk of another super-sized stimulus package, but the rise in the dollar and demand for safe U.S. and German government bonds remained. 
In contrast, the drop in sentiment has hit emerging market debt, especially countries with weak credit ratings, like a wrecking ball. Argentina's newly restructured bonds have lost around 25% making it the worst return to markets since Greece in 2012. 
""It has been a very interesting week"" said Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy. ""We have seen the dollar come back and what is interesting this time is that there also some element of dollar liquidity stress in it again too.""
He said the talk of more U.S. stimulus ahead of the November Presidential election was likely to just be ""show boating"" especially with a fierce battle over a seat on the Supreme Court now thrown into the mix.
""I just can't see anyway that the Democrats can make a deal here with this endgame into the election... it's dirty politics all the way now"".
On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, the S&P 500 gained 0.30% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%. 
While the economic picture in the U.S. remains clouded, the strongest sales of single-family homes in nearly 14 years in August helped to revive some faith in the recovery.
It helped nudge the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield up to 0.6725% from a close of 0.664% on Thursday. German Bunds ticked up to -0.5% on the day too, but were set for a weekly drop as the growing number of coronavirus cases in Europe fed demand for safety. 
In the currency markets, the dollar was hovering near Thursday's two-month highs, at 105.40 versus the yen and pushing the euro down to $1.1656 on course for its worst week since the end of March/start of April.
China's yuan also made gains after the country's government bond gained long-awaited entry into one of the world's most influential bond benchmarks, the FTSE Russell WGBI.
The dollar's strength this week has also battered commodities, with gold set for its worst week in more than a month. On Friday, spot gold was steady at $1,865.16 per ounce. 
Copper, which gets its ""Dr Copper"" nickname from its history as a bellwether of global economic health, was set for its worst week since the March panic with a near 4% drop, while Brent oil was down 2% on the week but 0.8% better off on the day at $42.2 per barrel.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - TikTok has told an Australian government committee that it will allow government officials to review its algorithm and test its source code, as it seeks to overcome distrust surrounding the video-streaming app operator's China ownership.
TikTok's owner ByteDance has reached a deal with  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc that it hopes will end U.S. plans to ban TikTok in the United States on security grounds. It said the deal will see the creation of a standalone U.S. firm, TikTok Global, that does not involve any transfer of technology, though Oracle will be able to inspect TikTok source code.
TikTok's Australian executives appeared in Canberra on Friday before the Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media, where they said the computer instructions that guide the content presented to TikTok users would be made more widely available for inspection.
""(It will be) available in a public setting for regulators, governments, commercial entities to come in and to test our code"", Global Chief Security Officer Roland Cloutier said via video link.
In its written submission to the committee, TikTok said qualified government personnel could review its algorithm and test its source code at a transparency and accountability centre in Los Angeles in the United States and another to be built in Washington, or through virtual tours of the centres.
During questioning, Cloutier also said TikTok's source code was not the same as the source code used for ByteDance's Chinese version Douyin.
Under its deal, ByteDance has said it will establish a U.S. subsidiary of which it will own 80%.
Oracle and WalMart, however, said majority ownership of TikTok Global would be in American hands, complying with an Aug. 14 executive order by U.S. President Donald Trump that ByteDance relinquish ownership of TikTok within 90 days.
TikTok's Australia General Manager Lee Hunter said the ""deal is ongoing"" and he did not have knowledge of the discussions.

TikTok was registered as a business in Australia last year, and two of three directors of the Australian company are senior executives of ByteDance.

Investing.com - European stock markets largely weakened Friday, with investors concerned that a second wave of Covid-19 cases will halt the region’s nascent recovery.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower and the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index outperformed, gaining 0.1% after the U.K. government announced plans Thursday that mean future support for furloughed workers.
This week’s activity data in Europe showed the recovery stalled in September as the resurgence of coronavirus cases hit the services sector particularly badly.
On Thursday, French Prime Minister Jean Castex warned that the government could be forced to re-confine areas if the number of cases did not improve in the coming weeks. His government had already announced extra restrictive measures on Wednesday, mainly in big cities, to contain the disease.
""Evidence is mounting that the rebound is not just fading, but also potentially reversing,"" said Pantheon Macroeconomics' Claus Vistesen in a note to clients, although he acknowledged that national surveys of business confidence from Germany and France were stronger than IHS Markit's PMIs had suggested earlier this week.
In corporate news,  Aviva  (LON:AV) stock climbed 2% after Reuters reported that the U.K. insurer was in talks with a consortium of Allianz (DE:ALVG) and life insurer Athora over Aviva’s French unit.
 Boohoo  (LON:BOOH) stock soared 16% after an independent probe into the U.K. retailer supply chain found “many failings”, but it was absolved from allegations that it deliberately allowed poor working conditions and low pay.
BMW (DE:BMWG) fell 0.2% after the German luxury car maker agreed to pay $18 million to settle claims in the U.S. that it had disclosed misleading sales figures. 
On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.2% higher, theS&P 500 gained 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4%, helped by talk that Democrats in the House of Representatives were working on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that could be voted on next week.
Oil prices edged higher amid renewed hopes for more stimulus measures to boost the U.S. economy. However, persistent concerns over demand growth are likely to result in a losing week for the oil complex.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $40.41 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.4% to $42.11. Brent is heading for a drop of over 2% this week, while U.S. crude is on track for a decline of around 1.5%.

859,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>",GM energizes China line-up with electric micro car,"By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - When 32-year-old photographer Jaco Xu needed a run-around car for work in the eastern city of Hangzhou, the price tag on the latest micro EV from GM's (N:GM) China joint venture overcame his qualms about electric vehicles.
Xu paid 38,800 yuan ($5,735) for his tiny two-door Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV, while the basic model retails for just 28,800 yuan ($4,200), making it China's cheapest EV.
""It feels pretty good. The price is so low and the appearance is simple and beautiful,"" said Xu. ""Why would I hesitate at that price?""
Launched in July, the Wuling MINI is heading a trend towards a new segment of EVs in China following changes to government subsidies - smaller vehicles with less range between charges, but a super-cheap price tag.
Despite basic features - no safety air bags, optional air-conditioning and a driving range of less than 200 km (125 miles) due to a smaller battery - buyers have been enthusiastic.
SGMW, GM's venture with partners SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104) and Guangxi Automobile Group, sold about 15,000 of the vehicles in August, making it China's top-selling EV for the month, surpassing Tesla's (O:TSLA) popular Model 3.
The venture plans to expand manufacturing capabilities of the new model, turning out cars at its plant in Liuzhou as well as its existing facilities in Qingdao, said Zhou Xing, SGMW's branding and marketing director.
""We positioned this model as a 'people's commuting tool',"" he said, speaking ahead of the Beijing auto show which starts on Saturday. ""Customers can drive their cars to work every day.""
The target market includes people like Xu who are looking for a city-run around as a second car, rural buyers who want a vehicle to move goods and young first-time buyers who are motivated by price.
NEW SEGMENT
Total sales of new energy vehicles -- including electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles -- are expected to reach 1.1 million vehicles in China this year, about 5% of total auto sales.
The micro car represents a shift in what typifies a mainstream electric vehicle, as policymakers push for increased EV production and sales have been bolstered by restrictions on petrol-fuelled cars.
In response to government requirements to win generous EV subsidies, automakers over the past decade have developed higher energy-density battery systems to allow cars to drive for longer with a single charge.
Tesla's Model 3, which has a range of over 400 km, has been the market leader in China for most of 2020, retailing for about $43,000, about 10 times the cost of the Wuling MINI. 
However, China cut subsidies heavily in 2019 and is now asking for higher EV power efficiency to save energy. Automakers, in turn, are planning more smaller EVs with a moderate driving range aimed at customers who can charge cars easily, industry executives said.
The economics are skinny. Wuling MINI will not get EV subsidies due to its short range. For SGMW, the cheap price tag means it makes very little money at best, according to insiders familiar with the matter.
EVs, however, generate green credits for SGMW that can be used to offset negative credits of other companies like SGM, its sister venture which is expanding a lineup of bigger SUVs under Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac marques.
""Selling micro EVs in China makes more sense this year,"" said a product planning official at a GM rival.
""Subsidies have become a less important factor of pricing as government has already cut a lot, while green credits are expected to become more expensive,"" the official said.
MICRO FOCUS
Bidding to reverse a sales decline due to a slower economy and stiff competition, GM expects EVs to make up more than 40% of its new launches in China over the next five years.
The Detroit automaker is revamping plants in Shanghai, Wuhan and Liuzhou under its two Chinese JVs to enable production lines making gasoline cars to turn out EVs, public documents detailing its constructions plans show.
For now, the Wuling MINI is the cheapest EV, but it faces competition from the cheapest models from rivals BYD (SZ:002594) and BAIC BluePark (SS:600733).
Great Wall Motor (SS:601633) and Toyota's (T:7203) China partner GAC (SS:601238) are also planning more electric models with a range below 400 km, company officials said this month.
And startup Kaiyun Motors is trying to radically lower the price of its new electric pickup truck Pixel to around 20,000 yuan for urban delivery services, although these EVs will be sold without batteries, allowing consumers to swap them.

""China is a huge market, any product with clear positioning can attract enough customers to survive,"" said Kaiyun founder Wang Chao.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: AstraZeneca gets partial immunity in low-cost EU vaccine deal,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European governments will pay claims above an agreed limit against AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) over side-effects from its potential COVID-19 vaccine, under different terms to a deal struck with  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY), an EU official told Reuters.
The deals reflect different strategies by two of the world's top drugmakers for protecting themselves as a debate rages about liabilities for vaccines aimed at ending the pandemic.
AstraZeneca (L:AZN) has secured the European Union's backing in a confidential agreement which reflects the lower price sought by the British drugmaker, the official said.
""If a company asks for a higher price we don't give the same conditions,"" said the official, who was involved in the talks but declined to be identified as the contracts are confidential.
Unexpected side-effects after a drug has regulatory approval are rare, but the speed at which a COVID-19 vaccine is being pursued increases the risks of unforeseen conditions. 
The deal with AstraZeneca, which shifts some of the risks involved in the roll-out of a vaccine to taxpayers, was struck in August and its liability clauses have not previously been reported.
Under the deal, AstraZeneca would only pay legal costs up to a certain threshold, the official said, declining to elaborate on how the costs would be shared with individual European governments or the cap. 
The financial shield would cover both legal costs and potential compensation, which is rarer but potentially a much bigger outlay in the event of something going wrong.
In return for the higher price paid for its vaccine, French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY), which is working with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) as a partner, did not get any liability waiver.
Spokespeople for AstraZeneca, Sanofi and the European Commission declined to comment on the specifics of the deals. 
When asked about AstraZeneca's relatively low price, a spokesman reiterated the company's pledge to share the vaccine widely and not to turn a profit from it during the pandemic. 
Under the AstraZeneca deal, EU countries have agreed to pay 2.5 euros ($2.92) per dose, while Sanofi has negotiated a price at around 10 euros, the official said.
SIDE-EFFECTS
As part of the supply deals, the only two sealed so far by Brussels, the EU has also made a non-refundable downpayment of 336 million euros to AstraZeneca to secure 400 million doses, proportionately lower than the 324 million euros it paid to Sanofi to secure 300 million doses.
The EU official told Reuters that the contract with AstraZeneca included a narrow definition of side-effects that could limit the possibility of claiming compensation although the company remains liable for its vaccine.
The deal with AstraZeneca was negotiated before it paused late-stage trials of its vaccine candidate this month after a British volunteer developed neurological symptoms. Trials have resumed in Britain but not in the United States.
EU governments would share compensation costs only if unexpected side-effects emerged after the AstraZeneca vaccine was approved. 
Liability has been a key stumbling block in talks with other COVID-19 vaccine makers, EU officials have said, as companies fear they risk larger legal costs than they usually face when vaccines are developed in much longer trials.
A European Commission spokesman said advance purchase deals ""provide for member states to indemnify the manufacturer for certain liabilities incurred under specific and strict conditions"", but ""liability still remains with the companies"".
This means it would be the firm's responsibility to defend its shot in the courts. 
Drugmakers have called on EU regulators to set up a Europe-wide compensation scheme, while patients' organisations are calling for an EU-wide fund financed by pharmaceutical firms that would compensate for unexpected side-effects. 
The EU legal regime is among the least favourable to drugmakers on compensation claims, although plaintiffs have rarely managed to win as the law requires them to prove the link between an illness and a vaccine that may have caused it.
The United States has granted immunity from liability for COVID-19 vaccines that receive regulatory approval.

Meanwhile, Russia has said it would shoulder some of the legal liability should anything go wrong with the vaccine developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Friday morning, reversing some losses from the previous Asian session. The offshore yuan was boosted by FTSE Russell’s inclusion of Chinese government bonds in its World Government Bond (WGBI) index, but gains were capped by the continuous uncertainty over the latest U.S. stimulus measures.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.03%, reversing earlier gains, by 11:20 PM ET (3:20 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.34%. Although FTSE Russell’s announcement saw the yuan push higher, investors are also watching China Evergrande, which warned that it faces a potential default that could potentially rock the Chinese financial system should its application for a stock exchange listing not be approved.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.30%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 225 rose 0.62% and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.77%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 climbed 1.34%. The state of Victoria is looking to lift lockdown measures as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to decrease, reporting only 14 new cases over the past 24 hours on Friday.
Investor sentiment was also boosted over a potential $2.2 trillion stimulus package that could be voted on next week, as well as suggestions that House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin could resume talks over the measures. But hopes that the U.S. Congress would reach a consensus remained low as there were reportedly only small differences from the Democrats’ previous offer.
“The odds of Phase 4 stimulus are a close call … while still possible, there is a high risk that it does not happen this year. Without it, we would expect the economy to hit a major speed bump in Q4,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) LLC chief economist Aneta Markowska said in a note.
Data released on Thursday also showed that 870,000 Americans, more than expected, claimed unemployment during the previous week and indicating a slowdown in economic recovery, leading  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) economists to cut their forecast for U.S. growth in the fourth quarter.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also reiterated that “it’s likely that additional fiscal support will be needed,” during his testimony before the Senate on the economic response to COVID-19. But Fed Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard was more optimistic, predicting that the economy could be close to a “full recovery” by the end of the year. The risk of a disputed U.S. presidential election in November also increased with President Donald Trump’s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he fail to be re-elected.
Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in Europe continue to increase, with the U.K. and France reporting a record number of cases over a 24-hour period on Thursday. The number of U.S. cases is almost at the 7 million-mark, while there are over 32 million cases globally as of September 25, according to Johns Hopkins University data."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Top asset managers Vanguard Group Inc and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) on Thursday introduced new exchange-traded funds that exclude oil companies, coal producers and other industries that a growing number of investors want to avoid.
The so-called ESG funds use environmental, social or governance criteria to pick investments.
""In our conversations clients continuously bring up the topic,"" said Rich Powers, head of ETF product management for Vanguard, the largest mutual fund company with $6.6 trillion under management.
Researcher Morningstar Inc found flows into such funds reached a record pace this year, taking in $20.9 billion through June, just shy of the annual record of $21.4 billion for all of 2019.
The demand partly reflects the performance of the funds, which has often topped traditional investment products this year. That was despite many funds being held back by strategies such as not owning high-performing energy stocks, as second-quarter results showed.
The Vanguard ESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF, the company's first fixed income offering in the sector, will track the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) MSCI U.S. Corporate Select Index, which excludes oil and gas, alcohol and civilian firearms companies.
Previously the manager launched ESG equity products including the Vanguard ESG US Stock ETF, now with about $2 billion in assets.
BlackRock, with $7 trillion in total assets, will offer three ESG stock funds that recreate exposure to S&P indexes of large, mid-cap and small-cap companies.

The warehouse chain spent about $281 million on employee bonuses and sanitizing its warehouses in the fourth quarter, mirroring a trend of rising costs across U.S. retailers during the health crisis.
Costco had estimated in May that COVID-19-realted costs would exceed $100 million, but would be lower than the $283 million incurred in the prior quarter. 
""$281 million is over $100 million but quite a bit larger,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on an earnings call.
The company cited the $2-an-hour premium paid to employees as a factor for the jump in costs. The bonus costs Costco $14 million a week.
""We've committed to doing that at least through, I believe, the first eight weeks of this fiscal quarter,"" Galanti said.
Several U.S. retailers, including  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), have come under fire for stopping hazard pay for their workers. 
Higher demand for fresh produce, appliances and gardening and sporting goods helped Costco's total revenue climb 12.4% to $53.38 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 30, beating the average estimate of $52.08 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
Traffic at the warehouse chain, where customers typically buy items in bulk at lower prices, also ticked up in the quarter, after declining about 20% in April, as COVID-19 restrictions eased and it brought back food samples.
Revenue from memberships rose 5.3% to $1.11 billion, while online sales nearly doubled.

Excluding items, Costco earned $3.04 per share, beating estimates of $2.84.

The settlement has been approved by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association but still requires approval by its 36 member companies, such as Anthem Inc and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield in New York.
It would also require approval by U.S. District Judge David Proctor in Birmingham, Alabama, who has overseen related nationwide litigation since 2013.
In a statement, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association declined to comment, while saying it remained committed to improving the health of its members and local communities. The Wall Street Journal reported the settlement earlier on Thursday.
The case had been brought on behalf of more than 1 million individual and corporate policyholders, whose policies covered tens of millions of Americans.
They alleged that the member companies violated the Sherman Act and other antitrust laws by, among other things, dividing up health insurance markets to avoid competing with each other.
Blue Cross Blue Shield said its member companies cover more than 109 million Americans, or roughly one-third of the U.S. population, including at major employers such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
The Journal said the proposed settlement would drop a rule that two-thirds of each Blue Cross Blue Shield company's national revenue from health plans and related services come from Blue-branded businesses.
It said the accord would also relax rules requiring national employers seeking coverage to work through Blue insurers covering where their headquarters are located, effectively giving some smaller one-state insurers a hold on major clients.

Stocks also reacted positively to news of efforts to enact further stimulus in Washington, helping lift the S&P to a session high, although the index then turned negative before retracing some gains. 
Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) <.FB.O>, stocks that have outperformed at a time of increased economic uncertainty, all rose. 
The wild session indicated caution was in store, said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC, who warned market sentiment that drove momentum has sharply changed.
""Fear of missing out has turned into to fear of losing actual money,"" Dick said. ""This is a shakeout of all the Robinhood traders, a shakeout of retail investors. They're getting punished, and rightfully so, because you can't just buy stocks out of a hat thinking stocks only go up.""
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are working on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that could be voted on next week, a key lawmaker said, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated she is ready to negotiate with the White House.
Wall Street started the day lower after the jobless claims data. The S&P 500 briefly fell 10% below the intraday record peak it hit Sept. 2 for the second time in recent days.
Dow constituents, considered a barometer of economic confidence, lagged the S&P 500 as data showed 870,000 Americans applied for jobless benefits in the week ended Sept. 19, up from 866,000 in the previous week.

Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), said notwithstanding spats of poor data, the U.S. economy is on a path to a powerful V-shaped recovery as seen in auto sales, the housing market and overall consumer spending.

The CBOE volatility index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge and which is hovering near two-week highs, is expected to climb in the run-up to the quarter-end next week.
""The key is the VIX index, which has not yet reached levels that would suggest a continued strong move to the downside,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

Investing.com – The Dow ended higher Thursday, but investors had to contend with topsy-turvy trading as markets struggled for direction.
Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.20% or 52 points. The S&P 500 was 0.29%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%.
The rally in tech lost some steam as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) eased from session highs, though both were up 1%. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were roughly unchanged. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was flat.
Investor sentiment on stocks was also boosted by signs U.S. lawmakers are still seeking to get a deal done on further stimulus before the election.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reportedly plans to resume talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to iron out differences on a fresh round of stimulus to boost the economy. The Democrats are preparing a $2.4 trillion package that would include unemployment benefits, small business loans, and support for airlines, CNBC reported. The bill could be voted on as early as next week.
Sectors tied to the progress of the economy such as industrials and financials also found their footing.
Financials were pushed higher by a 5% jump in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) after UBS upgraded its rating on the stock to buy from neutral, citing opportunity ahead for higher trading revenue. UBS suggested a closely fought U.S. presidential election could trigger volatility, boosting Goldman's trading revenue.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) all traded higher, with the latter up more than 2%.
On the economic front, the latest jobs data showed an expected rise in weekly jobless claims, but analysts played down the importance of the headline number.

Investing.com -- Markets seesawed on Thursday, with stimulus alternately on and off the table and the virus looming large across the Atlantic.
U.S. lawmakers -- seemingly heeding repeated pleas from a bevy of Fed speakers all week -- are trying to resume talks on stimulus, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reportedly plans to do just that with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to iron out differences on a fresh round of stimulus to boost the economy. The Democrats are reportedly set to announce a $2.4 trillion bill, which does not have Republican support, Politico said.
On Wall Street, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) helped lead a rebound in tech, while electric vehicle maker Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) got its first sell rating. Financials recuperated some. Markets gave back healthy gains late in the day after the U.K. and France both reported record numbers of new coronavirus cases.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Markets face another down week
Stocks are poised to end yet another week in the red, depending on how things go Friday. September has seen the S&P 500 post back-to-back-to-back down weeks, during which time it's dropped nearly 7%.
The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has fared even worse, giving back more than 10%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off more than 5%.
2. Fed speech frenzy comes to an end
If you haven't yet had your fill of Fed speakers this week (hard to believe that's possible considering, by our count, there have been 22 separate occasions), New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) is up yet again. He's already spoken twice this week. This time he's holding a conference call with community development and nonprofit leaders from the Rochester, N.Y., area and talking to young adults about the job market in the age of Covid.
3. Durable goods orders
We'll get a look at how U.S. factories are contributing to any economic rebound with the preliminary number for durable goods for August at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Consensus calls for a mild 1.4% gain, a big comedown from the massive 11.4% jump the previous month.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",'Healthy correction' or something more? Stock swings keep investors on edge,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A barrage of worrisome news is rocking the U.S. stock market after a nearly six-month surge, leading some investors to question whether the recent selloff in equities heralds a longer period of volatility.
The S&P 500 index was on the verge of a correction, defined as a 10% drop from its all-time closing high, after ending 9.6% below its Sept. 2 record on Wednesday. The benchmark index was higher in Thursday afternoon trade after shuffling between gains and losses earlier in the session.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) confirmed a swift correction earlier this month, and remained down more than 10% from its Sept. 2 high even as the index was rising on Thursday.
The rapid selloff has occurred amid fading hopes of further coronavirus-related fiscal stimulus from Congress, looming political uncertainty over the U.S. presidential election and fears of a COVID-19 resurgence in the fall. 
""The action that we have seen this week makes me less confident that this is a healthy correction,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. 
Falling from peaks: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/SELLOFF/rlgvdjjgzvo/chart.png
One source of unease has been the failure of lawmakers to agree on further fiscal stimulus to help the U.S. economy recover from coronavirus-fueled shutdowns earlier this year, despite Federal Reserve officials' repeated calls for more aid. 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut their forecast for fourth-quarter growth in gross domestic product (GDP) to 3% from 6%, based on an apparent lack of further fiscal support, which they said would reduce disposable income and weigh on consumer spending. 
""The lack of stimulus, the uptick in coronavirus cases, the tension coming out of D.C. overall lends to an environment that is going to be a little bit harder for stocks to remain relatively sanguine through,"" Delwiche said.
Earlier this month, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Executive Vice Chairman Tony James warned on CNBC that this could be a ""lost decade"" for equity returns as companies struggle to grow their earnings.
During the recent selloff, the focus has centered on large technology and growth stocks that have carried the market for much of the year, but have also been hit harder this month. 
The S&P 500 technology sector (SPLRCT) had fallen 12.8% from the market's Sept. 2 high as of Wednesday, while Amazon (O:AMZN) and Netflix (O:NFLX) each had declined about 15% over that time.
Tech stocks lead on the way up - and down: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/SELLOFF/dgkplbbglpb/chart.png
September has marked a reversal in stock market trends that have persisted for much of 2020. Without the performance of the tech sector, as well as Amazon and Netflix, the S&P 500 would have lost more than 9% of its market value as of Wednesday, as opposed to a 0.2% gain for the year, according to Refinitiv data.

The concentration of the S&P 500's weighting in a handful of stocks has been a consistent theme worrying investors.
Since the end of 2018, the S&P 500 is up 29% and five ""FAAMG"" stocks - Facebook (O:FB), Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) - are responsible for half of that gain, Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in a note Wednesday night.
Even with the recent swoon, the stock market's valuation remains relatively high, with the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio recently revisiting levels not seen since the dot-com bubble two decades ago. 
S&P 500 valuation revisits dot-com levels: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxqqwrvx/Pasted%20image%201600957514982.png
Some investors remain unconcerned about the comparatively high multiples of many stocks.
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) rises in valuation tend to occur during early cycle recoveries and are also being driven by the Federal Reserve's easing programs, Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro in Fidelity's global asset allocation division, said in a recent commentary. 

""P/E ratios will undoubtedly come back down to earth at some point, but as long as earnings start to recover soon it does not need to be at the expense of price,"" Timmer wrote.

(Reuters) - Attorneys for  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) and consumers suing the company over allegations its Roundup weedkiller caused cancer told a judge on Thursday they are continuing to resolve thousands more cases, improving prospects for its $11 billion deal to end the litigation.
The hearing was a contrast to the contentious tone among the parties last month that raised concerns the framework deal might unravel.
Ken Feinberg, who is mediating talks, said his ""optimism knows no bounds,"" and that he expected the next set of cases scheduled for trial to soon settle.
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco kept a stay on litigation until Nov. 2 and asked the parties for a status update at that time.
The parties have binding deals to resolve about 45,000 of the 125,000 filed and unfiled claims, according to attorneys involved. Settlements have been reached with each of the lawyers who took cases to trial.
Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), which acquired Roundup with its purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion in 2018, agreed in June to pay around $11 billion to settle the lawsuits, which have pummeled the company's share price. 
Bayer's stock closed down 1% on Thursday at 54.41 euros. Shares have slumped from a high of around 73 euros since the June settlement announcement.
Chhabria had questioned the fairness of the settlement plan, which proposed using an independent scientific panel to assess whether glyphosate-based weedkillers such as Roundup caused cancer.
Days later, Bayer said it would revise that part of the proposal.
Bayer has said Roundup is safe and important to farmers who use the herbicide in combination with the company's genetically modified seeds.

In 2015, the World Health Organization's cancer research arm determined the herbicide to be a ""probable carcinogen."" U.S. and the European regulators have determined glyphosate to be non-carcinogenic.

Prosecutors unintentionally misled a grand jury by claiming another firm, unlike Arkema, moved its hazardous chemicals when presented with the threat of flooding, Texas Judge Belinda Hill said in court on Thursday, allowing the trial to proceed. Defense attorneys had argued the grand jury testimony was part of a pattern of misconduct that tainted the case. 
The company's Crosby, Texas, plant became waterlogged and lost power needed to cool organic peroxide chemicals after Hurricane Harvey dumped more than 50 inches of rain on the area in 2017. The untended chemicals caught fire and burned for days, injuring 21 safety workers and forcing residents from their homes. 
Arkema and its U.S. chief executive, Richard Rowe, and former plant manager Leslie Comardelle face felony charges for the pollution released by the chemical blaze. The company faces up to a $1 million fine and the executives could receive up to five years in prison. 
The trial resumed after being suspended in the spring due to the pandemic. Judge Hill plans to release her findings on the misconduct at a later time, according to a person familiar with the matter. Earlier this year, she sanctioned prosecutors for withholding other evidence beneficial to the defense. 
Prosecutors this month agreed to drop separate assault charges against the company and a third executive over smoke inhalation injuries suffered by public safety workers assigned to guard the plant. 

Arkema maintains the case wrongly turns a flooding disaster into a criminal case.

The probe comes after nine Sudanese plaintiffs, who said they have been victims of rights abuses by ousted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's former government of Sudan, filed a legal complaint last year against BNP Paribas.
The plaintiffs allege the French bank was complicit in crimes against humanity because it provided financial services for the Sudanese government.
They argue that in a U.S. sanctions violations case the U.S. Department of Justice described BNP Paribas as Sudan's de facto central bank from 1997 to 2007 because it gave the Sudanese government access to international money markets, and the means to pay staff, the military and security forces.
Conflict in Sudan's Darfur region ignited in 2003 where Sudanese forces waged a campaign of violence that killed more than 300,000 people.
The International Criminal Court in The Hague has since characterized the campaign as war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.
Bashir was indicted by the International Criminal Court in 2009 and 2010 for crimes against humanity.
""This is what we were waiting for. We filed this complaint a year ago against the bank for complicity in genocide and crimes against humanity,"" Clemence Bectarte, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said.
FIDH said on Twitter it helped the plaintiffs to file the complaint.
BNP Paribas said the bank had no information regarding the proceedings and was therefore not in a position to comment.
The Paris prosecutors' office didn't respond to requests for comment. 

Earlier in 2017, French judicial investigators opened a full-scale inquiry into allegations of complicity in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In that case BNP Paribas is accused by non-governmental organisations of complicity over a transfer of $1.3 million to an arms dealer.

879,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",French billionaire Arnault builds up Lagardere holding,"By Sarah White and Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS (Reuters) - France's richest man Bernard Arnault ratcheted up a tug-of-war over Paris Match publisher Lagardere on Thursday, revealing he had built up a direct stake in the firm, which is under siege from several other investors. 
Loss-making Lagardere has become the unlikely target of a proxy battle between some of France's top businessmen, after the firm's managers sought help to fend off a campaign by activist investor Amber Capital to shake up the company's governance. 
New investors came on board as a result, including Vincent Bollore, another French billionaire who controls media firm Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY). 
But the new array of shareholders are now at odds over Lagardere's strategy, and the spat has fuelled speculation that Bollore and Arnault, who runs luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, will want to vie for some of its assets, which include publishing house Hachette and a travel retail division. 
Arnault said on Thursday that his family holding company now owned more than 5% of Lagardere, and that he was committed to the integrity of the group's main activities.
Arnault has also invested in the vehicle through which Lagardere's Chief Executive, Arnaud Lagardere, controls the firm and said the two, with a 12.8% holding between them, would act in concert.
While Vivendi has recently built up a 23% stake, and has teamed up with Amber, a 20% stakeholder, in a bid to be awarded board seats, Arnaud Lagardere exerts great sway over the company as his stake is held through an unusual ""commandite"" structure that gives him veto powers on many decisions. 
A spokesman for Vivendi said on Thursday the firm was ""very happy"" that Bernard Arnault had become a direct Lagardere shareholder. 
COURT BATTLE
Bollore initially rode to Arnaud Lagardere's rescue earlier this year to help him fight off Amber, but the mood soured after it emerged Bernard Arnault would also get involved, people close to the matter have said. 
Vivendi and Amber have now gone to court to try and trigger a swift shareholder meeting to change the group's governance. Its supervisory board unexpectedly renewed Arnaud Lagardere's mandate as CEO months ahead of schedule in August. 
""It's a company that's managed only in the interest of one person and those close to him,"" Amber's managing partner Joseph Oughourlian said on the sidelines of a court hearing on the case on Thursday. 
Lagardere's lawyers Florian Bouaziz and Didier Malka brushed off accusations of a lack of independence of the board, saying that Vivendi had initially voted for the renewal of the current one and against Amber. 

The court will rule on the shareholder meeting request on Oct. 14.

880,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>",Can’t-Lose Trades Falter With Inflation Expectations Flagging,"(Bloomberg) -- Inflation, dormant for a decade, captured the market’s attention all summer, with unprecedented Federal Reserve stimulus and a $2 trillion federal spending package set to juice prices.
The fever, it appears, has now passed.
Popular trades that couldn’t lose for months have started to come undone. Growth stocks have plunged more than 13% in three weeks. Gold’s rally to an all-time high has reversed, and the dollar is strengthening again after a bout of weakness that had some questioning its status as a reserve currency. Bond traders who for months bet that inflation would return to pre-crisis levels now expect it to fall short of Federal Reserve targets.
The sustained economic recovery that was going to bring a demand boom and usher in a new age of rising prices is now no longer a sure thing. Signs emerged that the rebound had become shaky, but Congress was expected to step in with even more money. That prospect dimmed Monday after Washington became preoccupied with the Supreme Court fight. Prospects for faster inflation got darker still after a lineup of Fed officials said the central bank alone can’t boost prices and the economy would falter without more aid.
“We’re seeing a tricky, uncertain economic recovery. It’s a deflationary shock,” said Lauren Goodwin, economist and multi-asset portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments. “We are not concerned about inflation over the next several years.”
The question facing markets is, where would it even come from? Global demand remains tepid and in the U.S., bets are now that Congress will remain on the sidelines until at least after the November presidential election, though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin signaled he’s willing to open negotiations with Democratic leaders. The Fed said it will sustain asset purchases, but didn’t commit to increasing them if the economy starts to weaken.
Inflation Breakevens
Doubt over the Fed’s ability to push price gains to 2% is most evident in bond-market gauges for inflation. Ten-year breakeven rates, derived from yields on standard and inflation-linked Treasuries, have plunged this month after rising steadily since March. The measure is now at 1.58%, down from 1.82% at the start of September, meaning investors don’t see the Fed really hitting its target for the next 10 years.
Moreover, the Treasury-linked measures of inflation are based on expectations for gains in consumer prices, which themselves normally run about 30 basis points above the Fed’s preferred measure -- putting the central bank’s target even further out of reach.
Yield Curve
Traders are also pulling back from one of this year’s favored reflation wagers, bets that rates on longer-dated Treasuries will rise more than those on shorter-dated bonds. A steeper yield curve would come about when investors demand more return on Treasuries that could lose value if inflation picks up with economic activity.
After the gap between 5- and 30-year yields widened to 129 basis points in early June as Fed largess and federal spending sparked a jump in economic activity, the spread has narrowed to about 113 basis points. Short-term yields remained pinned below 1% as the Fed commits to its emergency easing, but long-term yields haven’t pushed higher.
U.S. Dollar
The dollar has been a beneficiary in the recalibration of inflation expectations, reclaiming its safe-haven currency status. Investors pile into the greenback in times of stress because it is most likely to maintain its value relative to currencies that fluctuate more closely with global economic activity. After falling to the lowest level in two years, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index just rose four straight days. The gauge is now trading at the highest level in two months.
Precious Metals
Precious metals, used to guard against rising prices, have suffered. It was just last month that gold prices rose to an all-time high, as investors flocked to the yellow metal amid growing expectations for a pickup in inflation. Now, that trade is unwinding as projections for higher price pressures dwindle. Spot gold has fallen about 10% since peaking in early August, and now trades around $1,860 an ounce. At one point this week, it was on track for its worst streak since March.
Copper
The dollar’s strength is a problem for commodities that are denominated in the American currency. In particular, it’s hurt industrial metals like copper. Often seen as being closely intertwined with growth and thereby deemed “Doctor Copper” for its economic prescience, the commodity has plunged almost 6% this week after rising 47% since March.
Stocks Stumble
The decline in inflation expectations and consequential uptick in real rates -- jargon for yields after accounting for inflation -- is weighing heavily on equities. A measure of 10-year U.S. real yields bottomed at the start of September. The stock market took notice, with benchmarks topping out on Sept. 2.
Since, the Nasdaq 100 has fallen more than 13%. The S&P 500 is down almost 10% from a record -- the threshold that classically defines a correction. And while megacap tech led the selloff earlier in September, small caps have taken the lead more recently. The Russell 2000 small-cap gauge is down 6% this week, compared to a drop of less than 1% for the Nasdaq 100.
Credit
The corporate bond market has also come under pressure in recent trading sessions, signaling that the equity selloff may be more so related to the fundamental growth outlook. The Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global High Yield Index flipped to an annual loss this week, and investors have been pulling cash from exchange-traded funds that track high-yield debt.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission's plan to fence off the EU's industrial crown jewels from state-backed foreign buyers may breach WTO rules, while its ambiguous standards create legal uncertainties, lobbying group the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU said in its feedback on the proposal.
The European Union's executive laid out its plan in June, saying new measures were needed because existing foreign direct investment screening rules and trade defence measures were not enough to ward off a potential post-coronavirus buying spree of cheap assets.
It subsequently gave companies and other interested parties until Sept. 23 to provide feedback before deciding on legislation.
""The new legal tools proposed in the white paper lack a clear legal basis under EU treaties, will overlap with a number of existing EU and member states' instruments, and produce 'double standards' in their enforcement,"" the Chamber said. 
""The proposed legal tools could also potentially be incompatible with the EU's WTO obligations including principles such as national treatment, most favoured nation status, and non-discrimination,"" it said.
Brussels-based CCCEU has up to 70 members and chambers in EU member states, covering about 1,000 Chinese companies in the EU.
It said a proposed threshold of 200,000 euros in subsidies received by companies over three years that has to be reported to the Commission should be higher to ""achieve substantive justice"".
The Commission should also take into account Chinese investments in Europe that followed invitations by some EU countries in the wake of the European debt crisis, the Chamber said.
""The favourable terms they enjoyed at the time should be legitimately protected and exempted from future scrutiny,"" it said.

Scholz said he welcomed the European Commission's latest proposals for the regulation of crypto-assets and their underlying blockchain technology, used in private sector projects such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s Libra stablecoin.
""These are important proposals to make Europe's financial sector really strong. My goal is to move the discussions forward quickly,"" Scholz said, adding that this also applied to the Commission's proposal for expanding the bloc's capital market.
As Germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the 27-member bloc, Scholz said he would put both reform packages on the agenda of the next EU finance ministers meeting on Oct 6.
""With the package we can promote innovations in the financial sector so that Europe sets standards worldwide,"" Scholz said.
Scholz added that the proposals to deepen the capital market could help the region recover more quickly from the coronavirus shock.
""In order to get out of the crisis with full power, small and medium-sized companies in particular need good access to capital market financing,"" he said.
The European Commission on Thursday set out plans to create what its officials described as the world's most comprehensive set of rules for crypto-assets and their underlying blockchain technology.

EU policymakers have said that Facebook should not be allowed to launch its Libra stablecoin - a cryptocurrency designed to have reduced price volatility - in the bloc until proper rules are in place.

Fashion firms have made a public push in recent years to show their environmentally-friendly credentials, switching away from some materials used in clothing or handbags or trying to improve their energy sourcing in stores. 
A handful are now exploring new financing avenues to back their push towards more stringent goals in areas such as carbon emissions. ""Sustainability-linked bonds"" are tied to targets at the company-wide level, in contrast to green bonds, which fund specific projects. 
The five- and 10-year deals issued by privately-owned Chanel, which only began to publish annual earnings in 2017, marked its first incursion into the bond market, Financial Chief Philippe Blondiaux said. 
Some proceeds may be used for investments including in startups developing alternatives to plastics or leather. 
According to the deal structure, Chanel will also have to pay a premium when the bonds mature if it does not meet certain goals on cutting emissions within the firm and its supply chain. 
Chanel could tap the market again, Blondiaux said, adding that the company's future financing strategy would be in the format of sustainable bonds.
""It's a logical step...we're making (the financing strategy) consistent with the company strategy, which is centered around travelling to a more sustainable model,"" he said. 
Chanel received 600 million euros of investor demand for the shorter-dated 300 million-euro bond, which priced with a yield of 0.548%, and 750 million euros of demand for the longer-dated bond, which priced to yield 1.059%, a lead manager on the deal said.

(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday overturned a judge's approval of a novel plan by lawyers representing cities and counties suing drug companies over the U.S. opioid crisis that would bring every community nationally into their settlement talks.
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by a 2-1 vote declined to approve an unprecedented ""negotiation class"" of 33,000 cities, towns and counties who could have a vote on whether to accept any settlements proposed with drug manufacturers and distributors.
U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, who oversees 2,900 opioid lawsuits, approved the framework last year to promote a global settlement.
It would allow cities and counties that have not sued to participate in settlement talks. Any settlement would need to win support of at least 75% of class members to be approved.
While companies do not have to use the negotiation class to settle cases, many including the drug distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp objected.
Many state attorneys general, who have cases against the companies not before Polster, also objected, arguing the ruling could complicate their own settlement talks and interfere with states' rights over their political subdivisions.
U.S. Circuit Judge Eric Clay said the federal rule that allows for class actions to jointly litigate cases does not authorize what Polster approved.
""However well-intentioned the district court’s actions might be, the fact of the matter is that the court, when it certified the negotiation class, exercised power it did not have,"" he wrote.
The plaintiffs' lawyers and companies did not immediately comment.
Some companies have proposed deals that do not use the framework including the three distributors and drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, who in October 2019 proposed deals worth a collective $48 billion.
Negotiations are ongoing and dollar amounts have been shifting.

890,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",Carney backs call for climate risk to be baked into company financial accounts,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - United Nations climate envoy Mark Carney on Thursday threw his weight behind a growing push by investors for companies to more accurately reflect climate-related risks in their financial accounts.
Such risks can range from physical dangers such as water levels rising and destroying factories, to new regulations putting a higher price on carbon emissions, for example, which could render products and services redundant or in need of new pricing, impacting profits and contingent liabilities.
Already this year, leading oil majors including BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) have written down the value of their assets after revising long-term oil price assumptions, which underpin decisions such as capital expenditure and impairments, and investors are now calling on the process to be expanded to all companies.
Last week, investor groups representing more than $103 trillion in assets wrote an open letter calling on companies and auditors to follow guidance from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) released last year. 
That statement, in the form of an IASB 'opinion', made clear that factoring climate risks into company accounts is already required within the existing rules, if relevant and material, even though most companies have yet to do so.
Specifically, the investor groups, which include the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, said companies needed to explain the key assumptions made with regard to climate risk and make sure they are compatible with the goals of the Paris climate agreement.
Auditors, meanwhile, needed to only sign off accounts that were consistent with the IASB opinion in ""letter and spirit"". Regulators and civil society then needed to support the implementation of the opinion.
Speaking at a UN PRI webinar on Thursday, Carney, who has long championed the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures - a framework to help companies assess and manage the risks of climate change - said the conclusions also needed to be reflected in company profit and loss statements.
""It's recognising that when climate change risks are considered material that, just as any other financial risk, there should be disclosures included.""

891,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 11:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Airbus to hold jet output stable in face of crisis warnings - sources,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is set to reaffirm its main aircraft production rates, despite warnings that the coronavirus crisis will be deeper and longer than first expected, industry sources told Reuters on Thursday.
After cutting output of its best-selling A320neo single-aisle jet at the start of the crisis, the European planemaker has subjected its targets to a fresh internal review as a second wave of COVID-19 prompts new government restrictions in Europe.
But although it has prepared a fallback scenario for further trimming its monthly output of 40 A320neos, down from 60 before the crisis, output is seen holding the line for the time being.
""There are no signs of slowing; the contrary in fact,"" a senior industry source said of the A320neo output.
The preliminary decision is good news for hundreds of suppliers at risk from volatility in output rates. But it puts pressure on Airbus to keep up deliveries and find homes for some 170 jets already waiting for ailing airlines to collect them. 
In a letter to staff last week, Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury warned the crisis was deepening.
Falling demand, combined with billions of dollars of cash tied up in undelivered jets, has prompted a debate on whether to trim production rates by a handful of jets per month.
Although Airbus has expressed confidence in its goals, it had left itself some flexibility after telling staff in May it could make fresh cuts to tackle a second wave.
OUTPUT DILEMMA 
Contributing to pressure for a new cut, around 30 of the jets due in 2021 belong to lessors who have yet to find an airline able to take them, Ascend by Cirium data shows.
Several others do have a home, but questions remain over whether their designated operators will survive the winter.
Airbus has used a mixture of negotiations and legal warnings to keep deliveries relatively buoyant since the crisis began, but those tactics are running their course as airlines face a tough winter without the reserves generated in a normal summer.
""Production rates are too high,"" another senior source said.
Arguments against cutting reflect the stakes involved when jetmakers adjust an already fragile manufacturing base.
The fear is that an order to speed or slow down, even by a few jets a month, could send a whipsaw effect through the supply chain violent enough to drive some small firms out of business. 
Airbus also wants to keep its production system in shape to respond whenever the crisis ends, although there is little relief for wide-body output which has already been revised downwards.
Jet traders say the acid test for Airbus' bid to stabilise output will be whether the majority of cash-starved airlines will be able to find financing for next year's deliveries.

Funds are slowly returning for airlines with the strongest finances, but many airlines are struggling to find support and are seen likely to draw on European government export credits.

The reports, by newspapers Berlingske and Politiken and public broadcaster DR, cited leaked documents from Deutsche Bank obtained by the German daily Suddeutsche Zeitung and later shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). 
The documents appear to show that Deutsche Bank moved around 4 billion Danish crowns ($627 million) in so-called mirror trades through Danske Bank in Lithuania, the Danish outlets reported. 
Deutsche Bank declined to comment, and Danske Bank said it could not comment on specific matters due to ongoing investigations by authorities.
In 2017, Deutsche paid a $425 million fine in the United States over a mirror trading scheme, which moved $10 billion out of Russia between 2011 and 2015.
Mirror trades - for instance, buying Russian stocks in roubles for one client and selling the identical value of securities in U.S. dollars for a related one - are legal, but can create a pipeline for money laundering. 
Authorities in the United States and other countries are currently investigating Deutsche Bank's role in a money laundering scandal in neighbouring Estonia, where 200 billion euros in suspicious payments were made through Danske Bank's branch.
""As we have previously communicated, as a natural consequence of the Estonia case, we are also looking at other parts of our historical business, including in Latvia and Lithuania,"" Danske's Chief Compliance Officer Philippe Vollot said. 
Danske has sold off its Baltic retail banking businesses, but still has administrative back office operations in Lithuania.
Leaked documents known as the FinCEN Files prompted shares in the biggest global banks to drop on Monday after reports by BuzzFeed News and the ICIJ that they had allowed large sums of allegedly illicit funds to move through the financial system.
The reports were based on leaked suspicious activity reports filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
The Lithuanian Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

The living bequest marks the latest dynastic twist at the publisher whose Bild and Welt newspapers became the leading right-wing dailies in postwar West Germany and which last year was taken private.
Friede was founder Axel Springer's fifth wife and, after his death in 1985, she consolidated her control over the business.
She entrusted running the business to Doepfner in 2002 and, in a statement released by the company, said she was now completing the handover.
“I have always said that I will ensure continuity in the company,"" Friede Springer, 78, said.
""I am very happy and grateful to have found my successor in Mathias.""
Under the arrangement, Friede Springer will sell a 4.1% stake to Doepfner and gift 15% more - bringing the 57-year-old executive's direct stake to 22%. She is also transferring voting rights to Doepfner for her remaining 22% in the business.
The handover follows a deal last year to delist Axel Springer from the German stock exchange in which private equity house KKR (N:KKR) bought out minority shareholders, valuing the business at 6.8 billion euros ($7.9 billion).
The valuation on the 4.1% stake sold to Doepfner works out at 276 million euros, based on a KKR filing. Applying a similar benchmark to Friede Springer's gift of stock makes it worth around 1 billion euros.

The partnership with KKR, which owns around 48% of Axel Springer, seeks to invest in its portfolio of digital and media assets without facing the demand for short-term performance typically sought by investors in public equity markets. ($1 = 0.8589 euros)

The company, one of the retailers benefiting from the big shift to online shopping during the health crisis, said it expected seasonal hiring to be on par with last year, when it hired more than 130,000 store employees.
Consumers have been increasingly shopping online and either have items delivered to their homes or collect them at a nearby store as they stay indoors. 
According to a forecast from Deloitte, e-commerce sales are expected to record a 25% to 35% rise in the 2020 holiday season, traditionally the busiest time of the year.
""We're building even more flexibility into our seasonal staffing as we enter into, what is sure to be, an unprecedented holiday shopping season,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters on a briefing call, adding that the company would also offer additional hours of work starting with current staff.
During the first half of the year, more than 10 million consumers shopped on Target's website and demand for same-day fulfillment options quadrupled, the retailer said, leading it to
train more staff in areas that are in demand such as 'drive up and order pickup.'
Distribution centers will send more inventory to stores than usual to make sure in-demand items are well stocked, and to ensure smooth operation the company said it would hire more full-time and seasonal warehouse team members across the country than last year.
Target said it would pay its seasonal staff a starting wage of $15 per hour along with coronavirus health and wellness benefits.

Department store chain Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) also said on Thursday it would hire seasonal staff.

The new plan offers 15 Canadian cents in cash per common share and two warrants with the cash. Alternatively, the shareholders can hold on to their shares and take the two warrants, which could be used to buy shares at 5 Canadian cents per common share over a three year period.
Calfrac's board on Thursday formally rejected the C$26.13 million ($20 million) offer from Wilks Brothers, which owns a near 20% stake in the oilfield services provider and is also a major bondholder.
Wilks Brothers could not be immediately reached for comment.
Calfrac's management in July presented shareholders with a recapitalization deal, which offered a share swap in exchange for debt, to eliminate a massive debt load. 
But the plan met strong opposition from Wilks Brothers, which said the offer ""contains serious flaws"" and leaves the business at a high risk of filing for bankruptcy in the near future.
The investor group, led by oil billionaires Dan and Farris Wilks, has been acquiring stakes in hard-hit U.S. service firms and earlier made two bids for Calfrac's U.S. operations.
Calfrac, which remains in default of $431.8 million to the senior unsecured noteholders, has witnessed a slump in its market value this year due to a collapse in drilling activity fueled by a crash in oil prices amid coronavirus-related lockdowns.
Calfrac on Thursday also postponed its shareholders' meeting to Oct. 16 from Sept. 29, the second time a vote on the rivaling proposals was being delayed, saying it wants to give investors time to consider its new offer.

U.S.-listed shares of BlackBerry, which sells security software to companies and governments as well as infotainment software to carmakers, rose 6% in early morning trade.
BlackBerry's QNX car software sales, which had been under pressure due to a pandemic-related weakness in the U.S. auto industry, also improved in the quarter. Demand for new vehicles has been recovering after hitting a bottom in April, as lockdown restrictions ease and buyers return.
""Some signs of recovery in auto production point to sequential revenue growth and a return to a normal run rate for QNX by early next year,"" Chief Executive John Chen said in a statement. 
The quarter benefited from higher sales of the company's core security software, Spark, as businesses continue to strengthen their IT security to support remote working trends. 
In a post-earnings call with analysts, the company said its patent licensing business also performed strongly, contributing $108 million to total revenue.
Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said BlackBerry Spark provides the company with future demand as enterprises and government entities work to protect and manage devices.
The company reiterated it full year revenue forecast of about $950 million. Analysts expect revenue to be $956 million.
Total revenue for the second quarter ended Aug. 31 was $259 million, while analysts were expecting it to drop to $237.03 million from $244 million a year earlier, according IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, the company reported a profit 11 cents per share, compared with analysts' estimates of 2 cents per share.

Net loss narrowed to $23 million, or 4 cents per share, from $44 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday said special purpose acquisition companies (SPACS) offer ""healthy competition"" to traditional public offerings, but only when sponsors and investors have access to adequate disclosures.
""To the extent that a SPAC structure is an alternative to ... a traditional IPO, in some ways it's very healthy,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in an interview on CNBC.
""It comes down to a question about disclosure and transparency and whether investors are getting all the information they need.""
Also dubbed ""blank-check"" companies, SPACS are shell vehicles with no pre-existing assets which are initially valued based solely on the amount of cash they raise, which is then used to buy up assets.
Retail investors who buy into SPACs pay the same price as big Wall Street investors, but may have little knowledge about potential acquisition targets. In contrast, big SPAC investors, which provide the bulk of financing, are typically given confidential information on the vehicle's strategy.

Clayton's remarks on Thursday followed reports that electric-truck maker Nikola Corp, which initially raised money as a SPAC, is being investigated by regulators.
Clayton said on Thursday that the agency would be keeping an eye on the quality of disclosures. 
""People should understand that the compensation structures and the motivations here may be different than they usually expect ... but we will be paying attention to what's happening in the market,"" he said without elaborating.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened with fresh selling on Thursday, after a rise in initial jobless claims reinforced worries about the economic outlook.
By 9:40 AM (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 195 points, or 0.7%, at 26,569 points, its lowest since early August. The S&P 500 was down 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.0% on the day and now down nearly 13% from its last all-time high at the start of this month.
The declines came after the Bureau Labor Statistics said initial jobless claims edged up to 870,000 from an upwardly-revised 866,000 last week, disappointing hopes for another modest decline. 
""The momentum in the labor market is stalling,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in emailed comments.. ""Consumers’ spending - nearly 70% of the economy - can’t continue to increase at its recent pace in the aftermath of the ending of enhanced unemployment benefits, and the latest upturn in Covid cases and hospitalizations - up yesterday for the third straight day - threatens to trigger renewed restrictions on economic activity.""
Shepherdson said ""the need for further fiscal action is obvious, but we no longer expect any meaningful relief bill until February.""
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has stressed the need for fiscal action in Congressional testimony this week but lawmakers remain as far apart as ever on an agreement. Powell's colleague, Boston Federal Reserve President Fred Rosengren had said late on Wednesday that the economy ""remains fragile,” and that ""a second wave of COVID-19 infections this fall and winter is likely, which could cause some states to impose new restrictions on mobility and face-to-face interactions.”  
Rosengren repeated those sentiments in an interview with Yahoo Finance on Thursday.
Once again, data from the housing market came in considerably stronger than those from the labor market. New home sales surged in August to 1.011 million, well above expectations and the highest number since 2006.

WARSAW/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Buyout group CVC Capital Partners is starting preparations for a sale of its Polish utility PKP Energetyka in a deal potentially worth up to 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion), people close to the matter said.
Given the political challenges linked to Poland's determination to control strategic energy assets, any potential buyer will likely need a local partner to navigate the process, the sources said.
CVC bought PKP Energetyka, one of Poland's biggest energy groups and an electricity supplier to the national railway, from the state-owned railway firm in 2015 for 1.97 billion zlotys ($507 million), including debt.
The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), which won the parliamentary election later that year, tried to annul the transaction in court, saying selling assets such as PKP Energetyka contravened Poland's national security interests.
CVC declined to comment, while PKP Energetyka and the Polish government were not immediately available for comment.
CVC is expected to engage a sell-side advisor in early 2021 and start an auction soon thereafter, the sources said.
It has started to reach out to other private equity firms and to energy groups from outside Poland on the sale, they added.
The company is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 150 million euros this year, compared to 130 million euros in 2019.
One person familiar with the matter said bidders were expected to offer a valuation of about 7.5-8 times PKP Energetyka's core earnings, or 1.1-1.2 billion euros, including debt.
Another said PKP Energatyka's enterprise value could reach 1.8 billion euros, or up to 12 times core earnings.
Infrastructure investors such as KKR, EQT (NYSE:EQT), Macquarie and First State showed interest in PKP Energetyka in 2015, but some of them may shun the auction in the face of PiS' expected reluctance to sell the asset to a foreign investor.
The Polish government has also tightened regulation of the energy market, and PKP Energetyka has suffered from a cap on power prices introduced in 2019 to protect consumers from the impact of rising carbon emission costs.
Puls Biznesu daily said on Thursday that the company has claimed 85 million zlotys in damages from the state to compensate for losses resulting from the cap.
Since 2015 CVC has been approaching PiS representatives and allies to ease the conflict and convince the government it is raising the company's value, people close to the matter have said.
Local media have also reported that PiS actions against CVC may undermine good relations with Washington.

LONDON (Reuters) - Not all of Britain's financial firms are convinced of the need to invest large sums to crack down on dirty money, leaving the quality of anti-money laundering controls falling short, the Financial Conduct Authority's chief enforcer said on Thursday.
Global banks, including UK-based HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), face fresh scrutiny on their efforts to curb money laundering after a cache of leaked documents showed they transferred more than $2 trillion in suspect funds over nearly two decades.
""What surprises me still is there is a view in some quarters that anti-money laundering systems and controls is a lot of money for nothing in return, and it's a huge bureaucratic exercise in red tape rather than something that's really important,"" the FCA's head of enforcement Mark Steward told reporters.
""What that tells me is that the point of AML controls has somehow got lost and gone missing from the challenge, and understanding that this is all about reducing crime of a very serious nature.""
Steward said banks are spending a lot of money on systems and controls that in many cases, are still not yet good enough to do the job and ""something really needs to happen"".
""I am not yet sure that there is a strong enough, unanimous view that this is really serious,"" Steward said.
There is no major bank in Britain that hasn't been or isn't currently the subject of an ongoing probe related to the adequacy of their dirty money safeguards, he said.

Assets under management hit record highs of 8.5 trillion pounds at the end of 2019, a rise of 10% from 2018, helped by strong stock market performance, the Investment Association said in its annual Investment Management Survey on Thursday.
A downturn in markets dented assets in March, following a spate of pandemic-related lockdowns around the world. But markets recovered in subsequent months, the IA said.
Investors were increasingly interested in responsible investment products, though the size of the market remains small. Funds under management in this sector rose by 89% in the 18 months to June 2020 to a high of 33 billion pounds, the IA said.
The IA covers 85% of the UK investment management sector, it said. Taking the industry as a whole, including hedge funds, private equity, property and wealth management, it estimated assets under management at UK funds reached 9.9 trillion pounds in 2019.

Harley had spent recent months moving dealerships in the country to cheaper locations, and the announcement followed speculation in Indian media a month ago that executives had played down.
The move involves $75 million in restructuring costs, some 70 redundancies and the closure of its Bawal plant, walking away from a market worth about 17 million bike and scooter sales a year. (https:// It will retain only a scaled-down sales office in Gurgaon, south of New Delhi.
The departure is also the latest setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strategy to encourage domestic manufacturing that would keep more of the fruits of a gigantic home consumer market in India.
Harley has been scrambling for years to grow sales beyond baby boomers in the United States and has not posted retail sales growth there in the past 14 quarters.
Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz, who took the reins at the company in February, unveiled a major ""Rewire"" in July to boost profits by reducing Harley's product portfolio by 30% and investing in 50 markets with growth potential in North America, Europe and parts of Asia Pacific.
India was one of the markets the company at that point committed to investing in more heavily. Thursday's statement said the move to leave had been pushed through since Aug. 6.
Harley said it now expects total restructuring costs of about $169 million in 2020, but warned that the restructuring program - referred to internally as ""The Rewire"" - was likely to incur more charges.
India, still far cheaper and poorer than many of the developing economies with which it competes for investment, has proven an inhospitable market for other auto industry players.
Last year,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) pared back its interests and ceased independent operations in India by entering into a joint venture with Indian automaker  Mahindra & Mahindra  (NS:MAHM).
General Motors (N:GM), which stopped domestic sales in 2017, also plans to stop manufacturing and exports from India by the end of this year.

Growth in domestic sales has slowed of late - with sales of cars and motorbikes falling 18% in the last fiscal year to March 31 from a year ago.

Volvo, bought by China's Geely Holding in 2010, has repositioned itself during Samuelsson's tenure as a premium carmaker with a range of popular sports utility vehicles (SUVs), taking on far larger rivals such as BMW (DE:BMWG) and Mercedes (DE:DAIGn).
It notched a sixth straight annual sales record in 2019, of more than 700,000 cars, and while hit by the pandemic earlier this year has seen a sharp rebound in recent months, helped by strength in China and the United States. 
""We have a second wave in Europe which is making the outlook a bit more uncertain, but July and August started very well, and for September we are roughly on the same level as last year,"" Samuelsson told Reuters. 
""For the rest of the year I would say our base case is still to be back roughly at where we were last year.""
Samuelsson said Volvo had available production capacity at its U.S. plant and in China, while its European factories in Gothenburg, Sweden, and Ghent, Belgium, were running at full capacity. 
Earlier this year the group unveiled plans for a merger with its sister company Geely Automobile (HK:0175), but talks are on hold as Geely works to list its shares on China's Nasdaq-like STAR board.
Samuelsson, 69, a former executive at truckmakers Scania and MAN, said Volvo was working on the matter internally and expected to announce news on the way forward before year-end. 
""Volvo's Swedish and Geely's Chinese, and if we do something together it has to be a strong global internationally governed group, with an international management and board,"" he said. 
""The question is how we should solve that... There are different models for securing the synergies that by the end of the day are the main reason for this.""
Volvo, which aims for half the cars it sells to be fully electric by 2025 and plans to separate its combustion engine business into a standalone unit, will start production of its first fully electric car, the XC40 Recharge P8, this month.
After that, it plans to launch one new fully electric car per year.

""I think the timing is perfect,"" Samuelsson said. ""The pandemic has clearly accelerated the transformation to electric, and we are more committed than ever to go in that direction.""

Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). is pulling out of India, another major setback to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to lure or retain foreign manufacturers in the midst of the nation’s worst economic downturn in decades.
The motorcycle manufacturer will discontinue sales and manufacturing operations in India as part of broader additional cutbacks announced to employees Thursday, according to a regulatory filing. Harley said it will dismiss another roughly 70 employees as part of its exit from the country and that its latest moves will boost restructuring expenses this year to about $169 million.
Harley’s decision comes weeks after  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. said it won’t expand further in India due to the country’s high tax regime. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). pulled out of the country in 2017 while Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. agreed last year to move most of its assets into a joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. after struggling for more than two decades to get traction in the market. U.S. President Donald Trump has often complained about the country’s high tariffs, at times specifically mentioning the levies placed on Harley bikes.
Modi’s government has been trying to reverse the trend with a plan to offer $23 billion of incentives to attract firms to set up manufacturing, people familiar with the matter said this month, including production-linked breaks for automakers. The program is being spearheaded by the country’s policy planning body and is similar to a scheme implemented earlier this year aimed at drawing businesses away from China.
Harley recorded its first quarterly loss in more than a decade for the three months ended in June and has been cutting hundreds of jobs under Jochen Zeitz, who took over as chief executive officer in May. The former CEO of sneaker company Puma SE has narrowed the motorcycle maker’s focus to core markets and model segments, scaled back ambitions for expansion overseas and starved dealers of new bikes to shrink inventory and improve pricing.

915,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Top Toshiba investor calls for inquiry in widening votes scandal,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Takashi Umekawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp's (T:6502) top investor has called for an investigation of a botched meeting in July at which it says several shareholders were deprived of their vote, a letter to the Japanese conglomerate's board seen by Reuters shows.
What began as a problem at Toshiba has widened into a larger scandal for corporate Japan, with the bank hired to count the votes, Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank (T:8309), and Mizuho Trust, revealing details of counting errors at more than 1,300 firms. 
Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management, which owns around 10% of Toshiba, is the latest investor to join the outcry over the meeting, which has drawn attention to concerns about governance and treatment of foreign shareholders.
Effissimo and Toshiba both declined to comment on Thursday.
The letter from Effissimo comes after Toshiba this month said more than 1,000 postal voting forms for its July 31 meeting went uncounted. Another Singapore-based fund, 3D Investment Partners, has already called for an investigation, saying its vote had not been fully recognised. 
Effissimo said in its letter, which was dated Sept. 23., that Toshiba's board should establish a committee made up exclusively of independent members to investigate whether the July meeting was conducted fairly.
""We have surveyed several dozen shareholders regarding this matter, and were able to confirm that there are in fact several shareholders that were unable to vote in a manner consistent with their intentions,"" Effissimo said. 
BOTCHED MEETINGS
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, which was entrusted with counting the shareholder mail-in votes for the Toshiba meeting, said on Thursday it had found 3.4 million uncounted shareholder votes at 975 client firms.
The trust banking arm of Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411) said it had found 22,848 voting forms were uncounted at 371 shareholder meetings where it had been involved in a joint venture with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust. 
Although both banks said the uncounted votes would not have impacted the outcome of any shareholder meetings, the scale of the miscounting is likely to concern investors.
The 1,346 companies at which vote-counting problems were found were almost all listed companies, the banks said, or roughly one-third of listed companies in Japan.
""We deeply apologise for the mishandling of the vote counting,"" said Atsushi Kaibara, a senior official at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, as he and another executive bowed in front of reporters at a news conference.
The bank attributed the miscounts to procedures during the peak season for shareholder meetings. To get more time to count the forms, it usually asks the post office to deliver them a day earlier, it has said.
But it would not issue receipts until the day after forms were delivered, meaning that some were mistaken for being past the deadline even though they were delivered on time, it said. 

The procedure has been used for a ""significantly long time,"" Kaibara said, adding the bank was now doing away with it.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -  El Al  Israel Airlines (TA:ELAL) is opposing the purchase of a controlling stake by religious student Eli Rozenberg, alleging he is a front man for his father, who is not an Israeli citizen as required by law, according to a letter from its lawyers.
In the letter seen by Reuters, the financially strapped group's board requests government ministers reconsider giving the 27-year old Rozenberg control of Israel's flag carrier.
Eli Rozenberg's newly created Kanfei Nesharim Aviation bought $107 million worth of shares in an offering last week that gave him a nearly 43% stake in Israel’s flag carrier. 
He told El Al this week that he was assuming control of the airline and would make changes to the board.
Rozenberg, who is an Israeli citizen and resides in Israel, is the son of Kenny Rozenberg, chief executive of New York-based nursing home chain Centers Health Care.
""According to the laws and terms of El Al, buying a controlling stake by a foreigner is forbidden,"" El Al's lawyers wrote in the letter, adding control by an American could cause problems with flying rights to other countries.
It said data obtained by El Al shows Kenny Rozenberg controls Kanfei Nesharim.
El Al's board and representatives requested an urgent meeting with the relevant government officials.
A spokesman for Rozenberg said a legal response to El Al's concerns would come later on Thursday.
El Al, which has reported losses for two years and racked up debt to renew its fleet, suspended scheduled passenger flights in March at the outset of the coronavirus outbreak when Israel closed its borders to foreign citizens. 
Most of its 5,940 employees remain on unpaid leave.
Israel's government has offered to back 75% of a $250 million loan conditional on the group slashing expenses and issuing $150 million worth of new shares. 

In the offering, Israel's government bought a 15% stake for $34 million, while the holdings of El Al's current owners, Knafaim Holdings (TA:KNFM), fell to 15.2% from 38%.

MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Kazakh banking and fintech firm Kaspi.kz  may revive plans to list in London within weeks, three sources told Reuters, after  Yandex 's planned purchase of Russian online bank Tinkoff establishes a comparative valuation.
Kaspi, which previously aimed to raise between $500 million and $700 million from the London share sale it abandoned last year, declined to comment on Thursday.
A source close to the Kazakh firm said Kaspi, which controls the third largest bank in Kazakhstan where it is a leader in payment systems and e-commerce, may want to capitalise on the deal announced this week by Russian technology firm Yandex, which plans to take over online bank Tinkoff for $5.5 billion.
This would set a valuation benchmark for digital banks in countries in the former Soviet Union and Kaspi could proceed with its listing once the deal was finalised, the source said.
Kaspi will stress that its e-commerce business has been a big winner from the COVID-19 pandemic, a second source said.
This month, Kaspi said that its net income rose by 50% year on year in January-June to 115.6 billion tenge ($272 million) on higher revenue and margins.
Yandex's (O:YNDX) offer values Tinkoff (L:TCSq) at 10.5 times earnings and 2.9 times book value, Refinitiv data shows. 
A third source said Kaspi, whose popular mobile app has made it a household name in the oil-rich Central Asian nation of 19 million, could press ahead with the listing in the coming weeks.
The second source said the listing could be announced in the coming days with the aim to get it done before November's presidential election in the United States. 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are among the banks involved in the deal, the second source said. Morgan Stanley declined to comment and Citigroup did not respond to a request for comment.
Commenting on the Yandex-Tinkoff deal, Kaspi said it owed its success to its strategy ""which combines everyday payments, e-commerce and digital finance services"" in its app.
""This Ecosystem approach is now being replicated by leading internet businesses around the world and it's no surprise to us therefore that Russia's best technology companies are attempting to replicate something similar themselves,"" Kaspi.kz said.

In its listing announcement last year, Kaspi said the selling shareholders would include Baring Vostok funds, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Kaspi.kz board chairman Vyacheslav Kim, and its chief executive Mikheil Lomtadze.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Members Exchange (MEMX), a new U.S. stock exchange backed by some of the biggest customers of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc, launched on Monday with pricing aimed at taking market share from the incumbents.
""Out of the gate, we're looking to be aggressive in order to attract order flow so that people can experience our exchange,"" Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Kellner said in a recent interview. 
The new bourse went live trading seven symbols, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd, and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)  The exchange's mission is to improve the market through technological innovation, reduced complexity, and lower fees, while being a voice for its members on market issues, Kellner said. MEMX was founded in January 2019 by nine financial institutions, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp, Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Fidelity and Citadel Securities. Since then, MEMX has raised more than $135 million and brought on more than 40 members, including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Co and Jane Street Capital. The Jersey City, New Jersey-based exchange was founded after years of complaints by brokers and other market participants over what they saw as unjustifiably high fees charged by most exchanges for things like market data and exchange connectivity.  Initially, MEMX will give away its market data and will pay more in rebates to brokers that add liquidity to its exchange than it charges in trading fees, meaning it will lose money as it tries to take share from Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc's NYSE, Nasdaq, and Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE). 
The exchange will ""normalize"" its fees once it attracts meaningful volume, but those fees will be very competitive and MEMX will be transparent in how it sets them, Kellner said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open a little lower Thursday, with investors warily pausing for breath after the previous session’s substantial selloff. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell remains in the spotlight amid concerns about the economic recovery. 
At 7:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.2%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 12 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 42 points, or 0.4%. 
At the close Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.9% to hit its lowest level since the beginning of August, while the S&P 500 index fell 2.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 3%. These benchmark indices are on track for their worst week in two months.
So far in September the S&P 500 has declined 7.5%, while the DJIA has shed 5.8%. The Nasdaq Composite has been the weakest performer, registering a loss of 9.7% as investors rotate out of the big tech stocks.
Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell continues his speaking marathon later Thursday, appearing along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate banking committee.
Powell, along with a number of his Fed colleagues, appealed Wednesday for more fiscal aid from Congress amid fears that the U.S. economic recovery will stagnate. 
However, this additional stimulus looks unlikely with Washington as divided as ever, particularly after President Donald Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the election.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has cut its U.S. growth forecast for the fourth quarter to 3% from 6%, as “we think it is now clear that Congress will not attach additional fiscal stimulus to the continuing resolution.”
Amid worries about further growth, investors will focus on the weekly release of initial jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). These are expected to come in around 840,000 for last week, not much different than the week before, suggesting a stagnating employment market. Continuing claims, which are reported at the same time, are expected to be around 12.3 million.
New home sales for August are also due at 10 AM ET, and are expected to be in the neighborhood of 895,000, about even with July.
In corporate news, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) missed forecasts with its quarterly earnings, while CarMax (NYSE:KMX), Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) and FactSet Research are all set to report. The tech sector will remain in the spotlight after recent sharp losses.
Oil prices weakened Thursday despite official data showing crude inventories falling by 1.6 million barrels last week, on concerns the economic recovery in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, is slowing.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $39.97 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $41.83. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,858.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1647, having hit a two-month low on Wednesday.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Top accounting firms and the World Economic Forum were scheduled to release on Tuesday key metrics for companies to use when reporting on their environmental, social and governance impacts.
Report sponsors said the effort aims to cut through a mishmash of existing standards on topics like carbon emissions and workforce diversity.
""The goal here is to elevate from thousands of metrics a number of subjects that are a baseline,"" said Maha Eltobgy, head of investment for the World Economic Forum, known for the annual economic conference it sponsors in Davos, Switzerland.
While companies have formal guidelines to follow for traditional financial reporting areas like revenue or cash flow, there is little formal agreement on how to measure the impact of so-called ESG issues.
Meanwhile such topics have drawn new attention from financial companies looking to price in their impact on asset values. 
Efforts including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Global Reporting Initiative have offered various suggestions and pledged to work together.
Eltobgy pointed to the example of climate change. Tuesday's report suggests companies disclose both how many metric tonnes of carbon dioxide they emit, and whether they have set targets on greenhouse gas emissions, drawing on separate recommendations from the different standard-setters.
""The work was scanning all the standards and metrics out there and picking the ones that would be seen as most universal,"" she said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti joined other banking executives on Tuesday in declaring consolidation of the European sector ""inevitable"", declining comment on whether Switzerland's biggest bank plans to participate.
""Of course, I will abstain to talk about UBS,"" Ermotti said at the virtual Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) Annual Financials CEO Conference.
""But...you heard me say, particularly in the last year or two years, I felt the debate in Europe was too focused on 'too big to fail', and rather should have been 'too small to survive, to small to compete.'

Ermotti, due to be replaced by former ING head Ralph Hamers in November, said regulators had been vocal in the last few months about their openness to consolidation that made sense, adding they were right to oppose deals that did not add value.
Reports that UBS has examined a potential tie-up with rival  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) have put it in the spotlight of late.
At the same conference on Tuesday, the head of Credit Suisse said he also expected to see more deals.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and data aggregator Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) Yodlee said on Thursday they had signed a data exchange agreement, the latest move in an ongoing tug of war between fintechs and large banks over information sharing. 
The deal will enable the bank's customers to share their account information with fintech apps connected to Envestnet Yodlee. 
Wells Fargo and other large U.S. banks have been pushing to move fintechs and data aggregators away from so-called screenscraping and towards what they have said is a more secure method of accessing sensitive data. Through screenscraping, fintechs collect information by logging into a user's bank account on their behalf. 
""This is a significant milestone, we now have 99% of current third party app screenscraping under data exchange agreements,"" said Ben Soccorsy, senior vice president in Wells Fargo's strategy, digital and innovation group.
Fintech startups, such as those providing automated wealth management or budgeting tools, often need to connect to a user's bank account to gather the necessary data to provide their services. Some collect the information through aggregators such as Yodlee and competitor Plaid, while others request that customers provide their password to access their information.
Through Wells Fargo's new method, fintechs will not be able to use customers' passwords to access their entire financial data, but will instead connect to the bank's application programming interface, a set of programming code, that will only send specific account information authorized by the consumer. 
The changes come as banks and fintechs scuffle over data access. Banks have said their reluctance to share customer information with third parties reflects a need to protect sensitive data. Fintechs have expressed skepticism, suggesting that consumers should decide who can access their data. 

Soccorsy declined to say whether Envestnet Yodlee would be paying Wells Fargo for access to customer-permissioned data and said the bank could not disclose the details of any of these agreements as the terms are confidential. Envestnet Yodlee also declined to comment on the agreement's terms.

932,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>","Not coming soon: Cineworld squeezed by movie delays, fears new virus curbs","By Tanishaa Nadkar
(Reuters) - Cineworld (L:CINE), the world's second-biggest cinema operator, warned on Thursday it might need to raise more money if theatres shut again from fresh pandemic curbs after it swung to a $1.64 billion first-half loss, sending shares down 17%.
The Regal cinema owner, which counts United States as its largest market, said it was in talks with lenders to avoid an impending loan default, and flagged survival risks as studios delay major releases and people stay away from theatres. 
""If governments were to strengthen restrictions on social gathering..., it would have a negative impact on our financial performance,"" the British company said.
New curbs could be a major setback after Cineworld reopened 561 out of 778 sites, highlighted the strong performance of Christopher Nolan's ""Tenet"", and said it was looking forward to other big releases. 
""Two more big name films, West Side Story and Black Widow, have been pushed back to 2021,"" AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould said.
""There isn't anything out now or coming very soon that will really make people want to take the risk of sitting in a room with a load of strangers."" 
FIGHTING TO STAY RELEVANT
The world's largest cinema chain AMC (N:AMC) and Universal Pictures have agreed the studio's movies would be made available to U.S. audiences at home after three weekends in cinemas.
Cineworld boss Mooky Greidinger, however, said his company would stick with the traditional script.
""Our policy regarding the theatrical window remains unchanged as an important part of our business model, and we will continue to only show movies that respect it,"" he said in a statement.
A model agreed by AMC and Universal could easily be replicated across the industry, eToro analyst Adam Vettese said. Cineworld will have to either go on a charm offensive with other studios or make sure this shift does not result in lost revenues, he said.
The landscape could be further changed by a U.S. ruling last month which allows movie studios to own theatres.
""The more likely candidates to enter the theatrical space would be streamers such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), who are looking to attract renowned film makers with the prospect of a theatrical release,"" Third Bridge analyst Harry Barnick said.
Another challenge for Cineworld is its tussle with Canada's Cineplex (TO:CGX), suing the British group for damages after it scrapped a $1.65 billion takeover. 

Cineworld has made a counter-claim against Cineplex.

933,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 05:39AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Pets at Home Emerges Triumphant; Cineworld Sounds the Alarm,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Man’s best friend is his dog. An investor’s best friend in these troubled times, it seems, is the company that offers goods and services to his dog.
On a day when the screens were again awash with red, Pets at Home (LON:PETSP) shares rallied 22% after the company told the stock exchange that like-for-like sales had continued to grow at over 10% on the year through early September. As a consequence, it said, underlying pretax profit is likely to be ahead of the market’s expectations.
The stock is now up nearly 20% from its pre-pandemic high and up 34% year-to-date. Not bad for a stock that doesn’t rely on algorithms, artificial intelligence, or any of the other current buzzwords of the investing world, but rather the enduring willingness of a human being to allocate a large part of his or her income to the yowling, yapping, vomiting ball of fur that mitigates the loneliness of government-enforced separation from other humans. 
The company has, of course, had to beef up its online distribution of food and grooming products, and it has had to accept fewer visits to its grooming salons. Elective veterinary medicine, like elective human procedures, has suffered during the lockdown, and may suffer again if the U.K. tightens its social distancing restrictions any longer.
However, it is surely right to point to what it calls the “the inherent resilience in our pet care model and the underlying pet care market.” In a world of infuriatingly low visibility, spending on pets seems one of the more certain bets for the foreseeable future. 
Compare and contrast with Cineworld, the operator of movie theaters, whose latest update only illustrates what happens if your very business depends on bringing people together to sample the thrill of shared experiences.
Cineworld (LON:CINE) shares fell 13% to their lowest since early August, after the company warned that it is likely to breach its debt covenants by the end of the year, and unlikely to bring debt back within the agreed levels by the end of 2021.  It warned that it needs its remaining U.S. cinemas to reopen as planned by the end of October, and to avoid any further delays to major film releases, or else it will need fresh liquidity to continue as a going concern.

LONDON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Global shares slid and the dollar rose on Thursday on investor concern about another economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic, ahead of German sentiment data and speeches from a clutch of central bankers. 
After a summer lull in much of Europe, the infection rate has begun to rise sharply, with a number of countries including Britain introducing tougher rules to help limit the spread of the virus.
The MSCI World (MIWD00000PUS) index was down 0.6% at 0733 GMT, its fifth day in the red out of the last six and hovering near a two-month low. Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 1.93%, chalking up their worst day in two months after economic warnings from U.S. Federal Reserve officials.
A broad gauge of Europe's top shares, the STOXX Europe 600 (STOXX), was down 1%.
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester both said the economy remained in a ""deep hole"", with Clarida calling for more stimulus.
Yet political stalemate in Washington continues to frustrate efforts to prop up the world's biggest economy, beset by one of the worst COVID-19 death rates globally.
""A U.S. fiscal deal was baked into markets and now what you are seeing is that the probability of a deal going through has simply reversed,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, a London-based portfolio manager at Legal and General Investment Management.
""We have heard this week how important a fiscal deal is to the Federal Reserve but from a political standpoint, focus has moved more towards the election and Supreme Court deliberations rather than the economy,"" he added.
Flows into the dollar (=USD) helped up it rise for a fourth straight day, leaving it on track to record its longest streak of daily gains since June and now nearly 3% off its August lows.
""Have we overpriced the rebound in the economy? After the stern warning from Clarida, I say we have,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AXI.
""I think the market was interpreting a bounce from the bottom as a cyclical recovery, but I don't think we're there yet. I still think there's a lot of blood on the street, especially on Main Street.""
Commodities priced in dollars fell as a result, with Brent crude futures (LCOc1) down 0.7% at $41.45 a barrel and gold  down 0.2% - on course for a fourth day of losses that total nearly 7%.
The euro (EUR=) was flat at $1.1658.
""A stronger USD remains a significant headwind for commodity markets, with investor appetite waning,"" ANZ analysts said in a note. 
With central bankers in focus globally, the chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve will be closely watched later in the day when he and a number of colleagues speak at the Senate Banking Committee.
Elsewhere Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey is also due to speak, as is the European Central Bank's chief economist, Philip Lane, ahead of the release of its latest Economic Bulletin.
In emerging markets, both the Turkish and Mexican central banks are set to decide on monetary policy. MSCI's Emerging Markets Index (MSCIEF) was down 1.8% at 0814 GMT.
Investors are waiting for weekly data due later on Thursday, which is expected to show U.S. jobless claims fell slightly but remained elevated, indicating the world's largest economy is far from recovering.
In Europe, the German Ifo business climate indicator for September is set to give a fresh read on Europe's biggest economy, while French business confidence for September is also out.
Rate decisions are also due in Switzerland and Norway, while the ECB is also set to carry out its latest Targeted Longer-term Refinancing Operation.

935,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",UK COVID-19 policy threatens hundreds of thousands of jobs: Ryanair's O'Leary,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Britain risks losing hundreds of thousands of travel and tourism jobs in the coming months unless the government offers proper supports to workers and relaxes travel restrictions, Ryanair (I:RYA) boss Michael O'Leary said on Thursday.
O'Leary, group chief executive of Europe's largest low-cost carrier, was speaking hours ahead of the announcement of new UK COVID-19 support measures and weeks ahead of the launch of a European Union plan to coordinate travel restrictions in Europe.
Failure join the EU plan and provide a proper furlough scheme to pay those whose work has dried up due to COVID-19 ""will mean literally hundreds of thousands of job losses this winter,"" O'Leary told Sky News in an interview. 
British finance minister Rishi Sunak on Thursday was due to announce a replacement for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which supported 8.9 million private-sector jobs at its peak in May, as part of a series of new COVID-19 support measures.
O'Leary said if there was no ""proper"" replacement, staff not required would be put on unpaid leave. Job losses cannot be ruled out, but Ryanair is ""desperately working with our people to prevent them,"" he said. 
O'Leary also called for the scrapping of the United Kingdom's air passenger tax for 12-24 months. 
The EU travel scheme, due to be finalised in mid-October, would set out common COVID-19 travel rules across the continent and impose restrictions on regions with high COVID-19 rates rather than countries.
O'Leary, who earlier this month described the winter as a ""write-off"", said Ryanair's forward bookings for November and December are around 10%, around a quarter of the normal level for this time of year. 

He said British airlines in general were likely to fly around 30-40% of their normal capacity this winter and said bookings were now around 20-30% of normal levels.

936,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 04:31AM ET</span>",'We're a tech company': Russia's Sberbank bets big on strategy shift,"By Alexander Marrow
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Sberbank (MM:SBER), Russia's dominant lender, is planning one of the biggest reinventions in its 179-year history as it seeks to join the likes of Apple and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the global pantheon of Big Tech. 
The company, which is dropping the word ""bank"" from its logo as part of this drive, gave Reuters a preview of the devices it has developed to lead its charge - including a TV streaming box, virtual assistant and smart speaker - ahead of their official unveiling on Thursday.
Sberbank's Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky also said in an interview that it was launching ""SmartMarket"", an equivalent to Apple's AppStore or Google Play. 
""It's a huge investment, not a big investment. Even for a successful company, it's a huge investment,"" he said about the new range of gadgets and tech services, a potentially risky bet in an increasingly competitive market of domestic and foreign players. He declined to disclose the specific amount. 
The Russian government owns a stake of 50% plus one share in Sberbank, the country's oldest lender with assets of $401 billion as of August and a market value of about $67 billion.
In pursuit of a stronger presence in Russia's digital economy, it has invested in everything from cloud services to driverless cars in the past year. But the launch of in-house hardware marks a deeper move into tech; the company describes the new push as the ""largest transformation"" in its history. 
""We've always had a chip on our shoulder, we believe we are a technology company with a banking licence,"" Rafalovsky said, adding that most of its customers predominantly associate Sberbank with banking products. 
Sberbank announced the logo change and is unveiling the range of devices and services on Thursday at SberConf, a virtual event modelled on product launches by global technology firms.
NEW GADGETS: MEET SALUTE
Among Sberbank's new gadgets are SberBox, a TV streaming device, and SberPortal, a smart speaker with a screen attached which provides gesture and voice recognition.
Sberbank is launching a family of virtual assistants, called Salute, which it said had more of a focus on emotional attachment than Apple's Siri, Hey Google or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Alexa. It is built into all Sberbank's devices and mobile apps. 
What sets it apart from other voice assistants on the market is that it has three personalities, Rafalovsky said. They are ""cultured Sber, cheerful Joy and pedantic Athena,"" Sberbank said. 
The company's SmartMarket, meanwhile, will have coding tools available for businesses and entrepreneurs to produce their own apps and a revenue-share model where Sberbank will only take money from apps that charge money. 
""It's strategically important because SmartMarket instruments act as a bridge for the entire market into our ecosystem,"" said Rafalovsky.
TECH'S A RISKY BUSINESS
The new products will initially be targeted at the Russian market, where Sberbank says it serves almost 100 million active banking clients, though it operates in 17 other countries and the devices could potentially be rolled out abroad at a later date. 
Western technology companies have traditionally seen Russia as an attractive but high-risk market, due to the threat of sanctions and Russian laws such as those passed in 2015 requiring all data about Russian citizens to be stored in the country.
Amazon does not have a big presence in Russia, whose sheer geographical size makes logistics daunting, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) is blocked after a court found it breached the data storage rule, while domestic players dominate web searches and social networks.
However Sberbank's costly tech push could be both risky and challenging, with no guarantees of success in a fragmented and increasingly competitive hardware and software market. 
Apple (O:AAPL), Samsung (KS:005930) and Huawei are leading players in smart devices, with a wealth of experience, developed app ecosystems and deep pockets. Local player Ivi and others already offer TV streaming services, while Mail.ru (L:MAILRq), internet group  Yandex  (O:YNDX) and mobile operator MTS (MM:MTSS) all have smart speakers on the market. 
In June, Sberbank and Yandex - known as Russia's answer to Google - said they would stop working together on joint projects, including e-commerce venture Yandex.Market and payment service Yandex.Money, with non-compete agreements expiring in the third quarter, potentially putting the two in direct competition. 
LIFE BEYOND BANKING
While Sberbank's diversification drive could carry risks, analysts say it has become increasingly difficult for banks to make money in Russia, where the key interest rate is languishing at a historic low of 4.25%, while rates are negative in some of their European markets. 
BCS Global Markets analyst Elena Tsareva said banking was becoming lower margin and more regulated, and that it was being disrupted by new, nimble players such as online lender Tinkoff, which Yandex is in talks to acquire.
Against that backdrop, it makes sense for Sberbank to move into new areas, Tsareva said. 

""How do you earn money if you do banking business only?"" she added.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Thursday, with investors fretting a second wave of coronavirus cases during the northern hemisphere's coming winter will derail the economic recovery.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.8% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.9%. 
France became the latest European country to tighten its restrictions on social gatherings late on Wednesday, against a backdrop of rising infections and admissions to hospital. The U.K. and Belgium had already announced new restrictions in the previous 48 hours. 
“The impact of second wave-related weakness does lead us to think that the recovery is under more pressure than previously thought,” wrote ING’s Bert Colijn, in a research note. “For governments and European Central Bank, this will be a wake-up call, if they needed one.”
These worries were backed up by comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who reiterated the U.S. economy, the world’s driver, had a long way to go before recovery, and would likely require more support to get there. 
However, more fiscal support in the U.S. looks extremely unlikely before the November elections, as Congress now seems to be focusing on the battle to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.
Still, there was some good news Thursday as sentiment in the French manufacturing sector continued its steady recovery in September, rising to  96 in September compared with a revised figure of 92 in August.
This puts the focus firmly on the German Ifo Business Climate index to gauge the sentiment in Europe’s most important economy later Thursday, ahead of important weekly U.S. employment data.
In corporate news, Cineworld (LON:CINE) stock slumped over 17% after the cinema chain posted a first-half net loss of $1.64 billion, and warned that it may need to raise funds if a new wave of lockdowns were to occur.
Go-Ahead (LON:GOG) stock dropped 4.2% after the transport company swung to a loss in fiscal 2020, attributing the fall to GBP57.1 million of exceptional items related to the coronavirus.
Airbus (PA:AIR) dropped 2.3% following a Bloomberg report that Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is in talks with the European plane maker to delay the delivery of at least 40 aircraft.
Oil prices weakened Thursday despite official data showing crude inventories falling by 1.6 million barrels last week, on concerns the economic recovery in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, is slowing.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $39.62 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.7% to $41.48.

939,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chinese state investors to take BMW partner Brilliance private - sources,"By Julie Zhu and Yilei Sun
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state-backed investors are considering taking BMW's (DE:BMWG) main Chinese joint-venture partner Brilliance private, five people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, in the latest such deal targeting beaten down Hong Kong-listed stocks.
Shares in Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd (HK:1114) reversed losses and rose as much as 12.3% to HK$7.86 on Wednesday afternoon, their highest since Aug. 17, following the news. The company has a market value of $4.6 billion.
The deal to take it private would be led by state-controlled Liaoning Provincial Transportation Investment Group, which owns 12% of the automaker, the sources said.
The privatisation would attract other Chinese state-backed investors and could kick off as soon as the fourth quarter of the year, said two of the people.
Brilliance's parent, Huachen Automotive Group [LNGOVC.UL], said it had not obtained any relevant information about Liaoning Transportation Investment Group considering leading the deal.
Brilliance, Liaoning Transportation Investment Group, the provincial state asset regulator, and BMW did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The sources declined to be identified as the matter was confidential.
Based in northeastern Liaoning province, Brilliance is 30% owned by Huachen Group, which is majority-owned by the provincial state asset regulator.
The regulator supports the proposal and Liaoning Transportation Investment Group has talked to several banks about financing, said three of the people.
Prospective investors believe Brilliance is undervalued in Hong Kong, the sources said, as the automaker is trading at 3.67 times expected earnings, way below the industry's median multiple of 14.4, according to Refinitiv data.
Hong Kong's market has also underperformed major peers so far this year, with the blue-chip Hang Seng Index (HSI) down 16% as of Wednesday, compared with a 14% gain for China's CSI 300. Brilliance shares have fallen 10% in the same period.
The privatisation would come ahead of BMW buying another 25% to take control of the JV - BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) - for 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) in 2022.
Based on that offer, Brilliance's current 50% stake in the venture, which contributed to almost all the listed firm's profit in 2019, would be worth 7.2 billion euros ($8.4 billion), 83% higher than its market value. Its stake will halve to 25% after BMW increases its share. 
While the take-private proposal will not impact BMW's plan to increase its stake in the JV, Brilliance's valuation is likely to weaken after it loses control of the venture even though it is likely to remain profitable, the sources said.
Hong Kong-listed companies have announced take-private deals worth $17.8 billion so far this year, more than double last year's annual volume, often citing undervalued shares as a reason. The average premiums paid by buyers for those deals jumped to 46% in 2019 and this year, from 34% in 2018, according to Refinitiv data.
Brilliance also owns 51% of a venture with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) making vans and sport-utility vehicles, and a stake in an auto-financing firm.
It has yet to be decided if Huachen Group plans to divest its stake in Brilliance, said the people, adding the Liaoning government is planning a major restructuring of the debt-laden group.
Huachen's debt totalled 133 billion yuan ($19.6 billion) as of the end of June, with short-term borrowings reaching 16.5 billion yuan. Its cash balance was 32.6 billion yuan, versus 37.8 billion yuan at the end of 2019.

""FINMA found that the bank did not make sufficient efforts to investigate the substantial growth in the client's assets,"" the watchdog said in a statement, adding it had also failed to clarify the client's high-risk transactions. ""The bank did not adequately resolve issues that should have raised suspicions.""
Bank SYZ said it had taken a number of measures to improve the systems it had in place.
""The bank attaches the utmost importance to compliance with its anti-money laundering obligations,"" it said in an emailed statement. ""Unfortunately, for a specific business relationship, the procedures put in place proved to be inadequate.""

FINMA noted the Geneva-based wealth manager had reported suspicions, which enabled criminal prosecutors to investigate the Angolan case. It said it would appoint an independent auditor to oversee the bank's implementation of new compliance measures.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Thursday, following substantial losses on Wall Street overnight, with investors fretting about the global recovery after a series of warnings from U.S. Federal Reserve officials.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.9%. 
At the close in New York overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.9% to hit a new one-month low, while the S&P 500 fell 2.4%, and the NASDAQ Composite index fell 3%.
Weighing heavily on market sentiment were comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who reiterated the U.S. economy, the world’s driver, had a long way to go before recovery, and would likely require more support to get there. He was backed up by the likes of Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, who said the U.S. economy remains in a ""deep hole"" of joblessness and weak demand.
However, more fiscal support looks extremely unlikely before the November elections, as Congress now seems to be focusing on the battle to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.
Adding to the woes was evidence of the slowing recovery, as PMI data showed U.S. business activity slowed in September. This weakness wasn’t confined to America, as the recovery of activity also stalled in Europe with the number of new Covid-19 cases flaring up again.
“The impact of second wave-related weakness does lead us to think that the recovery is under more pressure than previously thought,” wrote ING’s Bert Colijn, in a research note. “For governments and European Central Bank, this will be a wake-up call, if they needed one.”
Investors will focus on the key German Ifo Business Climate index to gauge the sentiment in Europe’s most important economy later Thursday, ahead of important weekly U.S. employment data.
In corporate news, Airbus may be in the spotlight following a Bloomberg report that Delta Air Lines is in talks with the European plane maker to delay the delivery of at least 40 aircraft that were set to be handed over this year.
Oil prices weakened Thursday despite official data showing crude inventories falling by 1.6 million barrels last week, on concerns the economic recovery in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, is slowing.
Weighing heavily was Wednesday’s PMI data, which showed business activity slowed in September, with gains in the manufacturing sector more than offset by a retreat in services industries.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $39.65 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.4% to $41.60. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,858.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1660, having hit a two-month low on Wednesday."

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co is set to pay nearly $1 billion to resolve market manipulation investigations by U.S. authorities into its trading of metals futures and Treasury securities, a person familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.
The large fine would lift a regulatory shadow that has hung over the bank for several years and mark a signature victory for the government's efforts to clamp down on illegal trading techniques, such as spoofing, especially in the precious metals markets. 
JPMorgan has said in public filings that it was in discussions with authorities about resolving the investigations.
The settlement with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) could come as soon as this week and is not expected to result in any restrictions on the bank's business, the person said. 
The SEC declined to comment. The CFTC and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The settlement was first reported by Bloomberg News.
JPMorgan shares fell about 1.6% on Wednesday, less than the declines by other major banks. 
Spoofing is a practice in which traders place orders they intend to cancel to move prices to benefit their market positions. The Justice Department has taken aim at the practice in recent years, using sophisticated data analysis tools to spot potential wrongdoing that it could not previously detect.
Reuters has reported that around 2017, the agency began using techniques it originally developed to spot healthcare fraud schemes to identify suspicious trading patterns, including by scanning activity on exchanges.
“The idea was: let’s mine this data source to see who the worst actors are,” Robert Zink, a top Justice official who helped lead the effort, told Reuters in May.

The agency has already charged six JPMorgan traders for manipulating metals futures between 2008 and 2016.

The deal effectively offloads the China unit away from the parent, which has faced fundraising issues since a failed attempt to go public in 2019.
WeWork said it will maintain a minority stake and ""participating interest"" in WeWork China and that it will receive an annual fee from the unit for use of the WeWork brand.
Concurrent with the deal, the division has received $200 million in funding from existing investors, WeWork said. Michael Jiang of Trustbridge Partners will serve as WeWork China's acting chief executive officer.
Trustbridge and Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Private) Ltd (TEM.UL) held talks with WeWork's Chinese unit over increasing their stakes and taking majority ownership, Reuters reported in January.
WeWork shelved its initial public offering in 2019 after investors grew wary of its losses, business model and corporate governance, leading to the resignation of co-founder and former chief executive officer Adam Neumann.
It has since undergone significant management change yet remains enmeshed in lawsuits over a $3 billion tender offer to existing shareholders.
Last month, the New York-based startup said it had almost halved its cash-burn rate from the end of last year and obtained a $1.1 billion commitment in new financing from Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).

SoftBank, meanwhile, has been steadily offloading assets to raise money after a spending spree late last decade. This month, it said it would sell chip designer Arm Ltd, purchased in 2016, to semiconductor giant  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) for $40 billion.

Investing.com – Asian stocks slumped on Thursday morning, following a slide in U.S. markets during the previous session, as the ever-rising number of COVID-19 cases and remarks from several U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday dimmed hopes for a global economic recovery from the virus.
With governments re-implementing lockdowns to curb fresh outbreaks in the U.S. and Europe, there are fears that more countries could see outbreaks with the arrival of cooler weather in parts of the Northern Hemisphere.
Fed officials stressed the need for more fiscal stimulus to sustain the recovery, with hope that the U.S. Congress ends its stalemate on passing the latest support measures before the U.S. presidential election in November fast diminishing. Led by Chairman Jerome Powell, who said that more support was likely needed during a congressional hearing, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren also added their voices to the opinion.
Some investors struck a pessimistic note for the outlook.
“Markets are digesting and grappling with this idea that the growth expectations that investors have might not materialize,” New York Life Investments economist and multi-asset portfolio strategist Lauren Goodwin told Bloomberg.
“As the fiscal impulse in the U.S. starts to wane, some of these expectations for a slow and steady recovery are shaken,” she added.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.78% by 11:30 PM ET (3:30 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI slid 2.05%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 1.13% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.91%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 1.46% and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.85%. Investor sentiment was damped after an independent survey of more than 3,3000 businesses between August 13 and September 12 by the China Beige Book showed that economic recovery is only happening in the wealthier, coastal regions. The survey also highlighted the challenges for sectors such as services.
Also on investors’ radars is TikTok’s deal to sell its U.S. operations to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). TikTok parent company ByteDance filed for a temporary block to U.S. President Donald trump’s ban on the app that could see the app removed from U.S. app stores over the upcoming weekend.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) agreed on Thursday to pay a record A$1.3 billion ($920 million) fine to settle a lawsuit accusing it of enabling millions of payments to people exploiting children, closing off its darkest chapter.
Ten months after financial crime agency AUSTRAC dropped the bombshell lawsuit, the second-largest Australian lender said the parties agreed on a payout for allowing illicit payments to continue for years, plus 76,000 additional breaches discovered once legal proceedings had started.
""We are committed to fixing the issues to ensure that these mistakes do not happen again,"" Westpac Chief Executive Peter King said in a statement.
AUSTRAC said the settlement showed it would do whatever was necessary to stop criminals from exploiting the Australian financial system.
""Our role is to harden the financial system against serious crime and terrorism financing, and this penalty reflects the serious and systemic nature of Westpac's non-compliance,"" AUSTRAC Chief Executive Nicole Rose said in a statement.
The payout exceeds the A$900 million Westpac said it was setting aside for the lawsuit in April, and dwarfs a A$700 million fine against larger rival Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) when it admitted to allowing thousands of payments between money launderers in 2018.
In court documents published on Thursday, AUSTRAC said Westpac had raised the number of customers suspected of making illicit payments from 12 to 260 after widening its monitoring from the Philippines to all of Southeast Asia and Mexico.
Attorney General Christian Porter called the bank's initial settlement offer ""totally inadequate"" and said Thursday's fine ""more properly reflects ... acceptance of the fact that these represent some of the greatest failures of a corporate entity in Australia's history to abide by Australian law.""
FALLOUT
The settlement comes at a fraught time for Australian banks in general, with a powerful inquiry last year accusing the industry of rampant fee-gouging and predatory sales tactics to inflate bonuses.
Banks now must tread the sensitive path of getting thousands of borrowers to pay their mortgages again after offering loan holidays tied to government-ordered shutdowns to fight the pandemic.
The payout will trim Westpac's capital ratio - the money it is required to keep on hand compared with its loan book - by about 0.11% to 10.7% and could result in dividend cuts when the bank reports full-year profit in November, analysts estimate. Last month, Westpac became the only Australian bank to cancel its half-year dividend, citing rising default risks because of the virus.
Westpac shares were down 1.5% in morning trading, in line with other banks, while the broader market (AXJO) dipped 1% on concerns about the effect of global virus-related shutdowns.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said Westpac's oversight gaps may have been related to ""significant complexity of Westpac's IT systems, which we think will continue to hamper its cost growth outlook... and likely requires further investment to fix"".
Bell Potter analyst TS Lim said the fine resolved most of Westpac's ongoing legal issues related to the illicit payments and ""provides a lot more certainty for them going forward"".
""Plus it's hard to run a bank during COVID, so that's one less distraction for Peter King,"" Lim added.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 08:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: How a marked-up term sheet and messy rollout threw TikTok deal into disarray,"By Stephen Nellis, David Shepardson and Echo Wang
SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As China's ByteDance raced to seal a deal with  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc to keep its video-sharing app TikTok operational in the United States, an apparent breakthrough came last Wednesday in a phone call to U.S. Treasury officials. 
A top ByteDance lawyer conveyed that the Chinese company would agree to terms put forth by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel chaired by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that scrutinizes deals for potential national security risks. U.S. officials are concerned that the personal data of as many as 100 million American TikTok users could be passed on to China's Communist Party government. 
What appeared as a coup clinched by Mnuchin, a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) investment banker, did not hold. ByteDance would subsequently announce a deal under which TikTok would remain its subsidiary, contradicting Oracle and Walmart, which said the majority owners would be Americans.
ByteDance's version of the deal would also defy President Donald Trump's order last month calling for the Beijing-based company to relinquish ownership of the app in the United States. 
Four sources familiar with the frenzied negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained how a preliminary deal for TikTok announced by Trump on Saturday remains in dispute.
With ByteDance and TikTok's suitors angling for an agreement that both the United States and China can approve, key elements of what would be the social media industry's biggest-ever deal, potentially worth more than $50 billion, were not spelled out in a comprehensive contract that is typically seen in high-stakes mergers.
Instead, the companies were asked to agree in principle at breakneck speed to a CFIUS 20-page revision, awash in red font with mark-ups, to a proposal that ByteDance had submitted only four days before. If ByteDance did not have a deal by Sunday, the Commerce Department would block downloads and updates to the TikTok app.
Oracle and the Treasury declined to comment. ByteDance and Walmart did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
After Trump got assurances from Oracle and Walmart on Friday that they would create 25,000 new jobs at TikTok and a launch an educational initiative for children, he decided to announce the deal himself, without a contract drawn up or a plan for how it could be presented to bring China onboard.
He delayed the announcement until Saturday, following the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
With Trump providing scarce detail, Walmart and Oracle scrambled to issue a statement outlining the key terms of the deal as they understood them. When ByteDance then issued a statement about the deal on Monday, it conflicted with Oracle and Walmart's statement.
All the sides agree that Oracle would take a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global, a newly-created U.S. company that will house TikTok's Global business and store U.S. user data on its cloud, with Walmart Inc taking a 7.5% stake. But the fate of the remaining 80% stake in TikTok Global is in dispute.
ByteDance said it would hold an 80% stake in TikTok Global itself, until it launches an initial public offering in the next twelve months, and that it would then gradually reduce its stake. 
Oracle said on Monday that ByteDance would not have a stake in TikTok Global, and that it would be ByteDance's investors who would be awarded the remaining 80% stake. This is also how some Trump administration officials, and even a top ByteDance investor, have privately described the deal.
This discrepancy could be enough to scuttle the deal. If the Beijing-based company gets to keep a majority stake, it would represent a major reversal for the White House. If ByteDance got no stake in TikTok Global, it would be a blow to China, where officials have been opposed to stripping ByteDance of one of its most prized assets.
""The divergent messages from ByteDance and Oracle reflect the difficulty of trying to thread the needle of pleasing Washington and Beijing, if that is a needle that even exists,"" said John Kabealo, a regulatory lawyer not involved in the discussions.
SUNDAY DEADLINE
It remains unclear whether the conflicting descriptions of the deal, which still requires further CFIUS review, are the result of ambiguity in the terms or a push by ByteDance to alleviate Chinese concerns about caving in to U.S. pressure. 
One way Oracle and ByteDance had tried to minimize differences over TikTok Global's ownership is by stressing that the new company will be majority American-owned. About 41% of ByteDance's current investors are from the United States. By counting indirect U.S. ownership alongside Oracle and Walmart's direct ownership, ByteDance could claim that TikTok Global would be majority American, even if the Chinese firm owns an 80% stake.
The clock is ticking for the companies to come to terms. The Commerce Department has extended until Sunday its deadline for the companies to finalize a deal before TikTok is banned from app stores in the United States. A deal is unlikely by then, and the companies may ask for a new extension, two of the sources said.
Ownership of TikTok Global is not the only issue that has to be ironed out. While CFIUS has approved a broad plan on how Oracle will store U.S. user data and inspect TikTok's source code, details such as precise protocols for security fixes have yet to be hammered out.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted 3-2 on Wednesday to make it tougher for shareholders to push companies on issues such as climate change, social justice and diversity, with Democratic commissioners dissenting against the move.
The rule, first proposed by the SEC last November, raises the bar for submitting shareholder proposals to companies' annual ballots and increases the proportion of the vote a proposal must win before it can be resubmitted.
The SEC and corporate lobby groups have said the decades-old rules need to be modernized to stop niche issues clogging up corporate ballots - a risk that SEC chair Jay Clayton said on Wednesday could impose ""significant"" costs on companies and other shareholders. 
But the changes sparked blowback from many investors, lawmakers, and the SEC's own Democratic commissioners, who warned it would kill proposals on climate change, racial justice, and the COVID-19 pandemic just as corporate America should be confronting these problems.
""These issues are material to performance and shareholders ... Today’s rule amendments unnecessarily interfere with, and may chill, the live debate over these issues,"" said Caroline Crenshaw, the agency's new Democratic commissioner. 
Previously, an investor had to hold at least $2,000 of a company's stock for one year to file a proposal - a threshold the SEC raised to three years on Wednesday. It also raised the proportion of the vote a proposal must win in order to be resubmitted to the ballot year-on-year. 
However, the agency scrapped a highly contentious provision that would have allowed companies to exclude proposals that received falling levels of support, as first reported by Reuters. The SEC felt that change was ""not necessary,"" an official said. 
Amy Borrus, executive director at the Council of Institutional Investors, a major investor group which fought the changes, said they would weaken investor voices and result in fewer shareholder proposals.
""And that is precisely the goal of the business lobby that pressed the SEC to make these changes. Simply put, CEOs and corporate directors do not like being second-guessed by shareholders,"" she said. 
Corporate groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have pushed to rein in shareholder proposals and on Wednesday cheered the changes. The Chamber said they would help prevent ""special interest activists"" from pushing ""narrow agendas unrelated to the success of public companies.""
SEC officials said most of the proposals come from a small group of repeat filers.
""While we all have a right to get on our soapboxes, we have no right to force others to pay for them,"" said Republican Commissioner Elad Roisman, who spearheaded the rule change. 
Earlier this year, the SEC also imposed stricter rules on firms which advise investors how to vote in corporate elections, a change also backed by corporate lobbyists and panned by investor groups. 

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said Wednesday's change was a ""slap in the face to corporate accountability.""

Tesla's new battery cell — a larger cylindrical format called 4680 that can store more energy and is easier to make — is key to achieving the goal of cutting battery costs in half and ramping up battery production nearly 100-fold by 2030.
""We’re not getting into the cell business just for the hell of it, it’s because it’s the fundamental constraint"" to eventually producing 20 million vehicles a year, Musk said on Tuesday in a ""Battery Day"" presentation that disappointed investors.
Following are comments from battery experts on Musk's plans: 
Gene Berdichevsky, CEO and co-founder of battery materials manufacturer Sila Nanotechnologies and a former Tesla battery systems architect: “The most concrete, most tangible and maybe the most impactful thing is the new cell design. That’s a really good design, leading to lower manufacturing costs at the cell level. The hardest thing ever isn’t making it (the cell), the hardest thing is manufacturing it at scale.” 
Shirley Meng, a professor at the University of California San Diego: ""Most of the claims were expected, like the 4680 format, the tabless design, the silicon anode, the diversified cathode choices. I was caught by surprise by the cathode manufacturing process and the new aluminum-based alloys."" 
Gary Koenig, an associate professor at the University of Virginia: ""It seems like often people are looking for a new type of battery, but changing things like form factor can make a big difference, and a lot of the Battery Day discussion mentioned those advances. Making processing easier and faster, and even successfully making the (battery) wider or electrodes thicker, can make relatively big improvements at the larger pack level.""
""As Musk mentioned, battery electrode processing involves adding and later removing solvent, so it seems intuitively like there should be a way to cut out that step. The solvent addition really helps to blend the multiple desired components, so getting good adhesion and mixing without the solvent I expect to be challenging.""

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors charged a former U.S. employee of a Swiss energy trading firm with bribery and a Florida company pleaded guilty to bribery as a probe into corruption in energy trading widened in the United States. 
Authorities in the United States and Brazil are investigating improper payments to officials at Petrobras, Brazil's state-run oil company, as part of Brazil's far-reaching corruption probe, known as Car Wash. The latest U.S. court filings shed new light on the role of energy traders in a scheme that has led to charges against hundreds of powerful business leaders and politicians.
Petrobras said it has been collaborating with authorities since 2014 and was a victim of the schemes. 
Javier Aguilar, a former Vitol Group manager based in Houston, was charged on Tuesday with conspiracy and money laundering involving a $870,000 bribe to Ecuadorian government officials in order to win a $300 million oil contract. It marked the first indictment of an employee of a top commodities trading house in the probe. 
Aguilar, through his attorney, denied the allegations. 
The U.S. investigation mirrors efforts in Brazil, where prosecutors are also investigating people connected to trading houses Vitol,  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL], according to Brazilian court documents. The U.S. Department of Justice involvement was spurred by the involvement of U.S. banks in the alleged payments. 
Aguilar was Vitol's chief negotiator for the oil contract, according to a person familiar with the matter. Aguilar set up contracts with intermediaries in the United States to win the deal, the DOJ said in a release. 
Vitol said it was aware of the U.S. charges and is cooperating with authorities. The company has anti-bribery and corruption policies and controls in place, a spokeswoman said.
Trafigura said it has a zero tolerance policy on bribery and corruption. ""Any suggestion that Trafigura’s current management knew that its payments would be used to make improper payments to employees of Petrobras is not correct,"" Trafigura said. 
Glencore declined to comment. 
Luiz Eduardo Andrade, a Brazilian consultant, separately pleaded guilty to acting as a go-between to win contracts with Brazil's Petrobras, according to a DOJ statement. Andrade did not reply to requests for comment.
Sargeant Marine, a Florida company that once operated a joint venture with Vitol, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to working with Andrade and others to bribe officials in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela to win contracts for asphalt, an oil-byproduct. The firm will pay a $16.6 million fine, the DOJ said.
Sargeant Marine and Daniel Sargeant, the company's top executive, declined to comment through their attorneys.
Andrade and former Petrobras oil trader Rodrigo Berkowitz were arrested in the United States in December 2018 as part of Brazil's Car Wash investigations. They have been cooperating with the DOJ and Brazil prosecutors in parallel investigations targeting the oil trading houses, according to two people close to the matter in Brazil. 
Brazilian prosecutors said at the early stages of the investigation in 2018 that the details being made public were just the ""tip of the iceberg"" of an international corruption scheme in which trading firms would bribe foreign officials to win contracts.

Petrobras this year lifted a ban imposed in 2018 on dealings with traders Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's finance ministry and banking regulator extended tools to allow banks and financial intermediaries to restructure loans and other credits to clients, senior officials said Wednesday, in the government's latest push to help an ailing economy.
The measures will extend until next year several temporary rules designed to avoid defaults and loss of collateral, in what Finance Minister Arturo said was a recognition that the economy will remain fragile for some time.
""It's no longer a horizon of a few weeks,"" said Herrera, ""but a few months.""
The steps include relaxing liquidity requirements until next March, extending a capital buffer through the end of 2021, and an 18-month relief for farming credits.
Juan Pablo Graf, head of Mexican banking regulator CNBV, said he expected increases in debt delinquencies and debt stress in key industries such as tourism, which has fallen sharply since the pandemic began.
But the government does not intend to expand spending to strengthen the economy, Herrera noted, adding that he saw a slow recovery after the rapid slump during pandemic lockdown measures.
The government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has mostly maintained frugal spending since he took office nearly two years ago, opposing tax increases, new debt and bailouts for businesses.
Herrera, Lopez Obrador's second finance minister, said the government decided to extend the financial breaks due to the economic crisis.
""We now have to generate additional conditions that allow the Mexican financial system to be reorganized to continue to allow (better) terms for companies and families,"" said Herrera.

Mexico's peso suffered its steepest losses since June on Wednesday, slipping more than 3% against the dollar, on concerns spread about rising coronavirus infections in Europe.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) has agreed to pay $97 million to resolve U.S. government claims it used a purportedly independent charity to pay illegal kickbacks to cover Medicare patients' out-of-pocket costs for its pulmonary arterial hypertension drug Letairis.
The U.S. Department of Justice said on Wednesday the settlement resolves allegations that Gilead improperly used the Caring Voice Coalition as a conduit to cover thousands of patients' co-payment obligations.
Gilead's actions enabled the Foster City, California-based drugmaker to boost revenue, ran from June 2007 to December 2010, and violated the federal False Claims Act, the department said.
That law prohibits drugmakers from offering anything of value to induce Medicare patients to buy their drugs.
""Gilead used data from CVC that it knew it should not have, and effectively set up a proprietary fund within CVC to cover the co-pays of just its own drug,"" U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston said in a statement.
He said such conduct undermines Medicare's co-pay structure, which Congress meant to prevent against inflated drug prices.
Drugmakers cannot subsidize co-payments for older Americans enrolled in Medicare, but may donate to independent non-profits that provide such assistance.
In a statement, Gilead said it addressed concerns raised by the government, and does not believe it violated the law. It also said there was no allegation that patients who received medication did not need it.
Gilead's settlement resulted from an industrywide probe led by Lelling's office into drugmakers' support for so-called patient assistance charities.

Eleven drug companies including Novartis AG,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and United Therapeutics (NASDAQ:UTHR) Corp have reached more than $1 billion of settlements with the government. Four foundations and a pharmacy have also settled.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell sharply on Wednesday after data showing a cooling of U.S. business activity and the stalemate in Congress over more fiscal stimulus heightened concerns about the economy while the coronavirus pandemic remains unchecked. 
The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell more than 2%, and all 11 of the major S&P sectors closed lower. Energy (SPNY) - already the worst-performing sector this year - led the decline.
Hopes of a strong recovery and historic stimulus fueled the U.S. stock rally following the coronavirus-driven crash in March. But doubts over another relief bill and a sell-off in heavyweight technology-related stocks have weighed on sentiment since the market peaked on Sept. 2.
The economy is leveling off at about 80% of activity before the pandemic and won't get back to normal until a vaccine is in place, said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia.
""We're at that phase where it's harder to get that next bit of the recovery, that next bit of the reopening in place,"" Pride said. ""We're still doing it, but the progress is way slower than it was in the first three months of the reopening.""
Investors are struggling to understand where to invest with mega-cap tech stocks overvalued, but the deep-value stocks represent maturing industries, such as energy and brick-an- mortar banks, he said. 
""We’re spending more of our time in that sweet spot in the middle to get away from the extremes of growth,"" Pride said.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank was not planning any ""major"" changes to its Main Street Lending Program, while saying that both the Fed and Congress need to ""stay with it"" in working to bolster the economic recovery.[nW1N2FN01K]
""The longer we go without more stimulus, the harder it will be to sustain the gains in the economy,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.
Data from IHS Markit showed gains at factories were offset by a slowdown in the broader services sector in September, suggesting a loss of momentum in the economy at a time when concerns are rising about a potential surge in COVID-19 cases heading into the colder months.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department unveiled a legislative proposal, which would need congressional approval, that seeks to reform a legal immunity for internet companies and follows through on President Donald Trump's bid from earlier this year to crack down on tech giants.
Wall Street favorites including Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet Inc (L:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which have borne the brunt of recent losses, again declined at a rate exceeding losses of the benchmark S&P 500. A decline in  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) came in below the S&P drop.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), another recent Wall Street darling, tumbled after Chief Executive Elon Musk failed to impress with his promise to cut electric vehicle costs at the company's much-awaited ""Battery Day"" event on Tuesday.

Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 523.93 points, or 1.92%, to 26,764.25, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 78.58 points, or 2.37%, to 3,236.99, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 330.65 points, or 3.02%, to 10,632.99.  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) surged to a record high as its digital sales, especially in North America, helped offset a fall in sales at traditional brick-and-mortar stores.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - TikTok asked a U.S. judge on Wednesday to block a Trump administration order that would require Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) to remove the short video-sharing app for new downloads starting on Sunday.
A federal judge in San Francisco on Saturday issued a preliminary injunction blocking a similar Commerce Department order from taking effect on Sunday on Tencent Holdings' (HK:0700) WeChat app.
U.S. officials have expressed serious concerns that the personal data of as many as 100 million Americans that use the app was being passed on to China’s Communist Party government.
On Saturday, the Commerce Department announced a one-week delay in the TikTok order, citing ""recent positive developments"" in talks over the fate of its U.S. operations.
TikTok said the restrictions ""were not motivated by a genuine national security concern, but rather by political considerations relating to the upcoming general election.""
TikTok said if the order is not blocked ""hundreds of millions of Americans who have not yet downloaded TikTok will be shut out of this large and diverse online community - six weeks before a national election.""
TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, said on Monday it will own 80% of TikTok Global, a newly created U.S. company that will own most of the app’s operations worldwide. ByteDance added that TikTok Global will become its subsidiary.
 Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT) have agreed to take stakes in TikTok Global of 12.5% and 7.5%, respectively. On Monday, Oracle said ByteDance’s ownership of TikTok would be distributed to ByteDance’s investors, and that the Beijing-based firm would have no stake in TikTok Global.
On Saturday, ByteDance, Walmart and Oracle said they reached an agreement that would to allow TikTok to continue to operate in the United States after President Donald Trump said he had blessed the deal.
Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 14 giving ByteDance 90 days to relinquish ownership of TikTok.

Investing.com -- Selling accelerated in late afternoon trading on Wednesday as investors took in conflicting news on Covid-19 and tech stocks tumbled.
Confidence in the economic recovery is faltering, with signs of a new surge in virus cases in Europe and parts of the U.S. that threatens to halt progress even as public health leaders talked positively about the prospects of a vaccine. Federal Reserve officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, said Wednesday that further fiscal stimulus is needed to advance the recovery, but Congress remains deadlocked.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) dropped more than 4% in the afternoon, dragging the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and NASDAQ Composite along with it. Tech-heavy Nasdaq is down nearly 10% for the month.
Several earnings reports are due out Thursday, along with the weekly jobless claims numbers and new home sales. Wall Street continues to pump out newly public companies.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Earnings reports highlight the winners and losers from the pandemic economy
Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST)'s prospects look bright for the quarter as people stocked their pantry shelves and had more meals and snacks at home. Earnings per share are expected to be $2.83 on revenue of $52 billion.
Restaurant chain operator Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI) is expected to feel the pinch of reduced service in its eateries, which include Olive Garden. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect EPS of 5 cents on revenue of $1.56 billion.
One thing people did do was shop online for used cars during the months since the pandemic erupted.  CarMax Inc  (NYSE:KMX) is expected to report EPS of $1.03 on revenue of $5.1 billion.
2. New home sales for August and jobless claims
Households also reconsidered their place of residence during the pandemic, weighing the options of remote versus in-person schooling and the extra space suburban living offers over urban apartments. New home sales for August, which will be reported at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) are expected to be in the neighborhood of 895,000, about even with July.
Initial jobless claims, reported at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) are expected to be around 840,000 for last week, not much different than the week before. Continuing claims, which are reported at the same time, are expected to be around 12.3 million.
3. IPOs continue to pop, but can they maintain their momentum?
A flurry of recent stock debuts has investors buzzing, but it remains to be seen whether these freshly minted public companies can maintain their lofty valuations after the IPO party dies down. On Wednesday, Goodrx Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:GDRX) popped 40% after raising $1.14 billion in its IPO. The company sold shares at $33 in the IPO and they opened at $46. Bentley Systems Inc (NASDAQ:BSY) also jumped 37% after its $22 a share IPO, which raised $236 million.
GoodRx's IPO success comes on the heels of IPOs by Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW) and  Unity Software Inc  (NYSE:U). More IPOs are scheduled in the coming days.
Corsair Gaming Inc (NASDAQ:CRSR) sank 11% on Wednesday after the gaming component maker raised $238 million.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Airline Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) came under broad criticism in Colombia for paying its top two executives $6 million in bonuses in May, at a time when the carrier had furloughed most of its employees without pay and was preparing a bankruptcy filing. 
According to bankruptcy court documents submitted by Avianca itself, the airline paid Chief Executive Anco van der Werff $3.7 million and paid Chief Financial Officer Adrian Neuhauser $2.8 million on May 6. 
Five days later, the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S.
""Avianca is facing the most challenging crisis in our 100-year history,"" van der Werff said at the time. 
On Wednesday, Avianca defended the bonuses, saying they were necessary ""as an incentive for the company's management team to continue to provide services to Avianca."" 
In court filings, it also said its key executives would have sought employment elsewhere without the extra pay. 
During the pandemic, Avianca took more radical payroll cutting measures than its rivals, asking the majority of its 20,000 employees to take unpaid leaves. Its main rival LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM) slashed employees by half instead. 
Avianca and most Latin American airlines have not received government bailouts like their peers in the U.S. or Europe, whose governments have mandated that executives forfeit bonuses in exchange for aid. Colombia's government has, however, proposed a loan of more than $300 million to help get Avianca out of bankruptcy. 
News of the bonuses was first reported by local TV station Noticias Caracol. 
The May bonuses were at least the second round of bonuses paid that year, documents show, although Avianca said some of that money was in reality tied to 2019 performance. 
On March 18, just days after the coronavirus pandemic led to the cancellation of almost all air travel in Latin America, van der Werff and Neuhauser received $3 million in bonuses combined.
A day later, Avianca said the rapidly evolving pandemic had led it to ""take immediate and difficult decisions"" including ""the implementation of unpaid work leaves as soon as possible."" 
Rivals Ryanair and British Airways, which have not filed for bankruptcy, have also come under scrutiny for proposing bonuses that were significantly more modest than Avianca's.

Executives at a subsidiary of Lufthsansa, Austrian Airlines, eventually gave back bonuses last month, after Austria's finance minister said the payments were ""unacceptable"" for a company that was being rescued.

(Reuters) - Playboy Enterprises is nearing a deal to go public through a merger with  Mountain Crest Acquisition  Corp (O:MCAC), which would value the owner of Playboy magazine at around $425 million, including debt, people familiar with the matter said. 
A tie-up with Mountain Crest would result in Playboy's return to the stock market, nine years after it went private in a $207 million deal led by its late founder Hugh Hefner and private equity firm Rizvi Traverse Management.
Mountain Crest, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), could announce a deal with Playboy by the end of this month, the sources said on Wednesday, cautioning that talks could still collapse. 
Mountain Crest is in discussions with investors who would contribute around $100 million to the deal in the form of a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, transaction, the sources said. 
The sources requested anonymity as the discussions are private. A Playboy representative declined to comment. Mountain Crest Chief Executive Suying Liu had no comment when contacted by phone. Executives at Rizvi Traverse did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Reuters reported last week that Playboy was exploring going public through a SPAC merger. The New York Post reported the exclusive talks with Mountain Crest on Tuesday.
Mountain Crest raised $50 million in an initial public offering earlier this year with the goal of buying a private company, which would then become public as a result of the deal. SPACs have emerged in 2020 as an increasingly popular route to public markets over a traditional IPO.
Playboy earlier this year stopped printing its flagship magazine, ending a nearly seven-decade run on newsstands that began in 1953 with a debut issue featuring Marilyn Monroe. 

The company has expanded beyond its media business to refashion itself as a lifestyle brand and is eyeing expansion into sexual wellness.

Volkswagen is due to sign the settlement deal in Sao Paulo on Thursday, according to a report by German broadcasters NDR, SWR and the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Volkswagen was not immediately available to comment.
A government-appointed commission investigating abuses during Brazil's dictatorship found evidence that companies including Volkswagen secretly helped the military identify suspected ""subversives"" and union activists on their payrolls.
Many of the workers were then fired, detained or harassed by police, and were unable to find new jobs for years afterward, a Reuters investigation showed in 2014.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 01:50PM ET</span>",California to ban sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles in 2035,"By David Shepardson and Nichola Groom
WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California will ban the sale of new gasoline powered passenger cars and trucks starting in 2035 in a dramatic move to shift to electric vehicles and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Governor Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday.
""This is the most impactful step our state can take to fight climate change,"" Newsom said in a statement announcing his executive order. ""For too many decades, we have allowed cars to pollute the air that our children and families breathe. You deserve to have a car that doesn’t give your kids asthma... Cars shouldn’t melt glaciers or raise sea levels threatening our cherished beaches and coastlines.""
California is the largest U.S. auto market, accounting for about 11% of all U.S. vehicle sales, and many states choose to adopt its green vehicle mandates.
Newsom also wants the state legislature to stop issuing new permits by 2024 allowing use of hydraulic fracturing technology for oil and gas drilling. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to bar California from requiring sale of electric vehicles, while his rival Joe Biden has pledged to spend billions to speed the adoption of electric vehicles.
California said it was joining 15 countries that have made similar pledges, including Britain.
Newsom said the California Air Resources Board (CARB) will develop regulations to mandate that 100% of in-state sales of new passenger cars and trucks are zero-emission by 2035, which would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 35%. The board also plans to mandate by 2045 that all operations of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles be zero emission where feasible.
Newsom's executive order will not prevent Californians from owning gasoline-powered cars or selling them on the used car market.  
In response to a record wildfire season in the state, Newsom earlier this month said California needed to ""fast track"" its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. ""Across the entire spectrum, our goals are inadequate to the reality we are experiencing,"" he said on Sept. 11 while touring a burned area in the state.
California and nearly two dozen other U.S. states sued the Trump administration seeking to block the government from undoing California’s authority to set strict car pollution rules and rolling back nationwide emissions standard.

The Trump administration has been waging a multi-pronged battle to counter California's efforts to fight climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses from vehicles.

Addressing a trade conference streamed online, David Satterfield said debts owed by government hospitals to pharmaceutical companies in the United States and elsewhere had risen to around $2.3 billion from some $230 million a year ago.
Satterfield said U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had raised the issue with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak a year ago and was assured that arrangements would be made for prompt payment.
A year later those companies were being asked to accept significant reductions in the amounts owed, Satterfield said, adding there will be consequences for non-payment of debt or reductions in payment.
""Companies will consider departing the Turkish market or will reduce exposure to Turkish market. This is not a direction which serves the interests of Turkey,"" he said.
Bilateral trade amounted to some $21 billion last year and the NATO allies have said they aim to lift that to $100 billion.
Yet there are hurdles including U.S. tariffs on Turkish steel, and Ankara's purchase of Russian missile defences last year that prompted Washington to oust Turkey from a consortium producing F-35 jets. 
At Tuesday's conference hosted by the U.S.-Turkey Business Council, Turkish Trade Minister Ruhsar Pekcan said the steel tariffs and the removal of Turkey from a U.S. trade preference programme have damaged efforts to reach the trade goal.
""Such policies by the U.S. severely limit Turkish firms' ability to enter the U.S. market,"" she said.
Satterfield also voiced concern over a law adopted in July that Erdogan's party says will make mostly U.S. social media sites more accountable to Turkish authorities' concerns over content. Critics say it will silence dissent.

""A policy that mandates large social media firms to store consumer data only in Turkey can create an inherently uneven playing field,"" he said, adding it could ultimately compel U.S. firms to leave the market.

972,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",Eight more Volkswagen employees charged in diesel scandal,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Wednesday they had charged another eight employees of auto maker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) over the scandal surrounding cheating on diesel engine emission tests.
The eight are accused of fraud, false certification and violation of the law against unfair competition, the prosecutor's office in the northern town of Braunschweig said in a statement.
Some are also alleged to be responsible for embezzlement and tax evasion, or for aiding and abetting those crimes.
Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to having used illegal engine control software to cheat U.S. pollution tests, triggering a global backlash against diesel and costing the carmaker billions of euros in fines.
The eight are accused of being involved in the diesel manipulation between November 2006 and September 2015.
The are accused of encouraging, supporting or at least not preventing the installation of illegal software in the engine management system of diesel vehicles produced by Volkswagen despite knowing it was illegal.
The same charges were already brought against six other VW managers earlier this year, while former Volkswagen boss Martin Winterkorn and four other managers were charged in connection with the scandal last year.

The first trial in the Volkswagen case in Germany starts next week - that of former Audi chief executive Rupert Stadler.

(Reuters) - Shares of private equity-backed GoodRx Holdings Inc (O:GDRX) surged 40% in their debut on the Nasdaq on Wednesday after the online prescription drug platform raised $1.14 billion in its initial public offering.
The stock opened at $46, compared to the IPO price of $33 per share. At its opening price, the company is valued at nearly $18 billion, more than six times the valuation it commanded during its last private fundraise in 2018.
GoodRx's shares hit a session high of $49.57, a jump of over 50%.
The company, which counts PE firm Silver Lake among its biggest backers, sold about 34.6 million shares. It had initially set a target range between $24 and $28 per share.
GoodRx's debut comes on the heels of the successful IPOs of data warehouse company  Snowflake Inc  (N:SNOW) and  Unity Software Inc  (N:U), underscoring investor appetite for new stocks which promise rapid revenue growth.
Moreover, shelter-in-place restrictions to control the pandemic have prompted people to turn to virtual consultations and online purchases of medicines, benefiting companies like GoodRx, which is also one of the few startups to be profitable at the time of its IPO. 
""Healthcare companies have been the most active segment of the IPO market this year,"" said Kathleen Smith of IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. 
""Investors had a strong interest in GoodRx due to its 50%+ revenue growth and superior 40%+ EBITDA margins.""
GoodRx posted $257 million in revenue for the first six months of 2020, up from $173 million a year earlier. Net income totaled $55 million, compared with $31 million last year.
The California-based company gathers information for more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies to track drug prices and offers discount coupons. It makes money by charging fees to partnering pharmacy benefits managers.
Silver Lake owned a 35.3% stake in the company before the offering, GoodRx's filing https:// showed.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Nearly two-thirds of U.S. energy company executives polled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas believe U.S. crude oil production has peaked, according to a survey released on Wednesday.
The COVID-19 pandemic has knocked global oil demand and prices, prompting deep cuts in drilling this year by shale oil producers. The United States last pumped 12.2 million barrels per day, taking top spot in global crude oil output. 
Survey results said 66% of 154 oil and gas firm executives contacted by the Dallas Fed this month believe U.S. crude oil production has peaked. The survey includes executives from Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. 
The Dallas Fed did not say if the peak was considered temporary or permanent as major oil firms have been discussing. 
Global demand destruction during the COVID-19 pandemic, work from home policies and the continued growth of electric vehicles has energy companies looking to a prolonged downturn in crude oil and fuel consumption. 
Earlier this year,  BP  Plc (L:BP) said the pandemic would reduce demand by 3 million barrels per day (bpd) through 2025 and forecast a peak in demand between 2019 and 2050, according to the company's energy outlook.
Nearly three-quarters of executives from 148 oil and gas firms told the Dallas Fed that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would have a bigger role in determining the price of crude oil going forward. 

Executives surveyed, on average, expect the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (CLc1) to be $43.27 a barrel by the end of 2020. On Wednesday, WTI was up 36 cents at $40.16 a barrel.

Mountain Valley said that would allow it to complete as many activities as possible before winter, according to a filing with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) late on Tuesday.
FERC suspended work on Mountain Valley in October 2019 due to litigation over the project's Biological Opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which allows the project to work in areas inhabited by endangered and threatened species.
The FWS issued a new Biological Opinion in early September.
Analysts at ClearView Energy Partners said on Wednesday they expect FERC will allow Mountain Valley to resume construction even though some environmental groups and others will oppose the return to work and the new Biological Opinion.
U.S. pipeline company  Equitrans Midstream  Corp (N:ETRN), one of the partners in Mountain Valley, said in early September it expects the pipeline to enter service in early 2021.
Mountain Valley is one of several U.S. oil and gas pipelines delayed by regulatory and legal fights with environmental and local groups that found problems with federal permits issued by the Trump administration.
In February 2018, when Equitrans started construction of the 303-mile (488-km) pipeline designed to deliver 2 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale, it estimated Mountain Valley would cost about $3.5 billion and be completed by the end of 2018.
Equitrans has said it expects to receive new approvals soon from FERC and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that will enable it to finish building the last 8% of the project.
Mountain Valley is owned by units of Equitrans,  NextEra Energy Inc  (N:NEE), Consolidated Edison Inc (N:ED),  AltaGas Ltd  (TO:ALA) and  RGC Resources Inc  (O:RGCO).

(Reuters) - New Jersey regulators on Wednesday approved Public Service Electric and Gas Co's (PSE&G) plan to invest $1 billion on energy efficiency programs over the next three years.
Parent company Public Service Enterprise Group Inc (PSEG) (N:PEG) Chief Executive Ralph Izzo told Reuters the investments would cut customer bills by about $1 billion and stimulate economic growth by creating up to 4,300 jobs that will help the state recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
PSE&G is the biggest power and gas company in New Jersey.
Izzo said the investment will also drive ""significant progress"" toward achieving New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy’s clean energy agenda by avoiding 8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) through 2050.
New Jersey wants all of its electricity to come from non carbon emitting sources, like renewables and nuclear, by 2050.
PSEG said in July that it expects to sell its non-nuclear generating plants in 2021. That generation includes more than 6,700 megawatts (MW) of fossil-fired generation in New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and Maryland, and over 400 MW of solar power in various states.
""Our CO2 emissions (from power plants) are going to drop to zero by the end of 2021 as we exit the fossil generation business,"" Izzo said, noting the only big power plants the company plans to keep are the nuclear reactors, which produce about 90% of the New Jersey's carbon-free energy.

Izzo also said PSEG would decide over the next month or so on whether to invest in Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) A/S' (CO:ORSTED) planned 1,100-MW offshore wind farm off the coast of New Jersey, which is expected to cost about $1.6 billion and enter service in 2024.

LONDON (Reuters) - Struggling oil and gas producer  Premier Oil  (L:PMO) has begun talks with  BP  (L:BP) to lower for the second time a $210 million deal to acquire stakes in two North Sea oilfields, sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
Premier is seeking to reduce the cash payment to BP by $70 to $80 million while it attempts to raise $530 million in order to pay for the acquisition and restructure a debt pile of almost $2 billion, three sources close to the talks told Reuters.
The effort comes as Premier is also in talks with rival private equity-backed North Sea producer Chrysaor for an alternative funding option.
Both BP and Premier Oil declined to comment.
This is the second time Premier has asked BP to sweeten the terms of the $625 million deal announced in January 2020.
In June, following the collapse of oil and gas prices due to the coronavirus epidemic, BP agreed to reduce Premier's cash payment to a total of $210 million and retain costs associated with the abandonment of the Andrew and Shearwater fields.
Premier Oil's CEO Tony Durrant expected the cashflow from the acquisition to help lower the company's ballooning debt which dwarfs its market cap of 153 million pounds ($194.75 million) as of Wednesday. 
The acquisition of the BP fields will help push Premier's output to 100,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day from around 67,000 boe/d currently.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. airline chief executives and labor leaders redoubled calls on Wednesday for lawmakers to urgently pass another $25 billion in payroll aid, though hopes for a deal this month were dwindling as lawmakers shifted focus to a political battle over a Supreme Court vacancy.
The industry has been hoping that the U.S. Congress will approve a $1.5 trillion coronavirus relief package with another round of airline payroll support before mass furloughs in the aviation sector on Oct. 1, when a current package expires.
Airlines, weathering their toughest crisis ever, want to keep workers off the unemployment lines until the pandemic subsides, arguing that airline service is essential for an economic recovery.
""Everyone agrees that makes sense,"" American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Chief Executive Doug Parker said on the MSNBC program ""Morning Joe.""
Also speaking on the talk show, International President of Flight Attendants-CWA President Sara Nelson said: ""Everyone is for this program, including the White House. No one wants to see these mass layoffs on Oct. 1, so we just need to get this done now.""
But a fight over the Supreme Court seat left open by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday has derailed prospects for relief this month, said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute, a Virginia-based think tank.
""The airline bailout matters relatively little to the Congress compared with the current debate over a Ginsburg successor. Before the SCOTUS (U.S. Supreme Court) fight, there might have been some common ground. But when the system is super-polarized, compromise is impossible.""
Thompson said prospects for both a broader bill with an airline component and a standalone bill introduced by two key Republican senators on Monday were dim.
Speaking on CNBC on Wednesday, Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) CEO Gary Kelly said he is ""hopeful"" that Washington lawmakers can reach an agreement on more aid for airlines, while warning against hopes for a quick recovery.
Southwest's business over the past two months has remained down about 70% from a year ago, Kelly said, adding: ""There is no reason to believe that things are going to improve any time soon.""

""We're all ready for this to be behind us, but realistically it's not surprising. We have a pandemic and we've got a ways to go.""

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares slumped in early Wall Street trading as investors and analysts tried to make sense of Chief Executive Elon Musk's highly technical ""Battery Day"" presentation that set lofty targets but was hazy on near-term execution.
Tesla shares slumped 7.5% in early Wednesday trading, wiping out more than $30 billion in market value from Tuesday's close. Analysts and investors divided over whether Musk can deliver on his visions of novel, proprietary Tesla batteries that could make electric cars competitive with mass market, petroleum-fueled cars. 
Some analysts praised Tesla's impressive technology, capacity and cost targets. But others said Musk's promises lacked substance and questioned the three-year timeline he outlined for delivering the promised breakthroughs. Musk acknowledged that some of Tesla's ambitious technology is proving ""insanely difficult"" to manufacture at high volume.
Investors had expected two big announcements from Musk: the development of a ""million mile"" battery good for 10 years or more, and a specific cost-reduction target - expressed in dollars per kilowatt-hour - that would finally drop the price of an electric vehicle below that of a gasoline car.
They got neither from the event, with Musk promising a $25,000 car three years down the line that would ""basically be on par"" with a gasoline car. Musk has promised such a car for years.
Analysts from Swiss banking group UBS said that promise came with risks. 
""By the time (the car) arrives, there will be significant competition in the segment, from VW group, amongst others,"" the bank's analysts wrote in a note to clients. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) on Wednesday unveiled its latest electric vehicle, the ID.4 sport utility and said it would be priced to sell in the United States for thousands less than a Tesla Model Y SUV.
Tesla has yet to deliver a previously promised $35,000 Model 3 sedan. The lowest-range version of that car currently retails for nearly $38,000 in the United States, with narrow profit margins generally making inexpensive cars unattractive to automakers.
Analysts also criticized that it would take at least another year to see some of Tesla's battery innovations in production. Musk said the company was starting to ramp up the production of larger, more energy-dense cells at a California pilot facility, but acknowledged the process was not yet fully working.
At $305, the average target price among the 33 brokerages who follow the company is another $100 lower and several brokerages emphasized that expectations for what the company could deliver were already out of whack with reality as the global economy heads into a potentially long-lasting recession. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said Musk had shown substantial progress, but also laid bare the scale of the task in front of the company. 
""Elon can't do it alone ... Tesla needs help to get there,"" its analysts wrote, saying governments, suppliers, investors and engineering talent would have to support the company's mission.
Jed Dorsheimer, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said Tesla's challenges to scale batteries and manufacturing capacity at affordable rates showed Tesla was a modern day auto, rather than a tech company with high valuations.
Tesla's Battery Day did yield some positive reviews, however. 

Analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said the three-year plan for achieving 56% reduction in battery costs could materially boost Tesla's volume and margin outlook. The brokerage moved from the sidelines to assign a ""buy"" rating on the stock, and raised its price target to $500 from $400.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 12:16PM ET</span>",California outpaced Trump's Forest Service in wildfire prevention work: data,"By Nichola Groom
(Reuters) - While more than half of California’s forests fall under federal management, the U.S. Forest Service consistently spends fewer dollars than the state in managing those lands to reduce wildfire risks, a Reuters data analysis reveals. 
The relative spending by federal and state forest authorities undermines President Donald Trump’s repeated attempts to blame deadly wildfires on a failure by California to clear its forests of dead wood and other debris.
""You gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests... I've been telling them this now for three years... they don't listen to us,"" Trump said at a rally last month.
In fact, the bulk of California’s forest management falls under federal jurisdiction, with the U.S. Forest Service owning 57% of California’s 33 million acres of forests. Yet, for the fiscal year 2020, the agency spent $151 million treating 235,000 acres with practices like controlled burns meant to reduce wildfire risks, according to figures provided by the service. 
By contrast, California’s government spent $200 million on forest management work, and oversaw treatment of 393,282 acres of state-run and privately-held land, according to figures provided by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The Forest Service suspended its wildfire-prevention efforts for six weeks this spring, saying it was concerned about the safety of its personnel during the coronavirus pandemic. State fire officials at the time decried the move as risky. (Story here https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-wildfires/trump-administration-halts-wildfire-prevention-tool-in-california-over-coronavirus-idUSKCN21X1HD)
""We need the federal government to really come in and spend at a much more significant level and make a real investment,"" said Jessica Morse, deputy secretary for forest resources management with the California Natural Resources Agency. ""Because they own this forestland."" 
The number of acres treated by the U.S. Forest Service in California during fiscal 2020 was the second lowest under Trump’s administration, and 40% below a recent peak of 424,486 acres treated in the state during the last year of the Obama administration, according to the data.
Just over half of the acreage burned in wildfires in the state since 2015 has been on federal lands belonging to the Forest Service and other agencies, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the National Interagency Fire Center.
The Forest Service declined to comment, but directed Reuters to an agreement it inked with California last month to treat 500,000 acres per year each in the state by 2025. Last week before Congress, a senior forest service official said the federal government should dramatically increase its fire prevention efforts in California.
A White House official would not comment.
MORE MONEY
As concerns mounted about more frequent and severe seasonal fires, California ramped up its annual spending on forest fire prevention work to $200 million in the 2018 fiscal year from $40 million, according to a 2018 state report.
The U.S. Forest Service said it expects to spend around $250 million a year under its agreement with the state to treat half a million acres a year.
Scientists have said climate change is worsening natural disasters like wildfires, droughts, floods and storms by adding heat to the atmosphere and altering weather patterns. 
Trump’s administration has downplayed the impact of climate change, voiced doubts on the science of global warming, loosened environmental regulations and advocated for boosting U.S. production of fossil fuels.
California officials say some of the state's recent forest management efforts have shown evidence of helping slow the spread of the megafires currently burning on federal land.
This month's massive Creek Fire burning in the Sierra National Forest, for instance, became easier to fight when it spilled into utility-owned lands on which state fire and utility crews had removed dead trees and performed controlled burns in the last two years, according to Ryan Stewart, forester for Southern California Edison's 20,000 acres near its Big Creek hydroelectric power plant.
""The fuels weren't there,"" Stewart said in an interview, estimating the work saved thousands of acres from the fire.
California estimates that 9 million acres of U.S. Forest Service lands in the state need treatment to maintain forest health, according to a policy document from 2018 prepared by representatives from several state agencies.
About 163 million trees have died in the state in the last decade due to drought and bark beetle infestation, mainly in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, creating huge swaths of flammable material, according to a 2019 Forest Service survey.
Last week, a Forest Service official said the agency needed to double or triple its efforts in the fire-prone state.

“We're working really hard but we know it's not nearly enough,"" Chris French, national forest system deputy chief, said in testimony before the Senate Committee on Natural Resources. ""In places like California it means treating two to three times more acres per year than our current actions.""

Investing.com --  Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX) fell 16% after reporting a bigger loss than forecast, but not everyone's Debbie Downer on it.
The online retailer that sends boxes of clothes selected by stylists (known as Fixes) reported a loss per share of 44 cents compares to the expected loss of 16 cents. Revenue of $443.41 million beat the estimated $414.55 million, and active clients of 3.5 million represented an increase of 9% year-over-year.
Analysts diverged on the results, with some raising their price targets and others cutting.
KeyBanc is one firm that raised its price target, to $32 from $28, with consumers turning to specialty retail and away from department stores. Analyst Edward Yruma also expects the direct buy segment -- where customers pick and choose their own items -- to drive incremental sales, StreetInsider said. Plus, most obviously, the core Fix business remains strong.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), on the other hand, sees first quarter margins challenged as the company invests in inventory and marketing. Analyst Ike Boruchow reiterated his equal weight rating and $18 price target as the company pulled back on  marketing during the epidemic, leading to a loss of repeat customers, according to StreetInsider.
On the company's earnings call, Mike Smith, chief operating officer and interim chief financial officer, said, ""We're playing catch up to support the renewed surge in client demand. As such, in Q1, we expect to deliver mid- to high single-digit revenue growth, which reflects robust recent demand trends, offset by lower subsequent Fix volume I just mentioned. It also reflects some of the benefit from our new client growth moving into Q2.""

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf has apologized for making insensitive remarks around race and diversity, seeking to quell a row over his references to a shortage of talent among minority groups.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Scharf had exasperated some Black employees in a Zoom meeting this summer when he reiterated that the bank had trouble reaching diversity goals because there were not enough qualified minority candidates. 
He also made the assertion in a company-wide memo on June 18 that announced diversity initiatives as nationwide protests broke out following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man, in police custody.
""There are many talented diverse individuals working at Wells Fargo and throughout the financial services industry and I never meant to imply otherwise,"" Scharf said in a statement on Wednesday.
""Across the industry, we have not done enough to improve diversity, especially at senior leadership levels."" 
The remarks on a shortage of candidates were widely criticized after the Reuters report was published on Tuesday. 
""Perhaps it's the CEO of Wells Fargo who lacks the talent to recruit Black workers,"" U.S. Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet.
Scharf listed a handful of appointments the bank has made recently as evidence of its commitment to diversity and went on to lay out details of the steps it was taking to recruit more from minorities.
As the head of the largest U.S. bank by number of employees, he has pledged to double the number of Black leaders over five years and tied executive compensation to reaching diversity goals.
He has also told hiring managers to consider diverse candidates for high-paying roles that are vacant and to ensure diversity on interview teams.
""Anyone who's open to re-evaluating their position, their perspective and taking into consideration a new set of facts, you have to give him the benefit of the doubt,"" said Teri McClure, a former executive with  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) who had been among those criticizing Scharf on Tuesday.
""The Wells Fargo team should use that as an opportunity to move forward,"" she added.
Since Scharf joined the bank a little less than a year ago, it has added two Black executives to its operating committee - Lester Owens as head of operations and Ather Williams (NYSE:WMB) as head of strategy, digital and innovation.

""There is no question Wells Fargo has to make meaningful progress to increase diverse representation,"" Scharf said on Wednesday.

“Our actions were in no way an attempt to relieve pain on Wall Street,” Powell said Wednesday in a hearing before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. “We’ve done basically all of the things that we can think of.”
The Fed chief added, “we’re looking to do more.”
Powell defended the Fed’s Main Street Lending Program, which has been slow to start and seen little uptake from small-to-medium sized businesses.
“The current facility would not work for much smaller loans,” Powell said in answer to questions from the subcommittee. “We’d have to start a new facility that had much less protection for the taxpayer.”
Powell has a busy week of testimony before Congress. He was grilled along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Tuesday on the need for more stimulus to shore up the U.S. economy’s recovery from the coronavirus slump.
The Fed’s Main Street program was also a focus of Tuesday’s hearing.
On Thursday, Powell and Mnuchin are scheduled to testify together again -- this time before a Senate committee on the economic response to the pandemic.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), the world's top meatpacker, said on Wednesday it plans to combat destruction in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by monitoring its entire supply chain for deforestation by 2025, as pressure mounts from environmentalists and investors.
Brazilian meatpackers are facing increasing criticism that beef production is fueling deforestation in the Amazon, where cleared land is often used for cattle pasture.
The move is part of a broader set of environmental actions announced by JBS on Wednesday as it launched a 1 billion-real ($182.77 million) fund to foster social and economic development in the Amazon.
The company aims to invest 250 million reais in the fund in its first five years and may invest more 250 million by 2030, depending on donations, global CEO Gilberto Tomazoni said in an interview. Third-party companies are expected to join the project and invest up to 500 million reais.
It comes as deforestation soars. Last year, in the worst destruction for over a decade, an area the size of Lebanon was cut out of the world's largest rainforest - a vital bulwark against climate change.
JBS, along with other major Brazilian meatpackers, has worked to ensure it does not buy cattle from farms that have cut down the forest without permission, but has previously only monitored the final ranch that sells to them. 
Ranches further down the chain, so-called indirect suppliers, have avoided these checks, meaning cattle can be easily ""laundered"" from illegally cleared pastures to farms with no environmental record that then sell to slaughterhouses like JBS.
JBS said it plans to monitor 100% of its indirect cattle suppliers by 2025, using blockchain.
""Currently, the company does not monitor indirect suppliers and no company does so. But we plan to close this gap using technology,"" Tomazoni said, adding its 50,000 direct suppliers are already monitored.
The company plans to use information provided by its suppliers to monitor indirect suppliers, aiming to launch the system in 2021, starting in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso.
KLP, Norway's largest pension fund with $80 billion under management, said it would be watching for concrete results. 

""If this move by JBS can contribute to responsible and traceable supply chains, it is a positive step but we have to see the detailed evidence in practice,"" the fund, which does not own JBS stock and is among a group of the most active global investors threatening to pull out of Brazil-linked investments if the country doesn’t act to curb deforestation.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The brand of online Russian bank Tinkoff will live on despite its proposed sale to technology giant  Yandex  (O:YNDX), the bank's founder said on Wednesday, reiterating his pledge to stay with the business.
TCS Group (L:TCSq), the parent company of Tinkoff, is in talks to sell the bank to internet group Yandex for $5.48 billion in a deal seen as largely positive for both companies.
Oleg Tinkov, the founder of TCS Group who has been battling acute leukaemia and had a bone marrow transplant in July, said that nothing would change for Tinkoff clients who would only benefit from the deal.
""This is not a sale, but rather a merger,"" Tinkov posted on his Instagram account.
Analysts agree that synergies are on the table should Tinkoff become part of Yandex's stable of technological services, including data and product offering. 
The rationale for Tinkoff Bank is to build into Yandex's digital ecosystem with access to its more than 60 million unique users - potential Tinkoff Bank clients, said Alfa Bank in a note.
Tinkoff is currently the world's largest online-only bank with more than 10 million customers across Russia.
""We think the deal is positive for TCS business although minority shareholders should fight for a higher price,"" analysts at Renaissance Capital said, adding that TCS' capitalisation now stands at around a quarter of Yandex's.
The proposed price for the deal, a cash and share consideration worth $27.64 per Tinkoff share, represents an 8% premium to Tinkoff's GDR price as of Sept. 21. 
The deal announcement pushed Yandex shares (MM:YNDX) as much as 15% higher on Wednesday but caused a sell-off in TCS GDR's (MM:TCSGDR) in Moscow. In London, TCS GDRs were up 5.8% at $27.50 per piece. 
The proposed deal nonetheless brings challenges, exposing Yandex to the retail lending sector and requiring a boost to the tech group's management, Renaissance Capital said.
""Credit risks of the banking business will be added to Yandex's general business risk profile,"" BCS Brokerage said.
The deal is also subject to shareholder approval.

""The scenario in which a significant part of TCS's minority shareholders would not tender their shares and keep TCS a listed company is likely,"" said VTB Capital analysts.

Vacancies worldwide are expected to peak at 15.6% in 2022, with about 95.8 million square feet (8.9 million square meters) of space emptying over the next two years. That’s more than during the 2008 financial crisis, when tenants abandoned 85 million square feet of offices, the real estate services firm said Wednesday.
It’ll be 2025 before office markets rebound to their pre-Covid levels, when vacancies worldwide averaged 10.9%, according to the report. The pressures and pace of recovery will vary regionally as the persistence of job losses and remote working reduce space needs in North America and Europe, while the new-supply pipeline in Asia’s developing economies grows faster than jobs.
“We expect vacancies to increase everywhere,” Rebecca Rockey, Cushman’s global head of forecasting, said in an interview. “It’s just that the underlying dynamics causing this change are a bit different from the West versus the East.”
The firm’s outlook -- developed to help its clients time the market to negotiate leases -- assumes businesses will need common space to foster the innovation, productivity and teamwork that are hard to sustain when everyone works remotely.
It’s a theme echoed by executives of some of the world’s biggest financial and technology companies, who are campaigning to get employees to return to the office. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has said an extended stretch of working from home could bring economic and social damage.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>","SEC to vote on expanded tipster program to consider more bounties, but with heightened conditions","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday will finalize new conditions for its whistleblower bounty program, which will result in rewards being issued faster and some rewards rising in value, agency officials said. 
They added that the changes aim to ensure that eligible whistleblowers automatically get the current maximum 30% award of the resulting fine, a presumption that is not the case under current rules.
The new conditions, first proposed by the agency in 2018, would give staff more discretion to dish out rewards under the program taking into consideration a number of new factors. 
These include the significance of the tipster's information; the level of assistance they offer the SEC; the severity of the alleged misconduct; and the whistleblower's level of involvement in internal compliance systems. 
Even with these new considerations, SEC Chair Jay Clayton told reporters that he expected most rewards to ""stay the same or increase, and to be able to issue them faster.""
Created following the 2009 financial crisis, the program allows the SEC to reward tipsters whose original information leads to a penalty exceeding $1 million with between 10% and 30% of the fine. Wednesday's new rule would presume that a tipster is eligible for the maximum 30%, pending these considerations.
It also relaxes a proposal to impose discretionary caps on bounties and to tighten deadlines for formally filing tips, as reported https://reut.rs/3iTHpTr by Reuters on Tuesday.
The agency had proposed requiring that whistleblowers file their formal tip, a long legal document required to claim a bounty, within 30 days of first making contact with SEC staff. On Wednesday, the SEC will relax that proposed deadline in cases where the whistleblower had not been aware of the agency's formal filing rule.
The program attracts thousands of tips annually, public data shows, overwhelming SEC staff who can take years to assess all the claims and issue awards.
The SEC also will vote to expand the program's ""related actions"" provision, which allows it to distribute awards on behalf of other agencies, to include deferred prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements, as well as similar non-judicial settlements made by the Department of Justice. 
The SEC will give tipsters who would have been eligible if this rule had been in effect when the program began in 2011 90 days to file a claim.

Whistleblowers were previously ineligible for awards in these cases, the agency officials said.

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 10:26AM ET</span>",Exclusive: ECB plots Amazon-style market to prevent Wall Street COVID debt swoop,"By John O'Donnell and Matt Scuffham
FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Europe is working on an Amazon-style website to sell hundreds of billions of euros of bank loans which have been soured by the coronavirus crisis, in a bid to shore up the economy and challenge the dominance of big Wall Street debt investors.
The blueprint, devised by top European Central Bank (ECB) officials, is part of efforts by the 19-state euro zone to tackle a growing pile of unpaid loans and aims to prevent ""distressed debt"" funds from buying them at rock bottom prices. 
""The idea is to open up the market to buyers of smaller portfolios, with an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or eBay-style marketplace, where you can browse ... That can get the market moving,"" Edward O'Brien, a senior ECB official involved in the plan, told Reuters.
Large funds bought billions of euros of loans in the aftermath of the last financial crisis, in the process acquiring swathes of property some of which has since risen in value.
""The market for bad loans has been dominated by a few very large buyers. In a typical scenario, one of these firms may buy a very large portfolio at steep discounts,"" O'Brien said.
A study by Deloitte found that of the more than 450 billion euros ($529 billion) of loans sold in Europe between 2014 and 2019, roughly half were bought by Cerberus, Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Lone Star and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Blackstone and Cerberus did not respond to a request for comment. Goldman Sachs and Lone Star both declined to comment.
Banks offload bad debts, normally at a fraction of their face value, to free up their balance sheets to make new loans and keep both their own business and economies going.
The ECB scheme, which has yet to be signed off and will be discussed with European Union officials on Friday, is inspired by Italian website BlinkS, which links buyers and sellers of loans, as well as debt auctions by a U.S. federal agency. 
If EU states agree, the new marketplace could come under the Single Resolution Board (SRB), a European Union agency in Brussels that winds up failing banks.
""Why is it that every public contract has to be put out to tender in an open competition and bad loans can be sold off behind closed doors?"" Bostjan Jazbec, an SRB director, said. 
""Success in buying and selling bad loans involves a lot of insider information. COVID means more bad loans ahead. Any sale must be transparent,"" Jazbec added. 
Debt in the euro zone considered unlikely to ever be fully repaid stands at more than half a trillion euros, including credit cards, car loans and mortgages, and is set to rise.
John Fell, a second senior ECB official involved, said these bad loans presented a wider challenge.
""The problem is bad loans is too often understood to be one that is limited to banks. But it is far wider, it affects the whole economy,"" Fell said.
BALANCING ACT 
It is usual for banks to sell old loans to investors, with individual packages sometimes topping 10 billion euros, but the ECB is concerned that this is skewed in favour of big buyers.
""There are only about half a dozen buyers who can write a cheque for hundreds of millions of euros,"" said Gifford West of DebtX, which runs a similar platform in the U.S., adding that packaging the loans into smaller bundles could widen the pool of buyers up to 1,000.
Under the new platform contemplated by the ECB, which could be up and running early next year, the packet size could be cut to 10 million euros, attracting smaller buyers who may pay more.
As well as an economic angle to the ECB's blueprint, there is also a strong political dimension to challenging such big investors.
Supporters say they played a critical role, for example, in buoying the flagging Irish property market, after its crash.
But critics have dubbed them ""vulture funds"" and their power was a lightning rod in elections in Ireland this year when Sinn Fein secured more votes than the establishment parties for the first time.
The left-wing party's popularity was lifted by a housing crisis it partly blamed on fund investors crowding out the property market.
And in Spain, the rising cost of housing, also attributed in part to the role of big investors, was an issue in elections last year, prompting Madrid to tighten tenant protection.

(Reuters) - Budweiser and its parent company Anheuser-Busch Inbev (BR:ABI) announced Wednesday it will award 30 scholarships annually over the next five years aimed at growing more Black representation in the beer brewing industry.
The beer brewer will partner with the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) to award the scholarships, which will be named after Natalie Johnson, the first female Black brewmaster for Anheuser-Busch, who serves as the company's brewing director for North America.
The scholarships come at a time when nearly every company is confronting the issue of racism and diversity amid a national reckoning in the United States in the aftermath of George Floyd's death in May. 
""We realized we had a role to not only accelerate our diversity and inclusion agenda internally ... but also externally by way of education,"" said Monica Rustgi, vice president of marketing for Budweiser USA.
Each year, 25 scholarships worth $4,000 will go to students pursuing science, technology, engineering and math majors, which can lead to careers in beer brewing.
In addition, Anheuser-Busch said five interns in its brewing division will get a $6,000 scholarship to go toward the final year of their degree.
""I would love if all five (interns) came on board with us, and then the five the year after that,"" Johnson said.
Budweiser also released a short film in which former NBA star Dwyane Wade met with Johnson and surprised her with the announcement of the new scholarship fund. 
""It's bigger than just beer, it's about the opportunity we can create for the Black and brown community,"" said Wade, who helped the company launch a non-alcoholic beer called Budweiser Zero in July. 
Just 0.6% of all brewers in the industry are Black, according to data cited in the film.
Anheuser-Busch said it will maintain contact and track the successes of the award winners throughout the program, but declined to elaborate on internal hiring goals.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Ant Group plans to raise about half of its $35 billion dual listing in Hong Kong and will not offer a cornerstone tranche as it bets on strong demand from institutional investors, sources said.
Backed by Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA), Ant plans to list simultaneously in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's STAR Market next month in what could be the world's largest IPO, surpassing oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s $29.4 billion float last December. 
The financial technology firm is seeking to raise about $35 billion after assessing early investor interest and based on a higher valuation of about $250 billion or more, Reuters has reported.
Ant aims to sell 10-15% of its enlarged share capital, splitting the float evenly between Hong Kong and Shanghai, two of the sources said, requesting anonymity as the details were not yet public. 
Ant declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the details earlier on Wednesday.
After receiving positive initial feedback from prospective investors including some existing shareholders, Ant has decided to push ahead with the Hong Kong leg without cornerstone investors, who usually buy significant chunks of a local IPO, said three of the people. 
While the cornerstone practice is common in several Asian markets and helps bolster demand for large deals, such investors generally tend to push for as low an IPO price as possible, denting issuers' ambition for higher valuations. 
A high percentage of cornerstone investors would also sharply reduce post-listing trading volumes, as shares are locked up for at least six months in Hong Kong.
Ant, which won approval from the Shanghai Stock Exchange for the domestic IPO last week, plans to seek a listing hearing with the Hong Kong bourse in the coming days, said one of the people.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets turned lower after a mixed opening on Wednesday, as gloomy comments on the economic outlook from Federal Reserve officials and a backdrop of rising coronavirus infections overshadowed strong numbers by sports gear maker  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).
Nike published a blowout quarterly update after the close on Tuesday, pushing its stock up 9%. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average only just clung on to the gain line, despite the equivalent of a 100-point boost by Nike. By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT) it was up only 15 points, or less than 0.1% at 27,303 points by 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT). The S&P 500 was down 0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%.
The Nasdaq was again held back by underperformance in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which fell 6.5% in disappointment at the company's much-hyped 'Battery Day' presentation on Tuesday. The stock had already dropped over 5.5% on Tuesday in response to founder Elon Musk's tempering of expectations ahead of the event. Analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) nonetheless raised their recommendation to 'buy' with a price target of $500, some 25% above current levels.
Before the market open, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester had made some downbeat comments about the state of the economy, saying that the recovery was neither broad-based nor sustainable, and that ""very accommodative"" monetary policy and fiscal support would be necessary for some time. While the first of those conditions is in place, there is still no sign of a compromise on Capitol Hill on a new round of support measures, despite signs from the labor market that lay-offs continue to run at a high rate and that nearly 30 million Americans are either out of work or underemployed.
Fed vice-chairman Richard Clarida, meanwhile, had earlier rebutted suggestions on Tuesday by the Chicago Fed's Charles Evans that the central bank could raise interest rates again before the annual inflation rate got back to 2%. He too stressed that further fiscal support was necessary for the economy.
Elsewhere, Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock rose 4.5% to a new record high and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock fell 0.9% after reports that the e-commerce giant had ordered Echelon Fitness to stop styling its budget $500 exercise bikes ""Prime"" and suppressed Echelon's claims to a partnership with the Amazon Prime service.
Peloton stock had fallen sharply on Tuesday on the perception that Amazon was set to undercut it with Echelon's product. The episode comes against of increased antitrust scrutiny of Amazon's business model.
Another stock to hit an all-time high was Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), which gained 3.3% against a backdrop of rising Covid-19 cases and tighter social distancing measures in Europe, which seem likely to sustain high interest in its video-conferencing services for the foreseeable future. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told parliament on Tuesday he expects the new tighter controls to last at least six months.

1004,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 09:27AM ET</span>",Is the U.S. Recession Over? Official Panel Isn’t Ready to Say So,"(Bloomberg) -- The panel of elite economists who judge the dates of U.S. recessions is finding that declaring an end to this year’s downturn is tougher than calling its start.
The National Bureau of Economic Research’s business cycle dating committee announced in June that the Covid-19 recession began just four months earlier in February -- the shortest time yet for a decision that can take a year or more.
Most broad indicators including jobs, consumer spending and manufacturing have turned positive since May, suggesting that the slump could already be over; third-quarter figures are projected to show a record increase in gross domestic product, following the prior period’s record contraction.
But the NBER panel has held off from an official call on the recession’s end. While committee deliberations are secret, some individual members indicated they’re waiting for more evidence of a sustained recovery amid concerns about a slowdown in employment gains and risks of a renewed downturn.
If that happens, it would spur debate on whether it’s part of the same recession or constitutes a second recession.
Figures in recent weeks show a gradual rebound is ongoing, but it could be undermined by the expiration of some federal aid programs and the fact that the coronavirus continues to restrain business and schooling around the country. The U.S. surpassed 200,000 recorded Covid-19 deaths this week, prospective vaccines are still in testing and the cooling weather threatens a fresh wave of infections, which could bring a leg down in activity.
“Here is the worst-case scenario: No new stimulus, continued chaotic management of the virus, a real second wave as some epidemiologists predict,” said James Stock, a Harvard University economist on the committee. That could lead to “a second round of lockdowns leading to a decline in GDP,” he said.
Committee members would then be faced with the question of whether that decline would be a new recession or part of the one that was dated to February.
Stock said it’s correct to consider this “good question,” and it’s “too early to assess” the answer. A U.S. recession lasting just two or three months would be the shortest on record, following a 10-year expansion that was the longest, according to NBER data on business cycles back to the 1850s.
While the NBER’s judgment may not have practical implications for Americans, the debate among its members illustrates the complexity of the economy’s current state.
In addition, a call on the recession’s end ahead of the Nov. 3 election would come in the final weeks of a bitterly contested presidential race, potentially supporting President Donald Trump’s view that the economy has moved past the downturn. The nonpartisan NBER says politics doesn’t affect the timing of its declarations.
Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) University professor Robert Gordon, another committee member, said he believes the recession ended in April. “Any new downturn -- if satisfying the criteria of depth and diffusion -- would be classified as a new recession,” in his view.
It’s far from certain the committee is ready to agree. The fear of a second leg down suggests a declaration will be delayed, said Harvard professor Jeffrey Frankel, who served on the committee for more than a decade through 2019.
“The risk of a renewed downturn is a reason for the committee to wait as usual -- often a year -- before declaring the trough,” he said, adding that’s true “even if one doesn’t buy my judgment that the probability of a renewed negative quarter is especially high.”
This year’s recession call was unusually fast. Typically, the committee has taken six to 21 months to make such declarations of peaks or troughs in activity -- otherwise known as the beginning and end of recessions.
While many economists use the shorthand for a recession as two consecutive quarterly declines in GDP, the NBER defines one as “a significant decline in economic activity” and looks at a variety of indicators.
“The committee takes whatever time is needed to identify a trough reliably,” said Stanford University professor Robert Hall, chairman of the committee.
The committee members who agreed to be interviewed are united in seeing the jobs data as slowing in recent months. While there was a surge in activity in May and June, that mainly represented workers being recalled to jobs after temporary layoffs, while permanent job losses have continued to increase, Hall said.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who’s repeatedly warned that the outlook looks more difficult now, “is almost certainly right that the next points of unemployment decline will be harder,” Hall said.
The U.S. unemployment rate has fallen to 8.4% in August from a peak of 14.7% in April. About half the 22 million jobs lost in March and April have been regained.
“Personally I don’t think we will have another recession but rather a long, slow, and painful recovery from where we are now,” Northwestern’s Gordon said.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Roche Alzheimer's drug fails, joining long list of trial flops","ZURICH (Reuters) - An experimental Alzheimer's drug from Roche (S:ROG) and AC Immune (O:ACIU) failed to slow cognitive and functional decline in a trial, the Swiss companies said on Wednesday, in a fresh setback to efforts to fight the fatal dementia-causing disease.
AC Immune boss Andrea Pfeifer described the results of the trial of semorinemab as ""surprising and disappointing"".
The drug targets ""tau"" proteins believed to play a role in Alzheimer's and offers an alternative to treatments aiming to fight amyloid beta peptides in the brain.
The outcome of the Phase 2 trial - in patients with an early stage of Alzheimer's - means the failure rate for drugs aiming to fight the brain-wasting illness, which afflicts tens of millions of people worldwide, remains at nearly 100%.
""We believe the full data analysis of this first-of-its-kind study will yield information about this promising target that will advance our understanding and inform future efforts,"" Pfeifer said. 
So far, Alzheimer's drugs have nearly always stumbled in trials, though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now reviewing experimental treatment aducanumab from Biogen (O:BIIB) and Japan's Eisai (T:4523), marking the first Alzheimer's drug application in 17 years to be reviewed by the agency.
Aducanumab targets amyloid beta peptides, but nearly all similar drugs have failed, so far, including prospective medicines from Roche and AC Immune. Consequently, the companies were hoping anti-tau medicines like semorinemab would yield better results and said this result was a disappointment.
""We believe these data will contribute to the scientific understanding of the role of tau in this complex and difficult-to-treat disease,"" said Rachelle Doody, head of Roche's neurodegeneration operation.

Roche and AC Immune have other anti-tau medicines in development, along with many other companies, including Eli Lilly (N:LLY), Biogen and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ).

PARIS (Reuters) -  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) is considering merging its two French retail networks in an attempt to boost profitability, after two consecutive quarterly losses due to poor trading results.
SocGen's shares are near historic lows and its chief executive Frederic Oudea is speeding up initiatives to overhaul the bank, which is the third biggest listed lender in France.
French retail banking accounts for a third of the overall revenue at Societe Generale, which mainly operates under two different brands - Societe Generale and Credit du Nord. 
SocGen said a combination would have about 10 million clients and a stronger foothold in France's regions, as well as generating significant synergies to boost profitability.
""We want to speed up structuring initiatives to strengthen our business model of (a) diversified European banking group,"" Oudea said in a statement on Wednesday.
Shares in SocGen were up 2.3% to 11.9 euros at 1234 GMT, just above their lowest level in 27 years of 11.3 euros, after it said the review would be completed by the end of November.
SocGen is to present a new strategic plan in the first half of 2021.
The bank said it would look at ""the conditions for implementing a single information system"" and the eventual project would have a ""social"" dimension that would be subject to discussions and consultations with unions.
Any eventual layoffs could meet stiff resistance from unions and local politicians.
Right-wing heavyweight Xavier Bertrand, current head of Hauts-de-France, a region in northern France, said on Twitter that he had demanded a meeting with Oudea to obtain some guarantees on jobs in his region.
SocGen's CGT labour union said that a commitment not to resort to layoffs on behalf of the management was required.
SocGen has a nationwide banking network with 20,700 employees, 7.3 million clients and 1,749 branches, which are mainly in urban areas.
The Credit du Nord network, meanwhile, has around 8,200 employees, 2.4 million clients and 679 branches, rooted in the regions, with a focus on serving entrepreneurs.

SocGen said it would keep its online bank Boursorama independent.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday kicked off a final 60,000-person trial of a single-shot COVID-19 vaccine that potentially would simplify distribution of millions of doses compared with leading rivals using two doses.
The company expects results of the Phase III trial by year end or early next year, Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, said in a joint press conference with officials from the National Institutes of Health and the Trump administration.
Rival vaccines from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) all require two shots separated by several weeks, which make them much more difficult to administer.
""The benefits of a single-shot vaccine are potentially profound in terms of mass immunization campaigns and global pandemic control,"" Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J's COVID-19 vaccine, said in a telephone interview.
The company's shares rose 2% before the opening bell on Wednesday. 
""Big news. Numerous great companies are seeing fantastic results. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) must move quickly,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet. 
J&J published a detailed study protocol for its phase 3 trial Wednesday on the company's website, joining the three other vaccine makers that have made these study plans available in recent weeks after calls for increased transparency in the trials.
Stoffels said J&J started the phase 3 trial after seeing positive results in its phase 1/2 trial in the United States and Belgium. The company plans to release those results imminently.
Stoffels said the safety and level of protection in the study were on par with what was seen in the company's animal studies, and said the results showed a single dose could offer sufficient protection ""for a long time.""J&J's late-stage trial will use as many as 215 sites in the United States, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The company plans to manufacture as many as 1 billion doses in 2021, and more after that, Stoffels said.
The goal of the trial is to test whether the vaccine can prevent moderate to severe COVID-19 after a single dose, but it will also look to see if the vaccine can prevent serious disease requiring medical intervention and whether it can prevent milder cases of the virus.
Stoffels predicts it will take six weeks to two months to enroll the trial, and said the company hopes to get an answer on whether the vaccine works ""around the end of the year or early next year.""
It is not clear how fast the company could get regulatory approval, but J&J plans to manufacture doses before approval, so it could start distribution quickly.
The trial will be overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will review vaccine safety and effectiveness. In the press conference, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said all three of the vaccines being organized and supported by the federal government's Operation Warp Speed - J&J's, Moderna's and AstraZeneca's - share a common DSMB. Pfizer is running its own trial and has a separate DSMB, Collins said.
J&J's trial is designed to test for a vaccine that is 60% effective. In the study protocol, that could be determined after 154 people became infected with the virus. Stoffels said the company will start counting cases of COVID-19 infections within the study population 15 days after individuals are vaccinated.
The DSMB will take its first look at the vaccine's efficacy after 20 people have become infected.
Collins said the DSMB does not include any federal employees and is made up of ""very highly experienced"" scientists and statistical experts.

""Until they are convinced that there's something there that looks promising, nothing is unblinded and sent to the FDA. So everybody should feel pretty reassured,"" Collins said. His comments follow concerns government scientists may be pressured to rush the vaccine testing process to boost U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election bid.

LONDON (Reuters) - Active fund managers, who pick and choose investments rather than passively track indexes, have failed to cash in on the financial market volatility caused by COVID-19, new data has shown.
Fund managers have long complained that low market volatility makes their lives hard. But S&P's SPIVA scorecard showed that 63% of large cap funds and 70% of large cap 'core' funds had still underperformed Wall Street's S&P 500 (SPX) in the 12 months to end-June despite a chaotic 2020. 
Mid-cap and small-cap active funds performed relatively well, with 56% of mid-cap and 53% of small-cap active managers beating their benchmarks.
So-called 'growth' funds, which can focus on high-flying tech stocks, also did well with almost 75% of large-cap growth funds, 83% of mid-cap and 89% small-cap growth funds outperforming. 
However, their success was not enough to offset previous underperformance: 92% of large-cap growth, 74% of mid-cap growth, and 75% of small-cap growth funds have underperformed over the past 15 years, the data also showed.
The majority of fixed income funds failed to keep up with their benchmarks over the last year too, with COVID forcing interest rates to be slashed globally again.
Government funds struggled across maturities, with 92%, 63%, and 68% underperforming in the long, intermediate, and short-term segments, respectively, over the past year.

Government bond funds in general had ""a miserable decade"" S&P Dow Jones Indices' Berlinda Liu added. An overwhelming 99% of long bond funds have failed to beat their benchmarks over the past 10 years, along with 82% and 75% of intermediate and short bond funds, respectively.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Insurers' hedge fund investments may face chop after dismal pandemic performance,"By Maiya Keidan and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Having complained for years about hedge funds' high fees and lacklustre performance, insurance firms may be preparing to cut allocations to the sector after its poor performance during recent market upheaval left many of them nursing losses. 
That would be a problem for hedge funds, as insurance companies are huge investors, managing around $20 trillion of assets globally. 
It would also be a challenge for insurers, which have been hoping hedge funds would deliver market-beating returns to help them meet billions of dollars in pandemic-related payouts. 
One of the primary objectives of hedge funds is to preserve clients' capital during market downturns. But the industry mostly failed to do that in the first six months of 2020, losing an average of 3.5%, according to Hedge Fund Research (HFR).
An index fund tracking the S&P500 would have lost 3% in the same period.
(Graphic: Hedge fund annual returns - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/INSURANCE/xlbpgjloovq/chart.png)
For European insurers, the underperformance is a double blow, as they incur extra capital charges to hold investments classed as risky.
""The average hedge fund would not be a good investment,"" said Urban Angehrn, chief investment officer at Zurich Insurance (S:ZURN), which says a $120 million fall in hedge fund gains versus last year contributed to a drop in first-half profits.
Angehrn said there were exceptions but ""in aggregate, unfortunately, (hedge funds) don't do a very good job in creating extra performance.""
While Zurich earned a better-than-average 2.9% from its hedge funds between January and June, that was down from 9% in the same period a year earlier. It has around 1% of its $207 billion asset portfolio in hedge funds and Chief Financial Officer George Quinn told Reuters last month it did not plan a ""significant shift"" in allocations. 
Overall, though, European insurers' median hedge fund holdings have been falling, hitting 1.5% in September from 2% four years before, data from Preqin shows. 
Less than a fifth of global insurers plan to add to hedge fund allocations in the event of persistent volatility over the next three to six months, a  State Street  (NYSE:STT) survey showed in June, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management's July survey found that even before the pandemic, insurance firms were cutting hedge fund investments. 
""I don't anticipate COVID leading to increased allocations to hedge funds,"" said Gareth Haslip, global head of insurance strategy and analytics at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
(Graphic: Insurers' allocations to hedge funds [in %] - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/INSURERS/xegpbjogkpq/chart.png)
DAMAGE
Most major insurers do not provide detail of their hedge fund exposure in earnings reports, but Dutch group  Aegon  (AS:AEGN) told Reuters it had cut allocations to riskier assets by more than 20% as underperformance of hedge funds inflicted losses of $50 million in the first half of 2020. 
""Given the current environment, we decided to somewhat de-risk our investment portfolio and have lowered our exposure to hedge funds and private equity to $1.482 million per June 30, from $1.830 million per December 31, 2019,"" a spokesman said. 
U.S. insurer AIG (N:AIG) said earnings in its general insurance business suffered in the first quarter from a $588 million drop in net investment income, mainly due to hedge funds. AIG declined to comment on its allocations. 
Bucking the trend, reinsurer  Swiss Re 's (S:SRENH) hedge fund investments edged up to $355 million at June 30 from $352 million at the end of 2019. A spokesman declined to comment on future investment plans.
European insurers' hedge fund allocations have room to fall as they are above global averages. It's also costlier to hold hedge funds after Solvency II regulations introduced in 2016 required insurers to set aside more capital against riskier investments.
Those regulations have partly driven recent falls in hedge fund allocations, according to Andries Hoekema, global insurance sector head at HSBC Global Asset Management, but he noted holdings were down also in Asia, which hadn't tightened rules.
""In Asia, we have some evidence of insurers replacing hedge fund exposure with private equity,"" Hoekema said. 
This was ""driven partly by the more attractive returns of private equity and partly by the disappointing diversification properties of some hedge fund strategies in recent years,"" he added.

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>",JPMorgan to move $230 billion of assets to Germany ahead of Brexit: source,"By Lawrence White and Abhishek Manikandan
LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) is moving about 200 billion euros ($234 billion) of assets from the United Kingdom to Germany as a result of Britain's exit from the European Union, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
In January, the bank had also announced it would significantly expand its Paris hub as part of plans to relocate some services from London after Brexit.
The shift sees JPMorgan follow similar moves by other big banks in Britain, as regulators in continental financial hubs such as Frankfurt and Dublin urge banks to book their assets locally.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) for example has moved its European headquarters and almost 200 billion euros in assets to Dublin, Reuters reported last year.
The source did not specify what type of assets JPMorgan was moving to Germany, but for banks making similar moves, it would typically include cash and financial securities such as stocks and bonds that banks hold in inventory for clients to trade. 
A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment. 
The shift in assets represents part of banks' routine planning for life after Britain leaves the European Union, when they will likely no longer be able to book their entire trading operations for the contintent out of London.
Clients of those banks in Europe will now trade with the lenders' local banking entities rather than the UK-based subsidiary. 
Banks using Britain as a gateway to the European Union must fully execute their plans for serving EU customers before a Brexit transition period ends in December, the EU's banking watchdog said in July. 
Last year, consultancy EY said assets worth nearly $1 trillion were being moved from Britain to new financial hubs in the European Union ahead of Brexit. (https://reut.rs/33Upshd)
JPMorgan plans to finish the migration of assets to its Frankfurt-based subsidiary by the end of 2020, according to Bloomberg News which first reported the asset shift earlier on Wednesday.

1013,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",Tech lifts stocks as poor data rekindles stimulus hopes,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - Shares rose and the dollar steadied at new highs on Wednesday, with overnight gains by Wall Street tech champions helping balance concerns that new restrictions to counter coronavirus infections will hurt the economic recovery.
Renewed hopes of stimulus measures in Europe also came into play after surveys of private sector economic activity in September painted a gloomy picture for the region, with rising COVID-19 infections leading to a downturn in services.
MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was 0.3% higher, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark progressively extended opening gains to rise 1.3%.
Technology shares were among the strongest gainers from the start in Europe following a rally overnight in U.S. heavyweights Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT), and Apple (O:AAPL), and a positive performance earlier of peers in Asia. Tech companies have been rare beneficiaries of lockdown measures, with more people working and shopping from home. 
A rebound in beaten-down sectors provided extra support.
Nasdaq futures (NQc1) meanwhile built on Tuesday's strong bounce to gain 0.2%. S&P 500 futures (ESc1) were 0.4% higher.
Carlo Franchini, head of institutional sales at Banca Ifigest in Milan, said that despite the gains the underlying mood remained highly cautions given uncertainty linked to the pandemic and its effect on the recovery.
""The U.S. is the only market that's riding on. Investors are interested only in big U.S. tech, even though they should look elsewhere if they took fundamentals into account,"" he said.
""Cornonavirus is a Damocles' sword for markets. If we continue with uncertainty over a possible vaccine, it's going to be a problem.""
UBS Asset Management said on Wednesday that an emergency approval of one to three COVID-19 vaccines was likely in the coming months, a milestone that could finally end the surge of mega-cap U.S. tech stocks. 
Purchasing managers' (PMI) surveys showed euro zone activity growth ground to a halt this month, throwing the recovery into question, as fresh restrictions to quell a resurgence in coronavirus infections sent the services industry into reverse.
""It seems a W-shaped economic projection might be developing following the brief bounce in PMI numbers over the summer,"" said Charles Hepworth, Investment Director at GAM Investments.
""What this means is that continued stimulus across the euro zone will be hopefully forthcoming -- or at least that's what markets are placing their bets on,"" he added. 
In Britain, the recovery from the coronavirus lockdown lost some momentum this month, according to a PMI survey taken before Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a new round of restrictions that could probably last six months.
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.3% for its first gain this week, but the mood was hardly bullish. Japan's Nikkei (N225) returned from a two-day holiday to slip 0.1%.
In foreign exchange markets, the standout mover was the dollar, which surged to its highest level since July 27 against a basket of six major currencies (=USD) before paring those gains to trade flat.
""Risk-aversion on the back of new COVID-19 infections affecting Europe more directly remains an important factor this week,"" UniCredit strategists said in a note.
""This means that the USD is likely to remain firm in its role as preferred safe-haven currency,"" they added. 
The euro (EUR=) was flat after rebounding from a two-month low hit on concerns about coronavirus infections and after the tepid European surveys.
Commodities were weighed down by the robust dollar and worries linked to the economic impact of a second wave of COVID-19.
Gold touched a six-week low as the dollar strengthened. Spot gold  was last down 0.3% to $1,893.8 per ounce.
Oil managed to reverse course and turn positive, helped by a report saying U.S. fuel inventories fell.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were last up 0.5% at $41.91 a barrel and U.S. crude futures (CLc1) slipped 0.3% to $39.92. 
Italy's 30-year bond yield (IT30YT=RR) fell to a record low of 1.76% as the country's debt remained supported after local elections reduced the risk of a snap national poll. 
U.S. bonds fell, with the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. debt up 1.3 basis point at 0.6773%.

The company said it would drop the logo of an elderly African-American man wearing a bow tie on the 70-year-old brand and replace it with an orange package with Ben's Original' written in a blue font. The brand was named after a Texas rice farmer.
Mars joins a growing list of companies that have dropped racially insensitive branding after drawing criticism amid a national debate over racial inequality in the United States.
In June, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc said it would rename and change the brand image of its Aunt Jemima pancake mix and syrup, while Mrs. Butterworth's syrup, owned by ConAgra Brands Inc and Cream of Wheat porridge, owned by B&G Foods Inc, said they would review their packaging. 
At the time Mars said it was ""evaluating all possibilities"" regarding Uncle Ben's.
""We understand the inequities that were associated with the name and face of the previous brand ... (and) we have committed to change,"" said Fiona Dawson, global president of Mars Food. 
The new packaging for the brand will hit stores in 2021.

The details reported by finance periodical Bilanz suggest that a merger between Credit Suisse and UBS, which had been examined by staff working under UBS chairman Axel Weber in recent months, had been more seriously considered than previously known, receiving backing from both parties.
UBS declined comment. Credit Suisse did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Switzerland's two biggest banks held tie-up negotiations in the first half of the year, Bilanz reported, citing two unnamed sources involved in the discussions.
Although kept secret, a merger had been considered seriously, one source told Bilanz, receiving the backing of both UBS Chairman Axel Weber and Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner, who is due to retire from his post in 2021.
However, discussions had dropped off since the summer holidays, one source told Bilanz, amid a drop in Credit Suisse's share price placing the banks' respective valuations beyond the merger of equals threshold.
Reuters reported last week that the board of UBS had gathered to discuss strategy, but a merger with Credit Suisse was not on the official agenda, suggesting cooling interest in the idea. 

Both chief executives of UBS and Credit Suisse expressed expectations of an up-tick in consolidation within Europe's banking sector at a conference on Tuesday, with UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti calling more deals ""inevitable"".

The announcement comes as the Chinese-ruled hub tries to bolster its flagging economy and badly hit tourism sector, which was impacted heavily by anti-government protests last year and more recently, the coronavirus. 
Hong Kong's Disneyland resort is owned by a joint venture, Hong Kong International Theme Parks Ltd (HKITP), of which the local government owns 53% and Walt Disney Co holds the rest. It has been closed for +months this year.
The government said it was prudent to focus on the development and expansion of the existing resort in the coming few years rather than a geographic expansion, according to a statement on its website. 
""HKITP's strategic direction is to focus on the ongoing multi-expansion plan featuring a series of new attractions that will continue to position Hong Kong Disneyland as a premier tourism destination in the region,"" a spokesman for the city's Commerce and Economic Development Bureau said.
The option to buy the land, which is nearby the city's international airport, was agreed 20 years ago and expires on Thursday. 
A Walt Disney Company representative said that the company would continue investing but was ""extremely disappointed with the Hong Kong government’s decision not to extend the phase 2 land expansion option.""
The land earmarked for Disney has been unused for years and activists had advocated that public housing be built on it. As the city experienced a renewed rise in coronavirus infections, authorities set up a temporary quarantine centre.
Disney said on Tuesday it would open its Hong Kong park on Sept. 25 to a reduced number of visitors and limited days, with enhanced health measures.
It had closed again in mid-July for a second time.
The Asian financial hub has relaxed its coronavirus restrictions, including reopening theme parks, after the testing of nearly two million people in a programme organised by the Chinese government found 42 cases. 
Gatherings remain capped at 4 people and all guests inside the park must wear masks.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",Asian suppliers' shares slip on Tesla's cheaper battery plan,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Yilei Sun
SEOUL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares of Asian battery suppliers fell on Wednesday after Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) outlined a plan to halve the cost of its electric vehicle batteries and bring more production of the key auto component in-house.
The fortunes of battery makers in South Korea, Japan and China are linked to Tesla, the EV market leader, as they supply its factories in Nevada and Shanghai. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday the carmaker aims to lower electric vehicle prices to $25,000 each by producing new batteries with cheaper costs and longer range. 
Musk said that it will take about three years to fully achieve this goal-- disappointing investors and wiping $50 billion off its market value -- but analysts said plans for in house production would put pressure on suppliers to lower prices.
""Tesla will have more power in negotiating prices and therefore overall battery costs will fall further,"" said Rho Woo-ho, an analyst at Meritz Securities.
Shares in South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910) finished 1.4% lower after falling as much as 5.5% while Panasonic (T:6752) ended down 3.7% and China's CATL (SZ:300750) was down 1.7%. 
A Panasonic spokeswoman said the company is ""considering a variety of options"" when asked if Panasonic would partner with Tesla on new cell production, but added that nothing has been determined at this time.
""We value our relationship with Tesla and look forward to enhancing our partnership,"" the company said.
LG Chem declined to comment. A source familiar with the company said it is open to cooperating with Tesla on the new batteries. 
CATL said in a statement it also planned research and investment in nickel rich chemistry, large cells and integrated structure, which are part of Tesla's technology development roadmap, and saw them as key factors in making electric vehicles mainstream.
'INSANELY DIFFICULT'
Tesla said it plans to achieve 100 gigawatt hours of internal battery capacity in 2022 and 3,000 gigawatt hours by 2030 -- roughly 85 times greater than the capacity of its Nevada plant by 2030. 
""This 100 gigawatt hours are supplemental to what we buy from suppliers,"" Musk said, reiterating that Tesla will continue to use its existing cell suppliers.
Tesla currently produces batteries in partnership with Panasonic at its Nevada factory, while LG Chem and CATL supply cells to its Shanghai factory. 
Tesla said it has started ramping up production of its new batteries at a pilot line near its vehicle plant in Fremont, California, but the production yield is not high. 
""It is insanely difficult to scale up,"" Musk said at the company's closely watched ""Battery Day"" presentation. ""There is a clear path to success but a ton of work to do,"" he said.
Experts had mixed responses over whether Tesla will be able to live up to its aim of mass producing the bigger new batteries. 
""Tesla's new batteries are possible at lab levels, but mass production is impossible,"" said Cho Jae-phil, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked previously at Korean battery maker, Samsung (KS:005930) SDI (KS:006400).
However, South Korean battery expert and professor Park Chul-wan was more optimistic. 

""Once Tesla succeeds in mass-producing the new cells, other battery vendors will find it difficult to catch up. It will be difficult to imitate the technology,"" he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday, continuing the gains of the previous session, after supportive comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Strong sales figures from footwear giant  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) have also boosted sentiment.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT),S&P 500 Futures traded 16 points, or 0.5%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 225 points, or 0.8%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 34 points, or 0.3%. 
At the close Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, while the S&P 500 climbed 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.7%.
Fed boss Jerome Powell is set to testify in front of the Senate later Wednesday, the day after he told the House Financial Service Committee that the U.S. economy is recovering faster than expected from the shutdown but there needs to be more help through another stimulus bill.
The House of Representatives passed a stopgap funding bill to keep the federal government running through Dec. 11, and the Senate is also expected to pass the bill. However, this may be the full extent of cooperation on Capitol Hill, with no signs of compromise over a new coronavirus relief bill. 
Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. has surpassed 200,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data. In Europe, the U.K. has introduced new restrictions, likely to be in place for six months, and a number of other countries, including France and Spain, have reported a surge in new cases.
The economic data slate centers around the flash September PMI release, at 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT). The equivalent release for the euro zone saw a fall to 50.1 in September, barely above the line that represents growth, as the region’s economic recovery stalled with the resurgence of the coronavirus.
In corporate news, Nike (NYSE:NKE) will be in the spotlight after the world’s largest footwear maker stunned analysts by reporting quarterly profit and revenue way ahead of Wall Street estimates, with the brand's digital sales surged 82% in the first quarter.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also be in focus after CEO Elon Musk’s “Battery Day” fell short of expectations despite unveiling a new generation of electric batteries.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday, rebounding despite the American Petroleum Institute reporting surprise rise in U.S. oil inventories late Tuesday. Official data is due out later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $39.95 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $41.93.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Ninebot's IPO highlights Beijing's eagerness to lure home listings,"By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese e-scooter maker Ninebot Ltd will launch a domestic initial public offering soon with a listing structure that shows how eager Beijing is for Chinese tech companies to list at home amid rising tensions with Washington.
China's securities regulator gave Ninebot the go-ahead late on Tuesday to float on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market, making it the first company with a VIE structure to sell Chinese Depository Receipts (CDRs).
The variable interest entities (VIE) structure was created two decades ago to circumvent Chinese rules restricting foreign investment in sensitive industries such as media and telecommunications, enabling Chinese companies such as Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) Corp, Netease and Sohu (NASDAQ:SOHU).com to raise overseas money via offshore listings.
Ninebot, which counts  Xiaomi  (OTC:XIACF) Corp (HK:1810) as a key customer, plans to raise 2 billion yuan ($294.71 million) in the Shanghai IPO.
Further underlining regulators' tolerance, Ninebot hasn't yet made a profit, and grants shareholders weighted voting rights.
PwC global TMT industry leader Wilson Chow said that China's more inclusive IPO rules show it is ""encouraging those foreign-listed, China-based TMT companies to move back to the domestic market.""
The VIE structure has been adopted by many Chinese tech firms listed overseas or seeking an offshore listing. In the past, Chinese tech firms seeking to return home needed to go through a lot of hurdles to wind down the structure, Chow said.
Beijing is encouraging domestic listings at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is threatening to delist U.S.-listed Chinese companies that fail to meet U.S. accounting standards.
""To allow VIE-structured companies to come back is definitely a major policy breakthrough,"" said Craig Zeng, CFO of Nasdaq-listed Chinese firm  LexinFintech  Holdings Ltd (O:LX).
""This will significantly help to bring back China's tech companies, and enhance vibrancy and competitiveness of the Chinese capital market in the long run.""
Zheng said LexinFintech will consider a home listing.
VIE 
CDRs are the equivalent of U.S-listed American Depository Receipts (ADRs).
""China has the infrastructure ready for ADRs to come back home and get listed,"" said Jie Lu, Robeco's head of China research.
Ninebot's China listing will also cement the status of VIE in China, where authorities had not officially endorsed the structure.
""There's every indication that the Chinese regulators are fully embracing the VIE structure,"" said Marcia Ellis, Hong Kong-based Partner at Morrison & Foerster.
Ellis, who helped design VIE nearly 20 years ago for Chinese firms, thought at the time the makeshift structure would be phased out in five years, but now expects it to remain a viable option for the foreseeable future.
""There are huge national champions who utilize this structure,"" she said.
In addition, ""a bunch of companies planning to list on the STAR board will use the VIE structure,"" she added.
Brian Bandsma, portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management, said with China's IPO market getting more attractive, ""the U.S. markets will no longer be the default venue for Chinese (tech) companies to raise capital."" 
But he also cautioned that unless VIE is codified into Chinese law, there's a risk Beijing could change its mind.
""The concern is that if the VIE structures are no longer seen as beneficial to the Chinese government, they could take some action which would cause the structure to become invalid,"" Bandsma said.
""To some extent, it's at the whim of the government.""

(Reuters) - United Wholesale Mortgage said on Wednesday it is planning to go public by merging with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC)  Gores Holdings IV  Inc (O:GHIV) in a deal that will value the wholesale mortgage lender at $16.1 billion.
Under the agreement, United Wholesale will retain about 94% ownership of the combined company and will get about $425 million in cash held in Gores's trust account along with $500 million from a private placement.
Once the deal is completed, the combined company will be listed on Nasdaq and named UWM Corp, the Michigan-based company said, adding that the deal would make UWM the largest SPAC transaction so far.
United Wholesale's current Chief Executive Officer Mat Ishbia will continue to lead the business with the existing management team.
Gores Holdings IV, which went public at the beginning of this year, had raised $425 million from the offering.
The deal comes a month after Gores' other SPAC, Gores Metropoulos Inc, merged with autonomous vehicle sensor firm Luminar with plans to go public in the fourth quarter.
SPACs, also known as blank-check firms, are shell companies that raise funds through an initial public offering (IPO), with an intention to acquire a private company.
High-profile investors such as Bill Ackman and Michael Klein have raised billions through their SPACs in 2020 as the vehicle becomes an increasingly popular route to the public markets over a traditional IPO.

But for Carrhae Capital, the Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc.-backed hedge fund that’s handed its investors the best emerging-market equity returns among peers this year, the tide is turning.
Ali Akay, the London-based chief investment officer of Carrhae, expects returns on developing-nation equities to surpass those of the U.S. and Europe. Emerging markets didn’t fully benefit from low interest rates in the past decade and the potential for more stimulus, especially from China, should provide some support.
“We are optimistic on the trajectory of emerging markets,” Akay said in an interview. “Asset prices haven’t been juiced up as much. We just got through almost a decade of underperformance versus U.S. assets.”
While the pace of recovery in emerging economies outside of China has been weak, growth will accelerate from the second quarter of next year as central banks feel little pressure to remove accomodative policy, with persistently easy Fed policy and a weak dollar, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Since many of their central banks are at record-low interest rates already and therefore have less room to act if their economies continue to crater, China is the country that really matters, Akay said.
The People’s Bank of China “has been a lot more conservative than any developed market central bank this year in their response to the pandemic,” he said. “China does not want to see the economy adding more leverage at this point and they still have room on the fiscal side so that is where the incremental stimulus is coming from. That does not mean that they don’t have firepower to use in exigent circumstances.”

Carrhae Capital’s long-short strategy has returned 9.5%, after fees, this year through August, according to the firm. That makes it the best-performing fund focused on emerging-markets, among those with assets of more than $250 million, according to Singapore-based data provider Eurekahedge Pte. Long-short managers buy stocks they expect to rise and hedge those bets with sales of borrowed shares they hope to buy back at a cheaper price.
‘Ears to the Ground’
The firm, which oversees about $540 million, also manages a long-only strategy which has returned 12.7% in the first eight months of the year. In comparison, MSCI Inc’s gauge of developing-nation stocks lost 1.2% in the same period. The funds, founded in 2011, are named for the battle of Carrhae -- site of a Roman defeat to the Parthians in present-day Turkey -- as a reminder of the risks of investing without thorough knowledge of the market, Akay said.
The Romans’ “ignominious defeat at Carrhae largely stemmed from arrogance, underestimation of the enemy and failure to heed local advice when waging war in a new and alien geography,” Akay said. “When investing in distant emerging markets, we aim to heed his example and proceed with humility and caution, always keeping ears to the ground for sage local advice.”
The hedge fund still has “meaningful exposure” to Chinese technology equities, even after paring back some of its holdings, Akay said. Carrhae had snapped up Chinese and other emerging-market e-commerce and online companies when prices crashed in March in the midst of a coronavirus-induced selloff.
The tidal wave of central-bank stimulus had fueled a 45% rally in emerging-market stocks through August, from a four-year low in March. The market is headed for its first monthly loss since then amid simmering U.S.-China tensions and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. November presidential elections.
The year has “been like London weather -- variable,” Akay said. “A lot of torrents to navigate and requires a lot of mental agility and mental calm.”
Here’s where Carrhae is putting its money:

PARIS (Reuters) - French waste and water management firm Suez (PA:SEVI), target of a hostile takeover bid from rival Veolia (PA:VIE), said on Wednesday it needed some time to prepare alternatives.
Suez Chairman Philippe Varin also told a hearing at the National Assembly that Suez was talking with European Union anti-trust services and had asked French stock market watchdog AMF to look into Veolia's move.
Veolia last month offered to pay 2.9 billion euros for a 29.9% stake in Suez owned by French conglomerate Engie (PA:ENGIE), with a view to subsequently taking full control by buying up more shares. The deadline of Veolia's bid is Sept. 30.
""I do not see why Engie...would accept a four week ultimatum"", Varin said.
""We simply need some more time to prepare alternative offers...We need to find investors who will be prepared to buy that (Engie's) stake but we cannot act in a hurry in two weeks, this is not possible,""
Engie rejected Veolia's initial advance but has said it will consider a higher offer. 
Speaking in an interview on Tuesday, Veolia Chief Operating Officer Estelle Brachlianoff, who is also deputy CEO, said: ""There is a legitimate debate on the price, clearly, and there will be a discussion to be had.""
Varin also said that the structure of Veolia's offer raised legal issues as it was addressed to Engie (PA:ENGIE) as a prelude to a full takeover bid.
""This proposal does not comply with the principle of equal treatment for all shareholders as Engie will be treated a certain way and other (Suez) shareholders will one day find out how they will be treated,"" he said, adding that he believed a AMF meeting on the matter would take place ""very soon"". 
Separately, representatives of employees who are also shareholders of Suez and of Engie on Wednesday asked Engie's board to freeze decisions regarding Veolia's offer and start consultations with all parties involved.

Shares of the company were up 12.6% at $131.6 in premarket trading.
The brand's digital sales, especially in North America, helped offset fall in sales at traditional brick-and-mortar stores due to COVID-19 restrictions and social-distancing measures.
At least seven brokerages raised their 12-month price targets on the stock with the biggest bump coming from Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts, who raised their target to $117 from $95.
Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said that improvement in North America is the ""biggest positive surprise"" from Nike's results, and expects the Beaverton, Oregon-based company to do well in the long term, as consumers focus more on health and wellness.
Nike's results should come as a relief to investors after the company, just a quarter ago, reported a surprise loss of $790 million as retailers canceled orders and people kept away from Nike stores in key markets including North America, Europe and China.

""Nike offered its clearest signal yet that a higher digital mix and improving margins within the digital segment will push consolidated margins above historical levels,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Michael Binetti said.

(Reuters) - A jump in Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) following an upbeat forecast from U.S. rival  Nike  and better-than-expected euro zone manufacturing data on Wednesday helped European stocks extend a recovery from a steep sell-off earlier this week.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 1.3%, with Germany's DAX (GDAXI), London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) gaining between 1.6% and 2.0%.
Investors took heart from data that showed German manufacturing sector activity improved in September, with IHS Markit's flash PMI rising to 56.6, its highest level in more than two years. The survey showed manufacturers across the euro zone fared much better.
""Europe should benefit from that trend,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James. ""We've seen the world go from a lot of lockdowns to lot less lockdowns, that has been good for manufacturing.""
A weakening euro also boosted shares of exporters that draw a large part of their revenue from overseas, driving the euro zone blue-chip index (STOXX50E) up 1.6%.
However, the survey showed broader business growth ground to a halt this month as the bloc's service industry slammed into reverse, knocked by a resurgence in coronavirus cases that pushed governments to reintroduce restrictions.
London's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 (FTSE) jumped 1.9% as the pound was hammered by fresh UK curbs to tackle a second wave of COVID-19 infections. 
Fears of such restrictions slowing an economic rebound drove the STOXX 600 to its worst sell-off in three months on Monday, but markets have stabilised since on hopes that the curbs would be more targeted.
Adidas (DE:ADSGn) jumped 6.3% and Puma (DE:PUMG) rose 4.9% after U.S. sportswear maker Nike (N:NKE) reported strong earnings and forecast better-than-expected sales for 2020.
Osram Licht (DE:OSRn) surged 14.1% after Austrian sensor maker ams (VI:AMS) said it had signed a so-called domination and profit and loss transfer agreement as a key step towards closing its 4.6 billion euro ($5.4 billion) takeover of the German firm.
Travel stocks (SXTP) rebounded after a four-day run of losses, with Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) jumping 5.3% after a company executive said the airline was planning to make rapid COVID-19 antigen tests available to passengers in October.
British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) jumped 6.9%.
Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) gained 4.4% after it forecast an improvement of core revenues in the second half of 2020 due to a recovery in new retail loans and lower cost of insuring its loan book.

Danish pharmaceutical company  Genmab  (CO:GMAB) slumped 10.9% after it started binding arbitration to settle two license agreement matters with Janssen Biotech.

The financial technology firm, backed by China's biggest e-commerce company  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA), plans to list simultaneously on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market and in Hong Kong, in what sources have said could be the world's largest IPO and come as soon as October.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange approved the listing plan last week. 
The company is seeking to raise about $35 billion in the IPO after assessing early investor interest and based on a higher valuation of about $250 billion or more, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Ant declined to comment.
Separately, five Chinese asset managers said in their respective statements they would start raising up to 60 billion yuan ($8.83 billion) combined from Friday for mutual funds that would participate in Ant's IPO as strategic investors.
The fundraising period is two weeks, and each fund, with a lock-in period of 18 months, aims to raise up to 12 billion yuan.
The money managers behind the funds are China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC), E Fund Management Co, Penghua Fund Management Co, China Universal Asset Management Co and Zhong Ou Asset Management Co.
Ant said in its updated prospectus released late on Tuesday that several existing mutual fund products will also participate in its IPO share placement as strategic investors.

Associations belonging to the International Group of P&I Clubs, including the Shipowners' Club and the London P&I Club, said in a circular on Monday that it would not provide cover ""for any activity involving or related to the Nord Stream 2 or TurkStream construction projects"".
It said members were ""strongly urged to assess and mitigate the risks of entering into contracts on the Nord Stream 2 or TurkStream construction projects and exercise the fullest possible due diligence to avoid exposure to sanctions or enforcement actions"".
The International Group of P&I Clubs represents the world's top 13 ship insurers and covers nearly 90% of the world's ocean-going tonnage. The notice carried by its members said that all clubs had issued similarly worded circulars regarding Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream.
Led by Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project to double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 link is more than 90% complete and scheduled to begin operating next year. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has sought to curb the Kremlin's economic leverage over Europe and Turkey and has warned investors in the two natural gas pipelines could face sanctions. 
Former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is chairman of Nord Stream's shareholders committee. Gazprom holds a 51% stake alongside German energy companies E.ON and Wintershall Dea, Engie of France and Dutch firm Gasunie. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has faced calls in recent weeks to halt Nord Stream 2 in response to the suspected poisoning of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny in Siberia last month. 
The Kremlin has said the commercial project is beneficial to both Russia and European countries and that it should not be linked to the Navalny case.
TurkStream, which stretches 930 km (580 miles) across the Black Sea to Turkey, began operating this year.

1037,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 05:22AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Return of the Lockdown Trade,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe's economy is stalling again as rising numbers of Covid-19 infections interrupt the return to normal life. As a result, the stocks that benefited most from the first wave post-pandemic buying are getting a new lease of life. 
Everywhere where the virtual world is displacing the real one, there are fresh signs of momentum, even though the summer rally has already stretched valuations to levels more akin to Silicon Valley's. Take Ocado (LON:OCDO), the company whose software powers an increasing number of food retailers' warehouses. Ocado stock doubled between February and May, as it became clear that the pandemic would accelerate the transition to online food shopping and delivery. It then went nowhere between May and August as the public health situation improved. But in the last two weeks, it has surged another 26%, as investors have started to factor in another winter of coronavirus.
As well they might: U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson indicated that the new restrictions on social contact that his government imposed this week are likely to run for six months. Ocado has also been helped by a trading update that showed sales running ahead even of its own expectations, with the British public reacting very favorably to its joint venture with Marks & Spencer's food business.
Or take Adyen, the Dutch-based payments company that counts Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) among its biggest customers. Ever since it went public, Adyen has been the subject of pursed lips and frowns for having the kind of valuation that European stocks just don't usually get. But its profile begs for it to trade at a Nasdaq-style premium, and so it does. At Wednesday's closing price, it trades at 12 times trailing 12-month sales, and a cool 453 times 2019 earnings. 
Adyen stock hasn't even paused for breath in the same way that Ocado did, and yet it's still up 21% since the end of August. 
Italian payments group Nexi (MI:NEXII) has also gone from one all-time high to another, lifted by the by now almost banal proposition that the pandemic will accelerate the trend to electronic payments, and by constant suggestions that it is an inevitable acquisition target for those, such as Worldline (PA:WLN), who are trying to build a cross-border European payments champion. 
Away from the continent's bigger boards, Norway's Adevinta (OL:ADEV), a specialist in building digital marketplaces, has also broken out to post new all-time highs this week after plateauing in the summer.
All of the above were already considered 'crowded trades' by most even before their last leg up. But economic conditions returning to those that provided the fuel for their initial rally: IHS Markit's purchasing managers index for the euro zone showed how its consumer-facing services that weakened most in September as the continent's second wave of Covid-19 started to build. It would seem reckless to bet against lockdown stocks now. "

Genmab, which specialises in the development of antibody therapeutics for cancer treatment, currently receives royalties from Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company, for sales of its blockbuster Darzalex drug for treatment of multiple myeloma.
The Danish firm said late on Tuesday that a New York arbitration court will determine whether it is entitled to part of Janssen's royalty payments to Halozyme (O:HALO) which supplies the enzyme technology for Darzalex injections.
Janssen started reducing royalty payments to Genmab in the second quarter, the Danish firm said.
The arbitration will also decide the duration of Darzalex royalty payments to Genmab, whether they should expire around 2030, when most of the Genmab patents expire, or in 2035 when Janssen's patents for Darzalex injections expire.
Most analysts assume Genmab will receive royalty payments until 2035. If the arbitration court rules against Genmab on the duration of Darzalex royalties, it would reduce the biotech firm's market value by a quarter, according to analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
""While Genmab intends to vigorously protect its rights under the agreement, the outcome of any arbitration proceeding, as well as its duration, is inherently uncertain,"" Genmab said.
The legal battle creates both an overhang and uncertainty for Genmab shares, which will quickly be priced in, Citi analysts said in a note.
Genmab was the worst performer on the European STOXX 600 index, trading 10.8% lower at 2154 Danish crowns each by 0833 GMT.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - About 8.2 billion Swedish crowns ($919 million) in suspicious funds may have flowed through Swedish bank SEB between 2007 and 2016, Swedish Television (SVT) reported on Wednesday.
The allegations were based on leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which were reported by U.S. and other media on Sunday.
""The information that (SVT's) Uppdrag Granskning presents in its programme does not contain any news for the bank,"" SEB said in a statement.
SEB was fined 1 billion crowns by Sweden's financial watchdog in June for failures in compliance and governance in relation to anti-money-laundering controls in the Baltics.
However, it is unclear whether the transactions reported by SVT are known to the Swedish FSA or covered in its previous investigation. The FSA told Reuters it was reviewing the SVT report and would comment later.
The Baltic scandal, which first ensnaring  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) and resulting in a record Swedish fine for  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa), lifted the lid on money flows from Russian and other non-resident clients into the European Union and elsewhere.
Shares in SEB were up 1.4% at 0825 GMT, despite the report.
""It doesn’t add much that is new. We talked about a relatively large number of suspicious transitions before,"" said Andreas Hakansson, a senior analyst at Danske Bank.
Hakansson added that the SVT programme contained some new details on names connected to suspected wrongdoing at SEB.
Among others, SVT said SEB did business with a British company that was part of the so-called ""Russian laundromat"", an alleged large-scale, Russian-led money laundering scheme reported by media in 2017.
The FinCEN leaks reported by media on Sunday showed several global banks moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds over a period of nearly two decades despite red flags about the origins of the money.
""The transactions mentioned in the leak consist of activities that banks have identified as suspicious ...which is in line with how the banks should act,"" SEB said.

Speaking at Tesla’s much-awaited Battery Day event at a plant in Fremont, California, Musk also said the company plans to manufacture a $25,000 car in about three years’ time. The substantial discount compared with the company’s currently cheapest model at $37,990 is to be achieved by halving costs for batteries, the most expensive component in EVs.
Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Japan Ltd., lowered his rating on Panasonic to underperform from hold, saying Musk’s announcements increase the downside risks for the Japanese electronics maker’s unprofitable battery business.
“This is likely to put Panasonic (and other suppliers) under pressure to catch up to Tesla’s technology/process and to reduce costs,” he said. “With added pressure to improve efficiency and/or reduce costs, Panasonic may need to step up more R&D and is unlikely to have pricing power, even if Tesla’s in-house cells are not ready to replace Panasonic cells in the immediate term.”
Panasonic’s shares are down 10% this year, as the coronavirus has hurt profits across its business lines. Meanwhile, CATL Ltd.’s shares are still up 85% and LG Chem’s have almost doubled on high expectations for Tesla-related business. LG Chem’s stock has dipped recently however on its plan to split off its battery business, snubbing retail investors that had bought the stock on the EV theme.
Yayoi Watanabe, a spokeswoman for Panasonic, declined to comment on Musk’s remarks. “We value our relationship with Tesla and look forward to enhancing our partnership,” she said.

Investing.com - European stock markets climbed Wednesday, following the U.S. higher despite signs that the Eurozone economy came close to stalling again at the end of the third quarter. 
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.7% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 01.9%. 
The 'flash' reading of IHS Markit's purchasing managers index for September fell to 50.1 from 51.9, as ""rising infection rates and ongoing social distancing measures curbed demand, notably for consumer-facing services.""
French business activity slowed to a four-month low in September, according to its flash PMI, while the news from Germany was more promising, with the key manufacturing PMI release climbing to 56.6 from 52.2 the previous month.
Signs of a slowdown have prompted signs of concern at the European Central Bank, fanning hopes of increased stimulus later this year. The consensus view for some time has been that the ECB would increase its flagship bond buying program at its December meeting. Comments on Tuesday by ECB board member Fabio Panetta, who said the ECB should err on the side of providing too much stimulus rather than too little, boosted that view.
Earlier, the Financial Times had reported that the ECB would look at extending the flexibility of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program to its other asset purchase programs, which would effectively provide a stronger safety net to weaker sovereign states in the monetary union. However, outgoing board member Yves Mersch rebutted both that report and Panetta in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday.
Sentiment was also boosted by Tuesday's rebound on Wall Street, following comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in his testimony to Congress, that the central bank remains committed to using its tools “for as long as it takes, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.""
Powell testifies on Capitol Hill again later Wednesday.
In corporate news, BBVA (MC:BBVA) stock climbed 4.6% after the Spanish bank raised its guidance for 2020, thanks mostly to an improvement in its Mexican business. Adidas (DE:ADSGN) shares rose 6.3% after stellar results announced late on Tuesday by its biggest rival, Nike. 
Oil prices stabilized Wednesday after a surprise rise in U.S. oil inventories added to persistent worries about fuel demand as a surge in coronavirus cases around the globe led to stricter containment measures.
The industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, reported late Tuesday that crude oil inventories rose by 691,000 barrels in the week to Sept. 18, compared with forecasts for a drop of 2.3 million barrels. Official data is due out later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $39.77 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $41.76.

The evidence came during an inquiry ordered by the New South Wales state government last year after local media reported Crown hired tour operators with ties to drug traffickers to bring wealthy Chinese gamblers into its Australian resorts - allegations the A$6.2 billion ($4.42 billion) company emphatically denied in full-page newspaper advertisements.
""It's certainly a higher risk than other customers, yes,"" Ken Barton told the inquiry, when asked about hiring tour or ""junket"" operators to bring in gamblers, as is common in the global gaming industry.
""The entry point of risk with junkets starts off as high. We have to accept that they're high-risk when we start the relationship,"" added Barton, who was promoted from the role of chief financial officer in January.
Like casino operators around the world, Crown has experienced a sharp downturn in foreign tour-based, or ""VIP"", turnover, largely from China, because of border closures and enforced shutdowns to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
But the company has for years targeted VIP gamblers as a growth prospect as it gets closer to opening a A$2.2 billion casino resort in Sydney slated for December.
Barton told the inquiry the company had previously focused on compliance and reporting of risks of breaching anti-money laundering laws, but ""the ability to go beyond that and be proactive at eliminating risk ... is something that is incumbent on us to do and we have the capability of doing over time"".

The inquiry continues.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 02:31AM ET</span>",Positive about flying? Airlines look to COVID tests that give results in minutes,"By John Miller and Emilio Parodi
ZURICH/MILAN (Reuters) - European airlines are pinning hopes on pre-flight COVID-19 tests that deliver results as fast as pregnancy tests to help restore passengers' confidence in taking to the skies in confined spaces with shared air. 
Germany's Lufthansa, at the mercy of government bailouts for survival, is in talks with Swiss drugmaker Roche over deploying so-called antigen tests, according to two people familiar with the discussions, as the airline aims to make them available next month. 
Italian operator Alitalia, meanwhile, told Reuters that from Wednesday it would add two flights from Milan to Rome, to the two it is already offering from Rome to Milan, exclusively for passengers with negative tests.
The tests are administered by health authorities at the airports and included in ticket prices. If they prove popular and safe, these antigen-tested flights will be expanded to more domestic, and later international, routes, the airline said. 
Unlike laboratory-based molecular tests that have been the staple of health authorities in the pandemic, antigen tests do not require machines to process. Much like pregnancy tests, they can produce results in about 15 minutes.
However the tests require an uncomfortable nasal swab and are not as accurate as the molecular, or PCR, tests. They generally produce more ""false negatives"" which could mean sick people could slip through the cracks and onto planes.
An increasing number are hitting the market, from companies such as  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT), Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) & Co and Quidel (NASDAQ:QDEL) Corp and Roche, which is rebranding antigen tests from South Korea's privately held SD Biosensor.
Airlines are pressing governments to embrace alternatives to blanket travel restrictions amid a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Europe. 
Rapid antigen tests that can be administered by non-medical staff are expected to become available in coming weeks for as little as $7 each, the head of industry body the International Air Transport Association said on Tuesday.
NEGATIVE-ONLY FLIGHTS
Despite the drawbacks of such antigen tests, carriers hope they could tip the balance in convincing people to fly.
""It is to give ... confidence, at a specific point in time, that the result is positive or negative,"" said Christian Paulus, a Roche research and development manager. 
""The PCR remains the gold standard. Therefore if there are any questions open, or if the clinical appearance of the person who had a negative test, if the person has symptoms like a fever, then you would for sure do confirmatory testing."" 
Alitalia launched its ""COVID Tested Flights"" programme from Rome to Milan last week, and will expand it from Wednesday. Only passengers with negative COVID-19 results can board. 
""So far no positive passengers have been found,"" said an Alitalia spokesman, adding that many chose to take the airline's antigen tests the night before the flight. Travellers can access airport-testing facilities via a preferred lane with their tickets.
The airline plans to analyse findings around the middle of October, but already expects antigen-tested flights will be expanded to domestic and later international routes. ""First, we have to see how this experiment goes,"" the spokesman said. 
The pre-flight antigen tests follow a scheme in Italy where such tests were used defensively. 
SD Biosensor said its tests had been deployed at Italian airports for incoming tourists, to avoid a renewed COVID-19 wave imported from infection hotspots.
'BETTER THAN QUARANTINE'
Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr last week told employees during a townhall meeting that the airline was in talks with Roche. The drugmaker started selling the rapid tests this week, and said SD Biosensor could initially supply it with about 40 million tests per month.
The Lufthansa tests could initially go to cabin crews, a spokeswoman said, though Bjoern Becker, a senior director of product management, ground & digital services for the Lufthansa Group, said the tests could also be made available to first-class and business-class passengers.
""We think the tests would be a better option than putting somebody into quarantine,"" the airline spokeswoman said. 
Beyond airlines, Germany is eyeing broader antigen test use from October, including in nursing homes where older patients have been hardest hit by the deadly virus. 
Regulators still worry about test accuracy, which typically detect the virus 80% to 90% of the time, below the 95% rate of lab tests. 
Still, some officials don't want the perfect to be the enemy of the pretty good as they pursue some semblance of economic normality. 

""They're good enough,"" German health minister Jens Spahn said, pledging antigen tests in ""significant quantities"". The state of Bavaria has already ordered 10 million.

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 02:16AM ET</span>",Old green power plants seek to regenerate as Germany turns off subsidies,"By Christoph Steitz, Vera Eckert and Tom Käckenhoff
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Wilfried Haas owns a 3 kilowatt solar system which has been running as a micro power station since 1992, helping Germany, Europe's largest economy, curb its dependence on coal and nuclear power. All that might be about to change.
Together with thousands of other pioneer investors, Haas is considering whether he can continue his micro-generation without the subsidy scheme that helped to give Germany the highest level of installed renewable capacity in Europe.
After the scheme begins to wind down at the start of next year, Germany in the worst case scenario would lose wind and solar energy equivalent to four nuclear power plants in 2021 alone, industry figures show. For now, it is unclear how any gap will be filled.
Lobby groups on all sides are bickering as Berlin thrashes out an updated version of its renewable energy law. The government will discuss the latest draft on Wednesday.
The legislation is needed because when policymakers limited German subsidies to 20 years in 2000, the country had yet to decide on its Energiewende - or shift from coal and nuclear power to renewable energy.
Haas, 62, began his career in renewable generation before the government's big policy change. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 prompted him to leave his job in industry and he set up a renewable project company GEDEA-Ingelheim in Ingelheim, west of Frankfurt.
Once they became law, Haas benefited from the subsidies, known as feed-in tariffs, for selling renewable energy to the grid at about 50 cents per kilowatt hour.
Without them, he faces earning no more than the wholesale power price of around of 2-4 cents.
Protecting the environment was central, Haas said, and he hoped to continue operating his micro generation but it may cease to be economic if at any stage he faces a major repair bill.
""In that case the financial burden would become too great, meaning that in the current regulatory framework continuing to operate it likely won't pay off,"" he said.
Like other asset owners, he would have to decide whether to sell, upgrade or dismantle his generation capacity should Berlin fail to create a regulatory environment that makes it economic.
In 2021, around 6,000 wind turbines with a capacity of about 4.5 gigawatts (GW) - enough to power 2.1 million households - will lose subsidy status. In addition, 18,000 solar plants, producing 75 megawatts, receive subsidies, industry figures show.
SMALL NOT NECESSARILY BEAUTIFUL
Solar and wind stations contribute to making renewables account for 53% of Germany's 222 GW total installed generation capacity, more than twice the capacity of Britain, Europe's second-largest economy.
""We need to be careful not to lose what we have achieved,"" said Wolfgang Lemb, board member in charge of wind and solar at IG Metall, Germany's biggest and most powerful trade union.
""There must be more flexible regimes for repowering and ideas for how to continue operate old plants economically.""
The big utilities have long complained the playing field is uneven, with fossil fuel generators arguing they should receive subsidies for providing reliable baseload, if renewable energy gets help.
Another issue is that large utilities are unlikely to wish to buy any small-scale generation that might come up for sale from asset-owners who no longer wish to operate it.
Utility companies are, however, interested in marketing roof-generated solar power on behalf of retail energy producers or in upgrading old wind farms.
Norway's Statkraft, for example, is seeking to arrange long-term contracts, referred to as power purchase agreements (PPA), between producers and energy users.
""We do see a lot of potential for PPAs here, both for wind power plants that will see subsidies expire after 2020 and for new solar projects,"" Sascha Schroeder, a vice president at Statkraft, said.
E.ON (DE:EONGn), Germany's largest energy company, said it would help owners of older plants install smart meters - which display supply and consumption - so they can more effectively use the power they generate.
""At the same time, E.ON will take off excess electricity as a direct marketer and the customer benefits from an annual credit or insurance for their PV-systems (photovoltaic),"" a spokesman said.
A decline in the cost of storage batteries could also help.
Marion Noeldgen, who leads the German business of Scandinavian power start-up Tibber, which sells green retail power, said peer-to-peer selling of excess solar power was already an established business in Norway and Sweden.

""We have to see how that could be attractive for clients in Germany, because of course the market price is significantly below the feed-in tariff,"" she said. ""However, it is technically possible.""

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>",KKR to invest $755 million in retail arm of India's Reliance,"By Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) will invest $755 million in the retail unit of  Reliance Industries  Ltd (NS:RELI), the Indian conglomerate said on Wednesday, bringing the total funding in Reliance Retail to $1.78 billion within a month.
Reliance Industries, controlled by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, is lining up investors in its retail unit after the conglomerate raised just over $20 billion this year from global investors, including  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), by selling stakes in its Jio Platforms digital business.
The Mumbai-headquartered Reliance has approached investors in Jio Platforms about buying stakes in its retail arm, Reuters had reported. While Silver Lake, another one of Jio Platforms' backers, said earlier this month it will invest $1.02 billion in Reliance Retail.
KKR's investment for a 1.28% stake in Reliance Retail values the company at 4.21 trillion rupees ($57 billion), Reliance said in a statement. 
""Retail, whether online or offline, is a very capital-intensive business, so for Reliance making sure that their retail venture has a funding pipeline of its own is important,"" said Devangshu Dutta, the chief executive of retail consultancy Third Eyesight.
KKR, which announced its biggest investment in Asia with a $1.5 billion stake buy in Jio Platforms in May, said it was deepening its relationship with Reliance.
Reliance Retail is ""empowering merchants of all sizes and fundamentally changing the retail experience for Indian consumers,"" KKR co-founder Henry Kravis said in the statement.
Reliance, already India's biggest retailer with roughly 12,000 stores, forged a $3.38 billion deal last month to acquire rival Future Group's retail business.
The Indian conglomerate is also attempting to expand its so-called new commerce venture, which ties neighborhood stores to Reliance for online deliveries of groceries, apparel and electronics in a space currently dominated by Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) Flipkart and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Indian arm.

""Anyone taking on the deep-pocketed Amazon and Walmart has to make sure they are equally well-capitalized,"" Dutta said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen trading higher Wednesday, helped by a positive session on Wall Street overnight. Investors will focus on key European sentiment data amid concerns the region’s recovery will be hampered by a second wave of coronavirus cases.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 1%. 
Wall Street's Tuesday rebound was led by a 1.7% gain in the Nasdaq Composite, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 made more muted gains of 0.5% and 1% respectively.
Sentiment was helped by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in his testimony to Congress, that the central bank remains committed to using its tools “for as long as it takes, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.""
Back in Europe, European Central Bank board member Yves Mersch said Wednesday that the growth and inflation outlook in the euro zone has not deteriorated since the central bank decided earlier this month to keep policy unchanged. He also said the ECB's deviation from its usual rules on monetary policy should end when the medical emergency passes.
Investors will pay attention to business sentiment in the eurozone, in the form of PMI data, given the second wave of Covid-19 cases in a number of countries as well as the fraught Brexit negotiations.
“The increase from -14.7 to -13.9 shows that second wave worries have not dented confidence so far, but at these low levels it is also difficult to see the recovery in household consumption maintain the pace of the first months of recovery,” wrote ING’s Bert Colijn, in a research note. 
Oil prices fell Wednesday after a surprise rise in U.S. oil inventories added to persistent worries about fuel demand as a surge in coronavirus cases around the globe led to stricter containment measures.
The industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, reported late Tuesday that crude oil inventories rose by 691,000 barrels in the week to Sept. 18, compared with forecasts for a drop of 2.3 million barrels. Official data is due out later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $39.37 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.9% to $41.34. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1,3% to $1,883.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1681."

The currency tumbled.
Yields on the three-year bond fell as much as seven basis points to a record low of 0.14%, while the benchmark stock index gained almost 2%. The Reserve Bank of Australia will probably cut policy rates to 0.10% while also moving its bond yield target to the same level when it meets on Oct. 6,  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp.’s Evans said in a note.
Evans, who has a reputation for accurately predicting RBA policy shifts, joins other strategists who see a coordinated fiscal and monetary effort next month when the government is expected to announce new stimulus spending. When central bank Deputy Governor Guy Debelle spoke on Tuesday, he pointed out the drawbacks from other policy options including currency intervention, leaving traders to conclude that a rate cut is most likely.
“Expectations are gathering that the RBA will tweak its benchmark interest rate settings lower,” said Tom Nash, strategist at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) in Sydney. “This is significant for ACGBs, and we have been highlighting how short-dated yields have room to drop lower on the basis that such a move would likely include a cut to the three-year bond yield target.”
The RBA’s current cash rate and bond yield target are at 0.25%. Other than Westpac,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd. have also forecast more easing measures. Local newspapers have said the government could inject large amounts of money into the economy and provide extra infrastructure spending funds.
Australian stocks are the top performers in Asia, rising the most in three weeks. They’re defying a selloff in other markets, as rising concerns over possible new virus-related restrictions dent risk sentiment.
“The possible announcements of both greater monetary and fiscal stimulus –- when the budget is handed down in the same week -– has put a new coat of paint on the economic outlook,” IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda said. “That’s why we’re seeing consumer stocks and the financials underpin today’s rally.”
Evans’ call comes as Australia prepares to sell a 2026 bond. The nation has already broken records three times this year as it seeks to fund a raft of stimulus measures.
Andrew Ticehurst, a strategist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. who has been calling for further RBA easing since September 11, sees the three-year yield breaking new lows next month. “We think the decline in three year yields is fair, we expect these yields to be as low as 0.10% on 6 October,” he said.

Investing.com – Hong Kong-listed biotech company GenScript Biotech saw its shares continue to claw back some of the hefty losses sustained Monday after the company’s chairman was effectively detained in China on corruption allegations.
GenScript shares (HK:1548) had plunged as much as 27% on Monday to a 20-month low but recovered almost 10% on Tuesday and continued to gain ground on Wednesday. They were up 2.79% to HK$11.80 ($1.52) by 11:22 PM ET (3:22 AM GMT).

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Sony  Corp (T:6758)'s shares slid as much as 2% in Tokyo trade on Wednesday after  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said it would buy the parent of games publisher Bethesda Softworks, in a deal to bolster its games slate as it eyes cloud gaming expansion.
Sony (NYSE:SNE)'s PlayStation 5 is expected by analysts to outsell Microsoft's next-generation Xbox consoles when the devices launch in November, bolstered by Sony's stronger games pipeline including exclusives like ""Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales.""
Microsoft's $7.5 billion acquisition of the publisher behind hit franchises like ""Doom"" and ""Fallout"" helps close that gap, as it pushes into cloud gaming with the launch of a subscription service last week for Android devices.
The Xbox Game Pass is central to Microsoft's counterattack, with the rival PlayStation Now service from Sony - which has a dominant hardware install base - seen as lagging in terms of games on offer and by being limited to PlayStation and PC.
It will take time for the deal to feed through to Xbox's games pipeline, with Bethesda contracted to bring titles ""Deathloop"" and ""Ghostwire: Tokyo"" to PlayStation 5. 
The concentration of studios in the hands of established players puts clear blue water between a wave of challengers like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc that are moving into gaming but lack killer titles.
""Given the expansion of streaming services as we enter the era of next-gen consoles, we expect this industry consolidation to continue,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a client note.

Japan's markets reopened on Wednesday after national holidays. Sony's shares have risen by almost half since March lows as the gaming industry benefits from demand brought about by stay-at-home policies during the coronavirus outbreak.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning in the wake of U.S. Federal Reserve officials’ comments predicting a slow economic recovery and rising numbers of COVID-19 in the U.S. and Europe.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned on Tuesday that the economy still had a long road ahead before a full economic recovery and required further support, and will testify before the House Select Subcommittee on COVID-19 later in the day. On the same day, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said that rates could rise before the inflation target of 2% is reached. Evans also warned that the U.S. economy risks a longer, slower recovery and “recessionary dynamics” should the U.S. Congress fail to pass the latest fiscal stimulus package.
Although the U.S. House of Representatives passed a stopgap funding bill to keep the federal government running through December 11, investors are waiting to see whether the Senate will also pass the bill.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.64% by 10:57 PM ET (2:57 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.81%.
However, in Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.63%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.29%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.02% and the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.08%. U.S.-China tensions continue to simmer, after U.S. President Donald Trump told the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that China must be held accountable for ""unleashing” COVID-19 on the world.
China responded to the comment by accusing Trump of lying and abusing the U.N. platform to provoke confrontation. However, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for enhanced cooperation over the pandemic and stressed that China had no intention of fighting “either a Cold War or a hot war with any country” in his pre-recorded message for U.N. delegates.
Meanwhile, confusion remains over Oracle’s takeover of TikTok’s U.S. operations. State-backed China Daily said on Wednesday that China has no reason to approve the “dirty and unfair” deal based on “bullying and extortion” struck between  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and ByteDance.”
Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. surpassed 200,000 as of September 23, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Across the Atlantic, the U.K. introduced new restrictions, likely to be in place for six months and Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Britons to work from home where possible. With Greece and Denmark also introducing new restrictive measures, fears are mounting that more countries could follow.
Some investors warned that the uncertainty would likely continue for some time.

The case, part of a broad U.S. probe into bribes paid to South American officials, is the latest to sweep up the Swiss oil-trading giant. Last year, a former Petroleo Brasileiro SA oil trader who went by the code name “Phil Collins” told a Brazilian judge he received bribes from Vitol to favor the firm in contracts.
U.S. prosecutors allege that Javier Aguilar of Houston, who was previously charged in a sealed criminal complaint and arrested, made $870,000 in illicit payments to Ecuadoran officials so they would help him obtain a $300 million fuel-oil contract with Petroecuador.
While the indictment doesn’t name Vitol, the firm is Aguilar’s former employer, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because it’s private. An email to Vitol for comment wasn’t immediately returned. Aguilar couldn’t be reached for comment nor could his lawyer.
Vitol has denied the allegations of bribery in Brazil and has said it has a “zero tolerance” policy regarding bribery and corruption, and that it was cooperating with authorities, including the U.S. Justice Department.
Aguilar was initially charged on a sealed criminal complaint filed on July 10. He made an initial appearance on July 23 and was freed on $100,000 bail. In an indictment unsealed Tuesday brought by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, he was charged with conspiracy to bribe foreign officials and a count of money laundering. He’s scheduled to appear at a later date in federal court in Brooklyn.
Separately, a Florida asphalt company called Sargeant Marine Inc. pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe officials of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company and those of two other South American countries, agreeing to pay $16.6 million to end a wide-ranging U.S. investigation. Charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the company was “part of a scheme and conspiracy to pay bribes on behalf of the company in multiple countries, in Brazil, Venezuela and Ecuador, in order to win valuable business contracts,” the government told a federal judge in New York at a virtual hearing on Tuesday.

In the case involving Boca Raton-based Sargeant Marine, employees engaged in the bribery plot between 2010 and 2018, prosecutor Derek Ettinger said. They bribed Brazilian officials, as well as officials of Petroleos de Venezuela SA, and paid off a senior official of Petroecuador to win a 2014 contract. As a result of the scheme, Sargeant Marine earned about $26.5 million, the government said.
U.S. District Judge Eric Vitaliano in Brooklyn accepted the terms of the plea agreement and sentenced the company immediately.
Prosecutors also disclosed several guilty pleas that had been under seal, including by Daniel Sargeant, described in court papers as “an executive and one of the chief decision-makers” of the company between 2012 and 2016.

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 09:25PM ET</span>",Japan's SBI wants to shake up regional banks. It may get a Suga boost,"By Junko Fujita, Takashi Umekawa and Takahiko Wada
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese financial firm  SBI Holdings Inc  (T:8473) has ambitions to revive struggling regional banks by taking stakes and pushing them into higher-margin businesses - a strategy that may get a boost from the country's new prime minister.
Although regional lenders are dominant outside of Tokyo and other big cities, many are tied to areas where the population is ageing rapidly, and business has been hollowed out. The pandemic has deepened the pain after years of low-margin lending.
Yoshihide Suga has pledged to strengthen local economies and encourage regional banks to consolidate, a shakeup that many say is long overdue.
""If the government is going to focus on revitalising local economies, there absolutely will be a business opportunity in that,"" SBI Chief Executive Yoshitaka Kitao said in an interview.
Kitao spoke to Reuters before Suga announced his intention to run as leader of the ruling party to replace Shinzo Abe.
SBI has so far invested in four regional banks, and Kitao says he wants to expand that to 10. The remaining six tie-ups should come by the end of the financial year, he told Reuters.
If Suga pushes to revive local economies, regional banks could benefit, said Natsumu Tsujino of Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""Under such circumstances, SBI's framework would be more attractive for regional banks, and that could be a tailwind for SBI,"" she said.
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
""There are a lot of regional banks, and some of them don't seem to have changed very much,"" Suga told Reuters in an interview last month, while still chief cabinet secretary.
Without prompting, Suga mentioned SBI's CEO, saying: ""I hear many regional banks are going to see Mr Kitao"".
The two are close, according to one source. Suga has asked Kitao for help with regional banks, Kyodo news agency reported.
SBI declined to comment on Kitao's relationship with Suga or how the company could benefit under the new administration.
Founded in 1999, SBI was the financial unit of SoftBank Group (T:9984) until the tech firm exited in 2006. SBI owns an online bank, an asset manager and Japan's largest online brokerage.
Kitao says he wants to create the fourth-biggest banking force in Japan, behind ""megabanks"" such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (T:8306).
His strategy is to use regional banks to expand SBI's customer base, said Brian Waterhouse of Windamee Research, who publishes on the Smartkarma platform.
""He is not trying to rescue the banking industry or save regional banks. He sees this as an opportunity to expand his empire,"" Waterhouse said.
Smaller cities have plenty of wealthy people, many of whom don't know how to invest, especially in riskier assets with potentially higher returns, Kitao said.
SMALL BANKS, BIG MONEY
Combined net profits of regional banks tumbled 40% in the last four years, according to the country's Financial Services Agency. Yet regional lenders still account for nearly half of all bank deposits in Japan, holding some 368 trillion yen ($3.5 trillion) in cash deposits, according to central bank data.
For Shimane Bank (T:7150), in the western part of the main island, SBI's 34% stake has meant a ""dramatic change"" in how it invests, a spokesman said.
Profits from its securities portfolio improved after it invested with SBI Asset Management, which has connections with global fund managers such as BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the spokesman said.
Chikuho Bank <8398.FU>, on the southern island of Kyushu, has been able to tap an SBI investee company, BASE, to help build e-commerce sites for its customers, something the bank couldn't do itself, a spokesman said.
""The biggest advantage from the alliance has been SBI's connection with technology firms,"" the spokesman said. SBI had a 2.9% stake in Chikuho as of March, according to Refinitiv data.
Fukushima Bank (T:8562), which is 19% owned by SBI, has teamed up with an SBI-owned staffing company to help its customers secure workers.
The bank, a distant third in the prefecture, needs to expand beyond traditional lending, a representative said.
As Japan's population falls and market shrinks, some banks may not want to merge, said Windamee's Waterhouse.
""For these banks who are looking for more capital and rescue, Kitao is perhaps the only option at the moment.""

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 09:20PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines make urgent call for new bailout ahead of October 1 job cuts,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines launched a last-ditch bid to persuade Congress to grant them a new $25 billion bailout to help avert tens of thousands of employee furloughs set to begin Oct. 1.
The chief executives of American Airlines (O:AAL), United Airlines (O:UAL) and JetBlue Airways (O:JBLU) and major aviation unions held a news conference on Capitol Hill on Tuesday afternoon calling for a six-month extension of a payroll support program that consisted primarily of grants in exchange for keeping workers on the payroll.
""We're not going to give up,"" American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said, affirming that the airline would furlough some 19,000 on Oct. 1 without fresh aid.
He reiterated, however, that the company itself is not at risk without assistance. ""American Airlines is going to be fine,"" Parker said.
On Monday, two key Republican senators introduced legislation that would authorize another $25.5 billion in payroll assistance for passenger airlines, but congressional aides said it was unlikely to win passage given aid requests from many other struggling industries.
And with lawmakers shifting their focus to a looming battle over the vacant Supreme Court seat following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the likelihood of Congress passing a broad coronavirus relief package before Oct. 1 is slim.
However, the White House could find a way to provide some assistance to airlines without congressional action. 
The first $25 billion in payroll assistance to airlines was included under the $2.3 trillion CARES Act aid package in March, which also set aside another $25 billion in government loans for airlines.
American was the first U.S. airline to say it would tap its portion of the loans, something United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said on Tuesday his company would also do.
American plans to halt flights to 15 smaller airports starting Oct. 1 without new assistance, while Kirby said United does not plan any immediate flight cuts.
The loans carry restrictions on share buybacks and executive compensation.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), which have stronger balance sheets than their peers, have said they will not use the loans, while JetBlue Airways CEO Robin Hayes said on Tuesday a decision will be made in the near future.
International President of Flight Attendants-CWA President Sara Nelson said the funding was critical. ""This is a jobs program,"" Nelson said, recounting how numerous airline workers are on the brink of losing their jobs.
Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat, proposed at a hearing Tuesday that taxpayers should be fairly compensated for the use of government funds to support private business.

On a call with airline and union leaders, Himes said the industry message feels like a ""hostage situation"" for workers, describing the sentiment as ""Give me the money for free or we (won't) take it and we will fire people.’”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Robinhood Markets Inc, the financial technology startup credited with helping popularize trading among millennials, has increased its latest funding round from investors to $660 million, a spokeswoman for the company said on Tuesday.
The new fundraising is an extension of the Series G round which was announced last month, when D1 Capital Partners invested $200 million in the company, and will give Robinhood an $11.7 billion valuation, the spokeswoman said.
The new cash is coming from new and existing investors in Robinhood, including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, DST Global, Ribbit Capital, 9Yards Capital, and D1 Capital Partners.
""We've raised an additional $460 million in subsequent closings to our Series G to support our core product and customer experience and new offerings like cash management and recurring investments,"" the spokeswoman added.
The fundraising underscores investor appetite to back Robinhood as the company benefits from increased trading activity by retail traders during the COVID-19 lockdown.
Robinhood's latest fundraise will take the amount of capital it has raised from investors in 2020 to around $1.25 billion, and the total amount of capital secured to more than $2 billion, according to Reuters calculations based upon PitchBook data.

1062,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 06:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: LyondellBasell to cut Houston refinery staff by 10% on pandemic losses,"By Erwin Seba
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  LyondellBasell Industries  (N:LYB) said on Tuesday that it plans to cut salaried staff at its Houston oil refinery because of losses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company confirmed the contents of an email seen by Reuters, in which executive vice president Torkel Rhenman said Lyondell wants ""a reduction of approximately 10% of the refinery population.""
Refiners have posted large losses this year as air and road travel have cratered amid widespread lockdowns and work-from-home policies to combat the spread of the coronavirus. 
Several U.S. refineries have closed or reduced operations this year. In August, Marathon Petroleum (N:MPC) said it would permanently close two plants in response to lower fuel demand. Calcasieu Refining idled its Louisiana plant for economic reasons the same month.
""The refinery utilization rate is within two to four bad weeks of taking out the all-time record low of 66.7%,"" Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities USA, said in a note on Tuesday. Gasoline margins are threatening to go negative, he said, and leave the price of a barrel of gasoline below the cost of the oil used to produce it. 
Lyondell employs about 800 workers at its Houston refinery.
The planned job cuts would not apply to refinery workers covered by a union contract, which prohibits layoffs.
In a letter to employees, Refinery Manager Greg Nevermann said that before imposing involuntary layoffs the company would offer enhanced retirement packages to eligible employees and offer reassignments to the chemical maker’s other locations.
“Given the drop in demand and increase in industry refining capacity, we anticipate the outlook for the refinery will remain challenging for the next several years,” Nevermann said in the letter, which was seen by Reuters.
Lyondell's cost-cutting, including cutting travel and outside consultants and deferring non-safety-related maintenance, has not succeeded in reducing losses, he wrote. 
In July, Lyondell said the refinery lost $107 million in the first six months of this year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. During the same period of 2019 it posted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the refining business of $81 million.
The refinery dates to 1918. Between 1985 and 2007, the 263,776 barrel-per-day plant was an integral part of Lyondell's operations, supplying feedstocks to its chemical units. 

Following a merger with Basell in 2007 and emergence from bankruptcy in 2012, the company expanded chemical production plants around the world, making the oil refinery secondary to its petrochemical business.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>","After much hype from Elon Musk, Tesla's 'Battery Day' kicks off","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk fired up fans and investors for the company's ""Battery Day"" on Tuesday, even as he tempered expectations that Tesla's electric vehicles will soon surpass the cost and convenience of traditional gasoline-powered cars.
At the opening of the event, which drew nearly 250,000 online viewers, Musk walked on stage in a black t-shirt and jeans as about 250 shareholders -- each sitting in a Tesla Model 3 in the company parking lot -- honked their car horns in approval.
Ahead of the event, Tesla shares closed on Tuesday at $424.23, down 5.6% after Musk tweeted late Monday that the battery improvements to be unveiled at the event would not reach ""serious high-volume production"" until 2022. Shares rose 1.5% in after-hours trade. 
As automakers shift from horsepower to kilowatts to comply with stricter environmental regulations, investors are looking for evidence that Tesla can increase its lead in electrification technology over legacy automakers who generate most of their sales and profits from combustion-engine vehicles. 
Analysts expect Tesla to present a range of updates, including significant improvements to the amount of energy its batteries can store, allowing vehicles to drive further on a single charge. They also await updates on the production cost of battery cells, largely seen as an impediment to wider electric vehicle adoption.
Musk in July said scaling battery cell production at an affordable price was Tesla's biggest limitation to growth.
While average electric vehicle prices have decreased in recent years thanks to changes in battery composition, they are still more expensive than conventional cars, with the battery estimated to make up a quarter to a third of an electric vehicle's cost.
Some researchers estimate that price parity, or the point at which electric vehicles are equal in value to internal combustion cars, is reached when battery packs cost $100 per kilowatt hour (kWh).
Tesla's battery packs cost $156 per kWh in 2019, according to electric vehicle consulting firm Cairn Energy (OTC:CRNCY) Research Advisors, which would put the cost of a 90-kWh pack at around $14,000.
Analysts at UBS expect Tesla to announce battery cell costs of $70 to $80 per kWh over the next three years, allowing the company to save roughly $2,300 per vehicle.
Such a price advantage would leave competitors unlikely to catch up to Tesla, the UBS analysts said. 
Tesla currently produces batteries in partnership with Japan's Panasonic Corp (T:6752) at its $5 billion Nevada factory, while South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910) and China's CATL (SZ:300750) supply cells to its Shanghai factory.
Tesla is also building its own cell manufacturing facility at its new factory in Germany and is setting up a battery research and manufacturing facility at its largest vehicle factory in Fremont, California.

Musk in July also said Tesla was open to license and supply powertrains and batteries to other automakers.

(Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rebounded on Tuesday, led by a jump in Amazon.com, even as a likely delay in new fiscal stimulus by Congress and an increase in the number of coronavirus cases dampened hopes of a faster economic recovery. 
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) jumped 5.7% after Bernstein upgraded the stock to ""outperform,"" saying the company will continue to receive a boost from premium subscribers and third-party merchants even once the pandemic is contained.
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), which have fueled Wall Street's rally since the pandemic slammed markets in March, all rose more than 1.6%. They had carried the brunt of recent declines.

Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes closed higher, led by information technology (SPLRCT) and consumer discretionary (SPLRCD).
U.S. stocks on Monday extended a three-week losing streak as fears of a new round of lockdowns in Europe and the stalemate in Congress over the size and shape of another coronavirus-response bill dented hopes of a swift economic recovery.
""We have some fears about a number of different things that hurt the near-term growth outlook,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, who also cited the Federal Reserve's cautious economic outlook.

Investors are now bracing for an extended period of market volatility on concerns over growing political uncertainty in Washington that has been sharpened by the death last week of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
""All the political energies are going to be directed towards the next Supreme Court nomination. I don't see them paying attention to that and pushing stimulus through at the same time,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management in New York.

Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) fell 5.6% after Chief Executive Elon Musk warned about the difficulties of speeding up production as an expert cautioned that the electric carmaker's increased reliance on large-scale aluminum parts could bring new manufacturing challenges.

(Reuters) - U.S. pork exports to China have surged beyond pre-trade war levels, led by higher shipments from Brazil's JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) and China's WH Group Ltd (HK:0288), owner of Smithfield Foods, according to Panjiva, the research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence.
JBS may have shipped 370% more U.S. pork to China this year through Aug. 31 than at the same period in 2017, while exports linked to WH Group rose 90.1%, Panjiva said Tuesday. Meanwhile, Springdale, Arkansas-based  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) shipped 7.3% less pork to China compared to the same period in 2017.
U.S. President Donald Trump in April ordered U.S. meat processing plants to remain open to ensure domestic meat supplies despite COVID-19 outbreaks among workers.
JBS told Reuters in April, when plants across the country were closing due to outbreaks, that it reduced exports to focus on meeting U.S. demand.
JBS and Smithfield did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. 
Democratic U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker in June asked meat companies how much they exported to China during the pandemic. 
JBS said in response that its total market share of U.S. pork to China had been less than 10%. Exports are comprised largely of products like pigs' feet and livers that American consumers generally do not eat, JBS said.
Smithfield told the senators it would not give preference to foreign customers. 
China agreed to import a record $36.5 billion in U.S. farm goods in the Phase 1 trade deal signed in January, with pork expected to be key to reaching the mark.
Chinese demand is seen rising further after Beijing blocked imports from Germany, which has suffered an outbreak of a pig disease.

U.S. meat production has recovered as plants have reopened after being hit by COVID-19. Frozen pork supplies in cold-storage facilities reached a three-month high in August, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

(Reuters) -  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  (OTC:DLAKY) plans to start making rapid COVID-19 antigen tests available to passengers in October and is weighing the option of opening test centres at airports in the United States and Canada, a company executive said on Tuesday. 
The move comes as airlines and airports globally have urged countries to accept a passenger's negative COVID-19 test as an alternative to travel restrictions and quarantines that have battered demand for travel.
While the aviation industry has largely backed the use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests which take several hours to process in a lab, airline trade group IATA on Tuesday touted antigen tests that can be processed on site and typically give results within about 15 minutes. 
 Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) recently won the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for BinaxNOW, a $5 disposable device the size of a credit card. Some other antigen tests must be read using a small, portable device. 
""You know that companies like Abbott or Roche are bringing these tests to the market and we are definitely looking into this,"" said Bjoern Becker, senior director, product management, ground & digital services for the Lufthansa Group. 
""You will see us applying them for new products within the next few weeks in October,"" he told reporters during a virtual call. ""That's definitely the next thing to come."" 
Becker said Lufthansa is considering making the new antigen tests initially available to its first-class and business class passengers, given limited supply. 

Lufthansa is also looking at ways to expand its network of testing centers to airports in the United States and Canada, given that they are important markets, he said.

Nike shares gained more than 8% in after-hours trade following the report.
Nike announced earnings  per share of 95 cents on revenue of $10.59 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 44 cents on revenue of $8.89 billion.
Direct sales were $3.7 billion, up 12% on a reported basis with growth across all geographies, the company said.
Nike shares are up 15% from the beginning of the year, still down 2.90% from its 52 week high of $120.47 set on September 15. They are outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 2.63% from the start of the year.
""Our first quarter revenue performance was impacted by strong NIKE Brand digital growth of 82 percent, offset by lower revenue in our wholesale business and NIKE-owned stores,"" the company said.
North America, the company's biggest market, saw a 2% decline in sales, Greater China revenue increased by 6% on a reported basis, while EMEA returned to growth of 5%, led by triple-digit growth in digital.
But margins fell by 90 basis points to 44.8%, driven by the impacts from COVID-19, including higher promotions to reduce excess inventory across the marketplace and higher supply chain costs, the company said. Inventory rose 15% from the same period a year earlier but decreased 9% from the previous quarter.

Shares of the company were up nearly 2.4%, having lost about 19% in market value on Monday as Milton resigned following claims of nepotism and fraud by a Wall Street short-seller that have drawn interest from U.S. regulators.
""We feel very confident about due diligence that has been performed by our partners, and as you can see, our partners have been 100% supportive and behind us,"" Brady told investors at a virtual conference organized by Evercore ISI.
General Motors Co (N:GM) and Germany's Bosch said on Monday they were sticking to their alliances with Nikola.
""We recommend that investors really focus on the future, and what we have delivered, and what we are going to deliver,"" Brady said.

Milton, who had strongly denied the accusations leveled by short-seller Hindenburg Research in several Twitter postings, appeared to have disabled his account on the social-media site on Tuesday.

Investing.com – The Dow ended higher Tuesday as gains in technology helped the broader market shake off weakness from financials and worries over a second wave of Covid-19.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.30%, or 80 points. while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.20% and theS&P 500 climbed 0.74%
Tech continued its strength following a wave of buying into the close Monday as investors swooped in to scoop up the Fab 5 stocks, with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) leading the group following an upgrade from Bernstein.
Bernstein upgraded Amazon to outperform from market perform and said the pandemic has ""has pulled forward secular trends, from e-commerce to digital advertising and Cloud, with Amazon as a primary beneficiary across all three revenue pools.""
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded higher.
Financials, however, slipped nearly 1%, led by a decline in bank stocks as Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank remains committed to using its tools “for as long as it takes, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.""
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) fell, with the latter down about 2%.
Lower interest rates weigh on banks’ net interest margin -- the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their depositors.
Powell continued to caution on the outlook for the economy, stressing the importance of further fiscal stimulus from Congress to keep the recovery on track.
Following a “skinny” coronavirus aid bill rejection last week, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of 50 Democratic and Republican members of Congress, has proposed $1.5 trillion virus relief package to force lawmakers to reinitiate talks.
But progress has been hampered by the ongoing battle over the replacement of the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Overall investor sentiment, however, remained challenged by a resurgence in the spread of the virus.
In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the country was at a “perilous turning point” and reversed the lifting of some lockdown measures in England. The U.S. reported 52,000 new cases on Monday, the highest single-day increase since Aug. 14, according to Johns Hopkins University.
In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell nearly 6% after the chief executive Elon Musk tempered investor expectations ahead of the company’s ‘Battery Day,’ which kicks off later today.

Investing.com  -- Markets closed higher after struggling to figure out what to do with the day, recovering from three down days. 
Shares recovered a bit from Monday's pummeling, with tech in the lead, as usual. Banks were lower after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated to Congress that the central bank remains committed to using its tools “for as long as it takes, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.""
The U.K. is shutting back down for six months because of a Covid-19 resurgence, and the U.S. has more than 200,000 people dead because of the virus. 
There's more Powell testimony on Capitol Hill coming up Wednesday, along with a big-name IPO and a couple of earnings reports.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Day two of Fed Chair's testimony on Capitol Hill
Powell appears before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) to discuss the central bank’s response.
On Tuesday, Powell said the U.S. economy has a long way to go before fully recovering from the coronavirus pandemic and will need further support, Bloomberg reported.
“The path forward will depend on keeping the virus under control, and on policy actions taken at all levels of government,” he said told the House Financial Services Committee. While a recovery is underway, “both employment and overall economic activity, however, remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, and the path ahead continues to be highly uncertain.”
2. Yet another highly-anticipated IPO 
Peter Thiel's Palantir Technologies is finally planning its debut via a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The highly anticipated listing was slated for Wednesday, but Renaissance Capital recently reported it could be pushed back to Sept. 29. Either way, investors will be watching the latest tech go public with keen interest.
The company detects patterns in large data sets, and works with U.S. government spy agencies, among others. Thiel is a  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL)co-founder and early investor in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). 
3. Company earnings
 General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) reports fiscal 2021 first quarter results tomorrow. Analysts expect the cereal maker to post earnings per share of 87 cents on sales of $4.22 billion. Shares are up about 9% in 2020.
Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) should publish earnings per share of $2.11 on sales of $1.69 billion when it reports tomorrow. The stock is up about 10% this year.

A promotional video for the new channel, which will be free, said short-selling needs to be explained in detail so that investors can understand the issues and make decisions about how to protect themselves.
""This is the information that nobody else in the marketplace has any incentive to give you, except for activist short sellers,"" Block said on the video.
Short sellers such as Block do extensive research on companies they think are over-valued or have engaged in fraudulent practices. The strategy entails borrowing stock to sell, then buying it back later at a lower price for a profit. 
RealVision.com, a website dedicated to investing through the use of video, will be the production arm for Zer0es TV, which will have both live and pre-recorded content, said Stefan Prelog, a spokesman for Zer0es TV.

""This video channel is the go-to place for anything to do with short-selling,"" a blurb on a RealVision web page says. ""Nothing is off limits and nothing is watered down.""

The Center for Exhibition Industry Research on Tuesday gave a somber forecast for trade-show promoters, vendors and attendees, many of whom have had to switch to digital events for the time being. But the trade group said these online alternatives bring in only 13% of the gross revenue of an in-person event.
Small business-to-business shows have started to resume around the country, including some recent shows in Atlanta and Indianapolis. However, most big conventions won’t start back until the third quarter of next year because of social distancing requirements and people’s anxiety over flying, said Nancy Drapeau, CEIR’s vice president of research.
“Virtual events are trading digital dimes for trade-show dollars,” Drapeau said, quoting a piece of wisdom floating around the industry.
After some modest single-digit growth in recent years, an index that tracks factors such as attendance and revenue in the B-to-B trade-show industry is set to decline 76% in 2020 compared with last year, according to CEIR, which predicts a still-large 20% drop next year. Promoters stage about 9,400 B-to-B conventions annually.
Conventioneers seem willing to drive to trade shows, which is giving a boost to the smaller regional gatherings that are starting to resume, Drapeau said, adding that the industry also is bullish on Abbott Laboratories’ new 15-minute Covid-19 test.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) urged California officials on Tuesday to let the company reopen the Disneyland theme park, which remains shuttered six months after closing down to help curb the spread of coronavirus.
With approval from local authorities, Disney has reopened its parks in Shanghai, Paris and Florida with limited attendance, face mask requirements and other measures to prevent COVID-19 infections. Hong Kong Disneyland is set to reopen on Friday.
Disney parks officials, in a video briefing for reporters on Tuesday, said their safeguards had been successful and were given high marks by guests in customer surveys. The video included footage of families and employees throughout various parks wearing masks, keeping their distance on rides and saying they felt safe and enjoyed their visit.
Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney parks, experiences and products, urged California officials to provide ""fair and equitable guidelines"" to allow Disneyland in Anaheim, California, to reopen.
""As you can see from this discussion today, we're ready,"" D'Amaro said. ""And more importantly, it's time."" 
The state currently ranks coronavirus levels in the Orange County, where Disneyland is located, as ""substantial,"" the second-highest category.
D'Amaro urged state officials to consider the economic repercussions of keeping Disneyland closed. The resort supported nearly 80,000 jobs in the region when it was open.
""The longer we wait, the more devastating the impact will be on Orange County and the tens of thousands of people who rely on us for employment,"" he said. 
""With the right guidelines and our years of operations experience, I'm confident that we can restart and get people back to work,"" he added.

Representatives for California Governor Gavin Newsom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wells Fargo CEO ruffles feathers with comments about diverse talent,"By Imani Moise, Jessica DiNapoli and Ross Kerber
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) Chief Executive Charles Scharf exasperated some Black employees in a Zoom meeting this summer when he reiterated that the bank had trouble reaching diversity goals because there was not enough qualified minority talent, two participants told Reuters.
He also made the assertion in a company-wide memo June 18 that announced diversity initiatives as nationwide protests broke out following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man, in police custody.
""While it might sound like an excuse, the unfortunate reality is that there is a very limited pool of black talent to recruit from,"" Scharf said in the memo, seen by Reuters.
Scharf spent more time listening than speaking during the previously unreported 90-minute call which he initiated. His comments about Black talent rubbed some attendees the wrong way, according to the two employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared repercussions.
Not all attendees recalled being offended. ""The meeting was incredibly constructive. ... I walked away being incredibly surprised at how genuine and sincere he is,"" said Alex David, president of the Black/African American Connection Team Member Network. 
But several Black senior executives across corporate America said they are frustrated by claims of a talent shortage, and called the refrain a major reason that companies have struggled to add enough racial and ethnic diversity to leadership ranks, despite stated intentions to do so.
""There is an amazing amount of Black talent out there,"" said Ken Bacon, a former mortgage industry executive on the boards of Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA), Ally Financial Inc (N:ALLY) and Welltower Inc (N:WELL). ""If people say they can't find the talent, they either aren't looking hard enough or don't want to find it.""
Bacon said he was ""shocked and puzzled"" by Scharf's comments.
Wells Fargo spokeswoman Beth Richek defended Scharf's record on diversity.
The CEO of the largest U.S. bank employer has pledged to double the number of Black leaders over five years and tied executive compensation to reaching diversity goals. He is also requiring hiring managers to consider diverse candidates for high-paying roles that are vacant, and ensure diversity on interview teams.
Since Scharf joined the bank a little less than a year ago, it has added two Black executives to its operating committee - Lester Owens, head of Operations; and Ather Williams (NYSE:WMB), head of Strategy, Digital and Innovation.
Wells Fargo's latest proxy disclosed more diversity data than those of many other companies, including that two of 12 directors at the time were Black and one was ""Latino/Hispanic.""
Scharf ""is committed to deep and systemic change to increase diversity and has held several forums where there has been candid conversation and unfiltered feedback,"" Richek said in a statement. 
""TALENT IS THERE""
Introspection across corporate America during the Black Lives Matter movement has cast a harsh light on the lack of diversity. In boardrooms, African-Americans made up 10% of new director appointments in the Fortune 500 last year compared with their 13% of the U.S. population, according to a 2020 report from executive recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles. New Hispanic directors were even more scarce, the study found.
Only 7.3% of the five highest-paid executives at financial companies in the Russell 3000 were racial or ethnic minorities, according to data from ISS ESG, an arm of the proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services. That number has risen in recent years, yet remains far below the percentage of minority groups in the general U.S. population. 
Senior corporate executives and recruiters said the notion of a shallow minority talent pool is frequently cited as a hurdle to improving diversity but probably reflects insular professional and social networks.
Lauren Holland, who chairs a word-of-mouth professional network called Wall Street Friends, said she has 8,000 members in minority communities, and sent out more job posts to them in the last two months than in the last five years.
""I literally get emails every single day from people asking to be added to our list,"" she said. ""The talent is there. It's just a matter of the firm accessing it and connecting with it.""
NOT ENOUGH PROGRESS
Experts said one reason board rooms and C-suites lack diversity is that such jobs are often filled by people who have managed businesses, while many people of color have tended to be stuck in roles that lack a direct connection to profits.
""As women and minorities started to gain traction in corporate America, they were trapped in certain jobs companies felt comfortable placing them in, like human resources, administrative-support type functions,"" said Teri McClure, former general counsel and chief human resources officer at  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), who sits on several boards, including that of JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU).
McClure said she frequently hears comments like Scharf's when companies have not tried hard enough to find diverse candidates or give them the experience to qualify for senior roles.
Some Black directors and executives said they were unhappy with the progress in improving diversity.
""Unless I practically get on a soapbox about it and ask about it every meeting, it gets pushed out,"" said Mary Winston, a director at companies including  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG), about some of her past work on boards. ""It's just not as robust a conversation as it should be, and no progress has been made.""
Winston, adding that she is often the only person of color in board rooms, also disagreed with the notion of a talent shortage.

One of the Wells Fargo employees said there simply was no lack of talent: ""I can get them 10 to 15 resumes today.""

The New York-based fashion house, which has 530 stores globally, said the changes would see it move more business online. 
The company did not say how many or what type of jobs could go, but based on its last reported total workforce of about 24,900 employees, the changes could impact more than 3,700 employees.
""The changes happening in the world around us have accelerated the shifts we saw pre-COVID, and we are fast-tracking some of our plans to match them,"" Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet said. 
The health crisis has hit demand for high-end handbags, apparel and accessories as more customers hold back on non-essential spending, forcing many companies to slow their expansion plans. 
It has also put the brakes on the industry's biggest ever merger, with France's LVMH (PA:LVMH) trying to back out of its $16 billion deal to acquire  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF). 
Britain's  Burberry  Group (L:BRBY) and luxury department store operator Harrods have also cut hundreds of jobs. 
""After stores reopened, the second phase of recovery for retailers is looking at their balance sheets and how to improve profitability, and for high-end clothing companies, that often means closing stores or letting people go,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates. 
However, online sales of luxury goods have surged and Ralph Lauren said it would invest in digital platforms to support e-commerce operations and expand product personalization. 

The layoffs could result in gross annual pre-tax savings of about $180 million to $200 million, the company said. It expects to incur one-time pre-tax charges of about $120 million to $160 million in fiscal 2021.

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>",Permira buys German specialty pharma group Neuraxpharm,"By Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Buyout group Permira has agreed to buy German pharma group Neuraxpharm, seeking to gain from an expected rise in demand for the company's antidepressants, painkillers and other products for the central nervous system, the companies said on Tuesday.
The deal values the company at almost 1.7 billion euros ($1.88 billion), including debt, or at about 13 times its expected 2021 core earnings, three people close to the matter said. 
Permira and the seller, private equity firm Apax, declined to comment on the financial details of the deal. 
The British buyout firm prevailed against competing offers from Carlyle, ICG and Goldman Sach's private equity arm, the sources said. 
The runners-up also declined to comment.
Apax bought Neuraxpharm in 2016, combined it with Invent Farma, and later strengthened the company through add-on acquisitions, such as FB Health and Farmax. 
The company makes specialty pharmaceuticals for neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression and psychosis. It has annual revenues of more than 460 million euros and 850 employees.
While global M&A activity hit its lowest level in more than a decade in the second quarter, deal-making in the healthcare sector is expected to buck the trend this year as its products and services are considered resilient to the COVID-19 crisis, investment bankers say.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) advised Apax on the deal, which Reuters flagged in July, while Rothschild advised Permira.
Jefferies is supplying a pre-arranged financing package - so-called staple financing - of more than 6.5 times core earnings, a source close to the matter said.
Apax Global Alpha, which is an investor in the Apax VIII fund selling Neuraxpharm, said the deal is expected to result in a gross multiple on invested capital of 3.5 times and a gross internal rate of return of 36%.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 12:46PM ET</span>",French presidential palace requested LVMH letter: sources,"By Michel Rose, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Elizabeth Pineau
PARIS (Reuters) - France's presidential palace asked the country's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to write to LVMH advising the luxury goods company to defer its purchase of U.S. jeweller Tiffany, two sources familiar with the letter's origins told Reuters.
The French company's $16 billion purchase of Tiffany (N:TIF) hit the rocks this month after LVMH (PA:LVMH) said it could not complete the deal by a Nov. 24 deadline, triggering a legal battle.
LVMH cited, in part, an official foreign ministry request to delay closing the deal to January amid trade tensions with the United States. The letter requesting the delay was signed by Le Drian, U.S. legal filings by Tiffany and LVMH show.
The two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Elysee Palace, President Emmanuel Macron's office, had asked Le Drian to produce the letter. 
The Elysee declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the foreign ministry referred enquiries to a representative for Le Drian, who did not immediately respond. 
Le Drian said in parliament on Tuesday, that, in the context of an ongoing trade row with the United States, his ministry had received an enquiry from LVMH, and that it was natural for him to respond with advice. There was no immediate comment from LVMH on Le Drian's remarks 
Asked by Reuters about any interactions between the Elysee and the foreign ministry over the letter, an LVMH spokesman repeated statements denying it had solicited the letter.
Tiffany declined to comment on any Elysee involvement.
COVID SPILLOVER
The coronavirus crisis has dealt a huge blow to the luxury goods sector and raised questions about whether LVMH was overpaying with its $135 a share offer.
LVMH said after the deal fell apart that Tiffany had significantly underperformed LVMH's own comparable brands in the first half of 2020, and that the U.S. group's prospects for 2020 were ""very disappointing"".
In a lawsuit filed in Delaware to force the deal through, Tiffany said updated forecasts it had provided to LVMH in August 2020 projected that its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 would be greater than the previous year, demonstrating a rapid return to, and surpassing of, its pre-pandemic performance.
Sources told Reuters in June that LVMH's billionaire owner Bernard Arnault, a dealmaker known as the ""wolf in cashmere"" who has built an empire through acquisitions, was exploring ways to renegotiate the price, something LVMH has denied. 
Analysts have said the two sides may still agree to close the deal at a lower price, although some did not rule out that Arnault may have already set his sights elsewhere.
CONTESTED LETTER 
One point of contention has been the provenance of the Aug. 31. letter from the foreign ministry. Lawyers for LVMH sent an English translation of it to Tiffany's lawyers, a legal filing submitted by the U.S. firm shows.
""In order to support the steps taken vis-a-vis the American government, you should defer the closing of the pending Tiffany transaction until January 6, 2021,"" the filing quoted the letter as saying.
""I am sure that you will understand the need to take part in our country’s efforts to defend its national interests.""
Responding to media reports that LVMH had solicited the letter, the French company has said repeatedly that it had no involvement, and that any reports it was involved are malicious. 
Two government sources familiar with the details told Reuters that LVMH approached the French finance ministry seeking help in deferring completion of the deal.
The two government sources were not the same sources who said the Elysee asked the foreign minister to provide the letter. 
One of the two government sources said the approach by LVMH to the finance ministry happened in mid-July. The second source did not say when it had happened.
Both of the government sources said the finance ministry rejected the request from LVMH.

The finance ministry declined to comment. Asked on Tuesday if LVMH had any involvement in the origins of the letter, the company spokesman said: ""We formally deny these unfounded rumours"".

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Strong online sales and demand from Chinese shoppers and students heading back to school are expected to have helped  Nike  (N:NKE) swing back to a profit in the first quarter, a sequential improvement from the surprise loss it posted in July, according to Refinitiv.
With malls and department stores like J.C. Penney (N:JCP) shutting shops due to COVID-19 lockdowns, people turned to e-commerce, buying significantly more products directly from Nike's website. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Nike reported a 75% rise in online sales and Wall Street analysts expect this to continue - at least nine have raised their price targets on the stock in the last two weeks.
E-commerce sales are now nearly a third of Nike's total revenue – a goal Nike had previously set for 2023. Nike's first-quarter adjusted sales in China are also expected to have grown by more than 10% as official lockdowns there all but ended.
Particularly in North America, sales in the global athletic footwear and apparel industry have picked up, and Nike will get a boost from the new back-to-school dynamic, said Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia.
Portland, Oregon-based Nike is expected to post a net profit of $729 million in the most recent quarter, versus a loss of $790 million in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv.
To save costs and target investment online this year, the company said in July it would cut corporate jobs starting Oct. 1 and end nine major retail contracts, including deals with department store Dillard's (NYSE:DDS) and Amazon.com-owned (O:AMZN) shoe retailer Zappos. Nike in July scrapped plans to open a major shoe plant in Arizona in favor of investments elsewhere.

The company has invested this year in marketing itself as a supporter of high-profile social and political movements like Black Lives Matter and Time to Vote, and launched a new maternity line and several inclusive ad campaigns.

FTSE Russell, which runs the World Government Bond Index (WGBI) <.SBWGU>, a benchmark for an estimated $2 trillion in cash, is due to announce a decision during its annual index review scheduled for September 24.
Morgan Stanley last week put the chance of China's inclusion at 60%-70% but raised it on Tuesday after Beijing allowed more flexible settlement of trades, including scrapping the need for Japanese investors to make paper submissions in the widely-used Bond Connect system.
""This is a material improvement to bond access, in our view, and increases the chances of WGBI inclusion on September 24 significantly,"" the bank's strategist Min Dai said.
Inclusion would give China a 5.7% weight in the high-profile WGBI based on current estimates, just behind Germany at 6% and compared to 33.8% for the United States and 16.7%, 8.2% and 7.3% for Japan, France and Italy respectively.
The actual inclusion will happen in September 2021 with a 20-month phase-in. Morgan Stanley estimates it could help funnel $60-$90 billion of investment money into the country in the next few years and $3 trillion over the next decade.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. regulator to relax proposed whistleblower caps, tighter tip deadlines - sources","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator is poised to walk back a proposal to impose discretionary caps on whistleblower awards and tighten deadlines for formally filing tips when it votes to overhaul the bounty program this week, five people briefed on the matter told Reuters.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday will finalize changes to its whistleblower program, but will water down these proposed measures after whistleblower advocates, lawyers and lawmakers said the changes could deter insiders from flagging corporate fraud and misconduct.
In 2018, the SEC proposed https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-120 reworking the program which allows the SEC to reward tipsters whose original information leads to a penalty exceeding $1 million with between 10% and 30% of the fine. Created in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis, the program has resulted in more than $2 billion in penalties and $523 million in tipster rewards. 
The program attracts thousands of tips annually, public data shows, overwhelming SEC staff who can take years to assess all the claims and issue awards. SEC chair Jay Clayton has said he views the program as vital, but wants to make it more efficient and speed up awards. 
The SEC proposed, among other measures, giving staff more latitude when assessing the value of awards and the discretion to reduce some payouts if they exceeded $30 million.
    It also proposed requiring that whistleblowers formally file their tip within 30 days of first making contact with the agency. Currently, whistleblowers may file their tip, a long legal document required to claim a bounty, long after they first make contact with SEC staff and a probe is underway.
    Whistleblower advocates and lawyers said the changes would reduce incentives for tipsters to flag the most egregious frauds by increasing the legal costs of filing tips, limiting rewards and creating uncertainty. Whistleblowers face big risks and need confidence they will be adequately compensated, advocates say.
Some of the planned changes had also met with resistance on Capitol Hill, including from Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, a longtime champion of federal whistleblower protections, the sources said. Democratic lawmakers on Friday also wrote https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Ltr_to_Chair_Clayton_WB_rule_09172020.pdf to Clayton, warning against reducing rewards or injecting ""uncertainty and ambiguity"" into the program.
The SEC on Wednesday is set to water down those two proposals, the five people said. One of them added it will replace the proposed discretionary cap with a ""more generous"" solution, without elaborating. The same person said it will also address the filing deadline issue so that ""in no case would a whistleblower not be eligible for an award because they contacted the SEC informally.""
While the concessions are a win for whistleblowers, some lawyers raised new concerns in recent days that another provision would limit rewards the agency can issue for related enforcement actions brought by fellow agencies. 
Stephen Kohn, a partner at Kohn, Kohn and Colapinto, warned in a public letter filed with the SEC on Monday that the change could discourage cooperation between multiple enforcement agencies. Reuters could not ascertain if the SEC planned to address that concern.
Corporate lobbyists have been pushing the SEC to revise the program for years. They say excessive awards have spawned a cottage industry of tipsters and their attorneys who get a cut of the reward, overwhelming SEC staff with unhelpful and sometimes bogus tips. The SEC received 5,200 tips in 2019, the second highest number since the program kicked off in 2011. 
The majority of awards have been less than $2 million but some have been as high as $50 million. The SEC has said the proposed changes would ensure rewards are ""reasonably necessary"" and has pointed out that additional discretion would also allow staff to adjust bounties upwards in cases of smaller penalties.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - UniCredit (MI:CRDI) is looking to sell its German leasing operations and a local real estate investment unit, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, marking another move by the Italian bank to shed assets.
UniCredit's German leasing business, which provides financing for capital goods such as machinery, has an equity value of around 500 million euros ($587 million), one of sources said.
A representative for UniCredit in Germany declined to comment.
UniCredit has completed a successful restructuring under CEO Jean Pierre Mustier since mid-2016, shedding billions of euros in assets to bolster its financial strength and clean up its balance sheet.
European banks are now bracing for a new surge in unpaid loans once government support measures to help businesses hit by coronavirus lockdown measures and weakening demand are phased out. 
UniCredit's plans come after sources told Reuters last week rival Italian bank Intesa (MI:ISP) had received two non-binding offers for its leasing business, which it is selling together with 1 billion euros in impaired leasing contracts.
Banks that divest leasing operations continue to offer their customers leasing services through a third-party provider.
UniCredit recently struck a partnership with Deutsche Leasing and Deutsche Anlagen Leasing to offer leasing services in Germany.
UniCredit is also set to kick off early next month the sale of WealthCap, a business which offers customers investment opportunities in real estate, the two sources said. 
WealthCap is estimated to have an enterprise value of 150-200 million euros, one source said. 
Mustier, who has cut UniCredit's problem loan ratio below the industry average to 4.8% of total lending, earlier this year ruled out any further large asset sales saying the group's perimeter would now remain broadly stable.

Investors who sell borrowed shares in anticipation of price declines are back in force. Bearish wagers climbed to about 7% of total stocks available for lending this month, up from 2020’s low of a little above 6% reached in August, data compiled by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. show. That’s poised for the biggest increase since March.
The spike of short sales coincided with an equity rout that, at Monday’s worst point, took the S&P 500 to within points of entering a 10% correction. While contrarians may view the rise of skepticism as something healthy in a market that until now had defied any bad news -- from plunging corporate profits to a lack of fiscal stimulus -- JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou warned it may mark the start of an ominous trend for equities.
“The recent rise in the short base at individual stock levels is a worrying development, especially for U.S. stocks where the short base still stands at rather low levels,” Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients.
Selling abated Tuesday as the S&P 500 rose 0.2% as of 10 a.m. in New York, halting a four-day decline.
PagerDuty (NYSE:PD) Inc., nCino Inc. and  Flowserve Corp  (NYSE:FLS). are among Russell 1000 stocks whose short interest has surged this month as a percentage of their total shares available for trading, according to IHS Markit data compiled by Bloomberg.
To see how dangerous a continuing buildup can be, consider how fast bears took control earlier this year. According to JPMorgan’s data, the short interest ratio among individual stocks started the year at around 8% and then jumped above 9% as equities sank into their fastest bear market ever in March.
To be sure, all the shorted shares ended up helping contribute to the subsequent recovery through a process known as a short squeeze, when rising prices compel investors who made bearish bets to reverse their positions. But there’s no denying that the most-hated stocks fared worse during the March turmoil, with short selling compounding the market’s pain.
For now, short bets are growing from a relatively subdued base. Even with the latest increase, the current ratio still trails levels prior to the March meltdown. But that also means there’s a lot of room for short sales to expand should sentiment keep souring.
There is no shortage of reasons for pessimism. Stock valuations have reached the highest level since the dot-com era. Another round of fiscal stimulus is now seen unlikely by the end of 2020. And the U.S. presidential race is looming in November amid concerns that final results could be delayed for weeks.
“The market is going to be very fragile going into the election,” said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners. “If you want to bring your portfolio beta down without selling and going to cash, it makes some sense” to short some stocks, especially for short/long hedge funds, he added.
Skeptics had been mostly driven into extinction after the S&P 500 staged a 60% rally over five months. In August, the median S&P 500 stock had outstanding short interest equating to just 1.8% of market capitalization, the lowest level since at least 2004, data from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). showed.
Now that the rally has shown signs of faltering, short sellers are quick to ramp up wagers. To Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp., that bodes well for the market because every bear today is tomorrow’s potential buyer.
“The tricky part about that is, when that trade starts, it tends to build up a pent-up demand for equities,” Hogan said. “The larger the short position, the more likely there will be a floor of demand.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened moderately higher on Tuesday, in a cautious recovery from Monday's sell-off, which saw the Dow Jones index fall over 4% at one point. 
Trading was relatively subdued ahead of two days of testimony in Congress by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Powell had already repeated in prepublished prepared remarks his admonition to Congress to provide more stimulus to the economy. However, that seems less likely against a backdrop of a culture war between the two main parties over the need to fill the deceased Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat on the Supreme Court.
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7 points, or less than 0.1%, at 27,155. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%.  
The Nasdaq had outperformed on Monday as investors sought out tech stocks as their best defense against a renewed fall in economic activity driven by Covid-19 lockdowns. However, it lost its early momentum in premarket as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock sold off 4.8% in response to comments overnight by CEO Elon Musk.
Musk had warned via Twitter that whatever the company unveils at its 'Battery Day' event on Tuesday wouldn't enter into mass production until 2022 at the earliest, and so doesn't solve the company's looming supply crunch with regard to battery cells.
Leading the losers was imaging company Nano X Imaging (NASDAQ:NNOX) stock, which fell 16.4% after short-selling firm Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) Research published a report into the company that concluded that it ""has no real product to sell other than its stock.""  It's not the first short report published against Nano-X, which has now lost nearly two-thirds of its value in the last 11 days. 
Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock also fell another 7.7% while Illumina stock (NASDAQ:ILMN) fell another 1.1% on concerns about the cost of its buyout of Grail, which was announced on Monday.
However, other stocks that have profited from the dislocation of activity due to the pandemic continued to thrive on speculation of more and longer lockdowns as winter approaches in the northern hemisphere. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock rose another 1.7% to a new all-time high, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 2.5%.
There was a modest degree of support from a Richmond Fed survey that showed a modest improvement in both manufacturing and services activity in September, while existing home sales also stayed strong, rising to an 11-year high of 6.00 million in August."

Muddy Waters likened the company to  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA), whose founder Trevor Milton stepped down on Monday amid scathing reports from short-sellers.
""We conclude that NNOX (Nano-X) has no real product to sell other than its stock,"" Muddy Waters said in a report on Tuesday.
Nano-X Imaging did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Shares in Nano-X Imaging, which had been on an upward run since their market debut in August, took a hit last week after Citron said the stock was headed towards $0 and called the company a ""stock promotion"".

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) plans to shutter one in five branches in Germany as it seeks to save costs and capitalise on the changing habits of customers during the coronavirus pandemic, an executive said.
Philipp Gossow, who oversees the retail banking business in Germany, told Reuters that the reduction to some 400 branches from around 500 currently would occur primarily in urban locations and take place ""as quickly as possible"".
The cull comes as Deutsche Bank undergoes a broad overhaul of its global operations that began in 2019 after years of losses.
German banks traditionally operate large numbers of branches compared with those in the Netherlands or Britain, where customers are more comfortable with digital banking. Banks throughout Europe are rethinking their branch strategies in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.
(Graphic: Shrinking footprint: The decline in bank branches in Europe - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/bdwpkzezjvm/chart.png)
Deutsche's rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) recently opted to shut 200 of its 1,000 branches and is considering closing hundreds more.
""Coronavirus has further changed the demands placed on advisory services and the branch business,"" Gossow said. 
""Even customers who were previously not very familiar with online banking are now doing many simple banking transactions from home on their computer or iPad,"" he said.
Gossow said more complex advisory services were taking place increasingly by phone or video chat and the bank would invest an undisclosed amount to build out those services.
He elaborated on the changes on Tuesday at a conference in Frankfurt and in a memo to staff, in which he acknowledged the changes would mean hardship for some.
But the move is not expected to meet strong resistance from employees. The Verdi labour union said in a statement it was ""generally right"" for Deutsche to review its branch network.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS (S:UBSG) Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti joined other banking executives on Tuesday in declaring consolidation of the European sector ""inevitable"", declining comment on whether Switzerland's biggest bank plans to participate.
""Of course, I will abstain to talk about UBS,"" Ermotti said at the virtual Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) Annual Financials CEO Conference.
""But...you heard me say, particularly in the last year or two years, I felt the debate in Europe was too focused on 'too big to fail', and rather should have been 'too small to survive, to small to compete.' Now, I think, already since late (2019), and since COVID, things are crystal clear. As I mentioned a few quarters ago, the train left the station in that sense, and consolidation is inevitable.""
Ermotti, due to be replaced by former ING head Ralph Hamers in November, said regulators had been vocal in the last few months about their openness to consolidation that made sense, adding they were right to oppose deals that did not add value.
Reports that UBS has examined a potential tie-up with rival  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) have put it in the spotlight of late.
At the same conference on Tuesday, the head of Credit Suisse said he also expected to see more deals.
Ermotti said that while consolidation would be good for the market, deals needed to be sensible.

""Scale per se means nothing. You need to have focused scale, complementary scale, where you create added value,"" he said.

The consensus forecasts for the value of the business, which makes gas and wind turbines, is 21 billion to 22 billion euros, said the source. Based on the number of Siemens Energy shares, that would result in a share price of 28.90-30.28 euros apiece.
Siemens declined to comment.
The success of the spin-off can only be estimated after two or three months, with high price volatility expected after the company makes its stock market debut on Sept. 28, the person said.
Siemens Energy, which employs 91,000 people, makes products including combined cycle turbines, generators, transformers and compressors, and will also be involved in wind energy via its 67% stake in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (OTC:GCTAY).
Siemens is selling off the business, which has been hit by a collapse in demand and changing energy policies, to focus on smart buildings, mobility and factory automation. 
It is giving 55% of the shares in the unit to its shareholders at a ratio of one share for every share two Siemens share. Siemens' pension fund will get 9.9%, while Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) will keep a direct stake of 35.1%.
Siemens will reduce its stake over the next 12 to 18 months after the listing, but is in no hurry to exit completely. The pension fund is also likely to offload its stake.
Siemens, whose products range from trains to industrial software, will keep a stake of around 25% in Siemens Energy, the person said, to allow a smooth transition and prevent interference from a third party.
Via a blocking minority, which usually refers to 25% plus one share, shareholders can prevent key corporate decisions at general meetings. Such a stake could be kept for a minimum of five years, the source said.

Denmark's biggest lender is under investigation in several countries including the United States over 200 billion euros ($235 billion) in payments made via its small branch in Estonia between 2007 and 2015, many of which the bank has said were suspicious.
Danish law firm Klar Advokater said it had filed a final round of complaints against the bank on behalf of 55 pension funds and other investors. U.S. law firms Grant & Eisenhofer and DRRT were behind the action.
With the latest filing in the Copenhagen City Court, 331 investors claim 7.1 billion Danish crowns ($1.12 billion) for losses resulting from the alleged money laundering, the firm said.
""For years, Danske said nothing publicly about the issue and even misrepresented the extent of its participation in the massive money laundering scheme,"" DRRT said in a separate statement issued late Monday.
The bank is facing a number of other lawsuits from investors, including one filed by consultancy firm Deminor.
Danske Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those accusations, but has previously said it would defend itself against investor lawsuits.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Dividend futures suggest a decade of doldrums. Many disagree,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - It will take a decade for dividend payouts to return to pre-pandemic levels, futures markets are suggesting, a gloomy view that is at odds with the recent equity rebound and investors' confidence that payments will normalise far sooner.
The pandemic could see dividends fall by over $100 billion this year just in the United States and Europe, analysts tracked by Refinitiv I/B/E/S predict. The global drop may be as big as $400 billion, according to a Janus Henderson report.
But futures are pricing worse.
These derivatives, which allow punters to take a position on future payouts, imply S&P500 dividends will be 16% below April 2020 levels in 2029. For Europe's STOXX600 (STOXX), futures price 2028 payouts 18% below 2019 levels.
(Graphic: No full recovery from COVID blow in divis for years? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/nmovawjojva/Pasted%20image%201600454919081.png)
""Investors overall are still a bit cautious on dividends because people question whether or not we've got to the point of self-sustaining recovery or are we still simply subject to central bank stimulus etc,"" said Matthew Joyce, director of equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Central bank stimulus has floored bond yields and fuelled an equity bounce. Yet the longer-term economic and corporate outlook remains uncertain.
Joyce reckons dividends may recover by 2022-2023, noting that futures pricing is at a heavy discount to a closely watched dividend index produced by IHS Markit.
This forecasts European dividends 13% below pre-COVID levels in 2022, versus the 30% drop futures are pricing. It projects S&P 500 (SPX) payouts will return to 2019 levels next year.
So why the disconnect? And which is right?
Dividends did take four years to fully recover from the 2008-9 crisis so a decade may not seem too much of a stretch. But futures can be skewed by hedging as investors insure themselves against longer-term payment shortfalls.
(Graphic: 12M forward dividends for Europe, U.S. - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/yxmvjblygvr/Pasted%20image%201600454345746.png)
""For people who trade dividend futures, it's hard to see beyond the pandemic,"" said Erik Norland, senior economist at the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME). ""It may not be until 2021 that people look into the other side and price in scenarios on what the rest of the decade is going to look like.""
But it may prove challenging to match the 2010-2019 period when payouts rocketed by a record 155%.
That compares with 40% growth in each of the preceding two decades, Norland said, pointing to big budget deficits which governments could address by upping corporate taxes.
What seems clear though is that S&P500 dividends will bounce back well before Europe which is dominated by banks and commodity firms rather than cash-rich technology firms.
Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, predicts next year to be a record for U.S. payouts.
""We have gone through the (dividend) storm,"" he added.

1113,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Dan Fuss Shuns CLOs in His Funds as Fed Can’t Save Everything,"(Bloomberg) -- In the U.S. Navy in the 1950s, Dan Fuss learned a maxim he still finds useful to this day while navigating pandemic markets: “Don’t sail close to the reef unless you have to.”
It’s why the legendary bond investor and former Navy signal officer remains wary of collateralized loan obligations even as prices start to recover. The bonds, which pool loans to many small, private borrowers, are not far from the lingering malaise on Main Street.
In an interview, the 86-year-old vice chairman of Boston-based Loomis Sayles & Co. said he’s keeping his funds as liquid as possible, favoring Treasuries and investment-grade rated corporate bonds.
“Default odds are rising as more small and mid-sized businesses close down,” Fuss said. “I don’t think current prices reflect this. We don’t own any CLOs in accounts that I manage.”
A global credit rally fueled by unprecedented stimulus and zero-rate policies has pushed investors to pursue yields in ever riskier realms. While that’s boosting CLOs and the loans that underpin them, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Price Index is down 3.1% this year while similarly-rated high-yield bonds have erased pandemic losses.
Bonds of course are benefiting from the Federal Reserve’s limitless balance sheet, which it has extended all the way down the ratings spectrum to public junk debt. But small borrowers that rely on syndicated loans are struggling to get cash from banks hunkering down for a wave of defaults, according to a recent Bank for International Settlements study.
“The Fed has made it clear that they don’t want a liquidity problem in the Treasury market or the higher-grade corporate market,” Fuss said. “They cannot, unfortunately, underwrite lending in the private markets.”
Fuss, whose six-decade career in banking and securities has spanned the great financial crisis and hyper-inflation in the 1970s, has been right before in bold bearish and bullish calls.
A year before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, he warned that LBO debt was a bubble waiting to burst. But he also bet big on a comeback for European governments laid low by the sovereign debt crisis, pocketing an estimated 65% on Irish government bonds after buying them at distressed levels in 2010.
The firm’s flagship Loomis Sayles Bond Fund, which he began managing at inception in 1991, has posted an annualized return of 8.42% significantly higher than the 6% gain in the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Government and Credit Index.
Fuss got his start Wauwatosa State Bank in Wisconsin in 1958, when dealings between bankers and corporate clients were very different from today. He says the CLO market has completely upended the borrower-banker relationship. A loan that’s been pledged to a CLO and distributed to institutional investors in the bond market is harder to renegotiate if a borrower runs into trouble.
“The ability for the lender to work with the borrowers when there is a dramatic change in circumstances is gone, because that sold loan is out in the public domain, mingled somewhere,” he said. “I know I sound like one of those conservative old bankers out there. As a matter of fact, I am.”

(Reuters) - Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) Corp said on Tuesday it has hired a new leader for its Boost Mobile prepaid wireless phone brand, which will seek to fashion itself as the next innovator in the U.S. wireless industry.
Stephen Stokols, who previously founded prepaid brand FreedomPop, said in an interview that Boost has the potential to be as ""disruptive"" as U.S. carrier T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc, which developed a reputation for shaking up the industry by setting precedents such as ending the traditional two-year phone contract.
Dish, a satellite television and internet provider, bought Boost Mobile in April as part of the merger between wireless carriers T-Mobile and Sprint, which owned Boost.
While most U.S. wireless customers pay recurring phone bills at the end of the month on postpaid plans, prepaid users pay for phone service upfront. The plans often appeal to lower-income customers as they do not require a credit check.
Boost aims to expand its digital operations to sell more of its phone plans online, Stokols said. Currently, Boost primarily sells plans at its large number of stores across the country.
The wireless industry has increasingly focused on selling phone plans with unlimited talk, text and data, but some wireless customers use small amounts of data on their smartphones.
""If you look at the data for users, most use under five gigabytes a month. There's a huge opportunity to deliver value by offering plan flexibility that addresses that,"" Stokols said, declining to offer specifics.
Rival wireless carriers are also ramping up investment in prepaid at a time when many Americans are cutting monthly expenses during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last week,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) bought Tracfone, the largest prepaid brand in the United States, for $6.25 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange does not need a separate platform to trade low carbon aluminium and should focus instead on services its users need more urgently, such as a euro-denominated steel contract, metal industry sources told Reuters.
As pressure mounts on investors and companies to prove their activity does not harm the environment, the exchange last month outlined plans to support sustainable metal production with a spot trading platform in the first half of 2021 for low carbon aluminium.
Ahead of a Thursday deadline for feedback, industry sources who asked not to be named said the market had the tools needed for consumers willing to pay a premium for sustainable metal.
""LME contracts give you a basic price. If you have additional requirements - location, producer, shape of metal, warehouse company - there will be premiums to pay,"" a consumer source said.
""Buyers can ask for green aluminium and pay extra, you don't need a new platform. (The LME) should be concentrating on things like the euro-priced steel contract.""
The LME said by email it looked forward to considering all market feedback.
Aluminium produced by Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) and Russia's Rusal (HK:0486) is viewed as low carbon as it is smelted with hydropower, rather than fossil fuel.
It is used in construction, transport and packaging.
Last year, the LME launched a suite of cash-settled contracts including hot rolled coil steel https://www.lme.com/en-GB/Metals/Ferrous/HRC-N-America#tabIndex=0 for North America and China.
But plans for a European steel contract https://uk.reuters.com/article/metals-lme-steel/euro-pricing-likely-to-delay-lmes-europe-steel-contract-to-2020-idUSL8N210650 were postponed because Europe prices steel in euros and the exchange's clearing house was designed to only clear dollar-based contracts.
""We still don't have a euro-priced contract which the industry geared up to use,"" a metal broking source said.
""On sustainability, they should let the market decide.""
One industry source said the LME may be worried about the impact of a separate green aluminium contract, which would explain its preference for a physical platform.

""They have to be careful, they don't want to split liquidity. The LME's aluminium contract is one of the most liquid in the metals world.""

PARIS (Reuters) - French utility Veolia (PA:VIE) said on Tuesday it was open to discussions about the price it is offering to acquire Engie's stake in water and waste management group Suez (PA:SEVI).
Veolia last month offered to pay 2.9 billion euros for a 29.9% stake in Suez owned by Engie (PA:ENGIE), with a view to subsequently taking full control of Suez by buying up more shares.
Engie rejected Veolia's initial advance but has said it will consider a higher offer for the Suez stake. Suez Chairman Philippe Varin has called the Veolia bid ""very hostile"" and said Veolia's plans for the business were unrealistic.
Speaking in an interview with Reuters, Veolia Chief Operating Officer Estelle Brachlianoff, who is also deputy CEO, said: ""There is a legitimate debate on the price, clearly, and there will be a discussion to be had.""
But she said in Veolia's view the price was not the main issue determining whether the deal goes ahead. She said besides the price, Engie was looking at the viability of the future entity, and guarantees on jobs.
She said time was a factor because Veolia wanted to make the deal before Suez, as part of an existing plan to revamp its business, divests more of its units.
""Time is pressing if we want to avoid the dismantling of Suez,"" said Brachlianoff.

Earlier on Tuesday, Suez, which is rallying support for resisting the Veolia bid, said it planned to hand back more than 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion) to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks by the middle of next year.

Stocks tumbled across the board on Monday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.8%, the S&P 500 lost 1% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.1%. As a whole, these stocks are having their worst month since March, with the S&P and Nasdaq on a four-day losing streak and the Dow down for three straight days.
In a reversal of last week’s pattern, value-oriented sectors such as energy and industrials led the downturn, underperforming tech stocks.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, appears on Capitol Hill later Tuesday, to address any concerns lawmakers have over the emergency measures the central bank has taken to mitigate the hit to the economy delivered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Meanwhile, the picture surrounding the virus in Europe looks more worrying, with several countries reporting a spike in cases. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce further restrictions to all entertainment venues as well as urging people to once more work from home.
Meanwhile, the rancor surrounding the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the nomination of her replacement is likely to further complicate efforts in Congress to pass another stimulus package before the presidential election.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be in the spotlight on its “Battery Day”, when the electric-car manufacturer is expected to unveil steps to boost battery production.
The saga surrounding TikTok continues, with the Chinese state-backed newspaper Global Times saying a deal for the video sharing app is unlikely to get approval from Beijing. This comes after Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and TikTok's parent ByteDance announced they had reached a deal over the weekend.
Oil prices climbed Tuesday, rebounding after the previous session’s sharp losses, with Tropical Storm Beta proving less disruptive than feared. However, persistent worries about fuel demand as coronavirus cases continue to flare up around the globe remain a drag.
Traders will be watching out for the American Petroleum Institute's data on U.S. oil inventories due later on Tuesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $39.88 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1% to $41.86. Both oil benchmarks fell around 4% on Monday.
Elsewhere, gold futures were flat at $1,910.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at $1.1755.

Insurers are under the gun for not paying out on some claims from businesses interrupted by the pandemic, and firms could be less willing to insure themselves in future, said Anna Sweeney, executive director of the BoE's insurance supervision division.
""I do see a risk of a protection gap,"" Sweeney said.

""The high profile of disputes over business interruption claims has done nothing to dent the popular caricature of an industry that is happier to accept premiums than to pay claims. This matters: it could have an impact on demand for policies.""

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank preparing for wave of industry deals,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is working hard to prepare for a wave of mergers in the banking sector, its finance chief said on Tuesday, signalling a potential change in tone at Germany's biggest bank which has been focusing mainly on its turnaround. 
Policymakers have long said Europe's ailing banking sector needs to consolidate, but regulatory and political obstacles have hindered big deals over the past decade. 
This year, however, has seen major domestic bank tie-ups in Italy and Spain, with bankers saying regulators are now more willing to wave deals through. 
Deutsche's chief financial officer James von Moltke said the bank supported the ""appropriate or valid industrial logic"" of mergers among the region's larger banks.
""For Deutsche Bank, we've been very focused on executing on our own strategy, and we think that strategy would prepare us to engage in merger activity when the time comes and the right opportunities arise,"" von Moltke said at a financial conference. 
""So we are expecting this wave but we are also working hard to prepare on our side,"" he said.
The statements come amid growing speculation about a potential deal in Switzerland. 
The board of UBS (S:UBSG), which held brief tie-up talks with Deutsche last year, gathered last week to discuss strategy. Staff at the lender recently examined a potential merger with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), whose executives also expect consolidation.
It was only last year that Deutsche called off merger talks with domestic rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). Von Moltke said domestic mergers ""frankly present some challenges"".
Raimund Roeseler, who oversees banking supervision at Germany's financial regulator BaFin, said mergers could be helpful, but were not always the solution.

""Do we really believe that the problems of the German banking market would be solved if we only had 700 or 500 banks instead of 1,400? I don't think so,"" he said at a separate banking conference.

1121,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Latest U.S. Stock Slide Has a Silver Lining for Some Strategists,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. stock market session Monday would have been a lot worse without a final-hour rally that left the Nasdaq-100 index up for the day and kept the S&P 500 from dropping into a correction.
Both gauges had been down around 1.5% a little before 3 p.m. on Monday in New York, before making up ground. Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP said the way the session ended indicates investor exuberance is less pronounced than it once was. Sundial Capital Research Inc. said the intraday turnaround was a good sign.
Susquehanna’s Chris Murphy had been watching to see if both indexes ended above their July 31 closing levels of 10,906 and 3,271, respectively, which they managed to achieve. “While that alone isn’t an indication the markets will rally, this could be an indication that much of the froth from August has been removed from the market,” he wrote in a note.
The Nasdaq-100 closed with a gain of at least 0.25% after recovering from a dip of more than 2% to a one-month low -- while holding above its 200-day moving average -- seven other times in the past three decades, according to Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital. That led to further upside over the next week after six of the seven signals, he wrote in a note, adding the weight of evidence suggests “higher prices long term.”
Both indexes have fallen from their Sept. 2 record highs, with the Nasdaq-100 entering a correction after sliding 12%. They are still sitting on substantial gains from mid-March lows.
The question confronting investors is whether further weakness lies ahead due to risks such as rising coronavirus cases, U.S. election uncertainty and diminishing chances of further fiscal stimulus amid a seasonally weak period for stocks. Futures on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 as of 10:10 a.m. in London pointed to a stable open on Wall Steet on Tuesday.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","Beijing unlikely to approve Oracle, Walmart's TikTok deal: Global Times","By Josh Horwitz and Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is unlikely to approve an ""unfair"" deal  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said they have struck with ByteDance over the future of video-streaming app TikTok, the state-backed Global Times newspaper said in an editorial.
The U.S. majors have said they would buy into a new mainly U.S.-owned company, TikTok Global, with a board of directors comprised mainly of Americans, as the parties work to pacify the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which had planned to ban TikTok in the United States on security grounds.
In contrast, ByteDance has said TikTok Global would be its U.S. subsidiary with 80% ownership.
""It is clear that these articles (terms) extensively show Washington's bullying style and hooligan logic. They hurt China's national security, interests and dignity,"" the newspaper said in an editorial in its English edition published late on Monday. It was also carried in its Chinese edition.
""From the information provided by the U.S., the deal was unfair. It caters to the unreasonable demands of Washington. It's hard for us to believe that Beijing will approve such an agreement,"" it said, echoing comments on Twitter the same evening from its editor-in-chief, Hu Xijin.
Hu on Tuesday, responding to comments Trump made to Fox News about how TikTok Global was going to be ""totally controlled"" by Oracle, said on Twitter: ""Stop extorting. You think TikTok is a company from a small country?""
""There's no way the Chinese government will accept your demand. You can ruin TikTok's U.S. business, if U.S. users do not object, but you can't rob it and turn it into a U.S. baby.""
The Global Times is a tabloid published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, but does not speak on behalf of the party and government unlike its parent publication.
China's government has largely refrained from directly commenting on the deal's details, though the foreign ministry has said the United States should offer a fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign companies.
Reuters reported this month, citing sources, that Beijing opposed a forced sale of TikTok's U.S. operations by ByteDance, and would prefer to see the short video app shut down in the United States.
The deal requires approval from regulators in both Beijing and Washington, ByteDance has said. China's Ministry of Commerce in late August revised a tech export control list that experts said would give it regulatory oversight over any TikTok deal.
ByteDance and the commerce ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
MAIN OBJECTIONS
Over the weekend, ByteDance, Oracle and Walmart said they had reached a deal that would satisfy Trump's call for TikTok to be sold to an American firm or be shut down in the United States.
However, the sides have framed the deal differently in public statements.
Whereas ByteDance said it will majority-own TikTok Global, Oracle and Walmart together said ByteDance's ownership would be distributed to its investors - many of which are U.S.-based - and that ByteDance itself would have no direct stake. They also said four of TikTok Global's five-member board would be American.
The unidentified author of the Global Times editorial objected to there being only one board seat reserved for a Chinese national, as well as the stipulated inclusion on the board of a U.S-approved ""national security director"".
It also denounced the need for ByteDance to reveal source code to Oracle as part of the latter's role of ""trusted technology partner"" and criticised the likelihood of TikTok Global blocking Chinese access to its app. 
TikTok has never been available in China. It has said it has more than 100 million monthly active U.S. users, compared with 600 million daily users at mainland equivalent Douyin.
""As TikTok and Douyin should have the same source code, this means the U.S. can get to know the operations of Douyin,"" the Global Times said.
""If the reorganization of TikTok under U.S. manipulation becomes a model, it means once any successful Chinese company expands its business to the U.S. and becomes competitive, it will be targeted by the U.S. and turned into a U.S.-controlled company via trickery and coercion, which eventually serves only U.S. interests.""
Beijing-based ByteDance has only two Chinese nationals on its five-member board, with the other three being foreigners running U.S.-based companies.

ByteDance has also said Oracle's ability to inspect TikTok's source code before investing is akin to previous instances of U.S. companies such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) sharing source code with Chinese technology experts.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",Tesla warns on challenges of scaling up production,"By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tesla (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk warned on Tuesday about the difficulties of speeding up production as an expert cautioned the carmaker's increased reliance on large-scale aluminium parts could bring new manufacturing challenges.
While carmakers such as Mercedes-Benz have said automation has limitations, Musk has pressed on with plans to create a hyper-automated factory, which he refers to as the ""alien dreadnought"", or ""the machine that builds the machine"".
""The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It's 1,000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself,"" Musk said on Twitter.
Musk's warning comes ahead of a ""battery day"" later on Tuesday, when Tesla is expected to unveil steps to boost battery production.
For its new Model Y, Tesla plans to replace 70 components glued and riveted into the car's rear underbody with a single module made using the world's biggest aluminium casting machine in its new factory in Brandenburg, near Berlin.
Car bodies have traditionally been made by assembling multiple stamped metal panels, a technique which has helped create crumple zones to absorb energy during a crash, but Musk is charting a new course at the Brandenburg plant.
While casting could reduce the number of assembly steps, larger aluminium parts are more prone to deformation, according to Professor Martin Fehlbier at Kassel University in Germany.
""On paper it looks easy,"" said Fehlbier, a former head of foundry technology at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group, which pioneered aluminium construction techniques at its Audi brand. ""The small details can cause you to burn through a lot of cash.""
The larger the part, the more attention needs to be paid to heating the form, since molten aluminium needs to fill out the cast, Fehlbier said, adding the thinner the part being made, the more likely the metal will cool before filling out the form.
By contrast, the hotter the form, the longer the component has to cool before the next manufacturing step, which can limit the overall speed of production, Fehlbier said.
Cooling aluminium too quickly can lead a component to deform, and changing the consistency of the metal has huge implications for the cost of each component as well as on potential crash test behaviour, he added. 
""The Audi A8 has started to use more steel parts because a new side crash test in the United States cannot be passed using just aluminium,"" Fehlbier said. 

It's not the first time Tesla has faced challenges with new production techniques. The electric carmaker was forced to fly in a new production line from Germany to Nevada in 2018 to fix a manufacturing line after robots failed to coordinate seamlessly.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>","As cash flees Macau junkets, gambling hub faces long odds of quick recovery","By Farah Master
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Fears China is broadening a crackdown on offshore gambling has sparked a rush to withdraw billions of dollars from the world’s biggest gambling hub Macau, threatening a recovery in the coronavirus-stricken economy, executives say.
An unprecedented stampede to withdraw money from junkets – companies which lure high rollers to gamble – started in July after Beijing identified the cross-border flow of funds for gambling as a national security risk.
Worryingly, the customer withdrawals have spilled into the broader casino industry, leading to a cash crunch in Macau's VIP sector at a time the Chinese territory is struggling to recover from COVID-19 restrictions which has sent tourist numbers and gambling revenues plummeting. 
“This is not millions we are talking about being taken out here, but billions,” said a casino executive who was not authorised to speak to the media.
“We have cash in the bank but with everyone withdrawing, it's a problem.”
Several other executives also told Reuters that cash was being taken out in the billions of Hong Kong dollars.
While Macau casinos have ample reserves to ride out several months of zero revenues, the rising cash withdrawals point to a major loss of confidence in the crucial VIP junket sector in a further blow to the economy, analysts said.
The sector accounts for around 50% of overall gambling revenues, which hit $36.5 billion last year. The pandemic has already ravaged the economy with gambling revenues down around 96% in the second quarter year-on-year.
The withdrawals began when hundreds of customers tried to pull deposits from top junket Suncity, at its VIP clubs across Macau, over fears it was being targeted by Chinese authorities. Suncity denied the allegations. 
The group then began restricting withdrawals, sparking a panic rush by customers seeking to pull their money from all junkets, executives said.
Suncity said it was acting in compliance with new casino policies, but declined to elaborate. 
Junkets in the former Portuguese colony are licensed to provide customers with chip deposits and withdrawal services on behalf of casinos Sands China (HK:1928),  Wynn Macau  (HK:1128),  MGM China  (HK:2282), Galaxy Entertainment (HK:0027), SJM Holdings (HK:0880) and Melco Resorts (O:MLCO). All casinos declined Reuters requests to comment.
As customers started pulling out money amid fears of a broader crackdown by Beijing, junket agents in turn have begun taking back deposits from the casinos. 
CHIPPING AWAY
Casinos have reacted by putting limits on the amount of cash chips that can be withdrawn, executives said. 
“The crackdown on the cross border transactions have finally rammed home the inconvenient fact that Macau has always been dependent on outflow of funds from the mainland,"" said Ben Lee, founder of Macau gaming consultancy IGamiX. 
Gambling is illegal on the mainland, but is allowed in casinos in Macau.
In some casinos, customers can now only withdraw HK$1 million ($129,039) compared with HK$5 million in recent months and only the account holder can withdraw, say executives.
Any transaction over HK$200,000 is now flagged, leading to people carrying around HK$5 million in chips in multiple sets of $10,000 to avoid detection.
With thousands cashing out chips, some cash machines and exchange desks around Macau have briefly showed limited or no availability in recent weeks.
Macau’s monetary authority told Reuters the supply of Hong Kong dollars is “currently” stable and that it has taken measures to ensure the adequate supply of currency.
The withdrawals come as China fully resumes Macau tourist visas from Sept. 23, and executives warn that more arrivals could mean more cash being pulled out.
Some Suncity customers, angry at not being able to get their funds, have started an online group called Suncity victims’ and are planning a protest on Sept. 23 at VIP rooms across Macau.

Construction work at the California airport will begin in late 2021, pending necessary environmental permits, with the first phase expected to deliver 19 new gates at the start of 2025, Turner and Flatiron said in a joint statement late on Monday.
The second and final phase of expansion works will conclude in early 2027, adding 11 more gates and bringing the airport's total to 62.
The coronavirus pandemic has choked travel worldwide, forcing most airlines and airport operators to pause growth plans, and pushing some to downsize as passenger traffic languishes at less than half pre-pandemic levels.
Flatiron and Turner are both subsidiaries of engineering and infrastructure group Hochtief (DE:HOTG), itself majority-owned by Spain's ACS, a global constructor and airport operator.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's stock markets clawed back some ground on Tuesday, a day after rising second waves of the coronavirus epidemic caused the region's biggest wipeout since June and drover investors back to government bonds.
Conditions were still choppy. South Korea and China's bourses had pulled Asia down for a second day after the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell out of its recent stellar range, so it was a relief for traders to see Europe stabilise.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index made back 0.5% of the 3.2% it lost on Monday, helped by respective 1.5% and 0.6% gains for the tech and healthcare sectors. 
Travel and leisure stocks saw 0.3% falls to add to Monday's 5.2% plunge, however, and as investors stayed close to safety, yields on Germany's government bonds held near six-week lows and the dollar rose. 
""The market may be taking a breather but I would be surprised if that was it,"" said Rabobank's Head of Macro Strategy Elwin de Groot, referring to Monday's rout that came as countries had been forced to reintroduce some of the COVID-19 restrictions they removed over the summer.
""The market won't like it. The base case was that the second wave wouldn't be as bad as the first... but the fourth quarter will be now another quarter with stringent restrictions and there are going to be an increasing number of economic victims,"" he said.
Concerns surfaced in the currency market, with both the euro and Britain's pound down around 0.3% against the dollar.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will encourage Britons on Tuesday to go back to working from home, along with new curbs on pubs, bars and restaurants. 
This came as France saw its seven-day daily rolling case count rise above 10,000 for the first time over the weekend, Italy introduced more mandatory testing and Germany describe the situation as ""worrying"".
Beyond the impact of the virus, Hong Kong shares of HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) weakened a further 2%, after leaked reports showed they were among global lenders that have transferred more than $2 trillion in suspect funds over nearly two decades.
""Markets globally have run hard on the weight of huge liquidity, so it's not surprising to see a pullback in some valuations,"" said James Rosenberg, an EL&C Baillieu advisor in Sydney.
""Add in uncertainty with U.S. elections and another COVID wave in Europe ... it unsettles investors.""
BACK TO THE FUTURES
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 had dropped 0.7%, pressured by miners and energy stocks and the Aussie dollar fell to a one-month low while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index had closed down nearly 1%. 
Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday but early trading indicated a subdued day in store for Wall Street, with S&P 500 futures down 0.18% and Nasdaq 100 futures flat%.
U.S. stocks have tumbled over the past three weeks as investors dumped heavyweight technology-related shares following a stunning rally that lifted the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to new highs.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) had fallen 3.1% and 4.0% respectively on Monday too.
Concerns are also growing about a delay in U.S. stimulus measures after Congress has remained deadlocked for weeks over the size and shape of another coronavirus-response bill, on top of the roughly $3 trillion already enacted into law.
The death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared to make the passage of another package less likely before the Nov. 3 presidential election, sparking large declines in the healthcare sector. 

Gold fell against the rising dollar, and traded at $1,908.76 per ounce, while in oil markets, Brent gained 0.4% to $41.65 and U.S. crude rose 0.5% to $39.5 per barrel.

1129,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>","TikTok's promise of 25,000 new U.S. jobs sets lofty goal","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Even as dealmakers bicker over who will actually own TikTok Global, another question emerged after President Donald Trump agreed over the weekend to keep the wildly popular video-sharing app running in the United States for another week: how can they possibly create 25,000 new jobs in the United States? 
That vow, repeated by the president on Saturday at a campaign rally in North Carolina, was part of a concession that dealmakers offered to convince Trump to green-light a transaction in which a new board comprised of U.S. citizens would oversee a new U.S.-based company and co-owned by  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT).
But the lofty hiring target will be tough to justify, experts said. Such a high number suggests an expectation for massive revenue growth at a time when TikTok faces unprecedented global challenges.
If TikTok operated at anywhere near the efficiency of other internet companies such as Twitter (N:TWTR), TikTok would need to generate up to 19 times more revenue over the next few years.
TikTok is expected to generate about a billion dollars in revenue by the end of 2020, Reuters previously reported. 
Many of the new American jobs will likely be in engineering, content moderation and security roles, given the U.S. government's intense focus on the app's data privacy policies, said Dan Ives, a technology analyst at Wedbush Securities.
""From a security and infrastructure perspective, they're going to have to hire a few thousand alone to focus on that issue...given the sensitivity,"" he said.
TikTok recently announced a $1 billion creator fund that will pay popular TikTok influencers for making videos. Counting those content creators would help TikTok reach 25,000 jobs, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad agency GroupM.
Beyond that, it gets harder to justify a bigger staff. Because ByteDance will still own the algorithm that runs TikTok and license it to the new U.S.-based company, the new company will not need to hire large teams that work on artificial intelligence. 
Those types of jobs account for a large chunk of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Twitter's headcount, said Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical futurist at the Center for Innovating the Future, a technology and geopolitics consulting firm, raising questions about what job roles TikTok could hire for.
Oracle and Walmart could also create divisions within their companies to serve TikTok that could contribute to the job count, he added. 
A source familiar with the deal discussions said the 25,000-job figure was based on similarly sized organizations that serve as many users as TikTok, without offering details. The source added that the job figure was actually conservative in an effort to under-promise and over-deliver.
Another tech company, Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, promised in 2017 to bring 13,000 new jobs to Wisconsin. The deal to create a new factory in the United States was praised by Trump as the ""eighth wonder of the world"" and as proof of his ability to bring jobs back to America. 
A filing with the Wisconsin state economic development division showed Foxconn employed about 600 people in 2019 in the region, according to a CNBC report. 
PEER REVIEW
The ambition of TikTok's hiring goals can better be understood by comparing it against the revenue that workers make for other internet companies.
On average, Twitter's 4,800 workers each generated close to $720,000 or total annual revenue of $3.5 billion in 2019.  Snap Inc 's (N:SNAP) 3,195 workers each generated about $537,000, for a 2019 annual sum of $1.7 billion.
ByteDance currently employs more than 1,000 workers in the United States, mostly in California with some in other locations such as Texas, Reuters previously reported. 
At similar efficiency levels, TikTok's new total of 26,000 U.S. workers would be expected to make between $14 billion to $19 billion annually. 
Even at the low end, such revenue targets will be difficult for TikTok, Prakash said.
""We're in a different phase of TikTok...that comes with a lot of baggage,"" he said, adding TikTok is still banned in India, which was previously its largest market. ""It's going to take them that much longer and be that much harder to reach 14x (revenue).""

1130,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 04:58AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Whitbread Snaps as the U.K. Signals an End to Reopening,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The specter of lockdowns is haunting Europe's stock markets again on Tuesday, after the U.K. effectively abandoned its campaign to get people back into offices in an effort to contain a rapidly-swelling second wave of the Covid-19 virus. 
U.K. media reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will urge people to work from home wherever possible, on top of a new 10 PM curfew for pubs and restaurants. While the new measures fall short of what was feared, the unmistakable direction of travel is toward an extension of the extreme social distancing imposed back in the spring.
No surprise then, that the stocks being hardest hit are those travel and leisure-related names that had started to show signs of life in the last few weeks: Ryanair (LON:RYA), International Airlines Group  (LON:ICAG) and Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) stock all fell by between 4% and 5%, while aerospace suppliers  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT), Senior (LON:SNR) and Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) Holdings PLC (LON:RR) also all tumbled, the last of them hitting yet another new low for the year.
By contrast, tech is back as the defensive play: payments company  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) surged nearly 6% to a new record high, while SAP (NYSE:SAP) rose 2.2% and games publisher Rovio (HE:ROVIO) rose 2.2%, buoyed by the hefty $7.5 billion dished out by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, the author of Doom and other successful video game franchises.
But if you want a peek into the course of the next six months, then take a look at  Whitbread , a U.K.-based operator of hotels and restaurants. It announced on Tuesday it will cut up to 18% of its workforce, some 6,000 jobs.  While optimists will point out that the government's shift of focus will only redirect economic activity rather than kill it, those job cuts - which look like a pre-emptive measure to avoid being saddled with the full cost of paying the workforce when the government's furlough scheme runs out, are part of an ever-clearer trend toward higher joblessness, lower tax revenue and higher government deficits.
""It has been clear from the beginning of this crisis that even as restrictions are eased and hospitality businesses such as ours reopen their doors, that demand would be materially lower than FY20 levels for a period of time,"" the company said in a stock exchange statement, which also showed a 75% drop in revenue over the six months through August.  
Given that the thinking behind that decision took place against an improving backdrop, the fact that the announcement coincides with the government reversing course on reopening the economy has basically killed any hopes that the job cuts could represent some kind of turning point. Whitbread (LON:WTB) shares fell 3.5% and have now lost over half their value this year.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 04:51AM ET</span>",Unwanted delivery: Rappi spawns black market in worker accounts,"By Oliver Griffin
BOGOTA (Reuters) - As Rappi has grown in Latin America, particularly in its home country of Colombia, so too has a shadow market for the all-purpose delivery firm's worker profiles. 
Rappi, a play on ""rapido"" the Spanish word for fast, has gained some 150,000 active contractors known as ""Rappitenderos"" and $1 billion in backing from Japan's SoftBank (T:9434) since it was founded by three entrepreneurs in 2015.
But in a country where urban unemployment jumped to nearly 25% in July, up from just over 13% in March following coronavirus restrictions, and more than a quarter of the population lives in poverty, work as a Rappitendero is highly sought after.
Against this backdrop a black market where fake profiles are sold for as much as $160 apiece has emerged, including on social media platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Rappi told Reuters it ""strongly condemned"" any black market in its worker accounts. Facebook referred to its terms of use, which state that job posts must not promote illegal activity.
SoftBank (T:9984) declined to comment.
Rappi also said in a statement that it has a dedicated fraud team monitoring illicit activities and is building a tool alongside police to verify worker accounts in real time.
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen Rappitenderos in Colombia, where some 50,000 work, who said there was a roaring black market trade in profiles. Four said they had bought one of these accounts themselves.
""I had to buy an account. I'm the head of my household. I have my son, I have a wife,"" said one, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.
All the Rappitenderos, many of whom are Venezuelan migrants, said the black market was fueled by cancellations of their profiles by Rappi, with people now paying to be able to work.
Under Rappi's terms and conditions, messenger accounts can be blocked for violence against retailers, customers and other Rappitenderos, incorrect conduct when using the app and failing to maintain a high standard of service, among other reasons.
Gabriel Carvallo, a Venezuelan migrant who is a mechanic by trade said that one day he had been working on Rappi deliveries without problems, but when he tried to log on the next day, he found his account had been frozen. ""I received the same message as everyone else 'your account is blocked for (breaking) terms and conditions' - they don't write, or warn you, or send you an email,"" he said.
Rappitenderos in Bogota recently called a one-day strike to protest against such blockages and a points system which determines who can work in areas of high demand.
The Bogota-based company denied that any accounts had been blocked without justification, adding it had canceled 5,600 accounts in Colombia since March, of which 1,060 were due to ""false identity issues"", a spokeswoman confirmed.
It was not immediately clear who would investigate the trade in Colombia, where a spokesperson for Bogota police said fake accounts were a matter for regulators. 
The Superintendency of Industry and Commerce, which last year found Rappi failed to comply with orders to improve responses to complaints, advised contacting the police.
Sales of Rappi accounts are not confined to Colombia. In Mexico, three people close to the matter told Reuters the practice was common. Accounts for sale for rivals Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and iFood also appeared on social media in Colombia and Brazil.
Brazil-based iFood said in an email response to Reuters that passing accounts to third parties violated its terms and conditions. Uber Eats said in a statement it is constantly strengthening its systems to avoid account sharing or renting. 
YOURS FOR $160
While signing up officially to Rappi is free, Rappitenderos told Reuters that secondary accounts are typically offered by opaque contacts on Facebook groups, WhatsApp accounts and even by people in the street for $65 to $160 each.
Sometimes people who are not working as Rappitenderos are paid to set up profiles before passing them on, two of the workers said.
One person purporting to sell Rappi profiles, contacted by Reuters via WhatsApp, boasted in an automated reply of selling more than 300 profiles over three years. 
A person responding to messages to a second WhatsApp account said their clients had no problem working via the Rappi application once an account had been purchased.
Reuters could not verify if the accounts were connected or how many accounts they had sold. 
As well as offers to sell Rappi accounts, dozens of Facebook posts across multiple group pages advertise services for users, such as changing registered modes of transport from bikes to motorcycles or cars.
One woman who said she had worked for a year selling upgrades and other services to those with black-market accounts, described the secrecy involved.

""You're never close to, or know the person, who makes changes in-app,"" she said. ""I don't know how that's handled. No one knows if it's someone in the office, or someone hacking. Many of us aren't interested in who does it - that's irrelevant.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (CO:INTC) has received licences from U.S. authorities to continue supplying certain products to Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], an Intel spokesman said on Tuesday.
With U.S.-China ties at their worst in decades, Washington has been pushing governments around to world to squeeze out Huawei, arguing that the telecoms giant would hand data to the Chinese government for espionage.
From September 15, new curbs have barred U.S. companies from supplying or servicing Huawei.
This week the state-backed China Securities Journal said Intel had received permission to supply Huawei.
Last week China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (HK:0981) confirmed it had also sought permission to continue servicing Huawei. SMIC uses U.S.-origin equipment to make chips for Huawei and other companies. 
South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix (KS:000660) also applied for U.S. licence for Huawei sales, but it has not gained approval, a person familiar with the matter said. 
The person, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media, said non-U.S. firms may not have a high chance of getting U.S. approval, and chipmakers are drafting contingency plans to increase supplies to other customers. 
SK Hynix declined to comment. 
In August, Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek Inc (TW:2454) disclosed it had applied to the U.S. government for permission to continue supplying China's Huawei.
Huawei, founded in 1987 by a former engineer in China's People's Liberation Army, denies it spies for Beijing and says the United States is trying to smear it because Western firms are falling behind in 5G technology.

In what some observers have compared to the Cold War arms race, the United States worries that 5G dominance would give China an advantage Washington is not ready to accept.

Investing.com - European stock markets rebounded Tuesday after the previous session’s sharp losses. However, the overall tone remains weak amid concerns that the region’s recovery will be derailed by fresh lockdowns.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.6%. These three benchmark cash indexes all dropped over 3% on Monday, their biggest one-day losses in over three months.
A fresh Covid-19 outbreak in Europe is increasing fears of more new lockdowns on the continent. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to tell the public later Tuesday to work from home and will impose new curbs on pubs, bars and restaurants in a bid to tackle the swelling second wave of the coronavirus outbreak.
A number of European countries, including France, Spain and Greece, have already implemented new restrictive measures. 
In corporate news, Airbus (PA:AIR) stock fell 1.4% after CEO Guillaume Faury said that he couldn’t guarantee that the European planemaker wouldn’t have to resort to compulsory redundancies to cut costs. Airbus has said it needs to shed 15,000 posts worldwide.
 Whitbread  (LON:WTB), which owns the Premier Inn hotel and Beefeater restaurant chains, fell 2.4% after warning that 6,000 staff could lose their jobs given fewer guests since the coronavirus lockdown.
On the flip side, drinks producer A.G.Barr (LON:BAG) rose 7.4% after reporting a profit for the difficult first half of the year, admittedly sharply lower than the previous year, adding that dividend payments are expected to be resumed next year.
Later on, investors are likely to concentrate on U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as he makes the first of three appearances on Capitol Hill this week to discuss the central bank’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Powell is set to reiterate the Federal Reserve remains committed to maintaining loose monetary policy measures as the outlook remains uncertain.
Oil prices drifted Tuesday, with Tropical Storm Beta proving less disruptive to the infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico than feared. However, persistent worries about fuel demand as coronavirus cases continue to flare up around the globe remain a drag.
Traders will be watching out for the American Petroleum Institute's data on U.S. oil inventories due later on Tuesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $39.62 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.2% to $41.52. Both oil benchmarks fell around 4% on Monday.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,904.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1727.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",COVID-19 vaccine verdicts loom as next big market risk,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Optimism that vaccines are on the way to end the coronavirus pandemic has been a major factor in this year’s U.S. stock resurgence. That will face a critical test in coming weeks, as investors await clinical data on whether they actually work.
A UBS analysis found that about 40% of the market's gains since May can be pegged to hopes for vaccines to protect against COVID-19, which has killed over 960,000 worldwide and rocked the global economy. 
Global efforts to develop a vaccine are coming to a head, with late-stage data on trials by companies such as  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) possible as soon as October or November. Disappointing results could further shake markets that have recently grown turbulent on worries over fiscal stimulus delays and uncertainty around the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.
""The anticipation is that this stuff is going to work,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. ""So any news to the contrary could be a risk to the market.""
The number of vaccines in development could blunt the negative market impact of any single setback. More than a half-dozen vaccines globally are in late-stage trials out of over 30 currently being tested in humans, according to the World Health Organization.
“We are setting ourselves up for success in the sense of if you throw enough spaghetti at the wall, hopefully at least one noodle sticks,"" said Liz Young, director of market strategy at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Investment Management.
That could explain why stocks overall barely reacted earlier this month, when AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) and partner Oxford University paused global trials of one of the leading vaccine candidates after a participant in its U.K. trial became seriously ill. The trials have resumed in Britain, Brazil and South Africa, but remain on hold in the United States. 
Some forecasts on vaccine availability have grown less optimistic. Good Judgment, a company whose forecasters make predictions based on publicly available evidence, put the chances that a vaccine will be widely distributed in the United States by the end of March at 54%. That is up from an estimate of less than 20% in early July, but down from above 70% earlier this month.
Pfizer and Moderna could report initial efficacy results in October or November based on an early read of data, followed by data from companies such as AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and  Novavax  Inc (O:NVAX).
An approval or emergency use authorization this year could lead to a surge in travel, leisure and other stocks that have been decimated by pandemic-related shutdowns, while also fueling a long-awaited shift into value stocks from tech and other growth names that have led the market for years.
Even if a vaccine is approved, questions persist about how easily and quickly it can be distributed. President Trump and his health officials have issued conflicting predictions about when the general public could have access.
""The potential for market disappointment will likely come from the realization that manufacturing and broad distribution will take longer,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
An approved, broadly distributed and accepted vaccine could result in a gain of about 300 points to the S&P 500, or more than 8% at the index's current level, according to Keith Parker, head of U.S. and global equity strategy at UBS.
If a vaccine is widely distributed in the first quarter, BofA Global Research projects global gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 6.3% in 2021, compared with 5.6% if that does not occur until the third quarter.
Disappointing clinical trial news could result in a loss of 100 points from the S&P 500, or about 3%, Parker estimates. 

While the market might be able to handle one vaccine setback ""reasonably well,"" several setbacks could cause a rethink of the vaccine race, he said.

The car manufacturer is looking for senior developers in Singapore, according to job postings on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), which didn’t disclose how many people are sought. In July, Tesla began advertising for positions such as store leader and sales advisers in the city.
A Tesla representative in Beijing declined to comment.
Musk has previously criticized Singapore for not being supportive of electric vehicles, and Tesla hasn’t got any showrooms in the city whose premium-car market is dominated by brands such as BMW AG and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) AG’s Mercedes-Benz. The California-based company has been quick to expand in other major Asia-Pacific metropolitan markets, including Hong Kong, Sydney, Tokyo and Taipei.
Singapore said this year it plans to phase out fossil fuel-powered vehicles by 2040, planning to add incentives to encourage consumers to buy electric cars. The island state has been relatively slow to adopt EVs and Musk said on Twitter in January 2019 that the government was unwelcoming.
Tesla plans to ship cars made at its new Shanghai factory to other countries in Asia, including Singapore, people familiar with the matter said this month. Shipments could start as soon as the end of this year or early 2021, according to the people.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 01:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hong Kong-listed semiconductor maker ASM Pacific plans to go private: sources,"By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong-listed semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASM Pacific Technology Ltd is in talks with potential investors to help take it private, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
ASM is aiming to eventually relist itself on Shanghai's Nasdaq-like STAR Market to take advantage of its sharply higher valuations, said the people, who declined to be named as the information is confidential.
The company's parent Dutch chip maker ASM International (OTC:ASMIY) NV, which holds about 25% of the Hong Kong arm, supports the proposal but doesn't plan to divest its stake, said one of the people.
ASM denied that it was planning to go private. ASM International didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Based on ASM's current market value of $4.2 billion, a potential deal would cost outside investors at least $3.2 billion, without taking into account a premium paid on the stock price.
Hong Kong-listed companies have announced take-private deals worth $17.8 billion so far this year, more than double last year's annual volume, according to Refinitiv data, often citing undervalued shares as a reason for the deals.
The average premiums paid by buyers for those deals jumped to 46% in 2019 and this year, from 34% in 2018, the data showed.
ASM, which produces chip assembly and packaging machinery, has since earlier this year approached a number of private equity and venture capital firms in the hope they can help fund a buyout, the people said.
The company has also talked to several banks for the deal financing, said one of the people.
ASM's proposal comes as private equity interest in Chinese take-private deals is rising, with investors pouring money into new-economy companies listed on China's year-old STAR Market amid the intensifying Sino-U.S. tech war.
Companies raised $14.4 billion via IPOs on STAR in the first eight months of 2020, making it the second-biggest market globally, just behind Nasdaq, Refinitiv data showed, and ahead of New York and Hong Kong.
STAR Market-listed companies enjoy an average price to earnings of over 93 times, according to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Eikon data showed Nasdaq 100 companies have an average PE of 35.84 times.
Beijing has been spending billions of dollars in an effort to speed up improvements to its domestic chip industry, a campaign which has gained fresh urgency as Washington intensifies pressure on Huawei.
Chinese investors have also driven the country's 45 listed chipmakers to over 100 times the companies' earnings, making semiconductors the priciest sector in the stock market.
Founded in 1975, Singapore-headquartered ASM claims to be the only company in the world that offers high-quality equipment for all major steps in the electronics manufacturing process - from carrier for chip interconnection to chip assembly and packaging to Image result for surface-mount technology (SMT).
It has been listed in Hong Kong since 1989 and counts China for half of its revenue, according to its website and filings.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said improvements to be unveiled at the electric-vehicle maker's ""Battery Day"" event would not reach ""serious high-volume production"" until 2022, knocking its shares down.
Analysts were expecting Musk to unveil at the event plans for Tesla to produce its own battery cell as it seeks to cement its lead over General Motors (N:GM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and others. 
But in a post on Twitter ahead of the Tuesday event, Musk said: ""This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck & Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.""
Tesla expects significant shortages in 2022 and beyond, Musk cautioned, adding it intended to increase cell purchases from Panasonic (T:6752), South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910), China's CATL (SZ:300750), and possibly other partners.
LG Chem and CATL shares rose after the comments. 
But Tesla shares fell more than 5% to $425.50 in extended trade as the tweets cast doubt on whether Tesla would be able to produce its own batteries any time soon - a concern echoed by experts and industry officials. 
""Battery firms believe it is not easy to mass produce batteries. It took them a lot of time ... how can Tesla do it overnight?"" a South Korean battery industry source told Reuters.
Tesla is working to produce new, bigger battery cells at its Fremont facility, two people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. The new cells will have a diameter of 42 mm, versus the 21 mm ones made at its joint battery factory with Panasonic that are used in Model 3 sedans, the people said. 
PRICING PRESSURE
Tesla may have to partner with Panasonic to mass-produce its own cells, Seoul-based battery expert Park Chul-wan said. 
The new batteries could boost energy capacity, cut costs and enable faster charging, helping Tesla cars better compete with gasoline ones, Park said.
Some battery industry officials are wary that Tesla's move to produce batteries in-house could put pressure on prices. 
""Tesla is sending signals to suppliers that they should further lower costs, and if not, Tesla would source more batteries in-house,"" a former LG Chem official said.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 12:25AM ET</span>","BlackRock, JPMorgan climate votes at odds as new rules loom","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. asset managers BlackRock Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co were divided in their support of climate-related proxy resolutions at corporate meetings this year, two analyses showed on Tuesday, underscoring the industry's mixed appetite for the vehicles ahead of a key rulemaking.
Both studies - done by climate-focused shareholder organizations - found BlackRock (N:BLK) continued to offer little backing to resolutions asking companies for steps like setting emissions targets or lobbying reports. 
The findings prompted the organizations to complain that BlackRock hasn't backed up its vows to prioritize climate matters earlier this year. The studies found BlackRock supported such resolutions around 10% of the time this year, about the same as in 2019.
Other fund firms supported the climate-related resolutions about half the time or more, in keeping with their increased popularity, the studies of dozens of votes said. 
Proxy votes have drawn attention in recent years as a point of leverage for investors looking for companies to take more aggressive action on the environment or social issues. But they also can put fund firms in the awkward position of demanding changes at the same companies whose retirement assets they seek to manage.
One more frequent backer of the resolutions was the asset-management arm of JPMorgan (N:JPM) which supported them roughly half the time this year according to the separate but similar studies by activist investment firm Boston Trust Walden and by Majority Action, a liberal-leaning shareholder advocacy group.
That was up from JPMorgan's support rate of just 4% for climate resolutions in 2019 according to Walden. 
""I see an asset-management industry that overall is waking up to the substantial level of risk of climate change,"" said Eli Kasargod-Staub, Majority Action executive director. He and Walden senior vice-president Tim Smith both said BlackRock's climate voting record did not match its rhetoric. 
""It's shocking to see their votes remain at this substandard level,"" said Smith.
A BlackRock spokesperson said it has spoken more frequently this year with portfolio companies on environmental matters and other issues, voted more frequently against corporate directors and given more details about its stewardship activities. BlackRock also said not all proposals are worth supporting, and that ""not all shareholder proposals are created equal.""
It had previously given statistics showing it took a tougher line in some proxy votes this year, especially at energy companies.
A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment on its proxy votes. In February the company had outlined new initiatives for sustainable investing including more use of data.
The 162 environmental and social proposals voted at shareholder meetings this year at S&P 1500 companies won average support of 27.7% and 18 passed, said proxy solicitor Georgeson, up from 2017 when 211 of them won 20.3% average support and 5 passed.
Business groups - including one led by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon - have supported making the proposals harder to file or resubmit and last November the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3-2 along partisan lines for such changes. A final vote could come Wednesday.
BlackRock, known for its index funds, has taken a neutral stand on the rule changes, unlike some active management firms that oppose them. JPMorgan has not filed comments on the matter.
A BATTLE AT DELTA
Whatever the outcome, BlackRock and some rivals have begun to provide more details about individual votes.
For instance at Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) BlackRock voted ""against"" a shareholder resolution calling for a company report on how its lobbying activities match goals to limit rises in global temperatures.
Explaining the vote on its website, BlackRock said it expects Delta will provide more disclosures in any case and noted it is working to reduce its emissions via newer planes and the use of biofuels.
The resolution drew support from 46% of shares cast, including votes from JPMorgan, securities filings show. It would have passed with the support of BlackRock, a 5% holder at the time.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investor Sequoia Capital China is raising at least 15 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) in a new yuan-denominated fund, people with knowledge of the matter said, building a war chest as the world's second-largest economy recovers from a virus-induced slump.
The fund, Sequoia China's sixth, is likely to be the largest of its kind for the company and is expected to focus on sectors ranging from industrial technology, healthcare and consumer to media, said one of the people.
The early investor in top Chinese technology firms such as  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA) reached the first close of the fundraising late last year, according to another person.
The Chinese investment arm of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital looks to fully close the fundraising in the coming weeks and the final fund size would be about 18 billion yuan, said a third person.
The people declined to be named as the details of the fundraising plans are not public yet.
Sequoia China declined to comment.
The firm's yuan-denominated fundraising comes amid ongoing U.S.-China tensions over technology that have put global funds and companies in the cross-fire, and triggered concerns about the Chinese firms' ability to access private capital overseas.
One of Sequoia China's most prominent portfolios - Chinese tech major Bytedance - is in the final negotiations with the U.S. government over the fate of its global short-video streaming application TikTok.
The fundraising also comes as Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market has become increasingly attractive to China's tech founders as they prepare to leverage higher valuations and take their companies public, offering domestic investors an attractive exit option.
Sequoia China was founded in 2005 by former investment banker and entrepreneur Neil Shen, now one of China's best-known venture capitalists.
It has invested in over 500 firms in China, including e-tailer major JD (NASDAQ:JD).com (HK:9618), food delivery giant  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690) and ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing, according to the firm.
China-focused investment managers raised only $12 billion in July-August this year in funds denominated in U.S. dollars and yuan, compared with $68 billion and $59 billion over the same period in 2019 and 2018, according to data provider Preqin.
Venture capital and private equity fundraising are, however, picking up as a number of big names, with track records of landing big-ticket merger-and-acquisition deals and steady returns, come to the market.
Private equity firm Hillhouse Capital Group is raising a fund targeting over 20 billion yuan ($3 billion), its largest-yuan fund, Reuters reported last week.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were down on Tuesday morning, reacting to a slump in U.S. stocks overnight over the rising number of COVID-19 cases and the status of the latest U.S. stimulus measures.
A fresh COVID-19 outbreak in Europe is increasing fears of more new lockdowns on the continent, with the U.K. due to announce new restrictions on bars and restaurants later in the day. Denmark and Greece implemented new restrictive measures during the previous week.
South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.76% by 11:17 PM ET (3:17 AM GMT) and in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.66%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.54%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.17% and the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.18%. Fresh doubts were cast on Monday over Oracle’s takeover of TikTok's U.S. operations after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he would not approve the deal if parent company ByteDance remained in control at the entity TikTok Global. China responded shortly after that it also was unlikely to give the deal the green light, with Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin tweeting that Beijing would likely reject the deal “because the agreement would endanger China’s national security, interests and dignity.""
The deal, as it stands currently, would give ByteDance as much as an 80% share in TikTok Global, while giving U.S. investors slightly over 50% of shares.
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.
Global stocks also tumbled on Monday after around 90 banks, including HSBC (HK:0005) and  Standard Chartered  (HK:2888), were named in a leak of more than 2,100 suspicious activity reports (SARs). The banks are accused of moving over $2 trillion of reportedly illicit funds, despite concerns over their origins, between 1995 and 2017.
Meanwhile, a potential partisan battle to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg could further hamper efforts to pass the latest round of stimulus measures. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats have released a stopgap government funding bill in the meantime, but without the support of the White House or Senate Republicans.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also said on Monday that the U.S. economy is improving but warned that there is a long way to go before a full recovery from COVID-19. Powell will testify before the House Select Subcommittee on COVID-19 on Wednesday to discuss the Fed’s response to the virus.
Some investors remained glum about the outlook.
“Valuations were getting more and more stretched and folks were looking the other way in the context of undeniable Fed support and the view that the U.S. government was going to top off the loss of income during the pandemic,” Macro Risk Advisors Founder and Chief Executive Officer Dean Curnutt told Bloomberg.
“There is concern that this uncertainty around the election is going to stay with us for a period after the election,” he added."

In 2018, Australia banned Huawei from supplying equipment for a 5G mobile network citing national security risks, a move the company criticised as being politically motivated.
""In simple terms the 5G ban on Huawei has cost us 1,000 high-tech and high-wage jobs from the economy,"" Jeremy Mitchell, Huawei's chief corporate affairs officer for Australia, said in an emailed statement.
""We have gone from 1,200 staff to fewer than 200 and by next year it will be lower still.""
The Australian Financial Review first reported the comments. 
Huawei had terminated A$100 million ($72.3 million) of research and development investments in Australia since the 5G ban, Mitchell said.
Huawei last month said it would end its sponsorship of an Australian rugby league club a year earlier than expected due to a downturn in its business. [nL4N2FX13O] 
Diplomatic relations between Australia and China have soured this year after Australia called for an independent international investigation into the source of the coronavirus pandemic.

Beijing was angered by the move and has since blocked Australian beef imports, placed dumping tariffs on Australian barley, and launched an anti-dumping investigation into Australian wine.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 07:40PM ET</span>",Airbus unveils concepts for hydrogen-powered plane,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has unveiled three visual concepts for ""zero emission"" airplanes to be powered by hydrogen.
It is the planemaker's latest effort to draw public attention to its ""zero-emission"" ambitions as European governments push for cleaner technology in their post-COVID recovery plans.
Airbus (PA:AIR) has set itself a deadline of 2035 to put a carbon-free commercial aircraft into service, a target engine makers like  Safran  (PA:SAF) have described as ambitious.
The ""ZEROe"" initiative includes concepts for two conventional-looking aircraft: a turbofan jet engine able to carry 120-200 people over 2,000 nautical miles (3,700 km) and a turboprop able to carry up to 100 people for 1,000 nm.
Unlike normal planes, the engines would be adapted to burn liquid hydrogen stored in the rear fuselage.
A third proposal incorporates a revolutionary ""blended wing body"" design similar to one presented in February.
At the same time, Airbus is working on a demonstrator, with initial results expected in 2021.
""The demonstrator will allow us to assess what the most promising architecture is,"" Airbus Chief Technology Officer Grazia Vittadini said in an interview.
""We see it as applicable to all Airbus products eventually.""
To meet its 2035 goal, Airbus would need to select technologies by 2025, she said. Other industry executives said such a clean break in propulsion could take until 2040.
Challenges include finding ways to safely store volatile liquid hydrogen during flight at very cold temperatures. 
Airbus dismissed concerns that hydrogen would be unsafe and has called for massive investment in new energy infrastructure.
While hydrogen has been discussed since the 1970s, it remains too expensive for widespread use. Proponents say infrastructure investment and rising demand will lower the cost.
Most hydrogen used today is extracted from natural gas, which creates carbon emissions.

However, Airbus said the hydrogen used for aviation would be produced from renewable energy and extracted from water with electrolysis. That's a carbon-free process if powered by renewable electricity, but it is currently more expensive.

SEATTLE/MONTREAL/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. aviation regulator should require new cockpit procedures for  Boeing Co 's (N:BA) 737 MAX to help pilots disable an erroneous stall alert that could be a serious distraction during mid-flight emergencies, major pilots unions said on Monday.
The proposal about an erroneous ""stick shaker"" alert is among recommendations the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) and the Allied Pilots Association submitted during a 45-day public comment period for proposed 737 MAX design and operating changes laid out last month by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Monday was the deadline for comments.
The 737 MAX changes could pave the way for the FAA to lift a ban on the jet, potentially before year-end. The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide 18 months ago after crashes killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
In both crashes, pilots grappled with Boeing's flawed MCAS flight control system, which repeatedly forced down the jet's nose, and multiple audio and visual warnings that included the rapid and noisy rattling of their control column known as ""stick shaker"" and excess speed.
The proposals, which include recommendations for pilots during emergency situations, came during a U.S.-led gathering of regulators in the UK for a training review of the MAX.
While the FAA is in charge of certifying the MAX, other regulators like Transport Canada and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) could add different training requirements as part of their validation of the aircraft. 
ALPA proposed steps that would allow flight crews to identify and pull a circuit breaker to stop the stick shaker after they confirm an alert is erroneous, echoing an earlier recommendation by Transport Canada.
Separately, the Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)' pilots, also asked on Monday for a checklist to disable erroneous stick shaker activation as well as an overspeed warning.
The union said the FAA should condense a checklist for dealing with a loss of control called runaway stabilizer to help pilots ""more rapidly isolate the problem.""
Among other comments, the National Transportation Safety Board has called the FAA's proposed changes ""positive progress,"" while crash victims' families have said Boeing's changes to MCAS do not address the jet's underlying aerodynamic problem.

Meanwhile, Boeing whistleblower Curtis Ewbank has urged additional protections, while the British Airlines Pilots Association has called for Boeing to add a third ""angle of attack"" sensor to the jet.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",China's property developers seek to dodge new rules with shift of debt off balance sheets,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China is tackling unbridled borrowing in the real estate development sector anew with caps for debt ratios. But sources at developers say a rush to get around the rules by moving more debt off balance sheets is on.
Dubbed ""the three red lines"", Chinese regulators outlined caps for debt-to-cash, debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratios last month at a meeting with 12 major property developers in Beijing. Though not yet officially announced, developers expect the rules to be applied sector-wide as soon as Jan. 1, 2021.
The move has sent shock waves through the industry, sources at four Chinese property developers told Reuters.
""Every company is worried...so everyone is using their own methods, and it's all about off balance sheet: off balance sheet projects and off balance sheet debts,"" an executive at a mid-sized developer told Reuters.
""Liquidity is still abundant, both onshore and offshore, you just need more innovation in fund raising."" 
Moving debt off books by setting up ventures with other developers to purchase land is already common practice and will intensify, said the sources, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Other methods that effectively disguise debt as equity - such as investing in a project with a financial entity which gets guaranteed returns and an agreement for their stake to be bought back - will continue to gain in popularity, the sources added. 
But regulators have been loud and clear in their messaging and will likely step up countermeasures to rein in projects aimed at hiding debt, analysts and economists say. 
Regulators have since 2016 sought to limit lending to the sector, including by trust funds and other parts of China's shadow banking industry. They have also sent developers with many joint ventures questionnaires asking them to account for their business practices.
""I can't say this loophole has been completely sealed but for sure the room to manoeuvre is not as big as before. The same applies to disguising debt as equity - so unless there are new methods that regulators are unaware of, it’ll be hard to do in large volumes,"" said Rosealea Yao, China investment analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics.
AN INDEBTED SECTOR
China's property market was among the first to recover after the coronavirus-hit economy reopened this year, thanks to cheaper credit and the relaxation of urban residential curbs. Supported by robust sales, real estate investment in the country climbed 11.8% in August, the fastest pace in 16 months. [nL4N2G82G9]
According to Chinese media, the cap for the debt-to-assets ratio will be set at 70%, the cap for net debt to equity will be set at 100% and the developers should also have enough cash to match their short-term liabilities.
The People's Bank of China and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
If developers are successful in shifting more debt off balance sheets, it will make the task of assessing the magnitude of the debt problem across the industry even more difficult.
The property sector in general accounted for 28.7% of the $24.4 trillion outstanding yuan loans issued by China's banks in the second quarter - just under 2019's peak of 29%. Real estate development loans totalled $1.8 trillion. Those figures, however, do not include financing offered by the country's much larger shadow banking industry.
Not all developers are highly leveraged - China Vanke Co Ltd (SZ:000002), the nation's No. 3 developer - is known for its low debt ratios.
China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333), China's second-biggest, is the most indebted with some 835.5 billion yuan ($124 billion) in borrowings. It said at an earnings briefing last month, however, it had begun to cut its gearing even before the three red line policy.
The company which rarely joins hands with other developers, has slowed land purchases, sold a stake in a property management firm ahead of a possible IPO for the unit and is considering spinning off other units.
 Country Garden  Holdings (HK:2007), China's No. 1 developer, told an earnings call last month it did not expect the new rules to pose a problem as its net debt ratio was 58% and its cash to short-term debt was 1.9 times.
S&P Global analyst Ricky Tsang says developers rated single-B by the credit agency would be most affected by the new policy as many of them would breach at least one red line.
S&P estimates that on average developers will need to limit growth in annual debt to around 15% to avoid a red line. By comparison, consultancy PwC estimates leverage ratios in the sector grew 20-35% on average over the last five years, with the biggest developers' ratios growing the fastest.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Top accounting firms and the World Economic Forum were scheduled to release on Tuesday key metrics for companies to use when reporting on their environmental, social and governance impacts.
Report sponsors said the effort aims to cut through a mishmash of existing standards on topics like carbon emissions and workforce diversity.
""The goal here is to elevate from thousands of metrics a number of subjects that are a baseline,"" said Maha Eltobgy, head of investment for the World Economic Forum, known for the annual economic conference it sponsors in Davos, Switzerland.
While companies have formal guidelines to follow for traditional financial reporting areas like revenue or cash flow, there is little formal agreement on how to measure the impact of so-called ESG issues.
Meanwhile such topics have drawn new attention from financial companies looking to price in their impact on asset values. 
Efforts including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Global Reporting Initiative have offered various suggestions and pledged to work together.
Eltobgy pointed to the example of climate change. Tuesday's report suggests companies disclose both how many metric tonnes of carbon dioxide they emit, and whether they have set targets on greenhouse gas emissions, drawing on separate recommendations from the different standard-setters.
""The work was scanning all the standards and metrics out there and picking the ones that would be seen as most universal,"" she said.
The new metrics were developed with input from Bank of America (N:BAC) and accounting firms Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. court on Monday fast-tracked Tiffany & Co's lawsuit against French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH for trying to back out of its $16 billion deal to acquire the jeweler.
Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights said he would set a four-day trial beginning Jan. 5, 2021, which is after the Nov. 24 ""drop-dead"" date for the biggest luxury merger deal to close but before antitrust approvals begin to expire.
LVMH’s acquisition of Tiffany hit the rocks this month after the Louis Vuitton owner said it could no longer complete the purchase, citing an intervention by the French government and the U.S. jeweler's weakening performance due to COVID-19.
Slights said he hoped both Tiffany and LVMH could have ""productive discussions to avoid the need for litigation,"" referring to a potential settlement.
Tiffany had pushed for a trial before Nov. 24. The French luxury goods conglomerate argued for one beginning in March or April of next year.
In a statement, LVMH said it is ""fully confident"" it will be able to defeat Tiffany's accusations and convince the court that the conditions for the deal are no longer met.
""In the coming months, LVMH will demonstrate to the American justice system that the mismanagement of Tiffany during the COVID-19 crisis constitutes a material adverse effect,"" according to a statement.
Tiffany's chairman Roger Farah said in a statement that it has acted in ""good faith.""
Ed Micheletti, who is representing LVMH, said Tiffany was pretending the pandemic has had no financial impact on its business.
""It's hard to see how they can say that with a straight face,"" he said.
Rick Pepperman, an attorney representing Tiffany, said LVMH was seeking to force Tiffany into a renegotiation.
""That is what we suspect LVMH and Bernard Arnault really want, they want to acquire Tiffany but at a lower price than what they agreed to last November,"" Pepperman said.
The decision is Slights' first time weighing in on the broken deal, the most high-profile of a series of abandoned transactions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although the trial is now scheduled to occur after the deal expires, LVMH said in court papers that it would honor so-called ""specific performance"" - closing the deal - if the court found that it could not abandon it.
Slights said during Monday's hearing that is the preferred course of action compared to monetary damages.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are bracing for an extended period of market volatility as worries over a potential resurgence in coronavirus cases and political uncertainty roil stocks.
The Cboe Volatility Index, known as ""Wall Street's fear gauge,"" hit its highest level in nearly two weeks as concerns over waning fiscal stimulus and the long-term economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic took the S&P 500 down to a seven-week low on Monday. 
Market participants aren't expecting the turbulence to die down any time soon.
VIX futures show that investors are betting that market swings will persist beyond the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election and into December, reflecting worries about the possibility of a contested election and concerns that a deeply divided government will fail to agree on providing more fiscal stimulus to support the U.S. economy.
Other possible stumbling blocks for U.S. stocks include re-escalating tensions between the United States and China, as well as a potential increase of global coronavirus cases that could once again lead to broad economic shutdowns.
The ramped up concerns are a sharp departure from the summer months, when signs of healing in the U.S. economy and expectations of more fiscal stimulus took markets to record highs after their brutal March sell-off. 
""There are a lot of different unknowns out there, and we just don't know what that translates into,"" said Oliver Pursche, president at Bronson Meadows Capital Management. ""That's going to stick with us a little bit longer.""
Concerns over U.S. political uncertainty have recently been sharpened by the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which observers expect to deepen partisan divides as it sets up what promises to be a fierce fight in the Senate over President Donald Trump's eventual nominee to replace her.
Such a battle could hamper the bipartisan effort needed to pass additional federal coronavirus relief. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, among others, has stated that the U.S. economic recovery requires additional fiscal support. Such measures have been built into many economic and market forecasts for next year, and its continued absence could lead to further pullbacks in U.S. equities, some investors say.
""It's very hard to see how a compromise on another stimulus bill is reached in the next six to eight weeks,"" said Charles Lemonides, portfolio manager of hedge fund ValueWorks LLC. 
Lemonides is betting on declines in the stocks of several financial companies, including Wisdom Tree Investments Inc (O:WETF) and Cohen & Steers Inc (N:CNS), which he believes are trading at valuations that assume a steep improvement in the economy.
Ginsburg's death could also weigh on shares of managed healthcare companies as it increases the likelihood that the Affordable Care Act could be struck down, according to a note from UBS Global Wealth Management. 
A new challenge to the law comes before the Supreme Court in November. The health care sector already trades at its largest valuation discount to the S&P 500 in at least 30 years, a report from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said last week.
More broadly, however, ""it's not just Election Day that matters to this market,"" said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management. ""It's also 'do we get fiscal stimulus or do we not?'""

NEW YORK/BEIJING (Reuters) - ByteDance and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) issued conflicting statements on Monday over the terms of an agreement they reached with the White House over the weekend to allow TikTok to continue to operate in the United States, casting doubt on President Donald Trump's preliminary blessing of the deal.
China's ByteDance was racing to avoid a crackdown on its popular short-video app after the U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday it would block new downloads and updates to the app. U.S. officials had expressed concern that the personal data of as many as 100 million Americans that use the app was being passed on to China's Communist Party government.
A successful deal would allow Trump to drop his threat of shutting down TikTok and avoid alienating its army of young users ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. election.
ByteDance said on Monday that it will own 80% of TikTok Global, a newly created U.S. company that will own most of the app's operations worldwide. ByteDance added that TikTok Global will become its subsidiary. 
Oracle and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, which have agreed to take stakes in TikTok Global of 12.5% and 7.5% respectively, had said on Saturday that majority ownership of TikTok would be in American hands. On Monday, Oracle said ByteDance's ownership of TikTok would be distributed to ByteDance's investors, and that the Beijing-based firm would have no stake in TikTok Global.
Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 14 giving ByteDance 90 days to relinquish ownership of TikTok. Oracle's account of the deal would mean that ByteDance would be complying with that order, while ByteDance's account would represent a policy reversal for Trump.
Trump did not comment on the conflicting accounts of the agreement on Monday, but said the deal was ""working its way through"" after he granted his preliminary approval.
""If we can save (TikTok), we will save it, and if we can't we will cut it off. We have to have total security,"" Trump told reporters before departing the White House. 
The corporate governance arrangement that the companies have disclosed for TikTok Global does not award total control to Oracle and Walmart. Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon would be one of five directors on TikTok Global's board, the companies have said. Others would include ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming, and the heads of ByteDance's two top investors, General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital. The fifth board director has yet to be named. 
The current plan for TikTok Global does not involve any transfer of algorithms or technologies, and Oracle will be able to inspect TikTok U.S.'s source code, ByteDance said on Monday. This is akin to U.S. companies such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) sharing their source code with Chinese technology experts, ByteDance added. Oracle and Walmart have said all of TikTok's technology will be transferred to TikTok Global. 
The Commerce Department postponed a ban on downloads and apps to the TikTok app that was due to take effect on Sunday by one week, to give the companies time to finalize the deal. 
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a U.S. government panel that reviews deals for potential national security risks, has been overseeing the negotiations.
Some sources close to the deal have sought to reconcile the discrepancies by pointing out that 41% of ByteDance is owned by U.S. investors, so by counting this indirect ownership TikTok Global would be majority owned by U.S. parties. One of the sources said the deal with Oracle and Walmart values TikTok Global at more than $50 billion.
ByteDance on Monday also confirmed plans for an initial public offering of TikTok Global. Oracle has said this will happen in less than 12 months on a U.S. stock exchange. 
EDUCATION FUND
ByteDance also said a $5 billion payment of taxes TikTok Global will make to the U.S. Treasury is based on estimated income and other taxes the company will need to pay over the next few years, and has nothing to do with the deal reached with Oracle and Walmart. 
Trump last week had said there would be a $5 billion U.S. education fund as part of the deal, but ByteDance has said it was not aware of this. Walmart, Oracle and some ByteDance investors said they would sponsor an educational initiative for online courses for children in the suburbs and inner cities. 
ByteDance owning the majority of TikTok Global and the algorithms means that ByteDance is ""not out of the game"" and has avoided the worst-case scenario, China's state-run newspaper Global Times said in an editorial published on Sunday. 
But on Monday, Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin tweeted: ""Based on what I know, Beijing won't approve current agreement between ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, and Oracle, Walmart, because the agreement would endanger China's national security, interests and dignity.""

China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Three justices on Brazil's Supreme Court have voted against allowing state-owned oil company Petrobras (SA:PETR4) to go ahead with the planned sale of eight refineries, according to the court's website.
Justices Marco Aurélio Mello and Ricardo Lewandowski voted to stop the privatizations, according to the court's website on Monday, after justice Edson Fachin similarly voted against it on Friday. Brazil's Congress had requested that the court suspend the transactions.
The Supreme Court has until Friday to rule on the matter, with the other nine justices yet to cast their votes.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, is in talks to sell refineries in Bahia and Parana states as part of an overall divestment plan that aims to sell eight refineries.

The company is in exclusive talks to sell the Rlam refinery in Bahia to Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala Investment Co. Petrobras' bid to sell its Repar facility in Parana has attracted interest from Raizen, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and Brazil's Cosan (SA:CSAN3), as well as fuel company Ultrapar Participacoes (SA:UGPA3).

Investing.com – The Dow ended off its lows Monday, as investors snapped up beaten-down tech names to push the broader sector into positive, though falling hopes of further fiscal stimulus weighed on investor sentiment.      
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.84%, or 509 points, but had been down over 900 points intraday. The S&P 500 was down 1.13%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.13%.
A wave of late-buying in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and strength in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on deal news sparked a move higher in the broader tech sector, helping the market recover from its lows of the day.   
Microsoft ended more than 1% higher after announcing a $7.5 billion deal to buy ZeniMax Media, the parent company of game developer and publisher Bethesda Softworks. The move comes as Microsoft seeks to ramp-up efforts to build its consumer business after failing in its quest to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations.
""With over 15 million subscribers currently on its Game Pass MSFT is doubling down on its consumer endeavors with this acquisition, a smart and strategic move in our opinion heading into its highly anticipated new console release,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said.
Tech helped offset weakness in value sectors on fears that a lack of further stimulus could hurt the U.S. economic recovery at a time when a surge in cases across Europe threatens global growth.  
Analysts have warned that President Donald Trump's intention to press ahead with the replacement of the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will all but end the prospect of further stimulus. Democrats have urged Trump to halt plans to appoint a replacement before the November election.  
""Trump has said he will announce his pick by Friday or Saturday while seeking a confirmation vote before the November 3rd election … this will result in a further lessening of chances at a US stimulus bill,"" Scotia Economics said. The move would likely take up ""precious time for the executive and calendar space in the Senate before the election at the expense of things like a stimulus bill,"" the firm added. ""Even if quick resolution is achieved, however, the Democrats’ spirit of cooperation is likely to be further lessened as total election gridlock takes root.""
As well as concerns over stimulus, rising U.S.-China tensions also weighed on investor sentiment as Beijing is reportedly readying a list of U.S. companies to blacklist, The Wall Street Journal reported. The move comes in the wake of Trump's ultimatum for a U.S. company to take over video-sharing app TikTok.  Trump said he approved Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)'s proposal to take a partial stake in TikTok.
In other news, Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) slumped 19% after its founder, Trevor Milton, stepped down and was replaced by former General Motors (NYSE:GM) executive Stephen Girsky.

1160,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch for September 22,"By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Political rancor over the open Supreme Court seat puts the prospect of fresh stimulus on hold, and that realization sent markets into a tailspin on Monday.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death last week leaves a vacancy on the high court just as election season heads into its final weeks. That has ignited a fight on Capitol Hill about whether to delay a confirmation.
But that also means lawmakers are preoccupied with something else when people were still hoping for a new round of money to be pumped into the economy, prompting a furious round of selling not just stocks but gold and oil.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to testify in Congress on Tuesday, existing home sales data are released and earnings from  Nike  and others are expected.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow:
1. Mr. Powell goes to the Hill
Powell will head to Capitol Hill to testify before the Joint Economic Committee at 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT). It is the first of three days of testimony on the Hill as investors await new insights on the economic recovery and possible additional stimulus.
Last week the Fed held rates steady at near zero and repeated its pledge to allow inflation to run above the 2% targeted rate to help boost growth.
2. Home sales expected to rise as people flee cities for suburbs
August existing home sales figures are due out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect sales to rise 2.4% from July after increasing 24% in June.
Last week, data showed new home sales fell more than expected last month. But a wave of pandemic-driven relocations, many from city to suburb, is expected to continue as families cope with remote work and school. Shares of homebuilders have risen this year. KB Home (NYSE:KBH) will report earnings in the afternoon, and analysts expect profit of 53 cents a share on revenue of $888 million. Shares are up 13% year-to-date.
3. Earnings from AutoZone and Nike 
AutoZone Inc (NYSE:AZO) is expected to report earnings per share of $24.38 on revenue of $4.1 billion. Analysts are expecting comparable sales growth of 10%, according to Seeking Alpha.
Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) is expected to report EPS of 44 cents on revenue of $8.9 billion. Shares are up 11% this year, near a 52-week high they hit earlier this month. Household stimulus payments sent shoppers looking for new athletic shoes and apparel."

Investing.com – The Dow plunged Monday, led by a slump in economy-sensitive value stocks as diminishing hopes of further stimulus raised concerns about the pace of the U.S. economic recovery.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.28%, or 629 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.76%, while the Nasdaq Composite sliped 0.85%.
Value sectors of the market, which tend to outperform when the economy is prospering, fell sharply, with materials, industrials, and energy among the biggest leading to the downside.

Down 13% from its Sept. 2 high, the Nasdaq 100 has tumbled below its 50-day average and is underperforming the S&P 500 for the first time in a year. Yet deeper losses may be ahead because the selloff has yet to clear out the positive sentiment that bubbled up in the past few months during its historic rally, according to Mike Wilson, the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist.
The tech-heavy gauge is at risk of falling to its 200-day average, according to the strategist. That level, which sits near 9,528, would be a 12% drop from current levels and a 23% decline from its all-time high of 12,421 reached earlier this month.
“This is what happens when stocks get so extended -- corrections can be much bigger when remaining in an uptrend,” Wilson wrote in a note to clients.
The Nasdaq 100 extended a three-week rout, falling as much as 2.4% as of 1:40 p.m. in New York. The biggest ETF tracking the index lost money as the fastest rate since 2000 on Friday, while large speculators boosted the net bearish positions in Nasdaq futures to a 12-year high.
But to Wilson, excessive bullishness toward tech stocks has yet to be completely washed out. Just consider: Despite the worst drawdown in months, open interest on bullish call options remained elevated for tech giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). A flurry of software companies soared in their recent trading debuts, with Snowflake Inc. more than doubling on its first day.
More importantly, hedge funds have stayed “decidedly” long tech and growth stocks, Wilson said, citing the firm’s prime brokerage data. While the conviction partly reflects the outsize returns from internet and software companies, it also highlights the danger should sentiment start to sour, he said. Despite this month’s retreat, the Nasdaq 100 is up 24% for the year, compared with a gain of less than 1% for the S&P 500.
Many of those funds “are letting it ride,” Wilson wrote. “That may come into play and provide some fuel for this correction to go a little further than most are expecting.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. bank regulator announced Monday it had fined three former executives at  Wells Fargo  Bank (N:WFC) for their roles in the company's sales practices scandal.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced it had imposed the fines on three former executives from the bank's community bank arm, arguing they either did know or should have known about long-running problems with the bank's sales practices. 
The OCC imposed a $925,000 fine on Matthew Raphaelson, the former community bank group finance officer, and barred him from the banking industry. It also imposed a $400,000 fine on Kenneth Zimmerman, the bank's former head of community bank deposit products group, and a $350,000 fine on Tracy Kidd, the former head of community bank human resources. 
The fines come nine months after the regulator imposed fines on eight other former bank executives, including former CEO John Stumpf.
In a statement, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman acknowledged the bank's community bank had a ""flawed"" model, but that the firm was committed to fundamental changes.
""At the time of the sales practices issues, the company did not have in place the appropriate people, structure, processes, controls or culture to prevent the inappropriate conduct,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Langan. ""The company is different today, and we are doing what’s necessary to regain the trust of all stakeholders.”
The regulator added that the settlements also require the individuals to cooperate with any other investigation related to the sales practices.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) and Germany's Bosch said on Monday they were sticking to their alliances with  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA) after the executive chairman of the electric and fuel cell truck startup stepped down amid allegations of fraud.
Nikola founder Trevor Milton, whose company become a darling of the stock market over the summer, resigned as executive chairman on Monday following accusations by short-seller Hindenburg Research on Sept. 10 that he made false claims about Nikola's technology. 
Milton has fought back, even after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice said they were looking into the company.
Nikola shares were down 20% in trading Monday, and have lost more than 45% of their value since Sept. 8, when it announced an alliance to build electric and fuel cell trucks with GM. 
Nikola's alliance with GM, and earlier partnerships to develop fuel cell and electric commercial trucks with Bosch and  CNH Industrial  (NYSE:CNHI)'s Iveco unit are critical to the startup's effort to regain traction. On Monday, Nikola said board member Steve Girsky, a former GM vice chairman, would take over as chairman. 
Last week, Girsky defended the due diligence his firm, VectoIQ, did before it purchased Nikola in a reverse merger that took the startup public.
GM has agreed to build an electric pickup for Nikola and supply batteries and hydrogen fuel cells for commercial trucks. In return, GM was supposed to receive an 11% stake in Nikola and payments of up to $700 million for assembling the Nikola Badger pickup.
""We will work with Nikola to close the transaction we announced nearly two weeks ago,"" GM spokesman Jim Cain said in a Monday email.
GM shares were down 6% Monday amid a broad market sell-off. 
“GM put no money into this thing so I’m not sure why GM is selling off today,” said Scott Schermerhorn, managing principal with Granite Investment Advisors. “I viewed the Nikola shares they were getting as a lottery ticket.”
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and company executives have stressed that the alliance with Nikola - which has acknowledged that a prototype truck shown moving in a 2017 video was not moving under its own power - made sense strategically.
""Given that GM is now trading below where it was when the deal was announced, we would view it as a positive if GM and Nikola can still make this partnership work, and effectively a non-event for GM shareholders if the deal falls through,"" said Tim Piechowski, portfolio manager with ACR Alpine Capital Research. 
However, Hindenburg Research founder Nathan Anderson said in an email Monday that Milton's exit was ""only the beginning of Nikola's unraveling.""
""General Motors should carefully evaluate the potential long-term damage to its 112 year brand by continuing to tie itself to Nikola,"" Anderson wrote. 
Italy's CNH Industrial (MI:CNHI) declined to comment on Monday. CNH said last week it and Nikola were working to build prototypes of the startup's Tre seimi-truck, and CNH aimed to start testing the trucks later this year with hopes to begin selling them by the fourth quarter of 2021.
CNH invested $250 million in Nikola last September and owns about 7.11% of Nikola's shares.
Bosch, which has a stake in Nikola, declined to comment on Milton's exit, but said it will continue to work with Nikola. The company referred questions about the size of its Nikola stake to the startup.

""Bosch has been a supplier to Nikola for a number of years and invested in the company in its early financing rounds. We intend to continue working together with Nikola and remain in close contact with the company and its management,"" Bosch said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) said on Monday it will pay a $200 million quarterly dividend to Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) in cash instead of common stock, even as the company tries to reduce debt following a plunge in oil prices.
In a regulatory filing, Occidental said the payment on its perpetual preferred stock would be made on Oct. 15.
Berkshire bought $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock in August 2019, helping fund the Houston-based company's $35.7 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).
The preferred stock carries an 8% annual dividend. Occidental exercised its option to pay Berkshire's two prior quarterly dividends in common stock. Berkshire disclosed last month it sold the stock comprising the first of these payouts.
Occidental ""has the ability to generate substantial free cash at current oil prices"" to service near-term debts, Morningstar analyst David Meats said in an email. ""As a result there's no need to pay the preferred in stock, and the decision to do so earlier was probably due to abundance of caution at the outset of the pandemic and associated oil downturn.""
Since March, Occidental has lowered capital spending, slashed its common stock dividend 98.7%, and pursued asset sales to conserve cash and reduce debt from the Anadarko purchase.
The company agreed last month to sell some assets in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming to Orion Mine Finance for about $1.33 billion.
Occidental ended June with $36 billion of long-term debt, down from $38.5 billion at year end.
As of Friday, Occidental's market value was about $11 billion, down from roughly $44 billion when it bought Anadarko.

In afternoon trading, Occidental shares were down 43 cents at $11.22.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Members Exchange (MEMX), a new U.S. stock exchange backed by some of the biggest customers of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ), launched on Monday with pricing aimed at taking market share from the incumbents.
""Out of the gate, we're looking to be aggressive in order to attract order flow so that people can experience our exchange,"" Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Kellner said in a recent interview. 
The new bourse went live trading seven symbols, including Alphabet Inc (O:GOOG), BlackBerry Ltd (N:BB), and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)  The exchange's mission is to improve the market through technological innovation, reduced complexity, and lower fees, while being a voice for its members on market issues, Kellner said. MEMX was founded in January 2019 by nine financial institutions, including Bank of America (N:BAC),  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW), Virtu Financial (O:VIRT),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Fidelity and Citadel Securities. Since then, MEMX has raised more than $135 million and brought on more than 40 members, including BlackRock Inc (N:BLK),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), JPMorgan Chase and Co (N:JPM) and Jane Street Capital. The Jersey City, New Jersey-based exchange was founded after years of complaints by brokers and other market participants over what they saw as unjustifiably high fees charged by most exchanges for things like market data and exchange connectivity.  Initially, MEMX will give away its market data and will pay more in rebates to brokers that add liquidity to its exchange than it charges in trading fees, meaning it will lose money as it tries to take share from Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) NYSE, Nasdaq, and Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE). The exchange will ""normalize"" its fees once it attracts meaningful volume, but those fees will be very competitive and MEMX will be transparent in how it sets them, Kellner said.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 12:56PM ET</span>",Global banks seek to contain damage over $2 trillion of suspicious transfers,"By Alun John, Sumeet Chatterjee and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Global banks faced a fresh scandal about dirty money on Monday as they sought to limit the fallout from a cache of leaked documents showing they transferred more than $2 trillion in suspect funds over nearly two decades.
Britain-based  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA),  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN) and  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC), Germany's  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG), and U.S.-headquartered JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK) were among the lenders named in the report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and based on leaked documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.
The report was based on 2,100 leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs), covering transactions between 1999 and 2017, filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. Department of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen). Banks are required to file an SAR whenever handling funds that cause grounds for suspicion of criminal activity. 
While some banks said many of the transactions happened a long time ago, and they had since put robust checks in place, the reports revealed broader problems with the monitoring system at the heart of global policing of money laundering and other criminal activity. 
The reports drew calls from some industry groups and activists for reforms. Investors worried about the potential fallout for global banks, many of which have faced hefty fines in the past for lapses in controls and spent billions of dollars to bolster compliance. 
""It confirms what we already knew: that there are huge amounts of SARs being filed with relatively low numbers of cases brought through to prosecution,” said Etelka Bogardi, a Hong Kong-based financial services partner at Norton Rose Fulbright. 
""It also brings out the point that managing financial crime risk goes beyond making SARs,"" Bogardi said.
The Institute of International Finance, an industry group, called for reforms. ""There is a balance to be struck between managing financial crime risk and ensuring access to the financial system for legitimate customers,"" the IIF said.
HSBC and StanChart shares touched their lowest level in as much as 25 years, although they fared little worse than their peers amid a wider sell-off in global stocks. 
JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon, which were also in the top five banks mentioned most frequently in the SARs, fell more than 4% each during midday trading in New York. 
Shares of Deutsche Bank, which was involved in the largest number of SARs in BuzzFeed's dossier, were down more than 8% at one point on Monday morning following the reports. 
Several analysts, however, played down the scale of problems. 
""Unless there are more substantive allegations of fact, we expect that this article will not have lasting impacts on the industry or stock prices,"" Chris Kotowski, analyst at Oppenheimer, wrote in a note. 
Bank shares were also pressured on Monday by other news, including worries about the resurgence of the coronavirus in Europe.
(Graphic: Deutsche Bank shares plunge - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyvrmkrepe/deutsche.PNG) 
IMPORTANT WORK
Deutsche Bank said the issues raised in the media reports were ""historic,"" while the German Finance Ministry said on Monday that the cases linked to Germany in the reports had already been dealt with.
HSBC also said the information in the reports was historic, while Standard Chartered pointed to recent investments to improve its control procedures.
BNY Mellon said it fully complied with all ""all applicable laws and regulations."" JPMorgan said it has ""thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars dedicated to this important work."" 
Many of the suspicious transactions were linked to companies incorporated in Britain or offshore British territories, prompting calls from action groups for tougher rules. 
""If the government cares at all about the UK's reputation globally, it must stop rolling out the red carpet to the criminal and corrupt, and refuse to legitimize their money through our companies and banks,” Global Witness said. 
The UK government said it was working on reforms to its corporate registry system that will require more checks on company directors.

MAJOR WEALTH HUBS
Global banks in recent years have boosted investments in technology and staff to deal with tighter anti-money laundering and sanctions regulatory requirements across the world.
Thousands of clients were booted out of bank accounts in major wealth hubs including Hong Kong and Singapore after a money laundering scandal in Malaysia, the ""Panama Papers"" expose, and a global push for tax transparency. 
Compliance experts said that part of the problem now was banks were struggling to distinguish between transactions that were and were not suspicious, so were simply filing millions of SARs that enforcement agencies lack the capacity to deal with. 

""Lots of banks are struggling with high false positive rates and the backlog (of existing cases). That's why you see that sometimes SARs were raised over 100 days after the transaction,"" said Cliff Lam, a director at AlixPartners in Hong Kong.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) said on Monday it is starting to schedule  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX training for its pilots in November, a sign that it believes a return to service of the grounded jet could be near.
A spokesman said, however, that the training plans were not definitive.
""We have initiated the pilot training scheduling process, which can be canceled if the MAX is not recertified,"" he said, adding that the company remains in contact with the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing.
Boeing is awaiting FAA approval on proposed changes to the 737 MAX aircraft and pilot training following two crashes that together killed 346 people and caused a worldwide grounding that has lasted for 18 months. 
The training proposals are being reviewed by civil aviation authorities and airline flight crews from the United States, Canada, Brazil and the European Union. 
Though no final training program has been approved, American told its pilots to plan for sessions that will begin in November. 
""With the planned return to service for our B737 MAX aircraft in the near future, we will begin conducting B737 MAX Special Training for our B737 pilots,"" Ameya Kingaonkar, director of flight training planning and scheduling, said in a memo on Monday, which was seen by Reuters.
The training will consist of a distance learning training module that will last around 1 hour 40 minutes, as well as a simulator session entailing a 1-hour brief and a 2-hour simulator event, the memo said. 

American plans to release the distance learning module by Oct. 28 and train about 1,700 pilots in November. It expects to complete all of the training by the end of January 2021, the memo said.

(Reuters) - Illumina Inc (O:ILMN) said on Monday it would buy cancer screening startup Grail Inc in a cash-and-stock deal worth $8 billion, buying out investors including Jeff Bezos and snatching back a business it spun out four years ago.
Grail is developing a liquid biopsy, a blood test intended to diagnose cancers at early stages when the disease is easier to treat. The company has said it expects to launch its flagship test Galleri in 2021, betting on a market expected to grow rapidly in coming years.
Grail was founded by Illumina as a separate company in 2016 and had since raised about $2 billion, with investors including the founders of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Microsoft (O:MSFT). Illumina remained its largest shareholder, owning about 14.5% of its outstanding shares. Illumina Chief Executive Francis deSouza said in an interview that he began speaking to his board early this year about acquiring Grail after the start-up released promising data on its experimental diagnostic. ""From our perspective, early detection of cancer is the largest application of genomics for the next decade, decade and a half,” he said. Many cancers, like ovarian cancer, are difficult to diagnose and often only caught when the disease has spread to other areas of the body, when it is far deadlier. If a blood test can effectively detect these cancers earlier, it could significantly improve the prognosis for many patients.
Analysts have forecast a future market for liquid biopsies as high as $130 billion in the United States alone.However, the technology is still experimental and must demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials before being approved by regulators.
Illumina shares fell 8.3% to $271.07, as some analysts questioned the deal's rationale.

""We don't see the clear fit for acquiring a company that is still at a stage where clinical studies and clinical product development are still critical and will be for years,"" Cowen analyst Doug Schenkel said in a research note.DeSouza attributed the stock reaction to the deal's cost. ""It’s just a big deal. The numbers are large and so investors want to process what this means,"" he said. DeSouza said the deal fits into Illumina's long-term strategy of developing next generation technology that uses human genetics to improve patients' lives.

The company said the exit from the business could include divestitures, site closings and job cuts, while it works with its customers to complete existing obligations. (https://invent.ge/33HCxdQ)
GE has said in the past it would focus less on fossil fuels and more on renewable energy, reflecting a growing acceptance of clean power sources by utilities. 
""GE's exit from building new coal-fired power — after decades as a leader in this space — is an acknowledgement that growth in the energy sector will no longer be in coal,"" said Kathy Hipple, a financial analyst at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. ""The market will ultimately reward GE for exiting new coal builds.""
The move also makes GE's portfolio more ESG (environment, social and governance) centric, according to Wolfe Research analyst Nigel Coe, with the coal and steam equipment business being relatively small at about $1 billion of its annual revenues.
Shares of the company that also makes aircraft engines tumbled about 9% on Monday, which analysts said was unrelated to the announcement.

1180,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>","At $5 Trillion, the ETF Market Is Showing Signs of Saturation","(Bloomberg) -- America’s exchange-traded funds are shutting down at a record pace and the production line is stuttering as issuers struggle to sell new products in the $5 trillion market.
More than 130 ETFs have been liquidated in 2020, already the most ever, while 178 funds have started trading -- roughly on course to match last year’s launches. That was the lowest number of debuts since 2014 and the second drop in a row.
A glance at flows helps explain why: Almost a third of all existing ETFs were launched within the past three years, yet they account for only about $2 of every $100 currently invested in the industry, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.
“It’s way tougher” to create a successful product now, said Athanasios Psarofagis, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “Getting $1 billion today in real assets is really, really hard. It’s like getting $6 billion in the past when there was less product, and less of an issue to get on the platforms.”
While the industry as a whole has enjoyed solid growth in the last few years and total assets recently hit a record, giants such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and Vanguard Group dominate the scene. Their size and influence gives them huge advantages in terms of distribution and marketing. They also benefitted from economies of scale when a heated fee war broke out.
Funds from the biggest three issuers account for more than 80% of all ETF assets, and roughly 70% is in products launched more than a decade ago, the data show. The top 10 funds by size were all launched before 2013 and hold a combined $1.3 trillion.
“In the ETF space, distribution is king,” said Nate Geraci, president of investment-advisory firm the ETF Store. “You can have the best ETF in the world, but if investors aren’t aware it exists, it doesn’t matter.”
Even the much-hyped arrival of actively managed, non-transparent ETFs -- which reveal holdings just once a quarter, similar to mutual funds -- have failed to attract big flows. The 15 funds that have launched so far have drawn in just $546 million worth of assets.
Of course, there are some success stories. The Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF has grown to roughly $129 million after launching in June, while the Direxion Work From Home ETF has also crossed the $100 million milestone after its June debut. And so-called buffer funds -- which shield against losses in exchange for a cap on gains -- have steadily accumulated assets amid this year’s turbulent markets.
Still, for every winner there is likely to be at least 10 failures, according to Psarofagis, who says this puts the onus on issuers to ramp up their sales and distribution efforts.
Distribution muscle has helped firms such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management quickly establish themselves. Though the company didn’t launch its first fund until 2014, the JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF became the largest actively managed ETF earlier this month.
“Firms with distribution clout have been able to make inroads despite being late to arrive,” said Ben Johnson, Morningstar’s global director of ETF research. “Schwab, Fidelity, Goldman and JPMorgan are great examples of firms that have come late to the game with me-too offerings but have sold those in to their own captive channels and affiliates.”

LONDON/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Ghana, Africa's largest gold producer, is planning an up to $500 million listing of its gold royalty fund in London in October, though the deal could still run into political opposition, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Agyapa Royalties, a government-backed fund that holds equity interests including mining royalties in the state's gold assets, has hired Bank of America (N:BAC) and JPMorgan (N:JPM) to pursue an initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange this year, the sources said.
Royalties are payments that give the owner the right to receive a percentage of production from a mining operation, or retain a stake in them. 
Ghana wants to take advantage of the precious metal's strong performance this year to raise $400 million-$500 million from the IPO, the sources said. The fund's shares will also be listed on the Ghanaian Stock Exchange.
Yet, the listing could be derailed or pushed back because of resistance from Ghana's main opposition party ahead of a December general election, the sources said. 
""It's genuinely 50-50 at the moment, but if the local politics works out, the deal is ready to go this year,"" said one of the sources. 
Ghana's finance ministry was not immediately reachable due to a public holiday. JP Morgan declined to comment while Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
If it goes ahead, the listing would benefit from a surge in gold prices as the COVID-19 pandemic pushed investors into safe-haven investments. 
While the spot gold price has come off a record high hit in August, it is still up a whopping 27% so far this year at $1,931 an ounce . 
Canadian companies  Yamana Gold  (NYSE:AUY) and Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) have both signalled their intention to add a London listing this year. 
For London investors, it is an opportunity to increase gold exposure and potentially fill the gap left by South Africa's Randgold (LON:RRS), which delisted in 2018. 
The deal would also come at a time when the market for IPOs has come roaring back after a dismal first half of the year, with The Hut Group (L:THG) sealing a 5.4 billion pound ($6.99 billion) float last week.

 Cubic Corp  , which provides transportation and defense system services, adopted a poison pill after the hedge fund said it owns a 15% stake and wants to buy the rest with a private equity partner, Bloomberg Law reported.
The company said its standalone prospects are excellent, and Paul Singer's Elliott hasn't made a formal acquisition offer. 
The poison pill, a shareholder rights plan, gives the board of directors at Cubic time to make an informed decision, and prevents third parties from getting control of the company at a price that isn't the best interest of shareholders, Bloomberg Law said. 
Shares are down 12% in 2020. Cubic has five buy ratings and one hold.

Garrett also said it had entered into a ""stalking horse"" purchase agreement with private equity firm KPS Capital Partners LP for $2.1 billion.
According to the ""stalking horse"" agreement, which is subject to court approval, any other bids that come in must be higher than the offer made by KPS. 
Garrett said it was seeking court's approval for a $250 million financing facility to bolster its cash position as it aims to continue operating its business during the reorganization process.
The company has listed both assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion and $10 billion, according to a filing with the U.S Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
Automakers have been severely hit by the coronavirus outbreak, as they had to shutter factories, which led to a slump in production and disrupted supply chains.
""...the financial strains of the heavy debt load and liabilities we inherited in the spin-off from Honeywell - all exacerbated by COVID-19 - have created a significant long-term burden on our business,"" Chief Executive Officer Olivier Rabiller said in a statement.
Honeywell said Garrett was pursuing a bankruptcy ""to avoid the legitimate and reasonable financial commitments"" the company assumed as part of its spin-off in 2018.
""Garrett always has been capable of fulfilling those obligations with the assets it received in the spin-off,"" Honeywell said in a statement, adding that it was committed to engaging in a dialogue with the firm.
In January, Garrett accused Honeywell of devising its spin-off to offload the U.S. industrial conglomerate's liabilities related to asbestos-exposure claims. https://bwnews.pr/35SrIZ3
Garrett said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy and complete the sale process in early 2021.

Natural gas flows to the plant fell close to zero on Monday from around 0.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) since its last maintenance outage from Sept. 20-Oct. 13, 2019, according to data from Refinitiv.
One billion cubic feet is enough to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day.
The timing of this outage was in line with Dominion's 2018 and 2019 annual maintenance shutdowns.
Dominion spent about $4 billion to add the LNG export terminal to Cove Point's existing LNG import terminal. It sent out its first cargo in March 2018.
Dominion agreed to sell 25% of Cove Point to a unit of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), which will operate the facility once it completes the acquisition of Dominion's gas transmission business later this year. Dominion will retain a 50% passive interest in Cove Point.
U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 10.5 bcfd in 2021 and 12.5 in 2022 from 9.8 bcfd now.
By the mid-2020s, analysts expect the United States will become the biggest LNG exporter in the world, ahead of current global leaders Qatar and Australia.
Cove Point is designed to liquefy about 0.75 bcfd of gas.
Dominion sold the project's capacity for 20 years to a subsidiary of  GAIL (India)  Ltd (NS:GAIL) and to ST Cove Point, a joint venture between units of Japanese trading company Sumitomo Corp (T:8053) and Tokyo Gas Co Ltd (T:9531).

ST Cove Point has agreed to sell some of the LNG to Tokyo Gas and some will go to Kansai Electric Power Co Inc (T:9503), according to Sumitomo's Pacific Summit Energy (PSE) unit.

The $122 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) exchange-traded fund suffered its biggest daily outflow since October 2000, losing almost $3.5 billion on Friday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The tech-heavy fund, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, is suffering outflows after the sector’s massive rally over the past few months. The index just faced a third weekly loss and is on track for its worst month since 2008, a turnaround spurred by lofty valuations, persistent unemployment and a congressional stalemate on further stimulus.
“There is more of a concern that in equity markets we shouldn’t be priced to perfection anymore,” said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen. “That’s the pullback you’re really seen, especially with the stocks with the higher valuations.”
At the same time, there’s also evidence that some risk-tolerant traders are seeking to position themselves for a quick reversal in fortune, piling into a triple-leveraged version of QQQ that’s become popular among day traders. The $7.9 billion ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) notched a third straight week of inflows.
While tech slumps, sectors that had suffered the most during the height of the U.S. pandemic lockdown are outperforming. State Street’s Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) saw its best weekly inflow since June last week, while the firm’s Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) had its worst since January.
“Industrials, materials and the transportation companies started to outpace the broader market months ago, and those cyclical factors still have the most momentum, even in this selloff,” said James Pillow, managing director at Moors & Cabot (NYSE:CBT) Inc.

Some investors are suspected of conducting what the stock exchange has described as ""negotiated offers"" in their subscriptions to shares of new listings, it said in a statement posted on its website.
The exchange also said some lead underwriters -- the banks which organise the IPOs -- were not offering independent research reports. 
The Shanghai Stock Exchange will resolutely take regulatory measures to deal with illegal acts and irregularities in the process of IPOs in order to protect the healthy and stable development of the STAR Market, it said in the statement.
The year-old market is set for a major boost later this year when China's Ant Group, a financial technology giant, plans to list on it and in Hong Kong in a dual listing expected to be worth up to $30 billion.
The recent occurrence of super low offering prices represents a ""huddling-together"" strategy by investors anticipating that returns from new listings will drop as large IPOs suck liquidity out of the market, analysts at China Galaxy Securities said in report.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets started the new week as they ended the old one - with sharp declines, driven by concerns about a return of the Covid-19 virus as the northern hemisphere moves toward winter, and by concerns that a number of tech stocks may not be worth the astronomical valuations they've enjoyed during the summer. 
Reports of chronically lax compliance with anti-money-laundering rules by banks, and the resignation of Nikola chairman Trevor Milton under allegations of fraud, further soured the mood, while the market waited for a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Powell's colleague, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, had already cast a pall over the market by saying that U.S. stock valuations were already high, measured relative to gross domestic product, and that a correction could be ""healthy"".
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the  Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 550 points or 2.0% at 27,107 points, while the S&P 500 was down 1.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.6%. 
Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) stock was the most prominent name in the red, falling 21% to a four-month lower after Milton's resignation. General Motors (NYSE:GM), which had invested $2 billion in an 11% stake in Nikola only two weeks ago, fell 4.5%.
Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) stock was also down over 5% after the maker of gene sequencing equipment said it will pay $7.1 billion in cash and stock for the shares in Grail that it doesn't already own. Grail is developing a blood test that diagnosis cancer, but doesn't yet have any revenue.
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock was up 1.7% amid conflicting reports about the progress toward resolving TikTok's status in the U.S., while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 1.1% after an internal email from CEO Elon Musk said - as he usually does toward the end of a quarter - that the company could break records for deliveries and sales if employees pull together. Tesla is due to hold an event showcasing advances in battery design on Tuesday.
Tech stocks more broadly were, however, outperforming, as the weight of selling concentrated itself in cyclical stocks. That was due in part to fears that new U.K. measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 could herald a second wave of lockdowns across the developed world as the northern hemisphere moves into autumn, the time when seasonal flu generally begins to pick up. United Airlines stock was down 8.0% while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock was down 8.8%. Airline stocks are particularly at risk to a renewed downturn because they may find it harder to get the attention of lawmakers as they pursue a second round of bailout money. 
Washington DC was consumed at the weekend by the implications of the death of Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which prepares the ground for another bitter dispute over how and when to appoint new judges - a process that could derail the already difficult process of reaching a compromise agreement on a fourth round of economic support measures.

California-based Beyond Meat, for which about half of its global sales came from restaurants, has had to reroute its products - plant-based patties, chicken and sausages - to retailers such as Walmart and Costco (O:COST), to keep sales humming during coronavirus-led restaurant closures. 
""Following the initial release of our Beyond Breakfast Sausage Patties at retailers earlier this year, we heard an enthusiastic and overwhelmingly positive response from consumers who asked for increased availability,"" Chuck Muth, Chief Growth Officer, said. 
The company launched the Beyond Breakfast Sausage patty, meant to taste like pork breakfast sausage patties, at select stores in March. The addition of 5,000 more stores will result in doubling of distribution of these products, the company said. 
Demand for plant-based meat alternatives has continued to surge during the pandemic with Nielsen data showing that unit sales for fully cooked plant-based alternatives jumped 25% in the four weeks to Aug. 22. In the April-June period, the sales were up 31.4%. 
This has helped the company's shares nearly double this year to $149, in sharp contrast to the broader S&P 500 index (SPX), which is down 1.9%.

While this helped U.S. retail sales nearly triple to about $90 million in its most recent quarter, increased coronavirus-related costs as well as a sharp slump in sales at restaurants led to Beyond Meat posting a $10 million net loss.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",Boeing gearing up for 787 move to South Carolina: sources,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is nearing a decision to shift more 787 Dreamliner production to South Carolina, industry sources said, a cost-cutting strategy accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic that would deplete its iconic factory north of Seattle.
As recently as last year, Boeing was making record numbers of 787s at its Everett widebody hub north of Seattle and - since 2012 - a second plant in North Charleston, South Carolina.
But the strategy of supporting two plants has been severely tested by the coronavirus slump in international travel, on top of a cyclical downturn in demand for big jets. 
The decision marks a watershed moment in a decade-long saga that has seen the 787 emerge as an alternative cash cow to the 737 MAX, grounded for 18 months after fatal crashes.
Barring a last-minute U-turn, Boeing is ""all but certain"" to move the rest of 787 production away from its traditional base to South Carolina, two people briefed on its thinking said. 
It could be announced by late October when Boeing reports earnings, they said. Pressure for a decision is imminent as suppliers need to know what parts to make for jets in 2022. The decision is ""weeks not months"" away, one of them said.
However, several sources cautioned the decision was still subject to final approval and may require additional analysis. 
Boeing said it had nothing to add to past comments on output. In July, it said it would cut 787 output to six a month in 2021, compared with a recent peak of 14.
It also launched a study of the most efficient way to produce the lightweight jet, including the possibility of merging assembly at one location.
The earlier decision to move some production to the non-union state of South Carolina was the culmination of a years-old board-led strategy to reduce reliance on Washington state, where Boeing has had stormy relations with unions in the past.
But weak demand has forced Boeing to choose between tearing up its industrial diversification goals or gutting the highly integrated Everett plant, the world's largest building by volume.
The review has already rattled unions and politicians in Washington state who see Boeing wavering on its commitment to its Seattle-area birthplace, something the company denies. 
John Holden, president of a local chapter of the International Association of Machinists, has told members Boeing could be threatening a move to win contractual concessions.
EVERETT IMPACT
South Carolina offers cheaper labor, and the largest 787-10 variant cannot easily be built elsewhere due to its size.
But doubling down on the southern state is not without cost. 
Boeing must weigh the chances that concentrating 787 output in the south would make it easier for unions to organize there, a senior industry source said. 
Boeing aims to return to a rate of 10-11 787s monthly at some point. Running such rates at South Carolina would require investment to expand the facility.
On the other hand, senior industry sources say production could go down before it goes back up, piling even more pressure on Boeing to reorganize 787 output there to save cost.
Boeing also faces tough decisions about Everett as demand for twin-aisle jets dwindles.
Currently, it builds the 747, 767, 777, and some 787s there. After 2022, only the 767/KC-46 and 777/777X would remain, with Boeing putting out no more than five jets monthly - roughly three times fewer than a year ago.
After Boeing canceled plans for a new mid-market jet, there is no obvious backfill for the vacated 787 space, which means the remaining low-rate programs would absorb a bigger share of factory overhead.
One outlier scenario gaining attention involves moving 737 MAX production moving from Renton south of Seattle to Everett. But that is unlikely any time soon given the high volumes of planes on order and the priority of getting the 737 MAX flying.
Desperate to save cash, Boeing is also having to balance short-term needs with the industry's notoriously long-term planning horizon - but without the usual confidence in its own demand forecasts as the post-crisis economy remains uncertain.

""If they do an upgraded version of the 787 in five or eight years, they would have to either do it from a distance, or replicate the expensive design and engineering facilities they have in Everett,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said.

1200,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 09:09AM ET</span>",Citi’s Female CEO Rose as Bank Faced Failings on Gender Equality,"(Bloomberg) -- Along  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s path to naming the first female chief executive officer on Wall Street, the bank had to confront some grim truths.
For starters, the bank that Jane Fraser takes over in February pays women just 73 cents for every $1 men get, an even wider gap than the national average. And short of 40% of Citigroup’s managers are female.
Those figures show that Fraser’s historic elevation is far from a capstone. But the bank has spent years getting to this point, and a willingness to publicly face its shortcomings has helped it outpace rivals in many key measures of progress on Wall Street’s slow road to gender equality.
“These things don’t just happen,” said Jeanne Branthover, a managing partner in the global financial-services practice at the executive search firm DHR International. “They made sure they were identifying people to move up the ladder that were not just men.”
Fraser, 53, offers a sign of the advance and an expectation for more. When she takes over, the bank’s 16-member board will be half female, a far cry from the three women that sat on the board during the last CEO handover eight years ago. The executive management team is also stocked with women overseeing functions such as compliance and regulatory affairs -- critical areas as the bank prepares for increased regulatory scrutiny of its infrastructure and controls in the coming months.
Sara Wechter was CEO Michael Corbat’s only female direct report when he rose to the top job eight years ago. Now Citigroup’s head of human resources, Wechter credits Corbat with the strides made in female representation. But she said there’s more to do.
“We need all of the thousands of managers to be as dedicated as the executive management team is,” Wechter said in an interview. “This has been something we’ve been working on year after year.”
Citigroup’s campaign for greater gender equity got a fresh spark five years into Corbat’s tenure: He and then-Chairman Mike O’Neill appeared at the company’s 2017 annual meeting, arguing against a shareholder proposal filed by Arjuna Capital that would require the bank to publish a report about its policies and plans to reduce the gender pay gap.
The moment was cringe-worthy: In a stilted back-and-forth with multiple shareholders, Corbat and O’Neill conceded that they supported the idea of reducing pay disparities, but argued releasing the data wouldn’t help. After the meeting, Corbat and other members of the board believed their answers fell short and decided they wanted to make Citigroup a leader on the issue.
“Citigroup has worn their work on gender equity as a badge of honor in a different way, in a more authentic way, than the other banks,” said Natasha Lamb, a managing partner at Arunja, which has long pushed for banks to disclose more about their gender pay disparities.
A year later, the bank announced it would seek to boost the number of women managers in roles from assistant vice president to managing directors within three years to 40%, up from 37% at that time.
For some roles, the company hopes to go further. The bank is seeking to increase female representation in its analyst and associate programs to 50%. In 2019, 45% of the bank’s full-time analyst and associates were female, up from 35% a year earlier.
In 2019, the bank revealed the pay gap between men and women in its global workforce. It was an ugly number that showed men held most of the highest paying jobs at the bank. But, to this day, it’s one of only a handful of companies to offer such transparent pay disclosure.
“To really make lasting change, we know we need to take a comprehensive approach – board and senior level representation, benefits and support for female colleagues, male allyship, examining and disclosing what the data was telling us and using our voice to draw attention to this very important issue,” Corbat, 60, said in a statement.
Citigroup has sought to seize on the moment, developing an ad showing employees’ daughters at the moment they first learned about the gender pay gap and unequal opportunities. Many of them displayed anger or confusion.
Gender issues are far from Fraser’s only challenge. One of the first orders of business will be cleaning up the firm’s infrastructure and controls as regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, weigh whether to publicly reprimand the bank over continued deficiencies. She’ll also be charged with improving Citigroup’s returns, which lag behind peers.
Fraser won the top job because the board believed she could best tackle those challenges. A bonus of her taking that role, Wechter said, is it will help the bank hire, promote and keep talented women.
That impact is significant to people like Erica Witte, a director in Citigroup’s trading division. Witte was driving her daughter Paige to her first day of kindergarten when she told her the news about Fraser’s promotion.
“Guess what, mommy’s big company where she now works will now be run by a mommy too. This will be the first time a mommy is the big boss,” Witte said in an email to colleagues.

(Reuters) - Shares of electric-truck maker  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA) tumbled 34% on Monday after founder Trevor Milton stepped down as executive chairman following a public squabble with a short-seller over allegations of nepotism and fraud.
The embattled company named Stephen Girsky, former vice chairman of General Motors Co (N:GM) and a member of Nikola's board, as chairman, effective immediately.
Short-seller Hindenburg Research said in a scathing report earlier this month that it had gathered enough evidence to show that Nikola and Milton made false claims about company's proprietary technology to form partnerships with large automakers.
""The focus should be on the Company and its world-changing mission, not me. So I made the difficult decision to approach the Board and volunteer to step aside as Executive Chairman,"" said Milton, who owns about 20% of the company.
""I intend to defend myself against false allegations leveled against me by outside detractors,"" he said in a tweet.
Hindenburg also alleged that Milton appointed his brother, Travis, to lead the a unit in the company despite not having any substantial experience related to the sector. (https://reut.rs/3mFQ6mM)
Nikola has rejected all the accusations and threatened to take legal action against Hindenburg. The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have been probing the claims made in the report, according to reports last week.
Hindenburg's report came soon after Nikola sealed a partnership with GM, which took an 11% stake in the company for about $2 billion and agreed to work together to make electric pickup trucks to take on Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is probing Nikola to assess the merits of short-seller Hindenburg's allegations, according to a Bloomberg News report last week.

Nikola has said it has briefed the SEC on concerns pertaining to the report.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (L:RR) shares hit 16-year lows on Monday after the engine maker confirmed it was considering a rights issue of up to 2.5 billion pounds ($3.23 billion) following months of speculation about its finances. 
Britain's best known engineering company, which makes engines for airliners, military jets and ships, put out a statement on Saturday in response to media reports.
Rolls said that no decisions have yet been taken about the precise amount to be raised or by what means. 
Analysts say that Rolls' balance sheet is not in need of immediate funding. 
The stock was down 8% at 165 pence at 1121 GMT.
They have shed 76% of their value this year and a tumble in recent weeks could make it even tougher to raise as much as 2.5 billion pounds from selling new shares. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit Rolls hard as airlines pay the company according to how many hours its engines fly.
Yet given the low share price, Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham said raising new equity would be a last resort.
Rolls in August said it wanted to sell turbine blade maker ITP Aero and other assets to raise at least 2 billion pounds. 
On Saturday it said it was also looking at equity or debt issuance.
Two senior industry executives who deal with Rolls said they believed a re-nationalisation or injection of state capital was possible, but that it was unclear whether the UK had an appetite for such a move. 
Rolls was nationalised in 1971 and later privatised.
Britain owns a golden share in Rolls-Royce and the importance of the company to the UK's military capability and its economy in terms of exports, has fuelled talk of a possible government rescue.
Planemakers Boeing (N:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) are increasingly concerned about the plight of the company, according to several sources.
In July,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts warned that a second wave of COVID-19 infections could necessitate a government bailout.
The Financial Times newspaper reported that Rolls-Royce is in discussions with sovereign wealth funds including Singapore's to help underpin any fundraising efforts, but UK consent may be needed under rules which limit foreign ownership of the company.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 07:56AM ET</span>",Tesla traders bet on Musk battery pitch to spark rally,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Fasten your seatbelt, because Tuesday is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s ""Battery Day"", and some investors expect Chief Executive Elon Musk's pitch on the electric car maker's energy storage advances to re-energize its rally following a recent 21% stock slump.
Tesla's stock has recovered in the runup to the event scheduled and it gained 1.4% in early trading on Monday, helped by a leaked email from Musk that said the company was hopeful of racking up record car deliveries in the third quarter. 
Many analysts expect Musk to unveil battery improvements extending the Palo Alto, California automaker's lead over General Motors (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and other rivals.
Tesla options are pricing in a stock move of around 17% - up or down - by Friday, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. 
Tesla's stock has more than made up for a historic slump on Sept. 8 after it was unexpectedly left out of a group companies joining the S&P 500, and it has surged over 400% year to date. Still, Tesla remains below its Aug. 31 record high close.
Analysts, including those with neutral ratings on Tesla's stock, expect major advances from Musk.
""We (and the market) expect the announcements to be significant, cementing Tesla's cost and technology lead for several more years,"" UBS analyst Patrick Hummel wrote in a client note on Sept. 11, adding he expects a new dry electrode cell technology to help speed manufacturing and lower costs.
Batteries make electric cars cost more than gasoline-powered ones, so the ability to produce low-cost, long-lasting batteries could put Tesla cars on a more equal footing and help usher in mainstream acceptance.
Musk in August suggested on Twitter that Tesla may be able to mass produce batteries with 50% more energy density in three to four years, which could even enable electric airplanes.
A much hyped ""Autonomy Investor Day"" in April last year failed to stop a five-month decline in the company's stock. At that 2019 event, Musk said that Tesla robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets in 2020, continuing a habit of making bold pronouncements and setting deadlines Tesla does not meet.
""Even if Tesla provides overly ambitious aspirations at Battery Day, we nevertheless expect the event to reinforce Tesla's long-term growth narrative – central to the stock, while also reinforcing investor perception that Tesla is ahead of other automakers,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Dan Levy wrote in a Sept. 16 research note.
New battery cell designs, chemistries and manufacturing processes are just some developments that would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on its long-time battery partner, Japan’s Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY).
Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said in a recent client note he expects Tesla to announce it is bringing battery cell production in-house, and for Musk to focus on work done on ""million mile"" batteries. 
Eight Wall Street analysts recommend buying Tesla's stock, while 10 recommend selling and another 15 are neutral. The median average price target is $305, which is 31% below Friday's close.

Underscoring many investors' concerns that Tesla's stock has become overvalued, it is trading at about 150 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, about double its five year average, according to Refinitiv.

(NYSE:SNOW), which have doubled since their initial public offering last week, are “at risk of a violent sell-off,” according to Summit Insights, which started coverage of the software firm with a sell rating.
Analyst Srini Nandury set a price target of $175, implying 27% downside from Friday’s close, citing competition and the stock’s expensive valuation. The initiation is the first among firms tracked by Bloomberg since shares started trading last week. The stock fell 6.3% in U.S. premarket trading on Monday.
Snowflake is the most expensive name in all tech, Nandury wrote in a note, and the firm has “limited” differentiation compared with other data warehouses while also competing with traditional legacy vendors.
“For the stock to work from the current levels, Snowflake needs to execute flawlessly quarter after quarter, and have to live up to lofty expectations and grow into its valuation,” Nandury said. “While Snowflake’s management is stellar and is known for its execution, the odds of Snowflake’s stock faltering are high.”
The shares have doubled since going public in New York on September 16, taking Snowflake’s market value to $66.4 billion, above that of companies such as Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc. The surge reflects investor appetite for stocks exposed to cloud technology, and has been accompanied by IPOs for fellow cloud firms Sumo Logic Inc. and JFrog Ltd.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Publicly traded U.S. companies have been slow to add minority directors over the past five years even as women grabbed a greater share of board seats during that period, a comprehensive study to be released on Monday shows.
Across the Russell 3000, a broad index of U.S. companies, 29% now have two or more ethnically diverse directors, 7 percentage points more than in 2016, according to the new data from ISS ESG, an arm of Institutional Shareholder Services, scheduled to be presented at a conference on Monday. By contrast 66% of those boards now have 2 or more women, 27 percentage points more than in 2016, ISS found.
Brett Miller, head of data solutions for ISS ESG, said the figures reflect how boards traditionally recruit directors who have already been top officials elsewhere. 
The few minorities who become corporate directors are then in demand, with 30% of the 817 individual Black directors within the index serving on more than one board, compared to a rate of 19% for the 17,810 white directors counted for the study.
""Unless companies expand that recruiting pool you're going to see the same individuals continuously sought after,"" Miller said. 
Corporate America's lack of minority representation has drawn new attention during a nationwide wave of anti-racism protests and activism since the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in police custody in Minneapolis in May.
Top asset managers have previously focused more of their diversity efforts on gender, not race, although that has begun to change. Minority business leaders have long urged boards to seek candidates from nontraditional backgrounds.

ISS ESG's Miller said companies have helped limit the pool of obvious director candidates by their slow overall promotion of minorities. He found 84.2% of Russell 3000 companies have no ethnically or racially diverse top executives among their top five executives, down only 1.4 percentage points from 2016.

MILAN/BERLIN (Reuters) - Italian biotech ReiThera is in early talks with the European Union about supplying the bloc with its potential COVID-19 vaccine, a source close to the company said, the latest attempt by Brussels to secure shots as the fight against the pandemic intensifies.
The discussions come as Brussels seeks to raise more money to shore up supplies of potential inoculations amid concerns demand next year might exceed supply.
The talks with ReiThera, which is developing a vaccine together with Germany's Leukocare and Belgium's Univercells, means the European Commission is now speaking with seven vaccine makers including Johnson & Johnson,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and CureVac about possible supply deals. 
On Friday, the European Commission reached an agreement with  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) and GSK to buy up to 300 million doses following one with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) for up to 400 million doses.
The source said ReiThera was in preliminary talks with the EU, but said the outcome remained unclear.
""We are negotiating, but we do not yet have news of the outcome of the negotiations,"" said the source, who declined to be identified due to the confidentiality of the discussions.
A spokesperson for the European Commision declined to comment on the status of its talks with drugmakers.
Leukocare said in a statement the consortium was currently negotiating with various governments and organisations and declined to give further details on the individual talks.
ReiThera declined to comment while Univercells did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
ReiThera is developing a vaccine based on a so-called non-replicating adenoviral vector. This is the same technology being used in the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
The single-dose vaccine, which uses a simian adenovirus that only appears in gorillas, is currently being tested on 90 volunteers in Italy in a phase I trial with results expected by the end of the year.

A phase 2/3 trial in countries with high rates of infection is planned to start in late 2020, depending on the outcome of the early-stage trial.

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",Norway wealth fund may move $50 billion into U.S. stocks from Europe,"By Terje Solsvik
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1.15 trillion sovereign wealth fund should shift more assets into the United States and Canada, while cutting its holdings in Europe, the country's minority government said on Monday.
The proposal to parliament follows an earlier recommendation by the Norwegian central bank, the fund's manager, and could add investments of $50 billion in U.S. stocks, a Reuters calculation showed based on government data.
""The changes we are proposing will ensure the investments better represent the distribution of value creation in listed companies globally,"" Minister of Finance Jan Tore Sanner said in a statement.
The world's largest sovereign fund has historically given a higher weighting in its portfolio to European stock markets, focusing on countries that Norway does the most trade with, and a lower weighting to those of North America.
It will continue to favour Europe however, the proposal showed, but to a lesser degree than in the past. A move to full neutrality would have shifted well over $100 billion out of Europe, according to finance ministry data. 
While the fund currently owns about 1.5% of all stocks globally, its ownership in Europe amounts to 2.6% of all listed shares while its holdings in the Americas is only just over 1%.
Despite its lower weighting, North America represented 41.6% of the fund's overall $760 billion stock market holdings at end-June and would rise to 48% under the amended framework, while Europe would decline to 26.5% from 33% currently.
The minority centre-right cabinet of Prime Minister Erna Solberg must seek approval from parliament for any major strategic shifts at the fund, a process that could take months to complete and which may involve making compromises.
The central bank has said its advice was not based on any particular view on future return in individual markets or regions.

The fund last rejigged its regional weighting in 2012 and has since reduced its exposure to European shares from 50% of the total equity holdings to 33.5% by the end of 2019.

Morgan's prominent bond index division has made a key rule change that could pave the way for some of the world's poorest countries struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic to receive Brady (NYSE:BRC) bond-style debt relief.
The bank's index arm said that from the end of next month ""credit enhanced"" bonds would become eligible for all its major emerging markets benchmarks. The indexes are tracked by hundreds of billions of dollars of investment cash globally.
""Once the rule goes into effect, debt instruments with credit enhancements in the form of (but not limited to) third-party guarantees from multilaterals, governments, banks, insurers, private creditors, etc. will be eligible for index inclusion, provided the extent of the guarantee is less than 50% of the debt obligation,"" a J.P. Morgan note dated Sept 18 said.
The structures being discussed to help lesser developed countries cope with the economic fallout from the COVID crisis include multilateral guarantees on all or a portion of their bonds, or linking them to high quality sovereign collateral such as U.S. government bonds. 
""The latter scenario offers many parallels to the circumstances dating back to the origin of the EM sovereign debt through Brady loans and the launch of the EMBI in the 1990s,"" J.P. Morgan added.
J.P. Morgan also made a number of other changes, including keeping bonds in its indexes until six months before they mature rather than 13 months previously.
Serbia remained on track to achieving index eligibility but would remain on 'Index Watch' until January 2021, it added. 

India is set to have to wait longer for inclusion, though, after investors surveyed by the bank cited ongoing issues with custody and settlement of bonds, legacy trading and other operational hurdles in the country.

""We have a shot at a record quarter for vehicle deliveries, but will have to rally hard to achieve it. This is the most number of vehicles per day that we've ever had to deliver,"" Musk said in the email seen by Reuters. 
""It's also extremely important that we keep factory output as high as possible over the remaining 10 days. This is vital for the California market.""
The quarter-end rallying cry has become a familiar theme in recent quarters at Tesla, with Musk calling on employees to quickly build and deliver vehicles at the end of the quarter to achieve specific targets.
Tesla's U.S. production, which was suspended from the end of March to early May due to the COVID-19 lockdown, has recovered in the current quarter.
Former Wall Street analyst and Tesla bull Gary Black on Sunday forecast 144,000 deliveries for the July to September quarter. Tesla's previous quarterly sales record was set in the fourth quarter of last year, when it delivered 112,000 vehicles.
In the second quarter this year, Tesla delivered 90,650 vehicles, beating analysts' estimates and shrugging off a factory shutdown that hurt its output.

The S&P 500 is down 7.3% since its Sept. 2 record, and the Nasdaq 100 has slid 12% as investors fret over the coming presidential election and a Congress that’s deadlocked over the next stimulus package.
“This month’s underperformance of U.S. assets affirms an anxiety that has existed for some time -- that the U.S. would generate the greatest and the widest range of wild cards this fall,” JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists led by John Normand wrote in a note Friday.
Developments Friday deepened the concerns. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed below their 50-day moving averages, a line that had previously offered good support. And the passing away of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg could mean the Senate will be so focused on a replacement that lawmakers won’t be able to agree on additional stimulus. U.S. equity futures sank on Monday, reflecting losses in European stocks.
While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq’s technical moves “were only slight ‘breaks,’” a pattern of lower lows in stock prices of large tech companies that have led the market in recent years is a bearish sign, said Matt Maley of Miller Tabak + Co. “It increases our confidence that we will indeed see another leg lower for the stock market before long.”
A delay in stimulus could boost the VIX and cause cyclical stocks to lag behind, as well as send rates and the U.S. dollar lower, according to Michael Purves, chief executive officer at Tallbacken Capital Advisors LLC. The prospect of a delayed election result could also boost implied volatility of gold as well as the VIX curve, he said.
The bearish outlook has coincided with U.S. equities entering a seasonally weak month, according to Bespoke Investment Group.
“September has historically been the worst month of the year, and it’s a month that is usually volatile as well. Given the recent action, it’s not the most positive backdrop for the weeks ahead,” Bespoke wrote in a blog Saturday.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Monday, with investors fretting about allegations the banking sector ignored warnings over potential illegal activities, soaring coronavirus cases and renewed political tensions.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 53 points, or 1.6%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 535 points, or 1.9%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 157 points, or 1.4%. 
The benchmark S&P 500 is on a three-week losing streak, closing Friday below its 50-day moving average for the first time since April. These major stock indexes are having their worst month since March.
The banking sector is expected to open sharply in the red following reports that some of the major names in the sector continued to do business for years with entities they had already flagged to regulators as being suspicious. 
Banks including  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) fell in European trade, and the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) are set to follow suit.
Adding to the woes are concerns emanating from Europe of a second wave of Covid-19 cases, with the U.K. talking about a second national lockdown. This hit local travel and leisure shares hard, and the likes of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Carnival (NYSE:CUK) and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) were sharply lower premarket.  
The U.S. reported 39,844 new coronavirus cases Sunday and was closing in on 200,000 deaths, and at least one more cycle of the virus is expected in the fall and winter, the U.S.’s former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to be questioned by lawmakers Tuesday on the need for more stimulus to shore up the U.S. economy’s recovery. 
This comes as the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg has resulted in fresh conflict over who nominates her replacement on the Supreme Court, souring the political climate and making compromise over a new stimulus bill more unlikely.
Elsewhere in corporate news, President Donald Trump said over the weekend he supported a deal in principle that would allow TikTok to continue to operate in the United States, helping Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), who will own stakes in the new U.S.-listed company.
Additionally, Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) stock was sharply lower after Trevor Milton, the founder of electric truck-maker, stepped down as chairman in the wake of fraud allegations.
Oil prices edged lower Monday despite another weather pattern emerging to threaten output in the Gulf of Mexico. However, the uptick of Covid-19 cases, not only in the U.S. but globally, remains a serious threat to the recovery of demand for oil.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $40.59 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.7% to $42.42.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1.3% to $1,937.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.1792.

AMSTERDAM/LONDON (Reuters) -  Unilever  NV (AS:UNA) shareholders approved plans to end the Anglo-Dutch company's dual-headed corporate structure and form a London-based entity, which it says will make dealmaking simpler.
The proposal was passed with 99.39% of shares voted, the maker of Dove soap, Surf detergent and Ben & Jerry's ice cream said during an online extraordinary shareholder meeting on Monday in the Netherlands.
Unilever wants to unify on Nov. 22, ending 90 years as a hybrid since Britain's soap-making Lever Brothers merged with Margarine Unie in the Netherlands. 
To go ahead the plan must also be approved by investors in Britain's Unilever Plc (L:ULVR), who are due to vote on Oct. 12. 
Unilever says its dual structure hampers its ability to conduct acquisitions and disposals quickly, such as the planned sale of its 3 billion euros per year tea business.
Such flexibility is key to Unilever's ambition to shift from slow-growing categories into higher-growth areas like premium beauty. Unilever said this will be become even more important as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Unification will put us on a level playing field with other companies and ensure that we are best positioned for future success,"" Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said.
Unilever began its push to restructure under previous management after a failed $143 billion takeover approach by Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) in 2017.
Tax and political considerations thwarted its first attempt to unify in Rotterdam in 2018, with concerns about a 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax and forced selling by some UK shareholders once Unilever was dropped from Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) index. The current plan will see Unilever Plc shares included in the Dutch AEX (AEX).
Britain's departure from the European Union gives some extra urgency, as a delay beyond this year could mean additional scrutiny from EU and British regulators.
Chief Executive Alan Jope said Unilever would press on despite a proposal from a Dutch opposition party to impose an ""exit tax"" if it quits the Netherlands.
Jope repeated that the tax proposal, which could cost it up to 11 billion euros, is at an early stage and Unilever believes it would violate international law.
However, he said Unilever could always cancel the merger up to the moment of a high court approval hearing if the law were passed. Unilever says such a tax would be a reason to stop the unification.

Unilever shares were down 1.5% at 0955 GMT in Amsterdam.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Hedge funds see opportunity in battered New York, San Francisco apartment markets","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, as businesses across the country urged employees to work from home, rents plunged in New York City, San Francisco and other densely-populated cities.
Still, prominent hedge funds, including D1 Capital Partners and Long Pond Capital and mutual fund giants Capital Group and T. Rowe Price, purchased shares in the second quarter in companies that rent residential real estate in urban markets, buying in at beaten-down levels and possibly betting on a faster rebound than Wall Street forecast.
Now, nearly three months later, shares of real estate trusts that specialize in urban apartment rentals are down more than the broader real estate sector and the benchmark S&P 500 stock index for the year-to-date and since the March market rout. 
Shares of Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR), founded by billionaire Sam Zell, are up 7% since the March low, AvalonBay Communities (NYSE:AVB), which owns the Avalon Morningside Park with views of Manhattan, and UDR are up 26% and 14%, respectively, while the S&P 500 is up 48%. 
""The next three to five years are going to be very challenging,"" said Jonathan Litt, whose hedge fund Land & Buildings Investment Management concentrates on real estate. ""The key is to stay alive until 2025 in these markets.""
Shortly after funds like Dan Sundheim's D1 initiated a new position with 3.5 million shares in AvalonBay, Zimmer Partners put on a new position with 2.7 million shares in UDR and John Khoury's Long Pond Capital added to its position in EQR during the second quarter that ended on June 30, the outlook darkened.
Representatives for the funds declined to comment.
In July, Manhattan apartment rents dropped by more than 10% and the number of available units jumped to its highest level in more than a decade, according to StreetEasy, a listings website. Median rents in San Francisco have fallen 14.1% from last year, according to tracking firm Zumper.
Citing cellphone data tracked by Descartes (NASDAQ:DSGX) Labs, the New York Times reported that 420,000 people left New York City during the height of the coronavirus epidemic in the city, which was one of the early epicenters in the United States. 
Hedge fund executives and analysts also pointed to rising crime rates as one reason for occupancy and rent drops. According to official police statistics https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/stay-safe/crime-data/crime-dashboard, burglaries in San Francisco are up 42.3% for the year so far, while burglaries were up 21.7% in New York City https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/pr0902/nypd-citywide-crime-statistics-august-2020 in August compared with the year before. 
At the same time, experts say the trend to work from home is here to stay, which means people will be comfortable living further from cities. 
Jason Yablon, senior portfolio manager on the U.S. REITs team at mutual fund manager Cohen & Steers, said the number of people working from home could reach 15%, even after a vaccine for the coronavirus is developed, a five-fold increase from the pre-pandemic period. Cohen & Steers was one of the top sellers of several apartment REITs last quarter, unloading 9.8 million shares in Equity Residential, 7.5 million shares in UDR, and 2 million shares in AvalonBay, regulatory filings show. 
URBAN COMEBACK 
But some fund managers are not convinced that cities are dead and note that big employers like banks are already trying to bring people back into offices, something that would mean residential real estate won’t lay fallow for long.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has laid out plans for workers in its corporate and investment banking divisions to spend more time back in the office, reducing the amount of work from home but not eliminating it.
""We think that, overall, the fear is probably worse than the reality. There's more pain to go perhaps, but we see a lot of value in these stocks over the next one to three years,"" said George Taras, an analyst at mutual fund manager Baron Capital.
Hedge funds agreed, at least a few months ago. Hedge funds bought 7.4 million shares of EQR during the second quarter, regulatory filings and data from research firm Symmetric.io show.
At the end of the quarter they owned 10.9 million shares in EQR. Overall, all holders sold a total of 8.9 million shares, reducing investors' holding to 315 million shares.
At AvalonBay, hedge funds raised their ownership by 5.8 million shares to 8.75 million shares during the second quarter, making up a small portion of the total 129 million shares held.
City real estate companies may also appeal to investors for their value as potential takeover targets. 
""There is a lot of private capital that wants to buy apartments,"" Land & Buildings' Litt said.
While these companies are still nursing losses, investors note they have recovered from levels seen in March and they may wait to see how the economy recovers. 

""People are feeling comfortable with earnings reports and rent reports, so there is little reason to sell especially as their dividends are very attractive compared to 10-year Treasuries,"" said Michael Ashner, an investor and chairman of Winthrop Capital Advisors.

1225,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 05:42AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Days Without a European Bank Stock Disaster – Zero,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It never rains, but it pours. As if Europe’s bank stocks didn’t have enough problems with zero or negative interest rates and mounting bad loans, another investigative journalism expose runs their name through the mud with allegations of illicit payments.
The fresh dump of files, leaked from the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), paints a familiarly depressing picture of global finance doing too little to stop global organized crime.
Much of the leaked data is either historical, or builds upon abuses and shortcomings in banks’ anti-money-laundering processes that were already known: HSBC (LON:HSBA), which has grabbed headlines for its stock hitting a 25-year low on Monday morning, told the Financial Times that all the information contained in the FinCEN papers predated its 2017 settlement with U.S. authorities, which suggests that it faces little in the way of fresh punishment from the disclosures.
By contrast, some of what has come out is genuinely new and creates genuine risks for banks and their investors. Dutch giant  ING Groep  (AS:INGA), notably, fell 7.7% after the papers showed its Polish subsidiary involved in transferring hundreds of millions of dollars out of eastern Europe in a manner similar to the “mirror trades” made by Deutsche Bank’s Russian office. At least two of the ING employees named in the paper were former  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) employees.
The problem for ING is that it’s less than two years since it was clobbered with a $900 million fine for money-laundering. Given the Dutch state’s track record, fears of further penalties seem only too well-founded.
HSBC’s problems, by contrast, have less to do with the FinCEN revelations than with a second report over the weekend, namely that the Chinese government is preparing to put it on its list of “unreliable entities”.  According to updated provisions published by China’s Commerce Department, that would expose it to sanctions up to an including a ban on investing in China, and banning its staff from entering the country.
Such an outcome would be a disaster for HSBC, given how it needs China to bail out struggling units in the U.K., U.S. and Europe. The Asia region generated $7.3 billion in pretax profit in the first half, while globally it made a profit of only $4.3 billion.
HSBC has always been exposed to China risk, but investors’ core assumption has always been that it could protect itself against the worst by structuring its business through Hong Kong, using the former British colony's special status as a bridge between China and the West. That assumption is no longer valid since the introduction of Hong Kong’s new security law, which led the U.S. to declare that the “Special Autonomous Region” is no longer autonomous, and thus no longer special.
None of this is new and, in fairness, reports about HSBC’s place on the ‘unreliable entities’ have bubbled up before at times of particularly acute tension between the U.S. and China, without coming to much. However, it does represent the crystallization of risks that are all too well-known, and which have already made sure that HSBC shares haven’t enjoyed even the slightest bounce since the global market panic in March.
The grim truth is that the bank is being ground up between two antagonistic superpowers, and nothing suggests that it has the answers to protect its current generation of shareholders."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. app maker Blix on Monday took its fight against Apple (O:AAPL) to Europe as it laid out its grievances against the iPhone maker to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, saying that Apple is not playing fair.
Blix's criticism came amid Vestager's ongoing investigation into Apple's App Store and mobile payment system Apple Pay as she moves to curb the power of online gatekeepers on which thousands of companies depend for business.
Blix previously sued Apple for excluding its BlueMail product from the Mac app store, accusing the company of infringing its patented technology and abusing its dominance in the app store.
Apple, which subsequently allowed BlueMail back in the digital shop, had cited security issues for the exclusion.
""It is clear to us that Apple is not playing fair,"" Blix founder Ben Volach wrote in a letter to Vestager seen by Reuters.
""In writing this letter, we are trying to dispel a misconception perpetrated by Apple. The App Store is not a level playing field; developers are not treated equally when they compete with Apple's own apps. Our own experience bears this out,"" he said.
Volach urged Vestager, who will announce by the end of the year tough new rules known as the Digital Services Act to make U.S. tech giants play fair, to look deeper into Apple's actions.
""They mask Apple's ambition to fully control this essential marketplace and distribution channel in order to maintain its apps' dominance to its competitors' disadvantage,"" he said.
U.S. social media giant Facebook (O:FB) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) recently voiced concerns about Apple's App Store rules, which the European Commission said it was aware of.

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",EU agency recommends AstraZeneca-Merck drug Lynparza for two cancers,"By Aakash B and Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) - The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended approval for Lynparza in patients with a form of prostate cancer and as a first-line maintenance treatment for a form of advanced ovarian cancer, the British drugmaker AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) said on Monday.
Prostate cancer is the second-most common type of cancer in men worldwide, while ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in Europe.
The EMA recommendation follows positive regulatory updates for Lynparza, which AstraZeneca (L:AZN) has developed with  Merck & Co  Inc (N:MRK) as it faces competition from British rival GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) on cancer drugs.
Lynparza became the first marketed PARP drug with a U.S. approval for ovarian cancer in 2014. PARP inhibitors are a growing focus for drug research, with potential for use in breast, lung and prostate cancers.
Last week, GSK's cancer treatment Zejula, which is also a PARP inhibitor, won positive recommendation from the EU watchdog as a first option to keep advanced ovarian cancer at bay in women who have responded to chemotherapy.
Zejula competes with rival PARP inhibitors, a class of treatments that work by blocking enzymes involved in repairing damaged DNA, thereby helping kill cancer cells, from AstraZeneca and  Clovis Oncology  (O:CLVS).
Monday's recommendation for approval from the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CMPH) comes after Lynparza won EU approval in July for treating a form of pancreatic cancer.
While final approvals are up to the European Commission, it generally follows the CHMP's recommendation and endorses them within a couple of months.

AstraZeneca also said it is exploring additional trials in metastatic prostate cancer for Lynparza, and expects to publish data on a separate late-stage trial in the second half of 2021.

At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 2% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 2.5%.
Shares in HSBC (LON:HSBA), the largest bank in Europe by total assets, fell 3.9%, to its lowest level since 2009, after being accused of moving large sums of allegedly illicit funds over nearly two decades by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) was also implicated, and it dropped 3.4%, with Europe's banking sector, already down about 40% this year, falling sharply as a consequence.
Elsewhere, German telecom  Drillisch  (DE:DRIG), and its parent  United Internet  (DE:UTDI), slumped over 20% after it warned that an increase in the cost of its network access deal with Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) Deutschland (DE:O2Dn) would hit profits this year.
Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) dropped 10% after the engineering company warned late Friday that it was considering an equity raise of up to 2.5 billion pounds to strengthen its balance sheet.
Europe's travel and leisure index was also hard hit: British-Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) dropped 11%, easyJet (LON:EZJ) 9% and Ryanair (LON:RYA) 6%, as the U.K. moves toward a second national lockdown. New restrictions in Spain and other European countries are also spreading, after the number of Covid-19 cases rose sharply in recent weeks.
Economic numbers in Europe have shown a rebound of late, enough to prompt the European Central Bank to revise upwards its growth forecast for 2020 at its policy meeting earlier this month. The ECB is reportedly set to review its bond-buying activities to give its other programs the same flexibility as the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, its main tool for supporting the economy through the pandemic.

1233,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",Apple Court Triumph Forces Tough Choice for EU’s Tax Crusade,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) July court triumph over a massive European Union back-tax order is forcing antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager to make a tough choice: Challenge a ruling that faulted the EU investigation or accept judges’ criticisms and re-examine a case started more than six years ago.
Her dilemma about whether to appeal before a late-September deadline shows how court rebukes have bogged down probes that were once swift and lethal. The EU targeted big names, triggering changes to taxation across Europe. The 13 billion-euro ($15.4 billion) demand for Apple was its crowning achievement.
“The European Commission may very likely appeal the judgment of the General Court in the Apple case, if only to save face,” said Howard Liebman, a tax attorney with Jones Day in Brussels. “It will be a very rough row to hoe, given the very detailed and fact-oriented decision“ from the EU’s second-highest tribunal.
If Vestager opts to fight on at the EU Court of Justice, the bloc’s top tribunal, she risks overlooking criticism that the EU failed to prove “to the requisite legal standard” that Ireland’s tax deal broke state-aid law by giving the iPhone maker an unfair advantage.
The commission, the EU’s executive arm, has already had to re-investigate some 40 probes following court decisions that picked apart its findings. That includes a case into Dutch tax arrangements for  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). and 39 investigations into Belgian tax pacts with companies including branches of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA, BASF SE (OTC:BASFY) and British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) Plc.
At a Friday press conference in Brussels, Vestager refused to be drawn on her next moves in the Apple tax case.
“We haven’t taken that decision yet,” she said. “As the commission always does, we wait until we’re closer to the deadline of the appeal question” before commenting.
The speed at which some of these early cases were concluded -- the first Belgian investigation took 11 months and Starbucks took 16 months -- doesn’t match the current pace. The EU has been probing Inter Ikea’s Dutch tax arrangements since December 2017 and even extended the scope of the case in April. An investigation into Huhtamaki Oyj’s deal with Luxembourg started in March 2019 and one into  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE).’s tax treatment in the Netherlands began in January 2019.
The commission said in a statement that the pace of its state aid probes can vary, depending on the complexity of the cases or the information its staff has to go through. In some cases, the EU watchdog also “had to wait for important guidance from the European courts with respect to its investigations.”
Despite the EU’s many setbacks, judges haven’t questioned regulators’ ability to use state-aid law to probe individual tax agreements.​ ​And the commission said that “as part of its fight against aggressive tax planning” it will continue to review such tax rulings offered by governments to businesses.
But the greater victory for the EU crackdown on corporate tax evasion has been outside the courtroom.
Nations have slowly closed loopholes and ended structures that allowed multinational companies to cut their fiscal liabilities. A global push for more tax transparency was fueled in 2014 by the so-called Luxleaks revelations by a group of investigative reporters, who published thousands of pages detailing secret tax arrangements between Luxembourg and multinational companies including Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).’s Skype and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc.
“One could say that the commission lost the battle, but won the war,” said Liebman. “By commencing action in this area, the commission did highlight the defects in the international tax regime that allowed such planning to take place and escape sanction.”

1235,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 03:18AM ET</span>",Walmart Aims to End Emissions From Global Operations by 2040,"(Bloomberg) -- Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. said it’s targeting zero emissions from its global operations by 2040, a small fraction of its total, in the latest climate-focused step amid heightened calls from investors and activists to reduce carbon footprints.
The world’s biggest retailer also plans to secure enough wind, solar and other renewable energy sources to power its facilities with 100% green power by 2035, it said in a statement Monday. It had previously said that it aims to secure half of its power from renewable sources by 2025.
Walmart is committing to cutting emissions from it own operations, known as Scope 1 and 2. Though not an easy task, the target will zero out merely 5% of its total emissions. The retailing giant has put in some efforts through so-called Project Gigaton to address Scope 3 emissions, which are generated by its suppliers and customers, but the company has yet to set a net-zero target across all scopes.
The company also said Monday it aims to electrify and eliminate emissions from all of its vehicles, including long-haul trucks, by 2040. As well, it plans to manage or restore at least 50 million acres of land and one million square miles of ocean by 2030, and transition to low-impact refrigerants for cooling and electrified equipment for heating in its stores, clubs, and data and distribution centers by 2040.
Walmart is a member of a the We Mean Business Coalition, a group of companies that committed to reduce emissions in line with the goals set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts have identified at least 58 companies that have pledged to reach net-zero emissions by various dates through 2040, such as  Estee Lauder  Companies Inc (NYSE:EL)., Sony Corp (T:6758)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Monday, amid fears that an uptick in coronavirus cases causing fresh lockdowns will stifle the region’s nascent economic recovery.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 2%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.7%.
On Sunday, U.K. health minister Matt Hancock warned that the country was at a tipping point regarding Covid-19 as the number of cases have risen sharply in recent weeks. He suggested that a second national lockdown could be imposed if people don't follow government rules designed to stop the spread of the virus.
However, the U.K. is not alone in seeing cases rise sharply, with several countries across Europe--including France, Spain, Greece and Denmark--having already announced new coronavirus restrictions in some of their largest cities.
""We have a very serious situation unfolding before us,” Dr. Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation's regional director for Europe said last week. “Weekly cases have now exceeded those reported when the pandemic first peaked in Europe in March.""
Economic numbers in Europe have shown a rebound of late, enough to prompt the European Central Bank to revise upwards its growth forecast for 2020 at its policy meeting earlier this month. 
That said, these new localised lockdowns are likely to have an impact on sentiment, meaning the key focus this week will be updates on the September confidence readings through the flash PMIs and the German Ifo, on Wednesday and Thursday.
In corporate news, banking giant HSBC (LON:HSBA) is likely to be in the spotlight Monday after slumping in Asian trading, with its shares falling to the lowest level since 1995.
HSBC, along with Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), is one of the banks accused of moving large sums of allegedly illicit funds over nearly two decades by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) will also be in focus after the pharma giant said on Saturday that its Covid-19 vaccine trial in the United States was still on hold, after a safety event was reported in its U.K. trial two weeks ago.
Oil prices edged lower Monday despite another weather pattern emerging to threaten output in the Gulf of Mexico. In what has been an active hurricane season, Tropical Storm Beta has prompted some oil producers to evacuate offshore platforms in the region, just as they had been restarting their operations in the wake of Hurricane Sally.
However, the uptick of Covid-19 cases, not only in Europe but globally, remains a serious threat to the recovery of demand for oil.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $41.09 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.75% to $42.92.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,956.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1862."
1239,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 01:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Shell launches major cost-cutting drive to prepare for energy transition,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) is looking to slash up to 40% off the cost of producing oil and gas in a major drive to save cash so it can overhaul its business and focus more on renewable energy and power markets, sources told Reuters.
Shell's new cost-cutting review, known internally as Project Reshape and expected to be completed this year, will affect its three main divisions and any savings will come on top of a $4 billion target set in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.
Reducing costs is vital for Shell's plans to move into the power sector and renewables where margins are relatively low. Competition is also likely to intensify with utilities and rival oil firms including BP (NYSE:BP) and Total all battling for market share as economies around the world go green.
""We had a great model but is it right for the future? There will be differences, this is not just about structure but culture and about the type of company we want to be,"" said a senior Shell source, who declined to be named.
Last year, Shell's overall operating costs came to $38 billion and capital spending totalled $24 billion.
Shell is exploring ways to reduce spending on oil and gas production, its largest division known as upstream, by 30% to 40% through cuts in operating costs and capital spending on new projects, two sources involved with the review told Reuters.
Shell now wants to focus its oil and gas production on a few key hubs, including the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria and the North Sea, the sources said.
The company's integrated gas division, which runs Shell's liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations as well as some gas production, is also looking at deep cuts, the sources said.
For downstream, the review is focusing on cutting costs from Shell's network of 45,000 service stations - the world's biggest - which is seen as one its ""most high-value activities"" and is expected to play a pivotal role in the transition, two more sources involved with the review told Reuters.
""We are undergoing a strategic review of the organisation, which intends to ensure we are set up to thrive throughout the energy transition and be a simpler organisation, which is also cost competitive. We are looking at a range of options and scenarios at this time, which are being carefully evaluated,"" a spokeswoman for Shell said in a statement. 
Graphic - Shell's operating costs: https://graphics.reuters.com/SHELL-COSTS/oakpeoralpr/chart.png
Shell's restructuring drive mirrors moves in recent months by European rivals BP and Eni which both plan to reduce their focus on oil and gas in the coming decade and build new low-carbon businesses.
The review, which company sources say is the largest in Shell's modern history, is expected to be completed by the end of 2020 when Shell wants to announce a major restructuring. It will hold an investor day in February 2021.
Speaking to analysts on July 30, Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said Shell had launched a programme to ""redesign"" the Anglo-Dutch company.
LOW-CARBON FUELS
Teams in Shell's three main divisions are also studying how to reshape the business by cutting thousands of jobs and removing management layers both to save money and create a nimbler company as it prepares to restructure, the sources said.
Shell, which had 83,000 employees at the end of 2019, carried out a major cost-cutting drive after its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group 2016, which has helped boost its cash generation significantly in recent years.
Shell's operating costs, which include production, manufacturing, sales, distribution, administration and research and development expenses, fell by 15%, or roughly $7 billion, between 2014 and 2017.
But the sharp global economic slowdown in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic coupled with Shell's plans to slash its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 have led to the new push.
Shell cut its 2020 capital expenditure plans by $5 billion to $20 billion in the wake of the collapse in oil and gas prices due to the pandemic amid warnings it could have lasting effects on global energy demand.
Van Beurden said in July that Shell was on track to deliver $3 billion to $4 billion in cost savings by the end of March 2021, including through job cuts and suspending bonuses.
He said travel restrictions during the pandemic had accelerated the digitalisation of Shell while machine learning was being rolled out to minimise outages and shorten maintenance time at refineries, oil and gas platforms and LNG plants.
Besides cutting costs at its downstream retail business, Shell is pressing ahead with plans to reduce the number of its oil refineries to 10 from 17 last year. It has already agreed to sell three.

The review of refining operations also includes finding ways to sharply increase the production of low-carbon fuels such biofuels, chemicals and lubricants. That could be done by using low-carbon raw materials such as cooking oil, one source said.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>","Last in, first out: Female pilots bear brunt of airline job cuts","By Tracy Rucinski, Jamie Freed and Allison Lampert
CHICAGO/SYDNEY/MONTREAL (Reuters) - When Megyn Thompson landed her dream job as a commercial pilot last year, she was one of thousands being recruited globally to boost the number of women in the cockpit and meet record pilot demand.
Now an industry-wide campaign to recruit more female aviators is under threat, dealing a blow to efforts to overhaul the male-dominated airline sector as the coronavirus crisis transforms a shortage into a pilot surplus. (reut.rs/2FM3iWc)
In the United States alone, the top two airlines are set to furlough more than 3,000 pilots when government stimulus expires this month, and a disproportionate number of those are women.
Under layoff agreements between airlines and unions, junior pilots lose their jobs before senior ones, regardless of gender, race or age.
These ""Last In, First Out"" labour deals at many Western airlines mean the most recent hires are the first to go. 
And those new hires include a higher percentage of women than in the past, the International Society of Women Airline Pilots (ISWAP) said.
Thompson, who flies with a regional carrier owned by American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), is among at least 600 female pilots in the United States who will be furloughed on Oct. 1 unless there is more government payroll aid or last-minute union deals.
Thompson, 32, said her low seniority ranking puts her ""smack-dab in the middle"" of a furlough at American's PSA affiliate, which expects to cut about 35% of its pilots. 
""If you go back 40 years ago it was a man's world through and through, so there are not a lot of women at the top who are protected from this furlough,"" said Thompson, who decided not to have biological children as she built flying hours for her license.""PSA is not letting (me) Megyn go because they don't like her. It's zero to do with that and 100% to do with, if you're the last in, you're the first out."" 
Now the mother of three adopted children is applying for jobs at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kellogg (NYSE:K) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP).
CAMPAIGN ON HOLD
Before the crisis, global air travel was growing at a record 5% a year, generating a need for 804,000 pilots over the next 20 years, based on Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co estimates. The need for more pilots had pushed female recruitment to the top of the agenda.
But a shattered post-COVID industry does not expect traffic to regain 2019 levels and start growing again before 2024.
""This year we were meant to launch a great big campaign which we have just put on hold because of what has happened,"" said Australian pilot Davida Forshaw, who heads education and outreach at ISWAP.
Despite the female recruitment campaign, just 5.3% of airline pilots globally were women before the coronavirus crisis, ISWAP data shows. That percentage is set to drop again as airlines carry out furlough plans, the group predicts.
At American and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), women make up around 5.2% of the combined pilot population of about 27,800 and 6.7% of the 3,645 pilots whom those airlines expect to furlough, according to numbers provided by their main pilot unions.
American Airlines declined to comment directly on the issue, but a spokesman said the union data implied that the proportion of female pilots would slip post-furloughs to 4.9% from 5.1%.
Delta said it was in discussions with unions on pilot departures but did not give a breakdown by gender.
INDUSTRY SETBACK
The shakeout is potentially damaging for an industry already struggling to improve its diversity credentials, with an even tinier fraction of top management jobs held by women.
Boosting female pilot employment has become a key goal after the industry was criticised last year by airline executives of paying ""lip-service"" to diversity. (reut.rs/3cizNaQ)
The drive has also been at the leading edge of social change in countries such as India, which has the highest proportion of female commercial pilots in the world at 12%, despite a society that typically frowns on women in such jobs. (reut.rs/3hXs5Vk)
Aside from female pilots being furloughed, many others have decided to take early retirement or lost jobs as airlines went bust.
Australia's first-ever female commercial pilot, Captain Deborah Lawrie, who broke through the glass ceiling at Ansett in 1980, was one of 220 pilots laid off in April when budget airline Tigerair Australia closed.
Only one-quarter of female pilots globally are captains, according to ISWAP data.
Tammie Jo Shults, hailed as a hero after she calmly landed a stricken Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) flight in 2018, is among the female captains taking early retirement.
The need to balance family and work in a profession with frequent absences from home has already made it a challenge to attract female pilots. Shults said the more uncertain career prospects because of COVID will make it more difficult.
Still, Shults, who served as one of the first female fighter pilots in the U.S. Navy, urged women to consider alternatives like becoming firefighting pilots before giving up on aviation.

""You can’t always follow your passion, but don’t leave it behind,"" she said.

1241,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 12:23AM ET</span>","HSBC, Standard Chartered See Shares Slump Over FinCen Reports Leak","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – HSBC and  Standard Chartered  (OTC:SCBFF) saw their shares slump on Monday, with HSBC shares seeing their lowest level since 1995, over accusations of moving large sums of reportedly illicit funds of over $2 trillion between 1995 and 2017, despite red flags over their origin.
HSBC's Hong Kong shares (HK:0005) slumped 2.91% to HK$30.05, ($3.88), while Standard Chartered saw its Hong Kong shares (HK:2888) fall 2.69% to HK$36.20, ($4.67), by 12:19 AM ET (5:19 AM GMT).
The accusation was made using suspicious activity reports (SARs), filed by banks and other financial institutions with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) upon suspicion of financial crime. More than 2,100 SARs were leaked in 2019 to BuzzFeed News, and forwarded in turn to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
HSBC and Standard Chartered are among five banks mentioned most frequently in the SARs.
The SARs also highlighted the challenges faced by regulatory and financial institutions in their battle against money laundering. HSBC and Standard Chartered, as well as other global banks, have already paid billions of dollars in fines over the past few years for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and anti-money laundering rules.
HSBC went on the defensive on Sunday, saying “all of the information provided by the ICIJ is historical,” and added that as of 2012, “HSBC embarked on a multi-year journey to overhaul its ability to combat financial crime across more than 60 jurisdictions.”
Meanwhile Standard Chartered was more contrite in its own statement, which said, “We take our responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously and have invested substantially in our compliance programs.”"
1242,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 12:09AM ET</span>","With Gold Rallying, Mining CEOs Say ESG Scrutiny Is Intensifying","(Bloomberg) -- Skyrocketing gold is providing a welcome windfall to the mining industry, but it’s also attracting a broader base of investors who are demanding greater attention to environmental, social and governance topics.
Interest in ESG issues has moved to the forefront in conversations with stakeholders in the past year, top executives said in the run-up to the Denver Gold Group’s Americas conference, a key annual event in the precious-metals world. Such talks come as investors snap up billions of dollars in stock offerings from once-shunned gold miners.
Generalists are looking at bullion because of the high prices and “the strong argument that the gold price can go higher,” according to Sean Boyd, chief executive officer of Agnico Eagle (NYSE:AEM) Mines Ltd., a top-10 gold producer. And those investors tend to judge mining companies through an ESG lens.
“They don’t want to take a lot of risk, and a big part of the risk assessment is the ESG side of things,” Boyd said in a phone interview.
The Denver conference, which began Sunday and is being held virtually, is also expected to generate discussions about fiscal responsibility, given gold’s near-30% rise this year, and how much free cash flow should go to shareholders. But ESG is the one issue that can rile up investors and miners even more than cash.
“Often it’s the first, and sometimes the only, discussion when we’re meeting with investors in Europe,” Tom Palmer, CEO of top producer Newmont Corp., said by phone. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, many times “the only topic of discussion was around carbon intensity and the work that’s being done to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.”
Like any extractive industry, mining by its nature damages the environment. Companies also come into conflict with local communities or raise the ire of shareholders on corporate governance issues. In an open letter to the mining industry released Sunday, prominent gold investors targeted issues including executive compensation and directors who don’t have enough skin in the game.
But unlike miners of copper or battery-metals, for instance, gold producers may face more skepticism from ESG-minded investors. That’s because gold, which is mainly used to produce jewelry and acts as a store of value in bars and coins -- has less utility in advancing a green economy.
“Gold’s an odd thing because most of it sits in vaults around the world gathering dust,”  B2Gold  (NYSE:BTG) Corp. CEO Clive Johnson said by phone.
Gold miners nonetheless can reach the highest ESG standards, Johnson said, and a company’s success should be “defined by your community relations, your safety at your mines, the things you do for your employees.” The gold-mining industry has shown its worth during the Covid-19 health crisis by helping local communities, continuing to work responsibly and keeping people employed, he said.
Checkered Reputation
Still, the sector has had to overcome a sometimes checkered reputation on environmental, social and management issues. And high-profile incidents in and outside the gold-mining industry have stymied the rehabilitation process. High gold prices boost the appeal to dig for gold and threaten to increase illegal operations.
ESG has really “taken a spotlight” in the past five years, said Jon Lamb, a portfolio manager at Orion Resource Partners. Events like the fatal Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) tailings-dam disaster in Brazil in 2019 or the destruction of Aboriginal heritage sites at a Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Group mine in Australia this year have made such issues even more prominent.
“All these items put a very vivid image for people in the sector, people outside the sector, as to what the damage could be from mining,” Lamb said by phone.
For Newmont’s Palmer, the most important part of ESG is governance.
“That G should almost be at the front of the acronym,” he said. “Strong governance is the essential foundation in order to be able to support sustainable environmental and social performance.”

1243,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 20, 2020 11:36PM ET</span>",ByteDance Asserts Control of TikTok and Contests $5 Billion Fee,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd. emphasized it will remain in control of a hived-off TikTok Global business, appearing to contradict President Donald Trump’s statements about how the new entity will be directed by Americans and pay an unusual $5 billion fee to the U.S. government.
The world’s most valuable startup sought to play down speculation it’s giving up control of valuable Chinese technology and assets after striking a deal with  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. to create TikTok Global. ByteDance will retain full control of its prized social media algorithms and allow Oracle only limited access to view source code for “safety” purposes, the company said in a statement posted to its domestic news service Toutiao Monday.
Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will join TikTok’s board. But ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming and the Chinese company’s current directors -- which include Sequoia China’s Neil Shen and General Atlantic’s William Ford -- will reprise their roles. The statement made no mention of Oracle getting a seat, even though ByteDance said Larry Ellison’s company is slated to own 12.5% after a round of funding before TikTok Global goes public within a year. Walmart and Oracle have said American citizens will take up four of the five board seats for TikTok Global.
In a blog post entitled “clarifying groundless rumors about TikTok,” ByteDance contested Trump’s assertions his government will get $5 billion as part of the deal. It said that figure was just an estimate of the amount of taxes TikTok Global would pay over several years if the business proved successful.
TikTok has emerged as a top target in Trump’s effort to crack down on China ahead of the November U.S. elections. Tensions between Washington and Beijing are escalating as his administration wages a campaign that’s also ensnared Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd., whose WeChat app faces a similar ban.
ByteDance’s statement raises more questions over an arrangement cobbled together over just a few weeks to prevent the banning of the popular social video platform, which the White House accuses of spying on Americans and potentially influencing the elections. The Chinese company is seeking a valuation of $60 billion for TikTok Global, in which ByteDance may end up owning as much as 80% after Oracle and Walmart invest.
Trump has previously said the White House deserves a cut of the deal for making it possible. On Saturday, he said the companies agreed to pay $5 billion to bankroll an education fund that would teach American children “the real history of our country.” TikTok will pay more than $5 billion in “new tax dollars to the U.S. Treasury” and develop an AI-driven online video curriculum, according to a joint announcement from Oracle and Walmart.
But ByteDance said the promised tax payment had nothing to do with the deal.
“As for the so-called $5 billion tax to the U.S. Treasury, that refers to an estimate of the corporate income tax and other taxes TikTok will have to pay in coming years as part of its business development,” ByteDance added. “TikTok is confident in its future but the actual tax amount will have to be determined in accordance with the actual state of the business and American tax structures.”
While Trump is portraying the agreement as a victory, the business remains under Chinese control. ByteDance said Monday Oracle -- which won the right as part of the transaction to review TikTok’s source code for security threats -- will only review the software in a controlled environment. ByteDance cited past examples such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).’s transparency center in China, which lets experts review code in a designated location only.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to testify before the U.S. Congress later in the week to discuss U.S. COVID-relief efforts, with investors also looking out for progress on the latest COVID-19 stimulus package.
Some investors struck a pessimistic note.
“We do have concerns down the stretch about the markets reacting poorly to some of the uncertainties facing us -the election, potentially around Covid-19, and the fact that we don’t have a stimulus package yet,” Riverfront Investment Group senior market strategist Rebecca Felton told Bloomberg.
“I would have to think we could be volatile to the downside here.”
But other investors remained more optimistic, despite global equity valuations hovering close to an almost two-decade high. With fund flow data showing that money is continuing to move into U.S. stocks and the Fed pledging near-zero interest rates for years to come, they expect profits to moderately recover from the effects of COVID-19.
“We’ve been reasonably optimistic toward the equity market for quite some time,” Tribeca Investment Partners fund manager Jun Bei Liu told Bloomberg.
“The fundamental economic recovery seems to be on track. Over the next 6-12 months we do see substantial earnings improvement.”"

China is also the world's largest market for new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include battery electric vehicles as well as plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.
While previous policies to support NEV makers had offered subsidies on sales, the fresh rollout will require local governments and companies to build a more mature supply chain and business model for the industry. 
Local governments and companies need to prove their joint projects are able to lower the price of hydrogen fuel, increase the number of hydrogen-charging stations, enlarge hydrogen fuel cell vehicle fleets and improve related technologies, according to the document.
Authorities will offer rewards to the projects after an assessment of these key performance areas, the ministry said.
The rollout comes a few days after Reuters reported that China's policymakers and the government may publish a fresh policy, citing people familiar with the matter.
China has over 7,000 hydrogen vehicles, compared with over 4 million pure battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.
Global automakers including Toyota Motor (T:7203) and  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) have already announced launch plans for hydrogen vehicles in China.

1246,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 20, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>","Goldman Says Value, Not Cyclicals, Would Rally Most on Vaccine","(Bloomberg) -- Value shares are a better way to bet on a Covid-19 vaccine than cyclical stocks, even though the latter have gained favor for capturing the trade, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Value shares beat their growth counterparts by more than 3 percentage points over the Aug. 22 to Sept. 8 period, when the chances of a vaccine available by the first quarter of 2021 jumped to about 70% from around 40%, Goldman strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Friday. Cyclical shares underperformed defensive ones, they said.
Value stocks tend to have short-duration cash flows, so will outperform as rates rise, while cyclicals and defensives have similar durations on average, Goldman said, to explain the lack of correlation with vaccine odds.
“The consensus view of investors is cyclicals will outperform when a vaccine is identified,” the strategists wrote. “However, the correlation of returns with the prospects for a vaccine suggest value rather than cyclicals is the better tactical expression of this view.”
Value stocks have underperformed growth for years, with the Russell 1000 Value Index up about 7% since the end of 2016 while the growth gauge has doubled. Many a strategist has called for a reversal in recent months, and while multiple moves in that direction failed to generate much momentum, this month may be different as tech high-fliers suffer a pullback.
Food, beverage and tobacco is the sector that has the highest correlation with vaccine odds, Goldman said. Technology, hardware and equipment, semiconductors and retailing are the most negatively correlated with vaccine optimism. Some traditionally cyclical industries like materials and capital goods are among the most correlated.
Vaccine catalysts may coincide with the upcoming U.S. election, which may also provide a tailwind to value in the near term, the strategists said.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2020 08:15PM ET</span>",World's top companies urge action on nature loss ahead of U.N. talks,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest companies on Monday backed growing calls for governments to do more to reverse the accelerating destruction of the natural world and support broader efforts to fight climate change.
More than 560 companies with combined revenues of $4 trillion including Walmart (N:WMT),  Citigroup  (N:C) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) signed up to a statement calling for action over the next decade.
The call comes as the United Nations prepares to host a biodiversity summit later this month, aiming to build momentum towards forging a new global pact to ward off threats to nature exemplified by recent fires in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and California.
While many of the companies said they were already taking steps to make their operations greener, governments needed to provide the policies that would allow them to do more. 
""Healthy societies, resilient economies and thriving businesses rely on nature. Governments must adopt policies now to reverse nature loss in this decade,"" the companies said in a statement. 
""Together let's protect, restore and sustainably use our natural resources,"" they added. Others to sign included IKEA,  Unilever  (L:ULVR) and AXA (PA:AXAF).
Business for Nature, the coalition which organised the statement, said it was the first time so many companies had issued a joint call emphasising the crucial role healthy ecosystems play in human well-being.
""Many businesses are making commitments and taking action. But for us all to live well within the planet's finite limits, we need to scale and speed up efforts now, not tomorrow,"" said Eva Zabey, executive director, Business for Nature. 
Last year the IPBES international panel of scientists said a million species were at risk of extinction. 

About two-thirds of the world's animals - mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles - have vanished over the last 50 years, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

ZURICH (Reuters) - LafargeHolcim (S:LHN) has committed to further reducing its carbon emissions by 2030, the world's largest cement maker said on Monday, as investors and customers increasingly demand companies curb their environmental impact.
The Swiss company wants to reduce the amount of CO2 produced for every tonne of cement it makes by 21% as part of the global goal to limit temperature change to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
It wants to reduce the CO2 created for every tonne of cement to 475 kg per tonne, down from its previous target of 520 kg. Last year the figure was 561 kg - equivalent to around 120 million tonnes of C02.
Investors are pushing companies to lower their emissions, with insurers and pensions funds taking environmental impact into account when making their investment decisions.
LafargeHolcim's shares have lost 11.2% over the past 12 months, underperforming the Stoxx construction and materials index which is 0.4% lower (SXOP)
""Investor concerns regarding carbon emissions are holding back LafargeHolcim shares quite significantly,"" said Bernd Pomrehn, an analyst at Bank Vontobel. 
""For sure the level of carbon emission is becoming an increasingly important topic for investors,"" Magali Anderson, chief sustainability officer at LafargeHolcim, told Reuters.
LafargeHolcim said it would increase the use of low carbon and carbon neutral cements it makes. It will reuse 100 million tonnes of waste to heat its kilns and also increase the amount of recycled materials in cements.
The goals will be monitored by Science Based Targets Initiative, a collaboration among green investment adviser CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature.
LafargeHolcim was taking the initiative to help protect the environment, but there were also good business reasons to do it, Anderson said.

Using alternative fuels instead of traditional fossil fuels was cheaper, while customer demand for low-carbon cement was rising, she said.

The call by Xavier Bertrand, a former minister who now leads the Hauts-de-France region, adds pressure on the government to prevent an outright closure of the facility, as the coronavirus pandemic batters confidence.
The Japanese tyre maker's announcement on Wednesday that it planned to close the Bethune plant, which employs 863 workers in Bertrand's northern region, drew swift government condemnation.
Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne is expected to visit the factory on Monday.
Bertrand, a conservative who served as health minister between 2005 and 2007 in the government of Nicolas Sarkozy, told Europe 1 radio ""everything must be done"" to avoid a closure - invoking a 2013 precedent in which Italy invested in a Bridgestone plant to avert closure and save 60% of its jobs.

Bertrand also stepped up his criticism of Macron in a separate interview with Le Parisien, declaring himself ""more determined than ever"" to challenge France's centrist incumbent in the next presidential election.

The ban on new U.S. downloads of the app, owned by China's ByteDance, could still be rescinded by President Donald Trump before it takes effect if the company seals a deal with  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) that addresses concerns about the security of users' data.
TikTok said that in its proposal to the U.S. government, it has already agreed to measures like ""third-party audits, verification of code security, and the US government oversight of US data security.""
The ban is in response to a pair of executive orders issued by Trump on Aug. 6 that gave the Commerce Department 45 days to determine what transactions to block from the apps he deemed pose a threat to national security. That deadline expires on Sunday.
Commerce Department officials said they were taking the extraordinary step because of the risks posed by the apps' collection of data. China and the companies have denied U.S. user data is collected for spying.

""An American Technology provider would be responsible for maintaining and operating the TikTok network in the US, which would include all services and data serving US consumers,"" TikTok added in the statement.

The proposed plan includes forcing tech giants to break up or sell some of their European operations if their market dominance is deemed to threaten the interests of customers and smaller rivals, the newspaper said. 
The commission is set to propose new rules called the Digital Services Act by the end of the year, which will increase social media's responsibilities and liability for content on their platforms.
EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, in an interview with the FT, said the proposed remedies, which would only be used in extreme circumstances, also include the ability to exclude large tech groups from the single market altogether.
Brussels is also considering a rating system that would allow the public and shareholders to assess companies' behaviour in areas such as tax compliance and the speed with which they take down illegal content, the FT said.
Breton was quoted as saying activities such as companies preventing users from switching platforms or forcing customers to use only one service could lead to tougher sanctions.

1253,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 20, 2020 04:27AM ET</span>",TikTok Owner Seeking $60 Billion Valuation in U.S. Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s ByteDance Ltd. is seeking a valuation of $60 billion for TikTok as  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. take stakes in the short-video app’s business to address U.S. security concerns, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Oracle and Walmart have rights to buy 12.5% and 7.5% respectively of a newly established TikTok Global under an agreement that won the approval of President Donald Trump, the person said, asking not to be named discussing private negotiations. The two companies would pay a combined $12 billion for their stakes if they agree to that asking price.
The final valuation had not been set as the parties worked out the equity structure and measures for data security, the person said. Terms are still in flux and the proposed valuation could still change. Beijing also has yet to approve the deal, though regulators are said to favor any transaction in which ByteDance maintains control of its valuable recommendation algorithms and other proprietary technology.
ByteDance was pressured into a deal for TikTok when Trump threatened to ban the app in the U.S. over national security concerns. After  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). made a proposal for a full buyout of the service, ByteDance instead turned to Oracle’s offering in which the Chinese parent will maintain a solid majority stake.
“I approved the deal in concept,” Trump told reporters Saturday as he left the White House for a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. “If they get it done, that’s great. If they don’t, that’s OK too.”
ByteDance and Oracle representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump’s TikTok Drama Was Just Another Empty Threat: Tae Kim
The valuation for TikTok has been a looming question as Washington and Beijing escalated their rhetoric over the negotiations. The service for the U.S. market alone has been estimated to be worth $20 billion to $50 billion, or even more.  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP)., for context, trades at a $35 billion valuation.
ByteDance, the Beijing-based parent company, is the most valuable private startup in the world at $140 billion, according to market researcher CB Insights. The TikTok Global deal does not include the app’s China twin, Douyin, which has become an enormous hit in its own right.
ByteDance may end up owning as much as 80% of TikTok Global, which would include the app’s operations in the U.S. and the rest of the world excluding China. Venture firms, including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, may also acquire equity in the new business.
Under the current proposal, there will be five seats on the board of TikTok Global. Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will become a director, the retailer said in a statement. TikTok Global will likely be headquartered in Texas and will hire “at least” 25,000 people, Trump said. It will need to hire thousands of content moderators, engineers, and marketing staff that were previously located in China and around the world.
TikTok Global intends to hold an initial public offering within 12 months, Oracle and Walmart said. And Trump said Saturday he wants $5 billion from companies creating a new U.S.-based TikTok venture directed toward teaching American children “the real history of our country.”
Oracle will get full access to review TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company’s Chinese parent to gather data or to spy on the video-sharing app’s 100 million American users, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. software giant has given reassurances it can protect TikTok user data from foreign influence.
“Oracle will quickly deploy, rapidly scale, and operate TikTok systems in the Oracle Cloud,” CEO Safra Catz said in a statement. “We are a 100% confident in our ability to deliver a highly secure environment to TikTok and ensure data privacy to TikTok’s American users.”

1256,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 19, 2020 07:19AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for DraftKings,"By Yasin Ebrahim and Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- The economic fallout from the pandemic has left some firms fighting for their lives, worrying whether their business models will still be relevant in the ""new normal"" when the virus is eventually brought under control.
Online sports and betting operators like DraftKings are not among those businesses.
The lifting of gambling restrictions in many states across the U.S. is creating major opportunities for online sportsbooks. But investors aren't the only ones poised to profit. State regulators, strapped by lost revenue from Covid shutdowns, are eyeing online gambling as a source of tax income. There are risks, too, such as increased competition.
Investing.com's Yasin Ebrahim argues the bull case for DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG), while Christiana Sciaudone argues investors should beware the risks. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
While the bears may point to the company's lack of trading history given its public market debut via a reverse merger in April, DraftKings is a firm boasting solid fundamentals after the shackles of regulation were lifted two years ago.
In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court, struck down a 1992 federal law on commercial sports betting in most states, paving the way for 18 states, representing just over 30% of the U.S. population, to launch regulated sports betting markets.
With an eye on a new source of tax revenue, states like Tennessee, Virginia and New Hampshire, traditionally non-gaming states, also legalized mobile sports betting in the first two years since the court ruling. And more are likely to suit, leading to a fertile ground in which sports betting and online gaming operators can thrive.
""When legislatures return in earnest, we firmly believe the number of states ready to consider accelerating mobile sports betting and online gaming legislation to drive tax revenue will expand substantially,"" Matt King, CEO of FanDuel, told ESPN.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimated the sports betting industry will be a $7 billion to $8 billion business in the U.S. within five years.
Against this favourable backdrop, sport betting and gambling operators like DraftKings are able to provide what others in industries ravaged by Covid-19 cannot: Visibility.
Following the return of live sports, DraftKings recently reinstated guidance for the year, which is ""indicative of its favorable position in leveraging pent-up demand for online sports betting,"" Oppenheimer said.
While the bears will be quick to suggest a second wave of Covid could put live sports on the bench once again, and stall momentum in the sports betting industry. DraftKings has already proved its mettle when the first wave of the pandemic struck, with shares up more double its
Investors aren't the only ones eyeing online sports betting companies like DraftKings. So are governments hungry for fresh tax revenue.
Take New York, for one. Legislators are likely salivating at the prospect of raking in what NY Sports Day projects to be $108 million a year in taxes for the state. A New York Senate bill would authorize the state's seven retail casinos to operate online with a 12% tax on sales and a licensing fee, according to Casino Beats, to start. 
And that's just one of the risks facing online sports betting, says Barry Jonas, director and senior equity analyst at Truist Securities. He points to Europe, where there was pushback from a social harm perspective and, apparently, children found to be betting online. There's also growing competition and the question of loyalty, with bettors easily able to jump from one app to another.
Gaming analysts tend to be more conservative when it comes to online sports betting companies, Jonas said. They see the increasing competition and the regulatory risks, including states in fiscal straits that could easily try to tap into company profits with increasing taxes.
Jonas initiated DraftKings at a hold-equivalent rating in early September. While he likes the company and the management team, Jonas believes the market is calculating zero risks and that's helped spur a valuation that is simply getting out of control. Look no further than that company's shares having more than doubled since it started trading in April after completing a reverse merger with special purpose acquisition company Diamond Eagle.
Jonas points out that DraftKings' 10-year forward EBITDA target multiple of 11 is at the higher end of gaming’s one-year multiple of 10 times. DraftKings reported sales of $75 million for the second quarter and is expected to report $130 million for the third quarter, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
""DraftKings has effectively said they're not making money any time soon,"" Jonas said in a phone interview. They are estimating $1.2 billion in Ebitda in 2030. ""I don't see that it's a given that DraftKings will hit their target.""   
It's hard to argue that DraftKings isn't on a roll. It's one of the top 100 most popular stocks among Robinhood investors, something Jonas believes might be among the reasons for the current euphoria. Plus they recently added basketball great Michael Jordan as a special advisor to the board and inked a deal with ESPN. 
But the competition is already here. 
 Penn National Gaming Inc  (NASDAQ:PENN) soft-launched its online sportsbook in Pennsylvania this week. Penn bought a 36% stake in Barstool Sports, a digital sports media company, in January, which already has more than 56 million followers on social media -- and likely a few bettors among them. Penn already owns gaming and racing properties, as well as 8,800 hotel rooms. Their more traditional casino approach may eventually prove to be a more tempting wager for consumers interested in both in-person and virtual betting. 
Additionally, there's MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM)'s BetMGM sportsbook app. In a huge vote of confidence, IAC last month said it had taken a 12% interest in MGM valued at about $1 billion, and specifically pointed to online gaming revenue as a massive and still nascent opportunity.
While DraftKings is in vogue, both Penn, Barstool and MGM are household names already. And they're all up against each other.
Finally, there's the elephant in the room: Covid-19. Several major sports leagues were on hiatus last quarter because of the virus, and though most have restarted, chances of a health crisis halting play are always right around the corner.
""There are significant risks here and it's really priced to perfection,"" Jonas said.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",Wall Street Weekahead: Corporate debt frenzy rolls on as worries loom over markets,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are gearing up for the year's record-breaking pace of corporate bond issuance to continue in the coming week, even after the U.S. Federal Reserve rattled nerves at its September meeting with a gloomier-than-expected economic outlook. 
The past week has seen roughly $42 billion of high-grade debt come to market in 39 deals, most of which were small and offered by first-time issuers. 
""I would expect next week to be similar,"" said Monica Erickson, portfolio manager, global developed credit, at DoubleLine. 
The breakneck pace of fresh issuance illustrates how the Fed's late March pledge to backstop credit markets and its policy of holding interest rates near zero have spurred borrowing by corporations this year. Companies had already issued $1.7 trillion in debt through the end of August, according to SIFMA, compared with $944 billion in the same period last year. 
Demand is likely to stay elevated in the next few weeks, investors said, as historically low rates continue to drive a hunt for yield despite a cluster of economic and political concerns. Those include the Fed's downbeat economic projections as well as worries over waning fiscal support and potential uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election.
""You have low interest rates, you have tight credit spreads: If I'm an issuer, I'm going to issue as much as humanly possible because it's cheap debt,"" said Nick Maroutsos, head of global bonds at Janus Henderson Investors. ""That demand is there because people are craving any sort of return.""
Just over $18 billion in high-yield debt had priced in the week through mid-morning Friday, with two more deals in the pipeline from Aetheon United and PM General Purchaser, according to IFR Refinitiv. IFR's data showed that Friday's issuance was expected to drive the year-to-date total over $337 billion, past the previous annual record of $332 billion set in 2012.
Jason Vlosich, head fixed income trader at Brown Advisory, said he expects an additional $40 billion or so in new investment-grade deals through the end of the month. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in August forecast that this month's investment-grade issuance was likely to be between $120 billion and $140 billion. September issuance stood at about $115 billion on Friday, according to Refinitiv IFR.
In the coming week, investors will be watching earnings reports from Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group, which is typically seen as a preview of what's to come from Wall Street banks,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), cruise line Carnival (NYSE:CUK) and retailers including Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST). The economic data calendar is comparatively light, with Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index on Wednesday and weekly jobless claims on Thursday.
In a break with recent trends, about 50% of new investment-grade debt in 2020 has been issued to pay off or refinance existing debt, versus the 20% or 30% that is typical, said Erickson.
""Companies will come to market and buy back higher-priced debt just to lower their interest expense."" 
As a result, a slowdown in M&A and share buybacks - expected to continue through the end of the year - is less likely to dent issuance. 
Several factors could potentially slow the pace of corporate debt offerings, investors said. Junk-rated issuers could have trouble accessing the market if it appears the nascent U.S. recovery is flagging, Vlosich said. 
Since many big name investment-grade companies have already come to the market this year, the remainder of 2020 could mean smaller, lesser-known companies dominate issuance, resulting in lighter volumes. An uptick in Treasury yields could also diminish the allure of corporate debt, which is seen as a far riskier investment. 
For now, however, the intense demand for higher yielding debt remains in place. 
Flows into both high-yield and investment grade funds rose in the last week and are up 45% and 18% respectively since the start of April, according to Lipper. 

“I don’t see this stopping anytime soon,"" said Maroutsos of Janus Henderson.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke on Friday afternoon with the chief executives of the country's top airlines, who are urging Congress to approve another $25 billion in assistance to keep tens of thousands of U.S. workers on the payroll past Sept. 30, sources said. 
The call with Pelosi, House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio and the CEOs followed one with labor, where the speaker voiced support for additional aid, according to Association of Flight Attendants-CWA International President Sara Nelson. 
""It's clear that this is a priority for the speaker,"" said Nelson, who was on the call. ""Nobody is talking about why we need this. There's total agreement. The question is what's the vehicle.""
Airlines and unions are pleading for an extra six months of aid under a bipartisan proposal for another $1.5 trillion in coronavirus relief. 
The end of this month marks the expiration of the $25 billion in federal payroll assistance that airlines received when the coronavirus first began spreading around the world.
Without an extension, United Airlines (O:UAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL) alone are set to furlough some 40,000 workers on Oct 1. American has also said it plans to end service to 15 small communities, a move that could be followed by other airlines.
President Donald Trump is also open to a stand-alone measure for airlines, though congressional aides say that is unlikely to win support given aid requests from so many other struggling industries. 
In a letter to Congress on Friday, United CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) recognized the severe impact the virus is having on the entire economy and argued that assistance now can help lessen the long-term impact and speed a recovery.
""The aviation industry is a critical driver of the larger economy,"" he said in the letter, which was also signed by five union leaders. 
Air travel has plummeted over the last six months as the coronavirus pandemic has claimed nearly 196,000 American lives and prompted many to avoid airports and planes, seriously depressing airline revenues.
While lobbying Washington, airlines are also negotiating with employees to minimize thousands of job cuts that would happen without more federal funds.
A Democratic aid said earlier that CEOs from United, American, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), JetBlue Airways (O:JBLU), Hawaiian Airlines (O:HA), Alaska Airlines (N:ALK) and others were expected on the call with Pelosi.

Congress also set aside another $25 billion in government loans for airlines, but many have opted not to tap that funding source.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb Co's cancer immunotherapy Opdivo in combination with Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) Inc's Cabometyx reduced the risk of death by 40% in previously untreated patients with advanced kidney cancer, according to data from a late-stage study to be presented on Saturday.
The drug combination also doubled patients' median length of time before their cancer began to worsen to 16.6 months compared to progression-free survival of 8.3 months for patients treated with the chemotherapy sunitinib, an older  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) drug sold under the brand name Sutent.
""There is no doubt in my mind that this will be a major player"" as an initial treatment for advanced kidney cancer, said lead researcher Dr. Toni Choueiri from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
He noted that the oncology community is already familiar with both drugs and that the combination demonstrated positive results on all the study's goals.
The Phase III study of 651 patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma was being presented as part of the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting being held virtually this year. A brief summary of the data, known as an abstract, was released on Friday.
Researchers said the safety of the combination was manageable and consistent with the side effect profile of the two drugs when used individually.
Opdivo is one of Bristol’s top-selling drugs, with analysts forecasting nearly $7 billion in sales this year.

The new data could help boost sales that have slowed in recent years as Opdivo was eclipsed by Merck & Co’s rival drug Keytruda.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A large options player which some market watchers call the ""Nasdaq whale"" unwound bets on several technology-related companies on Friday after the sector's recent sell-off.
The investor closed a position in a bullish call options spread on Adobe Inc (O:ADBE) at a loss of roughly $200,000. The spread represented around $935 million of notional value. The call spread was originally bought on Aug. 5 among a group of trades that some market analysts have attributed to SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).
Adobe shares ended 1.4% lower at $467.55 as U.S. stocks fell broadly.
The investor sold stock at the time of the call spread purchase, then bought back the shares after selling the options, at a loss of roughly $9 a share. Because the options trades were tied to stock, they had minimal impact on market activity, unlike the sell-off earlier this month, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
The trade marks the first closure among the call spreads believed to be tied to SoftBank, and it could prompt speculation on whether it is ""just a one-off or the beginning of a trend,"" Murphy said.
Last week, an investor exited large options positions in names such as  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Salesforce.com Inc (N:CRM), though those positions had different structures from the call spreads tied to SoftBank.
Also on Friday, an investor closed large call options positions in Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), noted Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Alphabet shares fell 2.4% and Amazon shares dipped 1.8%, both underperforming the S&P 500 index (SPX), which declined 1.1%.
""These 'whale' tech unwinds continue to influence sentiment and put pressure on the FANG names,"" Wu Silverman wrote in an email, referring to the group of leading tech-related stocks including Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell for the third-straight week Friday, as big tech was shunned and a bright start for financials proved short-lived. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.88%, or 244 points. The S&P 500 slipped 1.18%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.07%.
Big tech, which has led much of rebound from March, appears to be running out of steam as strong start to the week faded even as the Federal Reserve largely stuck to script and signaled near-zero rates to continue until at least 2023.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended below the flatline. The fall in Apple this week has seen the tech giant's valuation fall below $2 trillion.
Elsewhere in tech, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) continued to await an update from the Trump administration on whether it will approve its proposal to take a monitory stake in TikTok.
The weakness in growth pushed investors in other concerns of the markets like financials that had been in the shadow of the relentless rally in tech.   
Financials outperformed the broader market, falling just 0.24%, as downside was limited by MetLife (NYSE:MET) and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).
In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was up 4% after cutting gains despite Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) lifting its price target on the stock to $515 per share from $480 per share, citing expectations for sharply higher demand for the electric automaker's energy products.
 Beyond Meat Inc  (NASDAQ:BYND) meanwhile, appears to be losing some of its luster on Wall Street after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) downgraded the stock, citing a toppy valuation, sending its shares 5% lower.

1263,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>",LVMH submits disputed Tiffany takeover for EU clearance,"PARIS (Reuters) - LVMH said on Friday it had submitted its troubled takeover of Tiffany, which is now at the centre of a legal dispute between the two groups, for EU approval as it seeks to counter accusations that it deliberately stalled antitrust proceedings.
The French group's $16 billion acquisition of the U.S. jeweller turned sour last week when LVMH said it could no longer complete it due to a request by the French government to delay the closing of the deal and the weakening of Tiffany's business.
Tiffany responded by suing LVMH in a court in Delaware, seeking to force the French group to honour the deal, which was agreed last year, before the coronavirus pandemic hit the luxury sector hard. 
""LVMH confirms that earlier today, immediately after receiving approval to proceed by the European Commission, it has submitted the proposed acquisition of Tiffany for antitrust review, as it has always stated it would do,"" it said.
""Eight of the ten requisite antitrust clearances have already been obtained,"" it added. 
LVMH said it expected to receive approval from the EU and Taiwan - the last two remaining authorities that have yet to clear the deal - ""well before"" a Nov. 24 deadline to close the takeover.
In its lawsuit, Tiffany accused the French group of delaying its request for antitrust clearance and running out the clock in order to make the deal collapse.
The U.S. group on Friday welcomed the filing of the deal with the EU.
""The speed with which LVMH acted after Tiffany filed its complaint in Delaware only underscores LVMH's delays and lack of compliance with the merger agreement over the prior months,"" it said.
LVMH denies having sought to delay regulatory approval of the takeover. It has in turn accused Tiffany of mismanaging its business during the health emergency -- an allegation which the U.S. group rejects.
The Delaware court meets on Monday to discuss Tiffany's request to fast-track the case. Tiffany wants a ruling before the Nov. 24 deadline, while LVMH says there is no reason to speed things up and that more time is needed to prepare properly for a complex trial.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday as technology shares sold off for a third day in a row, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted a third straight week of declines.
It was the first such weekly streak for the Nasdaq since August 2019.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc, (O:GOOGL) which helped to fuel the rally off the March lows, were among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
Friday marked the quarterly expiration of U.S. stock options, stock index futures and index option contracts, known as ""quadruple witching."" The expirations tend to bring about increased trading volume at the market close and feed into market volatility.
Strategists said investors appeared to be continuing a recent rotation out of high-flying tech-related stocks and into other sectors.
""It looks to be sentiment driven and, to some extent, it appears to be rotational to us,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. 
""We're not sure this really indicates there's a problem with economic growth, but rather, it's some profit-taking, some adjustment and rotation"" between sectors, he said. ""You're moving from the biggest weights in the market to the smallest weights.""
The S&P materials (SPLRCM) is the best-performing sector so far this month, while heavily weighted S&P technology is the worst. 
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 249 points, or 0.89%, to 27,652.98, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 37.89 points, or 1.13%, to 3,319.12 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 118.00 points, or 1.08%, to 10,792.28. 
Investors kept a close eye on rising coronavirus cases overseas. European countries from Denmark to Greece announced new restrictions on Friday to curb surging coronavirus infections in some of their largest cities, while Britain was reported to be considering a new national lockdown.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose as two analysts raised their price targets on the electric carmaker's shares ahead of its highly anticipated ""Battery Day"" event next week.

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 03:35PM ET</span>",What's the real impact of Trump's action against TikTok?,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will ban video-sharing app TikTok from U.S. app stores starting Sunday night, a move that will block Americans from downloading or updating the Chinese-owned platform over concerns it poses a national security threat.
Below are questions and answers on what this means for users, the political implications and how this will impact the companies involved.
WILL CURRENT TIKTOK USERS SEE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT?
Initially, not much. They will not be able to download updates and may miss new features and fixes. But on Nov. 12, the app could become slower or harder to use because American companies will be barred from providing back-end hosting services that help the app function smoothly. TikTok said in a statement Friday those changes would amount to a ""ban.""
HOW WILL NEW TIKTOK USERS BE AFFECTED?
Beginning Sunday, the app will no longer be available for download from app stores in the United States, greatly reducing the number of new U.S. users. Some may find workarounds, such as traveling to a foreign country to download the app or using a virtual private network, a U.S. official said. Users could also still sign up and watch videos via TikTok's website, but they will not be able to post videos without the mobile application.
WHAT ARE THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE TIKTOK BAN?
TikTok will not see major changes until after the election, so the issue's influence on the presidential race is unlikely to grow significantly. President Donald Trump could still be seen by some as defending U.S. interests by threatening to ban a Chinese app, and some may see him as avoiding a decision or arranging a deal for a political ally, in Oracle Chair Larry Ellison.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ORACLE'S DEAL TO PARTNER WITH TIKTOK?

The ban will ramp up pressure on TikTok's owner ByteDance and potential suitors including  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to put together a deal that is agreeable to President Trump as soon as possible. If a deal is reached before Sunday, there is a chance new downloads will not be blocked and that TikTok can go about its business.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Playboy explores deal to return to the stock market,"By Joshua Franklin and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Playboy magazine owner Playboy Enterprises is exploring options that include going public through a merger with a blank-check acquisition company, according to people familiar with the matter. 
A deal with a blank-check firm - referred to on Wall Street as a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) - would result in Playboy's return to the stock market, nine years after it went private in a $207 million deal led by its late founder Hugh Hefner and private equity firm Rizvi Traverse Management. 
Since then, the company's print sales have fallen further. The COVID-19 pandemic compounded its challenges, leading Playboy earlier this year to stop printing the magazine, ending a nearly seven-decade run on newsstands that began in 1953 with a debut issue featuring Marilyn Monroe.
Playboy is working with an investment bank to engage in discussions with a potential SPAC buyer, the sources said. A deal, if one is reached, would give Playboy access to money it needs to finance growth initiatives that it otherwise might not be able to tap, one of the sources said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. 
The sources cautioned that it is possible no deal will materialize. A representative for Playboy declined to comment. Rizvi Traverse Chief Investment Officer Suhail Rizvi did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Hefner, who founded Playboy in 1953, died in 2017 at the age of 91. His family sold a 35% stake in Playboy to Rizvi Traverse for $35 million in 2018, according to PitchBook data.
The company had explored a sale in 2016, Reuters reported at the time. 
Playboy magazine's rabbit silhouette became one of the best known logos in the world and the ""bunny"" waitresses in Hefner's Playboy nightclubs were instantly recognizable in their low-cut bathing suit-style uniforms with bow ties, puffy cotton tails and pert rabbit ears.
In recent years, Playboy has expanded beyond its media business to refashion itself as a lifestyle brand. It has also licensed its brand and logo to others. Playboy did away with full-frontal nudity starting in its March 2016 issue, but reversed course a year later.
A SPAC is a shell company which raises funds in an initial public offering (IPO) with the goal of acquiring a private company. The acquired company then becomes publicly traded as a result. Such vehicles have emerged in 2020 as an increasingly popular route to the public markets over a traditional IPO. 

Many of the most successful SPAC acquisitions this year have been for high-profile consumer brands, such as  Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp 's purchase of sports betting platform DraftKings Inc (O:DKNG), or for companies in emerging industries like electric vehicles and plant-based food.

Those indicted planned to pay over $100,000 in exchange for an unfair competitive advantage on the Amazon marketplace - a platform where third-party merchants sell goods, the Department said. 
The defendants used bribery and fraud to reinstate products and accounts that Amazon had suspended or blocked entirely from doing business on its marketplace. That resulted in more than $100 million of competitive benefits to those accounts, harm to competitors and harm to consumers, according to the indictment.
""The ultimate victim from this criminal conduct is the buying public who get inferior or even dangerous goods that should have been removed from the marketplace,"" U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran said in a statement.
An Amazon spokesman said the company worked with the Justice Department on the case and that it has systems in place to detect suspicious behavior by sellers and employees.
""We are especially disappointed by the actions of this limited group of now former employees, and appreciate the collaboration and support from law enforcement to bring them and the bad actors they were entwined with to justice,"" the spokesman said.

The company's third-party marketplace has come under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulatory agencies looking at Amazon's business practices on the platform and whether it hurts small sellers.

But since the House passed its stimulus bill in May, “other issues have emerged” as the virus has continued to disrupt lives and businesses that need to be addressed in any new plan, Pelosi said.She didn’t give any specifics about how much aid should go to airlines and other businesses, like restaurants, or what other priorities might have to be dropped or scaled back.
Republicans have rejected the $2.2 trillion Democratic plan, but President Donald Trump has signaled that he could support a bigger stimulus package than the $1.1 trillion proposal his administration had previously backed.
”It will get done when they come to the table,” Pelosi said of Republicans. “The ball is in their court.”
Pelosi also said the standoff on the stimulus won’t interfere with passage of a stopgap funding bill to keep the government operating after the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. She said the House was getting ready to release legislation Friday, giving both chambers of Congress enough time to act before the deadline.
She said the two parties are still negotiating the duration of the stopgap funding, which is needed because work still isn’t completed on full funding legislation.

1272,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>",Battleground States Showed Mixed Progress in August Joblessness,"(Bloomberg) -- Jobless rates showed mixed improvement across the closely contested U.S. election-battleground states in August amid broad gains nationwide, underscoring the labor market’s uneven recovery across the country.
Arizona’s unemployment rate fell 4.8 percentage points from the prior month to 5.9% and Florida’s dropped 4 points to 7.4%, according to Labor Department figures Friday on state employment. Meanwhile, Michigan’s rate was unchanged at 8.7%, Minnesota’s dropped by 0.2 point to 7.4% and Nevada’s rate declined 1 point to 13.2%, the highest in the country.
The national unemployment rate dropped in August to 8.4% from 10.2%, the monthly jobs report showed earlier this month.
The latest data add further detail to the 1.37 million jobs added in August and underscore the varying speeds at which state economies have been able to recover from massive -- and uneven -- job losses.
Before the pandemic, President Donald Trump emphasized the solid job gains seen under his presidency, with the unemployment rate matching a 50-year low in February. Covid-19 and the ensuing lockdowns upended that growth, spurring millions of job losses. In the swing states that may ultimately decide the Nov. 3 election, jobs -- or the lack of them -- could very well play into whether voters support Trump or Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
Nationally, 40 U.S. states added jobs in August, while employment was essentially unchanged in the remaining 10 states. The biggest month-over-month payroll increases were in New Jersey, New York and Virginia at 1.8%, while North Carolina reported a 0.4% increase.
Ten states still have unemployment rates above 10%, with Nevada’s 13.2% followed by Rhode Island, New York and Hawaii.
Nationally, the labor market is broadly showing signs of improvement, but payrolls remained about 11.5 million below pre-pandemic levels in August, pointing to a long recovery ahead that is dependent on state’s efforts to get the virus under control.
Permanent business closures also play a role in which states will recover fastest. Nationally, over 97,000 small businesses have shut for good since March 1, according to data from  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) Inc. Among the battleground states, Arizona, Nevada and Texas have the most combined permanent and temporary closures per 1,000 businesses, Yelp showed.

Investments to manufacture battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will be mainly directed at FCA plants located in southern Italy, supporting employment and compliance with the strictest environmental criteria.
To improve capacity utilisation at FCA's Italian plants, the group has announced a 5 billion euro investment plan for the country through 2021 which envisages the launch of new electric and hybrid models.
EIB and FCA had sealed 300 million euros in financing before the summer to fund investments for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle production lines at plants in Melfi, in the southern Basilicata region, and battery electric vehicles at Fiat's historic Turin plant of Mirafiori over the 2019-2021 period.
FCA has now finalised a 485 million euro deal with EIB to support both an innovative line of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles at the Pomigliano plant in the southern Campania region as well as R&D activities at FCA laboratories in Turin.

The EIB credit line covers 75% of the total value of FCA's investment in the project for the 2020-2023 period.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 12:26PM ET</span>","In row with Tiffany, LVMH may find that most sales are final","By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - France's LVMH faces an uphill battle in walking away from its $16 billion deal to buy U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co, with legal experts noting most mergers which end up in court are renegotiated rather than dissolved.
Tiffany last week sued LVMH in the Delaware Court of Chancery, the top U.S. business court, after the maker of Louis Vuitton handbags said it could not complete the acquisition, citing a French government request to delay the close and Tiffany's deteriorating business outlook due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
LVMH has said it will defend itself vigorously. In a filing on Wednesday, it accused Tiffany of mismanaging the pandemic's financial fallout and arguing this has triggered a material adverse effect (MAE) that nullifies their agreement. 
But Delaware courts have set a high bar for buyers to walk away from deals, ever since the Court of Chancery ruled almost two decades ago that chicken producer  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) had to complete its deal for rival meat company IBP Inc. 
That ruling came despite a severe winter that hurt the business of both companies and issues raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about IBP's financial statements.
""The inclination is to save the deal where it's possible and where it doesn't defeat the agreement of the parties to the deal,"" said Larry Hamermesh, professor emeritus at Delaware Law School.
Tiffany declined to comment. In a prepared statement on Thursday, LVMH said there are no objective reasons why the upcoming trial should not take place in a normal timeframe.
""Tiffany clearly fears a serene and fair rendering of justice,"" LVMH said in the statement.
A judge will weigh in on the matter for the first time on Monday, when the court hears Tiffany's request to fast-track the case. The jeweler, famous for its robin's egg blue packaging, wants a ruling before a Nov. 24 deadline for completing the deal. LVMH has countered that there is no reason to ""move mountains"" to conduct a trial quickly.
""The Court of Chancery has stepped up in this emergency to make sure that disputes are promptly decided on their merits, not by leverage resulting from delay, something especially important to vulnerable sellers,"" said Leo Strine, an attorney at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and former chief justice of the Delaware Supreme Court. 
The legal row is the largest and most high-profile yet in a series of broken deals due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including mall owner Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG)'s move to abandon its $3.6 billion acquisition of Taubman Centers (NYSE:TCO) Inc and private equity firm Sycamore Partners' decision to dump L Brands Inc (NYSE:LB)'s lingerie line Victoria's Secret.
A 2013 University of Pittsburgh study of 755 planned acquisitions found that most which experienced MAEs ended up being renegotiated on average at a 15% lower price. 
""There are deals that are canceled, but that is a lower percentage,"" said David Denis, one of the authors of the study and a professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh.
To be sure, courts judge cases on their merit. In 2018, German healthcare group Fresenius SE (DE:FREG) was allowed to walk away from its $4.75 billion acquisition of  Akorn  (OTC:AKRXQ) Inc, because the Court of Chancery found the generic drugmaker's dramatic slump amounted to an MAE.
This was a first for a Delaware court and it stunned Wall Street. Even so, the legal standard for an MAE to be triggered in Delaware remains high, lawyers say.
""Our courts view the reliability and predictability of the court as one of the more important things that Delaware offers to its constituents,"" said Greg Varallo, a partner at law firm Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. 
Other high-profile deals collapsed without a Delaware Chancery Court judge declaring an MAE.  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) LP cited tax problems that allowed it to walk away from its proposed $20 billion takeover of rival pipeline operator Williams (NYSE:WMB) Cos in 2016. The court found that Apollo Tyres Ltd had not breached its proposed $2.5 billion acquisition of Cooper Tire & Rubber in 2013 after the buyer failed to reach a contract with U.S. workers, allowing the Indian company to walk away.
""If you're litigating in Delaware and you can find some other basis to get out of a merger other than an MAE clause, I think you have a better shot,"" said Jill Fisch, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
Fisch added that LVMH will likely point to a letter from the French government asking that the deal be delayed as a way to break up the deal without requiring the judge declare an MAE.

Some 1,900 deals have been canceled, renegotiated or disputed around the world since the start of the pandemic, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's lending arm, the European Investment Bank, is to stop funding new projects in Belarus as part of the bloc's response to the disputed re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko, a source close to the bank said on Friday.
""There was a board meeting yesterday where it was made clear,"" the source told Reuters on the condition of anonymity, adding that no projects had been in the pipeline. 
The EIB has spent a total of 550 million euros ($652.14 million) in Belarus, having signed its first project in the country back in mid-2017.
The step comes amid ongoing international pressure on Lukashenko, who is turning to Russia for support to try and ride out the crisis.
The United Nation's Human Rights Council on Friday approved an EU-led resolution for closer monitoring of alleged rights violations following the disputed August presidential vote.
U.N. rights investigator Anaïs Marin told the session that member states needed to act to prevent a major geopolitical rift. ""Let's not allow another iron curtain to descend on the European continent,"" she said.
Marin said more than 10,000 people have been ""abusively arrested"", with more than 500 reports of torture and thousands ""savagely beaten"", since President Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in a presidential election on Aug. 9.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) which is majority-owned by EU countries and institutions, but also has Russia, the United States and other top governments as shareholders, said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the situation, though wouldn't comment further on its lending.
The EBRD invested 160 million euros in Belarus in the first half of 2020, more than double the 67 million euros it spent in the first half on 2019.
A former Soviet collective farm manager, the authoritarian Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 but has battled a wave of anger over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy and his human rights record.

State-approved exit polls showed him winning 79.7% of the presidential vote in August while his main opponent, Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, a former English teacher who emerged from obscurity to lead rallies against him, received 6.8%.

Chief Executive Brian Moynihan called for another round of federal stimulus to help the U.S. reach a full economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
“You’re back up to where 95% of the economy is back,” Moynihan said Friday in an interview with David Westin in advance of next week’s Bloomberg Equality Summit, adding that more help is needed for restaurants, airlines, performing-arts venues and state and local governments so they can “cross that same bridge” as housing, health-care and other recovered industries. “We’ve got to help everybody else get across.”
Moynihan said a year-over-year increase in consumer spending is a sign of the economy’s resilience. U.S. retail sales rose 0.6% last month, following a 0.9% gain in July, the Commerce Department reported earlier this week.
Government support for small businesses is running dry with the Paycheck Protection Program having closed in early August, and a supplemental $600 a week in unemployment benefits having expired at the end of July. Some House Democrats are keeping pressure on Speaker Nancy Pelosi to bring a new coronavirus relief bill up for a vote next week as they look to signal that the party is pursuing a deal to bolster the economy. Pelosi has held firm that the White House should first agree on a $2.2 trillion plan Democrats have put on the table.
A “second bite at the apple” for PPP would help the economy come back fully, Moynihan said.
“The idea of it recovering that last five percentage points tomorrow morning -- it’s going to take a while to grind through that,” he said, adding that more government support would help industries still struggling. “What we need, I think, is pretty straightforward: You need more stimulus for the people.”

1278,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Turkey's Halkbank urges dismissal of Iran sanctions criminal case in U.S.,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Halkbank on Friday urged a judge to dismiss a U.S. indictment accusing the state-owned Turkish lender of helping Iran evade American sanctions, even as it seeks the judge's recusal for alleged bias.
At a hearing in Manhattan federal court, a lawyer for Halkbank said its status as a Turkish ""instrumentality"" shielded it from prosecution because of sovereign immunity.
The U.S. Department of Justice charged Halkbank last October with using money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions, enable revenue from oil and gas sales to be spent on gold, and facilitate sham food and medicine purchases.
Halkbank has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges, including over its alleged transfer of $20 billion of otherwise restricted Iranian funds.
Simon Latcovich, a lawyer for Halkbank, told U.S. District Judge Richard Berman its alleged conduct had only ""incidental"" U.S. ties, and did not qualify for an exception to sovereign immunity governing commercial activity.
""We're talking about processing Iranian oil and natural gas transactions,"" Latcovich said. ""By definition, this is the type of activity that cannot be exercised by private citizens, making it sovereign, and not commercial.""
Prosecutor Sidhardha Kamaraju said it was enough that some restricted funds moved through U.S. banks for Halkbank to face criminal liability.
""It is the routing of $1 billion of Iranian oil proceeds, through the U.S. financial system, that violates U.S. sanctions laws,"" Kamaraju said.
The hearing followed a Thursday evening refusal by the federal appeals court in Manhattan to let Halkbank delay the case while it appeals Berman's refusal to recuse himself.
Berman has rejected bias claims, writing last week that Halkbank had ""astonishingly and falsely"" claimed he supported an alleged terrorist group bent on gaining control of Turkey's government.
The judge did not rule on Halkbank's dismissal request. A trial remains scheduled for March 1, 2021.

The case is U.S. v Halkbank, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00867.

By 11:37 AM ET, (1537 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 90 points, or 0.33%. The S&P 500 was down 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.1% after falling on Thursday.
Options expiry days have the potential to generate considerable volatility, although that usually comes later in the session. Consequently, the major economic releases of the day are likely to garner less attention than otherwise.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), whose social networks compete with TikTok for the public's eyeballs, rose 1.1% on the same news.
Financial stocks were down slightly on the back of the Federal Reserve's statement on Thursday that it was looking at extending the restraints on bank share buybacks and dividends that it had ordered earlier in the year.

Between mid-August and the first week of September, applications for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance -- a federal relief program intended for self-employed workers and independent contractors -- doubled in California to more than 524,000, far above claim levels when the federal program first launched in April, the state’s Employment Development Department said Thursday.
After the most populous state took action to deter suspected scammers from filing false applications in hopes of getting payments, PUA applications dropped sharply to 145,790, a decline of more than 72%, the department said.
In addition, California’s figures show a wide discrepancy with nationally-reported data on continuing PUA claims in California. While the federal Department of Labor reports that more than 6 million Californians are claiming PUA benefits each week, the state’s labor department shows that figure below 2 million, pointing to further data-reporting issues.
The Department of Labor didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
‘Actual Counting’
Those figures feed into a national total that the Department of Labor continues to report each week as an official tally of almost 30 million Americans receiving unemployment benefits, despite problems with inflated numbers that have been evident for months.
On the other hand, weekly national figures on initial jobless claims -- the widely watched headline number, which is separate from PUA -- may also be overstating the pace of layoffs: the California numbers showed 46,062 applications submitted last week for regular state benefits, compared with 230,225 that were processed, a number that corresponds with the state figure in the national report released Thursday.
That indicates the national figures may reflect states catching up with backlogs rather than representing the most recent levels of actual job losses.
In any case, the fraud issue in California underscores the widespread unemployment data challenges -- including clerical errors and double counting -- that state employment departments have faced since the pandemic began in March. Errors can skew economists’ outlook for the labor market because claims data are used to look for signs of distress in the job market and any recovery, along with details at the state level.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday cast doubt on the reliability of the national PUA figures, saying during a press briefing that the “actual counting of the claims is volatile” and it’s difficult to “take much signal about the particular level.”
Since the beginning of August, 34 arrests have been made in California related to unemployment fraud, with more expected in the coming weeks.
“Aggressive efforts to fight fraud are yielding results in curbing the recent uptick in suspicious Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) claims in California,” the state’s employment department said.

However, Glass Lewis said that Noble (OTC:NEBLQ)'s shareholders should vote against so-called golden parachute payments to certain Noble Energy executives, which would be triggered by the sale of the company.
Chevron announced its proposal to buy Noble Energy for $5 billion in stock on July 20. It represented the first big energy deal since the coronavirus pandemic crushed global fuel demand and sent crude prices to historic lows.
In supporting the transaction, Glass Lewis said it found the proposal to be ""both strategically and financially compelling"" to Noble investors, with the combined company offering a number of benefits that would be unavailable to Noble as a standalone entity.
Despite this, Glass Lewis said the proposed payments to executives, including Noble Energy Chief Executive David Stover, were ""excessive"" and should be rejected by shareholders.
""Although the company may have been contractually and legally obligated to make these payments due to employment agreements, we believe shareholders should question whether the size of these awards is the best use of company capital,"" it said.
Such change-of-control payments are designed, in the event of a sale of the company, to compensate executives, who may find themselves redundant given there is unlikely to be enough roles in the combined company for both management teams.

Noble shareholders are due to vote on the Chevron deal on Oct. 2. The deal has also been recommended by fellow proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).

AGRA, India (Reuters) - When business evaporated at Gajendra Sharma's eyeglass shop a couple of miles from the Taj Mahal during India's strict COVID-19 lockdown, he was relieved to hear about a pandemic debt moratorium that would give him breathing room on his home loan.
Now, however, the 53-year-old optician's $13,500 debt risks destabilising India's banks, authorities warn.
That is because a complaint he brought challenging the loan relief plan, grouped with those of other borrowers and now before the Supreme Court, could mean a $27 billion hit to lenders - more than half their annual profits - that could shake the nation's financial system, the industry and regulators fear.
The battle, launched from Sharma's small shop in the northern city of Agra and now involving more than 120 lawyers, has the central bank and government struggling to defend what was meant to be a helping hand.
The problem, as the other borrowers see it, is that they must pay additional interest on their skipped repayments during the moratorium, which they call ""interest-on-interest.""
The borrowers - including a leading real estate industry group, power utilities, shopping malls and small businesses - says the scheme unfairly hits them even as many have been financially devastated by the pandemic, that the banks must forgive the interest and compound interest that accrued while their payments were suspended.
Sharma, a voluble man with a thick moustache and a crop of dark hair, says the six-month reprieve, which ended on Aug. 31, increased his debt load because of the extra interest. He is also paying monthly instalments on a $21,700 business loan, for which he did not seek a moratorium. 
""I realized this scheme was not to give us relief, but to give us more grief,"" he told Reuters in his shop, where idols of Hindu deities compete for space with Ray Ban and Prada (OTC:PRDSY) sunglass displays.
BANKS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government imposed the world's strictest COVID-19 lockdown in March, Sharma saw no customers for months, though he had to keep paying his $2,700 in monthly recurring costs.
Across this nation of 1.3 billion people, companies say they are struggling to keep up with their loans as the lockdown has choked business and consumer spending. The economy collapsed a record 23.9% in the April-June quarter from a year earlier.
Now, even with the moratorium, ""the interest-on-interest will result in winding up various real estate and other companies,"" said Utsav Trivedi, a lawyer representing one group of Sharma's fellow complainants.
In a typical case, a homeowner with 15 years remaining on a roughly $40,000 loan would pay an additional $6,000 in interest due to the moratorium, an extra 16 months' worth, explains SBI, India's top state-run bank.
Citing Sharma's case, the finance ministry last week ordered a panel to analyse the impact of withdrawing interest and the compounding levy.
The Supreme Court appears sympathetic to the borrowers on the extra interest. During the most recent hearing on Sept. 10, Justice Ashok Bhushan said the court was ""inclined to pass an order"" that banks forgive the additional levies.
India's banks, too, are reeling from the pandemic, and the industry fears a major judicial setback, given that the court has previously overturned government decisions in ways that hit sectors from coal mining and telecommunications.
Banks already have bad loans of over $120 billion, much of it on the books of state-run lenders, which dominate India's banking landscape, and the non-performing debt is set to surge in coming months. Any deterioration in their books would force the government, itself deeply indebted, to set aside billions of dollars to recapitalise the banks.
Combined annual profits at private banks and state-owned banks is some 3.2 trillion rupees ($43 billion), ""so a waiver of interest will be totally destabilising,"" said analyst Anil Gupta at credit rating agency ICRA.
The Reserve Bank of India told the court an ""interest-free"" moratorium would cut the sector's income by at least 2 trillion rupees ($27 billion), or 1% of India's GDP. ""There would be huge consequences for the stability of the banking system,"" the central bank said.
The finance ministry told the court last month what waiving what it says is standard compound interest would be ""against the basic canons of finance"", adding it was crucial to protect the more than 1.9 billion deposit accounts that earn interest income.
The central bank and ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>","EU to introduce crypto-assets regime by 2024, EU documents say","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union will introduce new rules within four years to make cross-border payments quicker and cheaper through the use of blockchain and crypto assets like stablecoins, two EU documents showed.
The European Commission is due to set out its strategy for encouraging greater use of digital finance at a time when 78% of payments in the euro zone are in cash. It also wants a rapid shift to ""instant"" payments generally as pandemic lockdowns showed the growing role of cashless payments.
The EU executive will present a draft law to clarify how existing rules apply to crypto assets and set out new rules where there are gaps, the documents said.
""By 2024, the EU should put in place a comprehensive framework enabling the uptake of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and crypto-assets in the financial sector,"" the documents said. ""It should also address the risks associated with these technologies.""
Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency often backed by traditional assets, leapt onto policymakers' agendas last year when Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) revealed plans for its Libra token. Central banks are now studying whether to launch their own.
Brussels also wants to make it easier to share data within the financial sector to encourage competition and a wider range of services, while upholding the principle of ""same risk, same rules, same regulation"", the documents say.
The bloc should also have rules in place within four years to allow new customers to start using financial services quickly once anti-money laundering and identity checks have been completed, it said.
""By 2024, the principle of passporting and a one-stop shop licensing should apply in all areas which hold strong potential for digital finance,"" it said. Instant payment systems should become the ""new normal"" by the end of 2021.
Instant payments are suitable for many uses beyond traditional credit transfers, in particular for physical and online purchases, which are currently dominated by payment card schemes, the documents said.
Europe has long sought ""home grown"" alternatives to the likes of MasterCard and Visa (NYSE:V), the U.S. payments firms heavily used in the region.

The Commission will assess the impact of charges levied on consumers for instant payments and to could require that they are no higher than those for regular credit transfers.

Investing.com --  U.S. Steel jumped nearly 10% after saying market conditions are improving. 
Third quarter 2020 adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization costs, are expected to be approximately negative $100 million, and the adjusted diluted loss per share to be approximately $1.45. In the second quarter, the adjusted Ebitda loss was $264 million.
“Improving market conditions experienced in June and July have accelerated through August and September. Strengthening steel fundamentals and our ability to respond quickly to increasing customer demand are expected to result in significantly improved adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter,” U. S. Steel Chief Executive Officer David B. Burritt said in a statement. 
“We have grown confident in the recovery that is underway in North America and Europe. While we believe this recovery is enduring, we remain relentlessly focused on what we can control, including management actions to stay nimble, reduce costs, and preserve cash,” Burritt said.   
The Flat-rolled segment results will continue to be negative in the third quarter, but ""significantly better"" than second quarter results. The company's order book and lead times have improved, and it has restarted three blast furnaces that were temporarily idled earlier this year.
In Europe, the pace of market improvement also exceeded company expectations, and third quarter results should be better than in the previous quarter.   
Shares have more than doubled since March, but are still lower for the year. The stock has four hold ratings.

Qatar-based BeIN Sports told the Bundesliga Friday it was pulling out of the negotiations on a new five-year deal, blaming piracy as the primary factor.
“Our business plan is clear. We will only bid for rights at levels that make economic sense and have a value proposition,” Richard Verow, chief sports officer at BeIN, said in a statement. “Piracy has crippled the market so we have made the decision not to renew with Bundesliga there.”
The company had paid 200 million euros ($237 million) in the previous five-year deal and has been showing Bundesliga games live in 24 countries in the region.
A spokesman for the German league declined to comment.
BeIN blames Qatar’s regional rival Saudi Arabia for supporting a rival broadcasting outfit that it says is taking BeIN soccer feeds illegally and selling them on. The Saudi government denies the allegation.
During a failed bid for English club Newcastle United by a consortium headed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, BeIN wrote to all the Premier League’s 20 clubs warning them not to throw their support behind the Saudis, who they blame for allowing piracy of the league’s content.
Earlier this year, BeIN blacked out the opening matches in the restarted Italian Serie A calendar after demanding a discount and failing to agree terms.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>",Britain's financial watchdog sets out rules for cannabis listings,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog opened the door to cannabis company listings on Friday by setting out how it would navigate laws to prevent pocketing proceeds from criminal use of the drug.
The Financial Conduct Authority set out its ""approach"" to cannabis-related companies interested in a UK listing, pending public consultation on more formal guidance in due course.
The legalisation of cannabis, including for recreational use in Canada and a number of U.S. states, fuelled a speculative ""green rush"" on Toronto and New York stock markets last year, with analysts expecting some listings in Europe in 2020.
The FCA said that while medicinal cannabis was legalised in Britain in 2018, investment in overseas licensed medicial cannabis companies remains a legally complex area, with a risk of triggering broadly-defined British law that prevent financial gain from criminal activity.
Proceeds from recreational cannabis companies, even when located in countries that have legalised it, are proceeds of crime under the law, it said.
""We can't assume a person who has been licensed in an overseas country would receive a licence here in the UK as licensing regimes differ globally,"" the FCA said.
""UK-based medicinal cannabis companies can be admitted to the Official List, if the company has the appropriate Home Office licences for their activities where they are required,"" it added.
The FCA said overseas-licensed medicinal cannabis companies and cannabis oil companies could list in Britain if the proceeds of crime law does not apply, and they meet listing criteria.

1293,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",No Revenue Is No Problem in the 2020 Stock Market,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Wall Street isn’t always too fussed about whether a start-up is profitable before listing on the stock exchange. A decent track record of sales growth is usually pretty essential, though. 
That quaint idea has been turned on its head this year by the fad for special purpose acquisition companies. Called SPACs for short, they raise cash from investors in an initial public offering and then go find a company to buy. By merging with one of these cash boxes, the target gets a dollop of capital and a stock market listing without all the hassle of a traditional IPO (though the fees can be steep). So far this year, North American SPACs have raised about $38 billion, according to Bloomberg data. SPACs are so trendy, even former House speaker Paul Ryan has one. Billionaire Richard Branson wants to start one of his own too. 
The remarkable thing about some of these SPAC-backed companies is they’re going public before they’ve generated their first revenues. These businesses are selling a vision rather than a proven track record of turning that dream into reality. Investments don’t get much more speculative than that.  
The trailblazers for this were Branson’s space tourism company Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc. and electric truck maker  Nikola Corp ., which both rocketed to multi-billion dollar valuations after being taken public via SPACs. Both have yet to start commercial services.(3)
They’ll soon be joined by slew of early stage electric vehicle companies, including Fisker Inc., Canoo Holdings Ltd. and Lordstown Motors Corp.(2) Lordstown, founded a year ago when it acquired a former General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). plant to build an electric pickup truck, won’t begin commercial production until the second half of next year.  
The point of the stock market is to funnel capital to companies with bold ambitions that banks and bondholders might be wary of lending to. Early-stage life sciences companies have a long track record of raising money via an IPO to fund research and see them through the lengthy regulatory approval process. 
However if you recall the dotcom bubble, you’ll know that things don’t always work out too well when some companies go public with little more than a prototype and a business plan.
Perhaps the biggest lesson of the intense scrutiny Nikola has faced this week following a scathing short-seller report is to be wary of companies that list on the stock market before they’re ready. Nikola acknowledged rolling a truck down a hill in a 2017 promotional video, rather than having it drive under its propulsion, but it denies misleading its investors.  
“I guess you’re seeing how the sausage is made, and we went public way too early,” Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) board member Jeff Ubben told Bloomberg this week.
Is there a bubble forming again that we should be worried about? The trend for companies to go public with near zero revenue certainly reflects the current frothiness of equity markets. With Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. valued at almost $400 billion even though it remains only modestly profitable, it’s not surprising SPACs want a piece of the action. Shares of Tortoise Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, have gained 370% since June when it announced it would take heavy truck electrification company Hyliion Inc. public later this year. 
In a traditional IPO, written disclosures tend to focus on historic financial performance. But when a company merges with a SPAC, it’s permitted to publish detailed revenue and profit projections for the next several years. Consider Fisker, which is being taken public by a SPAC affiliated with private equity giant Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc. The company forecasts $10.6 billion in yearly sales and $1 billion of free cashflow by 2024, even though it won’t begin production of its Ocean electric SUV until the end of 2022.
Such forecasts doubtless help investors get comfortable investing in a company with little current revenue, but they could turn out to be a pretty unreliable guide. Developing and manufacturing a vehicle isn’t straightforward. Henrik Fisker’s first venture, Fisker Automotive Inc., filed for bankruptcy in 2013 after safety recalls and battery supply hiccups. At his new eponymous electric vehicle company, Fisker Inc., he and the chief financial officer, who’s also his wife, will together have 90% of the voting rights, according to this filing. Sub-optimal governance is another issue new companies can face.
Investing in an immature company isn’t for the faint-hearted. Absent meaningful revenues to assess each quarter, investors might struggle to judge whether the company is making progress and the hype might start to fizzle. Nikola’s first earnings as a public company were a snooze: one analyst asked,  “Is this all we get?”
Of course, as Nikola has discovered, public companies also face much greater scrutiny from shareholders and regulators, which risks diverting management attention from the task of building a viable product or service. The company may have been able to avoid some of these issues by taking more time to perfect its hydrogen and electric trucks away from the public market’s gaze.
For now, the buzz around pre-revenue companies remains intense. The hangover could be too.
(1) Virgin Galactic holds over $80 million in customer deposits, so it has at least demonstrated there's demand for space tourism.
(2) Canoo already generates some revenue from engineering services

1294,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",Stock Traders Brace for Quadruple Witching Amid Options Anxiety,"(Bloomberg) -- In a month during which the red-hot trade in technology stocks has wavered and options activity dominated headlines, traders are facing another potential catalyst for market turmoil on Friday.
Options and futures on indexes and equities are scheduled to expire, a quarterly event known as quadruple witching that typically fuels trading as large derivatives positions roll over. While spikes in volume usually occur around the open and close, providing windows of robust liquidity, large price swings can happen suddenly at any time of the day.
The event is getting more attention than usual because options activity from small investors and the so-called Nasdaq whale have been blamed for whipping up turbulence in internet and software shares. Despite an 11% drop in the Nasdaq 100 from its Sept. 2 peak, open interest on bullish contracts tied to the gauge remains elevated. So was volume in calls linked to shares of tech titans like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
“If you’re heavily long tech, the quadruple witching is going to be a real fireworks show,” Michael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at Baird, said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Alix Steel. “There is going to be a lot of action.”
Quadruple witching can spark some of the busiest trading days of the year. The last event in June saw more than 16 billion shares changing hands, 30% above the average in the previous three months.
The expiration event usually coincides with a rebalancing of major indexes such as the S&P 500 and can spark some of the busiest trading days of the year.This time, index rebalancing alone could force $32.4 billion of trades, S&P Dow Jones estimated.
“When you have those expirations, you typically get some more volatility,” said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust in Santa Ana, California. “People need to figure out what to do with them, clear out those positions off their books and potentially re-up for other ones.
About 90 million option contracts are set to expire Friday, according to data compiled by Chris Murphy, a derivatives strategist at Susquehanna. While the amount is up from a year ago, it trails the June expiration by roughly 10%.
One reason behind the shortfall is the robust use of short-dated options, especially calls sought by day traders to chase market winners, Murphy said. Because these options expire within days or weeks, few are left for quadruple witching.
Options contracts with maturities less than two weeks out comprised 75% of all trades in July, a record high, according to data compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Another unusual feature this time around is the popularity of single-stock options, particularly bullish wagers, as investors chase stock winners, rather than hedging against broad market losses. At the start of September, single stock call option volumes averaged $335 billion over 10 days, approaching the notional volume traded in index put options for the first time in at least three years, Goldman data shows.
That preference is likely to shift in coming months amid macro risks ranging from the U.S. presidential election to the path of economic reopening and trade tensions with China, according to David Silber, head of institutional equity derivatives at Citadel Securities.
“There will be an increase in index activity into year-end as people migrate out of single stock risks and focus more on the macro environment and the many events before then,” Silber said. “We can see another large expiration in Q4 closer to the size we saw in Q1, when there was a large demand for March options given the macro uncertainty around Covid.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp on Friday said more than 1,000 postal voting forms for its shareholder meeting went uncounted, and the bank that counted the votes, which carries out a similar job for almost a thousand listed companies, said the oversight may not have been limited to Toshiba.
The admissions by Toshiba and Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank are likely to deepen concerns about corporate governance in Japan at a time of new political leadership and increased scrutiny by investors.
Toshiba said that 1,139 voting forms, representing a combined 1.3% stake, were left out for its annual meeting even though they were delivered before the July 30 deadline to Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, its shareholder registry administrator.
The trust bank said those forms were not counted because they arrived a day before the appointed ""delivery date"", which led to them being omitted from the tally.
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust said it would review its procedures, but the vote-counting problem may have happened at other clients, because it uses the same vote-counting procedure.
An official of the bank told reporters at an online briefing it would investigate the handling of vote counting for about 970 listed companies that entrusted the bank with such tasks for this year's shareholder meetings.
Toshiba said it would continue its investigation and take appropriate measures, adding that the results of the annual meeting would not change even if all the uncounted votes were tallied.
Separately, the trust banking arm of Mizuho Financial Group Inc said on Friday it would investigate the adequacy of its vote-counting procedure, which is done by a joint venture with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust. The probe will cover more than 400 clients, a spokesman said.
Reuters last month reported Singapore-based hedge fund 3D Investment Partners, a major investor in Toshiba, had called for a third-party investigation into the meeting, saying its vote had not been fully recognised.

A Toshiba executive on Friday confirmed that about 1,300 voting forms with postmarks indicating they were accepted at post offices close to senders on July 27 had failed to be counted for the July 31 meeting.

The money has been sequestered from the company's Italian unit Novartis Farma SpA, suspected of selling medicines to hospitals at inflated prices as part of a scheme to fraudulently obtain reimbursement funds from the regional government.
Novartis said in a statement it rejected the ""groundless"" accusations of the Milan prosecutors and had behaved with full transparency.
Finance police conducting the investigation say that nine private hospitals in Milan took part in the scheme between 2013 and 2018, hurting the finances of the Lombardy region around Italy's financial capital.
According to the seizure decree, seen by Reuters, the hospitals were reimbursed in full by the region, omitting to declare that the real price they paid was lower thanks to credit notes issued to them by the pharmaceutical companies.
The San Donato group, the company that runs the hospitals, already paid 10.2 million euros in damages to the Lombardy authorities in December last year.
The group, contacted by Reuters, did not comment. 
Novartis said it was not aware of the economic or accounting arrangements in place between the hospitals it sells pharmaceuticals to and the regional governments they deal with. 
Mylan Italia, the Italian unit of multinational pharmaceutical group Mylan (O:MYL), is also among the companies involved in the investigation, the document shows. 
The company has filed a plea bargain proposal for a fine of 200,000 euros and a confiscation of 1.2 million euros, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. 
The request has received a green light from the public prosecutor's office and it will now be up to a judge to decide whether to accept it, the source added.

Mylan Italia declined immediate comment.

At 07:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, the Dow Futures contract fell 22 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 50 points, or 0.5%. 
On Thursday, the S&P 500 declined 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.5%, snapping a four-day winning streak, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3%, down 10% from its record high.
The major equity indexes are still on course to break a two-week losing streak, although quarterly futures and options on indexes and stocks are set to expire on Friday, an event known as quadruple witching, which could make for a volatile session.
Investors pumped nearly $24 billion into equities in the world's top economy in the week to Sept. 16, research from the Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) showed, the largest such inflows since March 2018. The inflows come after 10% pullback in Nasdaq 100 in early September.
With the Federal Reserve confirming this week that it will retain its ultra-low interest rates policy for some time, but not adding any more monetary stimulus, the focus returns to Congress and the ongoing negotiations over another relief bill.
The two sides are still struggling to come up with a compromise on how much aid to provide in a new package. That said, President Donald Trump broke ranks on Wednesday when he said he liked “the larger numbers,” implying Republican lawmakers should go for a bigger coronavirus stimulus.
The economic data slate centers around the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT). The forecast is for a reading of 75, marginally higher than 74.1 the prior month, suggesting a slowing recovery.
In corporate news, the saga surrounding TikTok continues amid reports that China's ByteDance, its current owner, is planning a U.S. initial public offering of TikTok Global, the potential new company. Video games maker Unity Software (NYSE:U) will also be in focus after pricing its IPO offering above its marketing range. 
Oil prices climbed Friday, with the complex set for its best week since June on the back of strong words from Saudi Arabia about adherence to agreed production cuts and reduced U.S. stockpiles.
Eyes will turn later Friday to the Baker Hughes’ weekly rig count data for any signs of life in the shale patch.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $40.98 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $43.34. Both benchmarks have seen gains of over 9% this week, the first positive week in three.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Ant Group has received approval from the Shanghai Stock Exchange for a domestic initial public offering, the bourse said on Friday, bringing the financial technology firm closer to a dual-listing expected to be worth up to $30 billion. 
Backed by Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA), Ant plans to list simultaneously in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's STAR Market, in what sources have said could be the world's largest IPO and come as soon as October.
The company is planning to seek listing approval from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as early as next week, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Ant aims to open books after China's week-long National Day holiday on October 1-7 and go public around the end of next month, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints. 
The timetable has not yet been finalised and is subject to change, they cautioned. 
Ant declined to comment on the timetables of the hearing and deal launch. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange declined to comment on individual companies or listing applications. 
Under local rules, once Ant passes the STAR Market listing committee's hearing, it can register the flotation with the securities regulator and wait for the registration to be accepted. It would then start the pricing consultation process.
Ant, controlled by Alibaba founder Jack Ma, had addressed questions raised by the Shanghai exchange over its planned IPO, as per disclosures on the bourse website last week.
The bourse had sought explanations about Ant's relationship with Alibaba, the impact of regulatory changes on its business, and comparable peers in domestic and overseas markets.

Reuters last week reported that Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings and sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd as well as Saudi Arabia's sovereign fund PIF were weighing potential investments in Ant's IPO.

1299,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Treasury Savings Bonds Can Yield More Than Junk,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It seems like a life hack for fixed-income investing.
It’s no secret that investors are living in a lower-for-longer interest rate world. In the U.S., this is clear by any number of metrics. The Federal Reserve’s key short-term lending rate is pinned in a range of 0% to 0.25% and isn’t expected to budge for years, at least; the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes is 0.69%, after never falling below 1.32% before 2020; and the Freddie Mac 30-year mortgage rate set a new five-decade low of 2.86% last week. Meanwhile, companies can borrow as cheaply as ever. One often-cited example is Ball Corp., a junk-rated aluminum-packager, which sold $1.3 billion of 10-year debt last month at 2.875%, the lowest ever for U.S. speculative-grade debt with a maturity of longer than five years.
Now what if I told you there were U.S. Treasury-guaranteed bonds that effectively yield 3.5% over 20 years?
It sounds impossible. After all, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made a big deal earlier this year about bringing back auctions of 20-year Treasury bonds, like Tuesday’s $22 billion sale, which priced to yield 1.213%. The 30-year U.S. yield peaked at 3.46% during the Fed’s last tightening cycle and is now just 1.44%. So how can a 3.5% return still exist?
In reality, the federal government offers other ways to lend to Uncle Sam besides just the $20.2 trillion of marketable U.S. Treasury securities quoted on a daily basis. One such example: Series EE savings bonds.
I admit, I never would have given these non-tradable bonds a second look if it weren’t for a recent article from David Enna, who writes the Tipswatch blog and has been a longtime investor in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, with the headline “Seeking Yield and Safety? The Best Choice Is U.S. Savings Bonds.” In it, he made the case that even though EE bonds were something of a “financial relic,” given the current level of absolute interest rates, they’re nothing short of a “nominal superstar.”
At first glance, the savings bonds appear underwhelming, with an annual interest rate of 0.1%. But here’s the key passage, located deep within the question-and-answer section about rates and terms: 
Does Treasury also guarantee the growth in value of an electronic EE Bond?
Yes. Electronic bonds are sold at face value (not half of face value). They start to earn interest right away on the full face value. Treasury guarantees that for an electronic EE Bond with a June 2003 or later issue date, after 20 years, the redemption (cash-in) value will be at least twice the purchase price of the bond.  If the redemption (cash-in) value is not at least twice the purchase price of the electronic bond as a result of applying the fixed rate of interest for those 20 years, Treasury will make a one-time adjustment at the 20-year anniversary of the bond's issue date to make up the difference.
EE Bonds continue to earn interest until they reach 30 years or you cash them, whichever comes first.
Yes, you read that correctly. The Treasury will double the face value of an EE savings bond after 20 years. Applying the so-called Rule of 72, an equation that states the amount of time for an investment to double equals 72 divided by the compounded rate of return, and fixing the time at 20 years, puts the effective yield at just more than 3.5%. At the 1.2% rate on marketable 20-year Treasuries, it would take 60 years for an investment to double.
Naturally, this elevated rate of return comes with some caveats. Most obviously, the money has to remain locked up earning 0.1% interest for 20 years before it suddenly doubles, at which point the buyer must remember to instantly cash in the bonds. Redeeming them early comes with a small penalty and an even more meager return. This also isn’t for giant pension funds or other institutional investors — Treasury has a $10,000 cap per person per year on purchases of EE bonds. It’s a strategy, in other words, that requires a lot of patience and diligence but can’t be scaled up.
The bonds’ other advantage, on top of the huge bump in value after two decades, is that they “are exempt from taxation by any State or political subdivision of a State, except for estate or inheritance taxes,” according to the Treasury. That’s a big perk for the millions of Americans living in high-tax states like California, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.
In an earlier era, given the current level of interest rates relative to the EE bond program, buying the savings bonds would be a no-brainer piece of financial advice for retail investors. Nowadays, with the prevalence of no-fee stock trading and evidence that individuals are opting for “lottery ticket” wagers in the options markets, it’s anyone’s guess whether a strategy that takes 20 years to return 3.5% is enticing enough to catch on in any meaningful way. Why bother with that when the online crowd says “stocks only go up” and the Fed seems all too happy to encourage risk taking, not to mention allowing inflation to overshoot its 2% target? 
I’d think about it this way. Young people are probably better off parking the money they can afford to invest in riskier securities, which over two decades should deliver returns better than 3.5%. Older investors may not want to wait 20 years for the face value to double. That leaves a small subset of Americans in their 40s and 50s, who already are well on their way to creating nest eggs and who are looking for a safe fixed-income alternative on the side, as the target demographic.
For those people, socking away $10,000 a year starting at age 40, which is guaranteed to turn into $20,000 a year starting at age 60 and is exempt from state and local taxes, isn’t a bad plan by any stretch. Savings accounts and certificates of deposit are likely to yield next to nothing for the foreseeable future, while interest rates on investment-grade corporate debt and even junk bonds seem headed ever lower, too. Until Fed Chair Jerome Powell starts “thinking about thinking about” raising interest rates or scales back the central bank’s bond-buying program, the real inflation-adjusted yields on Treasuries should remain deeply negative.
The phenomenon of negative real yields in the U.S. has led some money managers to conclude that stocks, junk bonds and other risky assets are their only choice, simply because there is no alternative (TINA) in fixed income. That may be true at an institutional level. But for individual investors, at least for the next few years, buying U.S. savings bonds will remain a sort of niche arbitrage opportunity worth considering.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>","Unilever's Dutch shareholders vote on unification, HQ move","By Toby Sterling, Martinne Geller and Siddharth Cavale
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Shareholders of  Unilever  NV (AS:UNA) in the Netherlands are expected to back plans to unify the consumer goods giant under a single parent company based in London and end 90 years as an Anglo-Dutch hybrid.
The result of an online vote will be released on Monday during an extraordinary shareholders' meeting streamed online due to the coronavirus, with investors in British Unilever Plc (L:ULVR) due to vote on Oct. 12. If approved by both sides, Unilever hopes to unify on Nov. 22. 
The maker of Dove soap, Surf detergent and Ben & Jerry's ice cream has argued that the dual national structure hampers its ability to conduct acquisitions and disposals quickly, such as the planned sale of its three-billion euro tea business.
""My guess is that [the vote] will pass and it will give Unilever a simpler organisational structure, making it easier for effective management actions to take place,"" said Steve Clayton, UK fund manager of the  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) Select Fund range, whose UK Income fund has a 6.2 percent weighting in Unilever.
Unilever began its push to restructure under previous management after a failed $143 billion takeover approach by Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) in February 2017.
Tax and political considerations thwarted its first attempt to unify in Rotterdam in 2018, with concerns about a 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax and forced selling by some UK shareholders once Unilever was dropped from Britain's FTSE 100.
Now, Britain's departure from the European Union gives some extra urgency, as a delay beyond this year could mean that the marriage of the company's two arms could face additional scrutiny from EU and British regulators as a cross-border merger.
""We are definitely in favour of the reunification. The situation has been running on for far too long and has presented an unnecessary distraction,"" said Freddie Lait, chief investment officer of Latitude Investment management. ""It makes complete sense ... and it should not be controversial.""
Glass Lewis, an independent share advisory group, recommends voting for unification.
The British government has also cheered the plan. Dutch politicians are less enthusiastic.
In 2018, Prime Minister Mark Rutte tried unsuccessfully to scrap the 15% tax on dividends. The cut was intended to keep Unilever and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) in the Netherlands, but became seen as a gift to rich foreign investors. 
Dutch politicians also do not want their country missing out on collecting some 300 million euros ($355 million) annual tax from Unilever, leading an opposition party to propose an ""Exit Tax"". 
Unilever says that idea violates European law, but if enacted as proposed, it would cost the company 11 billion euros -- enough to derail unification once again. 

""If it doesn't happen, the last hundred years or so suggests that Unilever will continue to thrive, all around the globe,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown's Clayton.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 06:51AM ET</span>",Burps to burgers: food companies wrangle climate-warming cattle emissions,"By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Looking to improve milk production, California farmer John Verwey turned to a Swiss-made feed additive designed to make a cow more efficient while reducing methane emissions from cattle burps.
The more a cow belches, the more it spends energy that could be used instead for milk production, Verwey reasoned. So two years ago, he started feeding his cattle Agolin, made of coriander, clove and carrot extracts, and replaced costlier additives that promoted weight gain. 
He is still determining whether the change has affected milk output, but Verwey figures he has positioned himself for a world where consumers care more about greenhouse gas emissions from livestock.
""We think we're ahead of the curve,"" he said from Fresno, California. ""Everyone should be trying their best to prevent pollution.""
Major food companies are stepping into the space. Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) and chocolate producer Barry Callebaut have partnered with startup Agolin, while in July, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) started serving burgers made from less gassy cattle at several U.S. Burger King restaurants.
Their plans hinge on farmers and the companies that buy the meat and milk they produce adopting cattle feed additives that inhibit gas. It is a tiny market that developers say is poised for multibillion-dollar sales.
The shift comes as meat and dairy industries face competition from substitutes for their products due to the perception they are healthier and less damaging to the environment.
Livestock emit 14.5% of the world's greenhouse gases that are related to human activity such as farming, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Nearly two-thirds of those emissions come from cattle, including through burps, flatulence and manure.
1 MILLION LOW-BURPING CATTLE
Ruminant animals like cattle produce methane as microbes ferment fibrous carbohydrates in their stomachs into digestible form.
Farmers feed Agolin to 1 million head of cattle in Europe, and another 250,000 head of American cattle, double its total sales volume five years ago, said Kurt Schaller, Agolin's managing director.
Feeding Agolin to some of the cows in Nestle's supply chain is one part of Nestle's net zero carbon commitment, said Robert Erhard, head of dairy sourcing for the maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Coffee-mate.
Generating more milk per cow reduces the animal's emissions on a per-liter basis, he said. 
Barry Callebaut feeds Agolin to a ""low single-digit"" percentage of cows in its supply chain, said spokesman Frank Keidel. 
Within two years, feed company DSM intends to launch sales in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Latin America.
The global market for methane-inhibitor feeds could reach 1 billion to 2 billion euros ($1.18 billion to $2.37 billion) by 2030, said Mark van Nieuwland, director of DSM's ""Clean Cow"" program.
DSM is testing its Bovaer product with several food companies, including New Zealand dairy cooperative Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd and Arla Foods Amba.
Mootral, another Swiss startup, plans to launch commercial sales in 2021, feeding 300,000 head of cattle, and adding at least another 1 million head by 2022, said Chief Executive Thomas Hafner.
To be sure, a few million cattle producing less methane would amount to a tiny fraction of the global 1.3 billion-head cattle herd.
""Agriculture, and food in general, it's not a very fast industry,"" Schaller said. ""A new concept needs time.""
While global sales of methane-reducing feed may amount to just $30 million in 2021, such sales may hit several billion dollars within five years, Hafner said.
""If (all feed suppliers combined) aren't in 50 million animals by 2025, we've done something very wrong,"" Hafner said.
Cattle methane-reducing efforts made headlines when Restaurant Brands began selling lower-methane Whoppers.
The pilot project is a bet that reduced cattle emissions will soon matter to consumers, said Matt Banton, Restaurant Brands' head of global innovation and sustainability.
""We're preparing for a future where that becomes a much bigger criteria.""
The U.S. livestock sector has become more efficient and less emissions-intensive in recent years thanks to better use of feed and veterinary care and due to improved animal genetics, said Frank Mitloehner, professor of animal science at the University of California, Davis.
Mitloehner sees promise in feed solutions, but he sharply criticized Burger King's methane-reducing claims as premature and noted its marketing materials wrongly identified flatulence, rather than burps, as a major emission source.
Banton, of Restaurant Brands, agreed the company needs to do much more research.
Investors, however, are starting to pay attention to cattle methane emissions.
A Sarasin & Partners fund invests in DSM because of its efforts to help produce more sustainable food, such as through Bovaer, said Jeneiv Shah, global equity analyst at Sarasin.
FAIRR, a global investor network focused on risks with intensive animal farming, is concerned that strategies like Burger King's ""simply aren't ambitious enough,"" said research manager Faazi Adam. 
But feed makers hope to benefit from the attention to methane that the burger giant generated.
""It's positive that Burger King goes in this direction,"" Schaller of Agolin said. ""It shows the need - and for me, competition is healthy.""

1304,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 06:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: International lenders back $9.5 billion financing for Russia's Arctic LNG 2 - document,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - International lenders have lined up about $9.5 billion in financial support for a Russian Arctic liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, a document seen by Reuters showed, even as such projects come under greater scrutiny over climate concerns.
The $21 billion project, which received final investment approval a year ago, is expected to be launched in 2023 and to reach its full capacity of almost 20 million tonnes per year in 2026. 
While the energy industry touts natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal or crude, it is a source of carbon emissions and critics say LNG projects are hard to reconcile with the transition to low-carbon economy envisaged in the Paris climate agreement and the European Union's Green Deal economic plan. 
The interest of international institutions, however, gives a boost for the Arctic LNG 2 development, led by Russian non-state company Novatek (MM:NVTK) as Moscow's plans to raise its share in the global LNG market.
Among them is French state investment bank and credit agency Bpifrance, with an offer of $700 million in credit finance, the China Development Bank, expected to offer a facility worth $5 billion and Germany's Euler Hermes, with a covered facility of $300 million, the document said.
Alongside Bpifrance's support, the document said a number of other state-backed institutions are also expected to help fund the project including the China Development Bank, which is expected to offer a facility equivalent to $5 billion.
The Japan Bank for International Cooperation is also seen providing a facility of $2.5 billion; an unnamed Russian bank $1.5 billion and Italy's SACE a covered facility of $1 billion. 
Russian top lender Sberbank (MM:SBER) has already earlier said it was ready to provide more than 2.7 billion euros in financing for the project, which aims to process gas from the Gydan Peninsula and ship 80% of LNG to Asia.
The lineup described in the document, if backed in full, would cover the need for the external financing, earlier estimated by Novatek at $9-$11 billion.
The project's equity partners include France's  Total  (PA:TOTF), China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL], China's CNOOC (HK:0883) and the Japan Arctic LNG consortium made up of Mitsui & Co (T:8031) and state-owned JOGMEC, formally known as Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp.
While Bpifrance's recommendation, detailed in an internal document, comes with caveats and could yet be rejected by the government, its support highlights the importance of the project for one of France's industrial champions.
The document said Bpifrance Assurance Export gave a ""favourable opinion"" to the strategic project guarantee ""subject to subsequent examination of the project's risk profile and its economic fundamentals"" and with a ""strong reserve"" waiting for the finalisation of the environmental and social analysis.
Bpifrance and Total both declined to comment and Novatek had no immediate comment.
Relations between Europe and Russia, including energy, remain tense after a poisoning attempt of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny sparked calls for another key energy project between the two, Nord Stream 2, to be ditched.
The role of European development institutions in bank-rolling LNG projects around the world has also come under greater scrutiny given EU's ambitious climate goals.
Export credit agencies such as Bpifrance provide government-backed loans, guarantees, credits and insurance to private companies to help make it easier for them to do business abroad.
A spokeswoman for JBIC, which has already announced one loan for up to 125 million euros ($148.29 million) to help Mitsui & Co and the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation take an equity stake in the venture, declined to comment on the Bpifrance document as she could not confirm the figure.
SACE declined to comment. CDB did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Euler Hermes directed the question to the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy.
The ministry said it was not ""not authorized to provide third parties with any information in this respect"".

The administrator told an SAA creditor meeting that the government's communication had the support of National Treasury but the timelines and mechanisms for the funding were yet to be finalised.
The administrators took control of SAA in December after almost a decade of financial losses and published a rescue plan for the airline in June following repeated delays and wrangling over its future.
But the plan, which envisages scaling back SAA's fleet and cutting jobs, needs at least 10 billion rand to work, and the cash has not materialised since July, when creditors approved the restructuring plan.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) said on Friday it had been forced to cut its capacity in October and that it may have to do the same for the rest of the winter unless European Union governments ease their COVID-19 travel restrictions. 
The budget airline, whose Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary last week described the winter as a ""write-off"", said it would fly around 40% of the capacity it flew last October, down from an earlier plan of 50%.
""If current trends and EU governments’ mismanagement of the return of air travel and normal economic activity continue, then similar capacity cuts may be required across the winter period,"" a Ryanair spokeswoman said in a statement.
The capacity reductions, it said, were required ""due to damage caused to forward bookings by continuous changes in EU Government travel restrictions and policies, many of which are introduced at short notice."" 
It called for a proposed coordinated EU system of restrictions to be implemented immediately. 
Airlines across Europe have blamed an uneven patchwork of travel restrictions and quarantine rules for a stop-go recovery that has proven tougher than many expected.

Ahead of the latest cuts, O'Leary said last week he expected to fly around 50 million passengers in the fiscal year to March, one-third of the previous year's number.

1307,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 05:42AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Covestro-Apollo Report Strengthens the Case for Cyclicals,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- A week dominated by IPOs that showed the insatiable demand for growth is ending with a story that – just about – keeps the tired old narrative of rotation into value stocks alive.
Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) is looking at a possible acquisition of German chemicals company Covestro (DE:1COV), a fine example of a beaten-down cyclical stock whose inherent strengths have been largely forgotten amidst the chaos of this year.
Covestro, which was spun out of the conglomerate Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) as it pursued the higher valuations attached to life sciences stocks, is a classic cyclical. While much of the buzz around its spin-off was generated by how its advanced plastics can make the cars of the future lighter, it only generates one-fifth of its revenue from automotive. The rest is spread relatively evenly among the furniture, construction, electronics, chemicals and health and cosmetics sector. As such, its exposure is split between business investment and discretionary consumer spending.  
The cycle has been hard on Covestro for the last two years. EBITDA peaked in 2017 at 3.4 billion euros ($4.0 billion) and had already halved by 2019 as President Donald Trump’s trade assaults on China hit a market which accounts for one quarter of its revenues.
The pandemic has made things substantially worse: revenue was down 23% in the first half and the group’s lack of visibility left it forecasting full-year EBITDA for 2020 at anything between 700 million and 1.2 billion euros. Net debt, at nearly 3.2 billion, will be over four times EBITDA at the bottom of that range.
Short-term investors tend to get rattled by such developments, and a debt downgrade from Moody’s in June to Baa2, with a negative outlook, didn’t help much either.
However, the traditional strength of private-equity buyers like Apollo is their willingness to look through cyclical volatility. Apollo has already made one killing in the chemicals sector with its investment in LyondellBasell after the financial crisis. By comparison with Lyondell’s at the time, Covestro’s balance sheet today look like a veritable fortress. If confirmed, interest in Covestro from a buyout group with that track record would therefore be a massive vote of confidence.
Even after a 7% rise on Friday in response to the news, which leaves it 74% above its March lows, Covestro’s shares are still barely at half their cyclical peak back in 2018.
While it may still be a while before the cycle turns decisively in its favor, reports of such interest are a strong argument that the downside from here is limited."

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) has agreed to buy U.S.-based wireless networking company Cradlepoint in a $1.1 billion deal, the Swedish telecoms gear maker said on Friday, as part of plans to expand its 5G-related products for business customers.
The deal, Ericsson's largest in more than a decade, would give it access to tools that can connect devices using the so-called Internet of Things over a 4G or a 5G network. 
""We think this will give our customers a chance to generate new income sources within the enterprise segment,"" Ericsson finance chief Carl Mellander told Reuters.
Ericsson plans to sell Cradlepoint products to its mobile operator customers, who can create new revenue streams by selling it to their business clients.
Cradlepoint, which will become a subsidiary of Ericsson, sells routers and a subscription-based wireless networking service. 
A rival of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Cradlepoint had sales of 1.2 billion crowns ($137 million) in 2019, with a gross margin of 61%. Ericsson estimates that Cradlepoint's revenue will be about 1.6 billion crowns this year.
""The acquisition is expensive, but the price tag is tolerable given high underlying growth rates and Ericsson's potential for revenue expansion in the enterprise market,"" said Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) analyst Aleksander Peterc.
While Cradlepoint has mostly focused on the U.S. market, Ericsson aims to take the products outside North America and plans to keep it as a standalone business with its own sales team. 
""Where we have struggled in the past is when we have started to integrate on the sales side. That's when you lose track of all your go-to-market channels and customer interactions,"" said Ericsson CEO Borje Ekholm.
Ericsson's last big deal was in 2007, when it bought data network equipment vendor Redback Networks for $2.1 billion.
The transaction, which is expected to close before the end of this year, will dent Ericsson's operating margins by about 1% in 2021 and 2022. The company expects the takeover to start contributing to operating cash flow from 2022. 

Ericsson said its 2022 group financial targets remain unchanged.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will launch its first online store in India on Sept. 23, the iPhone maker said on Friday, coinciding with the country's holiday season that brings some of the biggest sales for retailers every year.
Apple sells its products in India through third-party vendors and e-commerce operators such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Indian unit and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc-owned Flipkart.
The Cupertino, California-based tech giant's iPhones are coveted by tens of millions of Indians but their price keeps them out of the reach of many.
Chinese companies led by Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp dominate in the world's second-biggest smartphone market, with Apple accounting for just 1% of shipments.
Through its online retail platform, Apple plans to offer assistance to customers in English and Hindi, while allowing users to personalise some devices, including iPads, with engravings, it said.
The website will also allow Mac customers to configure their laptops according to their needs.
The opening of Apple's online store presents another challenge for bricks-and-mortar retailers whose business has suffered due to discounts by e-tailers, said Subhash Chandra L, managing director of Sangeetha Mobiles.
""At least some of Apple's die-hard customers are likely to shift to buying from its online store,"" said Chandra whose chain operates more than 650 stores across southern and western India. 
""But we've learned to compete with online retailers.""
China's Xiaomi, RealMe and OnePlus also sell smartphones from their websites, besides Amazon and Flipkart.
Apple is building its first company-run retail store in India, in the financial capital of Mumbai, with plans to launch in 2021.
India offers huge growth prospects for device makers and competitive labour costs for electronics manufacturing.
Apple assembles some of its smartphone models, including the iPhone 11, at Taiwanese contract manufacturers Foxconn and Wistron's plants in south India.

Foxconn plans to invest up to $1 billion to expand a south India factory where it assembles iPhones, Reuters reported previously.

""I can confirm that I will go on Monday with junior Economy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher to Bethune to meet with local officials and staff representatives,"" Borne told Sud Radio on Friday.
""We want Bridgestone to review all scenarios. It is its responsibility to look at all alternatives.""
Separately, government spokesman Gabriel Attal told Europe 1 radio that Bridgestone representatives would be present during the visit.
""We will do all we can to find a future for the plant,"" he said.
Bridgestone said on Wednesday that it would begin talks to close the factory in Bethune, which opened in 1961 and employs 863 people, in the face of weak demand for low-profile tyres, its main product.

Reserves were called up to help patrol the border, the State Border Committee said in a statement posted on Telegram Friday.
Lukashenko, who’s facing the biggest challenge of his 26-year rule after the country’s disputed Aug. 9 vote, has blamed the West for inciting mass protests that have shown no sign of flagging and drawn closer to Russia.
“We’ve been forced to withdraw the troops from the streets, put half of the army on high alert and close the state border from the west, primarily with Lithuania and Poland,” Lukashenko said Thursday, addressing a women-only support rally at an ice hockey arena in Minsk. “We have been forced to strengthen the state border, unfortunately, with our fraternal Ukraine.”
Lukashenko last month made an as-yet empty threat to shift cargo flows from Lithuanian ports to Russia.
The borders remained open Friday and Polish and Lithuanian officials said they’re watching the situation. Lines haven’t formed yet at border check points to Lithuania, according to live monitoring information on the Baltic country’s State Border Committee website.
“There have been statements that half of the army has been thrown to guard the Western border, as if something is threatening from here, something is going to attack,” Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said in an interview with Lithuanian Radio. “This is an unbalanced response to the situation from an unbalanced person.”"

Investing.com - European stock markets drifted lower Friday, amid concerns about the economic recovery as a resurgence in the coronavirus weighs. A number of M&A deals has helped temper the losses.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded flat, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.3%. 
U.K. retail sales rose 0.8% on the month in August, data showed Friday, slightly better than the 0.7% predicted, but still a sharp slowdown from the 3.7% growth seen in July. This follows the pattern seen in the U.S. Thursday, as employment and housing data pointed to a slowdown in the country’s economic recovery.
While a rebound of sorts is underway in Europe as lockdown restrictions have been eased and businesses reopened, France, Spain and the U.K. among others are grappling with a virus resurgence.
That is raising the very real possibility of renewed restrictions and lockdowns.
""A flaring in the number of Covid-19 infections over the summer months has made it very clear that if there is no effective vaccine, growth will be handicapped,"" said Peter Vanden Houte, chief economist at ING.
Investors are still fretting over the Federal Reserve’s decision not to add additional stimulus while Congress argues over a new relief bill and with the European Union’s 750 billion euro recovery fund only due to kick in next year.
Still, news of potential mergers and acquisitions within the region has helped the tone.
Covestro (DE:1COV) stock soared 6.7% after Bloomberg reported that buyout firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) is weighing up the acquisition of the plastics manufacturer. Bayer (DE:BAYGN), which holds a 7.5% stake in Covestro, also outperformed, rising 0.3%.
Caixabank (MC:CABK) gained 0.8% after its acquisition of state-owned lender  Bankia  (MC:BKIA), down 2%, was approved by both boards, potentially creating Spain's biggest domestic bank. That comes as their two biggest rivals,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA), both plumb 52-week lows.
Additionally, the  London Stock Exchange  (LON:LSE) rose 0.6% after it revealed it had entered into exclusive discussions with  Euronext  (PA:ENX), which gained 4.2%, in relation to the sale of the Borsa Italiana group.
Elsewhere,  Man Group  (LON:EMG) rose 0.7% after saying it will start a new share-buyback program of up to $100 million.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>",SoftBank exits cellphone distributor Brightstar in telecoms sell-down,"By Sam Nussey and Chris Gallagher
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) said on Friday it would sell U.S. cellphone distributor Brightstar for an undisclosed price, marking the latest sale of telecoms assets as the Japanese conglomerate builds a cash pile. 
SoftBank will sell the money-losing firm to a newly formed subsidiary of private equity firm Brightstar Capital Partners for cash plus a 25% stake in the subsidiary, it said in a statement. 
Brightstar Capital, founded by a former chief operating officer (COO) at the handset distributor, has $2.1 billion in assets under management and is not affiliated with Brightstar, SoftBank said.
The sale marks SoftBank's latest move away from the telecoms industry, as it slashes holdings in wireless carrier SoftBank Corp (T:9434) to 40% and following the merger of Sprint with T-Mobile US (O:TMUS).
SoftBank explored a Brightstar sale to shed lower-growth businesses in 2018, people familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time. Brightstar could be valued at more than $1 billion, the people said.
Brightstar's founder, Bolivian-born billionaire Marcelo Claure, has risen since SoftBank's 2014 acquisition to become group COO and is seen as a candidate to succeed founder Masayoshi Son as chief executive. 
SoftBank's founder has a reputation for buying and not selling, but in recent months has sold assets in excess of a plan announced in March to stabilise the group's balance sheet and fund buybacks.
This week, SoftBank said it would sell chip designer Arm to  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) for as much as $40 billion, in an early exit from an asset lionised by Son.
The group's mounting cash pile and bets on the share market and derivatives are seen as deepening uncertainty over its strategic direction. Its shares closed down 1%.
Son frequently bemoans the gap between the value of the group's portfolio and its share price. Executives have held early stage talks about taking the group private, a source has told Reuters.

The Brightstar transaction, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, is expected to close by March 31, 2021, SoftBank said.

The uptick in French infections mirrors steady increases across Europe, with the number of new cases in Germany rising Friday by more than 2,000, the most since late April. Portugal on Thursday reported the most new infections in five months, with 770, while Spanish cases rose at a slower pace than the previous day but still by more than 4,500.
Health officials blame the increase on social gatherings, especially among younger people, and on travelers bringing the virus back from vacation. The upward trend threatens to derail Europe’s recovery from a collapse in activity in the second quarter, should governments be forced to further tighten restrictions on movement.
Speculation swirled Friday that the Spanish government might be forced to put the Madrid region back into some kind of lockdown and possibly reimpose a state of emergency in the capital. Austria is banning indoor meetings of more than 10 people from Monday after bars, clubs and private parties fueled new infections.
“We are noticing that we have an exponential increase,” Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said Thursday in Vienna. “We have to react now to avoid a second lockdown.”
The pace of coronavirus infections in France has been steadily climbing for a month, and there were 10,593 new cases Thursday. Deaths linked to the virus increased by 50 to 31,095.
The government has asked local authorities to propose measures to control the spread in Lyon and Nice, which have some of the highest rates of infections. The city of Marseille on France’s Mediterranean coast has already taken “strong” steps, though it may have to take further measures such as closing bars and barring gatherings if the number of patients in intensive care there keeps rising, Veran said in Paris.
France is sticking to a strategy of local measures to control the epidemic, Veran said. The government has said it wants to avoid a new nationwide lockdown, and President Emmanuel Macron said this week that citizens need to learn to live with the virus.
“The virus did not become less dangerous with the summer, alas,” Veran said. “Therefore a more active circulation of the virus necessarily ends up resulting in more hospitalizations and more serious cases in intensive care.”
The number of hospitalizations and patients in intensive care has also started to climb in the past two weeks. The number of ICU patients on Wednesday rose above 800 for the first time since mid-June. Veran said that while the virus has been actively spreading among young people, most people in intensive care are elderly.
“It is circulating more and more among the over-65s, and this since the start of August,” Veran said. “We are now seeing the number of Covid patients in intensive care go up in a worrying way.”
France has increased testing for the virus to around a million tests a week, after the government in July said anyone could get tested without a prescription and be fully reimbursed by public health insurance. Scientists have called for more targeted testing to prevent laboratories from running out of reagents, as an influx of people seeking tests threatens to swamp capacity.
Veran said that with an increase in testing, there’s been “gridlock,” particularly in large cities where confirmed cases result in large numbers of contact testing. France doesn’t have a lack of reagents, and any testing delays have been a question of organization, the minister said.
France has drawn up a protocol to give testing priority to people with a prescription or with symptoms, contact cases and health-care professionals, and is adding testing sites, according to Veran. The country has also ordered 5 million rapid tests that will be evaluated by health authorities, Veran said.

Investing.com – Asian stocks mostly saw modest gains on Friday morning, with some indexes reversing earlier losses. However, they were struggling to maintain momentum as yet another U.S. tech stocks selloff on Thursday caused investors to tread with caution.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.05% 10:51 PM ET (3:51 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that the core consumer price index (CPI), inclusive of oil products but excluding volatile fresh food prices, fell 0.4% in August year-on-year.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.21%. In Australia, the  ASX 200 inched up 0.02% and Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index edged down 0.11%. Hong Kong-listed Tencent was one of the gaming companies asked to provide further information about their data-security protocols by the U.S. on Thursday.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.10% and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.20%. Investors were keeping an eye on China-U.S. relations after TikTok buyer Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) reached a tentative agreement to terms for its bid for the app’s U.S. operations with the U.S. Treasury Department and TikTok owner ByteDance. Oracle accepted a revised term sheet sent by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday, with the changes reportedly addressing national security concerns related to the transaction.
The Bank of England (BOE) was the latest central bank to hand down its policy decision, saying on Thursday that it was considering negative interest rates in the wake of the rising number of COVID-19 cases, high unemployment rates, and the possibility of a hard Brexit. It also announced a hold on its main stimulus programs over a better-than-expected economic recovery from COVID-19.
Some investors agreed with the BOE approach.
“Delivering net economic stimulus this way absolutely can be done,” ANZ chief economist Sharon Zollner told Reuters, in reference to negative interest rates, which are also under consideration by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.
“But will prolonged super-low rates stimulate the ‘right’ behaviors from a long-run perspective? That’s a problem for another day,” she added.
However, more stimulus measures are expected across the Pond, after the U.S. Federal Reserve handed down its own policy address on Wednesday, which said that low interest rates would be in place for years to come.
“Fiscal policy needs to really step up,” Perpetual Investment Management Ltd head of investment strategy for multi-asset Matthew Sherwood told Bloomberg.
“Consumer sentiment data and the employment picture still reflect a fragile recovery which needs to be bolstered by higher incomes,” he added.
Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases continues an ever-continuing climb. The number of global cases topped 30 million as of September 18, according to Johns Hopkins University data."

(Reuters) - China's ByteDance is planning a U.S. initial public offering of TikTok Global, the new company that will operate the popular short video app, should its proposed deal be cleared by the U.S. government, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
ByteDance is racing to clinch an agreement with the White House that will stave off a U.S. ban on TikTok that President Donald Trump has threatened could happen as early as next week.
Trump ordered ByteDance last month to divest TikTok amid U.S. concerns that the personal data of as many as 100 million Americans who use the app could be passed on to China's Communist Party government. 
On Wednesday, he reiterated he was opposed to ByteDance retaining majority ownership of TikTok.
The White House and ByteDance have agreed to a term sheet on some aspects of a deal, although Trump has not yet approved it, one of the sources said. Top ByteDance U.S. investors,  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and potentially Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc would hold at least a 60% stake in TikTok's U.S. operations, the source said.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said the situation was still fluid. 
""There's no definite proposal that the president's being asked to consider or reject at this point,"" Meadows told reporters. 
The new company, dubbed TikTok Global, will have a majority of American directors, a U.S. chief executive and a security expert on the board, the source added. Oracle has agreed to eventually own a 20% stake in the company, according to the source. If Walmart also successfully negotiates acquiring a stake, its CEO, Doug McMillon, would get a seat on TikTok Global's board, the source said.
Trump said that his administration talked with Walmart and Oracle on Thursday but ""nothing much has changed"" regarding a deal.
He added, without giving details, ""I guess Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is still involved."" Microsoft said on Sunday its offer for TikTok was rejected. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
""We'll make a decision soon,"" Trump said.
An IPO of TikTok would be one of the technology sector's biggest-ever stock market debuts, given that the app was recently valued by ByteDance investors at more than $50 billion. It would further reduce ByteDance's stake in the company to appease U.S. officials who want to see the Chinese firm loosen its grip on the video app.
The filing of the IPO would be on a U.S. stock exchange and could come in about a year, the sources said.
There is no certainty over whether Trump will sign off on the agreement. It was also not immediately clear what assets TikTok Global would own beyond the app's assets in the United States. ByteDance has offered to create 25,000 new U.S. jobs with TikTok headquartered in the United States as it seeks to win Trump's blessing for a deal, Reuters has reported.
It was also not clear whether ByteDance could present the deal to China as keeping majority ownership of TikTok. Chinese officials have said they do not want ByteDance to agree to a forced sale, and the company's proposal to the White House this week called for it to retain majority ownership of TikTok.
The board of TikTok Global would include a national security director, who will be approved by the U.S. and chair a security committee overseeing the protection of user data, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The term sheet will grant Oracle the right to inspect TikTok's source code and includes numerous provisions to ensure data security and requirement that all U.S. users data remains in the United States housed by Oracle, the source said.
It is not clear what Oracle or Walmart will pay for a stake. Oracle, Walmart and Treasury did not immediately comment.
Meadows said on Thursday that the administration is still looking at details of the deal and whether it meets national security thresholds. Meadows said if TikTok remains predominantly Chinese-run under the Oracle deal, that would not meet Trump’s objectives.
CHINA APPROVAL
ByteDance said on Thursday it would need China to approve the proposed deal with the White House, indicating how its bid to stave off a ban in the United States could be further complicated.
As many as 40% of Americans back Trump's threat to ban TikTok if it is not sold to a U.S. buyer, a Reuters/Ipsos national poll found last month. Among Republicans - Trump's party - 69% said they supported the order, though only 32% expressed familiarity with the app.
The White House has stepped up efforts to purge what it deems ""untrusted"" Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks. Beyond TikTok, Trump has also issued an order prohibiting transactions with Tencent Holding Ltd's messenger app WeChat.
Earlier this year, Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd sold gay dating app Grindr, bought in 2016, for $620 million after CFIUS ordered its divestment.

ByteDance acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly - whose user base was largely American - for $1 billion in 2017 without seeking CFIUS approval, relaunching it as TikTok the following year. Reuters reported last year that CFIUS was investigating TikTok.

1323,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 10:27PM ET</span>",TikTok’s Owner Is Gaining Confidence Beijing Will Okay U.S. Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. is getting more confident its envisioned alliance with  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). will pass muster with China’s regulators, a critical step in the political clash over the popular video app, people familiar with the matter said.
While Beijing has asserted its right to block the sale of critical technologies, it is likely to greenlight the deal as long as it doesn’t involve the transfer of the artificial intelligence algorithms that drive TikTok’s service, they said, asking not to be identified discussing a private deal. That’s true even if ByteDance were to cede majority control over TikTok, they said.
ByteDance had reached a deal with Oracle and later made revisions put forward by the Treasury Department aimed at addressing U.S. national security concerns, Bloomberg reported Thursday. The proposal calls for ByteDance to own most of TikTok, with Oracle, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and venture capital investors holding a minority. But President Donald Trump, who’s threatened to ban the app on national security grounds, has final say on the transaction and has said he doesn’t want the Chinese parent to retain majority control.
It’s unclear if ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming will relinquish that much ownership over the app he’s built into a challenger to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). But the Chinese government’s stance gives him that option, so long as he maintains a tight grip over the service’s technology.

Under the existing proposal, Oracle has power to review the software or source code underlying the TikTok service, but ByteDance maintains ownership. That technological division could remain even if American investors end up with control of TikTok’s equity. Oracle and ByteDance have accepted Treasury’s conditions -- that a newly formed TikTok would have a board of directors entirely consisting of American citizens and a national security committee that reports to Cifus, people familiar with the talks have said.
ByteDance executives have also spoken to Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom about a possible role in the new organization, according to another person familiar with the discussions. It’s not clear if the discussions are advanced, the person said.
ByteDance representatives declined to comment. In its latest statement to Chinese media, ByteDance said a final deal needs approval from Chinese and U.S. regulators.
TikTok has emerged as a top target in Trump’s effort to crack down on China ahead of the Nov. 3 election. The president is trailing his Democratic opponent Joe Biden in the polls and seeking to use a tough stance with Beijing as a selling point to voters. That’s despite the fact that American investors collectively hold roughly 40% of ByteDance’s equity, with the rest owned by Zhang, his employees and a clutch of non-U.S. investors such as SoftBank Group Corp., a person familiar with the structure has said.
On the flip side, there are signs Beijing is backing one of its biggest internet companies, firing off a litany of comments condemning U.S. “coercion” and “bullying.” ByteDance also recently acquired a company with a coveted national digital payment license — a competitive arena that Beijing rigidly controls.
“ByteDance has been trying to get this license for a long time,” said Mason Xu, founding partner of Heyi Capital. “The fact that it happened only recently, I would say -- at least from an external perspective -- it is a kind of endorsement from the Chinese government.”
Despite the revised terms of the Oracle deal, Trump administration officials remain wary about the proposed new ownership structure and how much influence that would give China over the company. If Trump balks, ByteDance and Oracle may have to tweak the deal.
In their opening proposal to the Trump administration, ByteDance and Oracle outlined a plan to create a standalone company for TikTok. Oracle and other American investors -- including Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic and Coatue Management -- would get minority stakes in the new business. The newly formed U.S. company will then hire 25,000 American workers in a wide range of jobs from content moderation and engineering to product and marketing.
But importantly, ByteDance will not sell or transfer its proprietary technologies to Oracle. The newly created company isn’t going to recreate the powerful algorithms that ByteDance has built and trained with the help of data collected over many years, one of the people said.
Instead, the U.S. software giant will be able to check all source code to make sure there’re no back doors that may let ByteDance gather data on the video-sharing app’s users, according to people familiar with the matter. The world’s second-largest software maker can continue to review the code as updates come in, to make sure ByteDance doesn’t create new points of access to the data, the people said. ByteDance itself will still have visibility into the algorithms, but Oracle will be able to monitor the data flows and review and approve all updates to the code.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 07:46PM ET</span>",Judge blocks 'politically motivated' changes to U.S. Postal Service ahead of election,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday blocked controversial changes to the United States postal service, saying they were ""a politically motivated attack"" that had slowed the nation's mail and likely would slow the delivery of ballots in the upcoming presidential election.
U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian in Yakima, Washington, said he was issuing a nationwide injunction sought by 14 states in a case against U.S. President Donald Trump, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, and the U.S. Postal Service over July changes to the service.
The 14 states, led by Washington, had filed a motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to immediately halt a ""leave mail behind"" policy that required postal trucks to leave at certain times, regardless of whether mail was loaded. 
The states also asked for all election mail be treated as first-class mail, for the replacement of necessary sorting machines that had been removed, and for the postal service to abide by DeJoy's commitment to suspend the changes until after the Nov. 3 election.
DeJoy, a Trump supporter, said in August that he would halt many of the cost-cutting changes he put in place until after the presidential election after Democrats accused him of trying to put his thumb on the scales to help Trump, which he has denied. A surge in mail-in ballots is expected because of the coronavirus pandemic.
""The states have demonstrated that the defendants are involved in a politically motivated attack on the efficiency of the postal service,"" the judge said after about 2 1/2 hours of arguments that Reuters heard by phone. 
""They have also demonstrated that this attack on the postal service is likely to irreparably harm the states' ability to administer the 2020 general election.""
The judge said the preliminary injunction would essentially be issued as the states requested and he would file a written order with details, likely later on Thursday.
U.S. Postal Service spokesman Dave Partenheimer said while the agency was exploring its legal options, it was ""ready and committed to handle whatever volume of election mail it receives. 
""Our number one priority is to deliver election mail on-time,"" Partenheimer said.
Lee Moak, election mail committee chair of the postal service's board of governors, called any suggestion of a politically motivated attack on efficiency ""completely and utterly without merit.""
At the hearing, Kristin Beneski, a lawyer for the Washington Attorney General, told the judge critical mail already had been delayed for weeks at a time, including ballots. She also noted reports that postal trucks had left for cross-country trips empty.
Attorney Joseph Borson, who represented the defendants, said the postal service was prepared to timely deliver election mail and that the problems have largely been resolved. 
He also said that the states were required to bring the matter to the Postal Regulatory Commission, not the courts.
""The postal service has and will continue to do extraordinary efforts to ensure all ballots are delivered,"" Borson said, but added there are ""physical limits to what it's able to do.""
Besides Washington, states joining the lawsuit include Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin. 
Similar lawsuits by states are pending in Pennsylvania and New York. 

""Today’s victory protects a critical institution for our country,” Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said after the ruling. “Americans can now confidently vote by mail and have their voices heard.”

CHICAGO/SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. air accident investigator said on Thursday that proposed safety upgrades in the  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX jet were ""positive progress"" toward meeting cockpit and systems recommendations it made after faulting Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration last year for development flaws following fatal crashes.
The comments from National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt were submitted during a 45-day public comment period for proposed 737 MAX design and operating changes laid out by the U.S. FAA last month.
The changes could pave the way for the U.S. FAA to lift a ban on the jet, potentially before year-end. The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide 18-months ago after crashes killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia and raised questions about FAA certification of the aircraft.
In a separate filing on Thursday, victims' families urged additional steps including a full aerodynamic review, saying the changes ""fail to address the root cause of the problem: the 737 MAX's inherent aerodynamic instability.""
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.
In their filing, victims' families said Boeing's proposed modification of a key software system called MCAS linked to both crashes does not address the jet's underlying aerodynamic problem, introduces greater complexity, and may create additional failure modes.
The families called for a complete aerodynamic evaluation of the 737 MAX to understand the airplane's pitch-up tendency and a simplified crew alert system so that pilots are not overwhelmed by multiple warning systems. 
In both crashes, the MCAS flight control system, triggered by erroneous data from a single angle-of-attack airflow sensor, repeatedly and forcefully pushed down the jet's nose as pilots struggled to regain control.
If the MAX is certified to fly again with a less powerful MCAS system, the families called for a third active angle-of-attack sensor and accompanying software to detect sensor failures. 
Sumwalt, the NTSB Chair, said the FAA's actions on the MCAS system were ""positive progress"" toward meeting the intent of the NTSB's own safety recommendation related to uncommanded flight control inputs. Sumwalt also said proposed changes to pilot procedures were ""generally consistent with the intent"" of another NTSB recommendation. 
A year ago, the NTSB, which participated in both crash investigations, criticized Boeing and the FAA for failing to adequately consider how pilots respond to cockpit emergencies.

Aside from the FAA's final airworthiness directive, Boeing is facing reviews by foreign regulators, who are also weighing new pilot training procedures. FAA Administrator Steve Dickson also plans to conduct a 737 MAX test flight.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>",Senator Warren blasts U.S. CEOs for 'empty' social promises,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Thursday blasted U.S. business leaders, including JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) Jamie Dimon and Walmart's (N:WMT) Doug McMillon, for falling short on a ""splashy"" promise to look beyond profits when running their businesses.
Writing to the CEOs in their capacity as former and current chairs respectively of the Business Roundtable, Warren, a Democrat, said the country's top business group had been lobbying for ""narrow, short-term interests"" rather than the broad group of stakeholders it promised to serve last year.
Notably, the Roundtable had lobbied for legislation granting companies immunity should workers contract COVID-19 on the job, and had opposed extending unemployment benefits to workers, Warren said, citing a news report based on federal lobbying records.
""Rebuilding our economy so that workers, customers, and communities are able to share in prosperity requires real change in the way decisions are made in corporate headquarters and on Wall Street, not just the vague, empty-worded press releases that you have issued,"" Warren wrote in the letter, first reported by Reuters.
In a statement, a Roundtable spokeswoman said its members had demonstrated their commitment to last year's pledge by “prioritizing the health and safety of their employees and customers and continuing to evolve their businesses to be as equitable and inclusive as possible.” 
She said its CEOs were pressing “Congress to provide direct payments to individuals in need and more financial support for hard-hit small and medium-sized business” and “for necessary reforms to strengthen communities and address racial injustice in policing,” adding that the group would continue to share more details with Warren.
The Massachusetts senator's broadside turns up the spotlight on corporate leaders, who are increasingly being called upon by workers and politicians to confront pressing issues such as climate change, racial justice and income inequality.
In August 2019, over 180 Roundtable members comprising CEOs of top companies such as Amazon (O:AMZN), Apple (O:AAPL), and Coca-Cola (N:KO) pledged to end its 30-year stance that corporations exist to primarily serve shareholders, and vowed to do more to support workers, their communities, and the environment.
On Wednesday, the group also promised to fight climate change by backing market-based carbon pricing and slashing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
Warren, a progressive former presidential candidate, wrote to the Roundtable's members in October asking for details on how they planned to fulfill last year's pledge but got ""boilerplate"" responses and anecdotal evidence, she said on Thursday. She added that Dimon and McMillon did not directly reply.

Corporate America's response to the pandemic belies the Roundtable's pledge, she said, with companies failing to protect and invest in essential workers and disproportionately hurting minorities at a time when racial justice should be a priority.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Thursday it would decide by the end of September if it would continue capping bank dividend payments and laid out two hypothetical severe recessions it will use to test further big bank resilience amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The central bank said it will release the results of the new analysis by the end of 2020. The upcoming test marks an unprecedented second stress test in a year for the Fed, which said the ""continued uncertainty"" from the pandemic made it necessary to keep testing bank resilience. 
The upcoming results will mark the first time the Fed will publish firm-specific findings about how each of the 34 banks tested would perform in a pandemic-informed analysis, giving banks and their investors the clearest glimpse yet on how they may fare in the months ahead.
The Fed previously published stress test results in June, which found that banks would face heavy losses from hypothetical pandemic-driven lockdowns, but mostly retain necessary capital cushions. The Fed opted to publish aggregate results in that ""sensitivity analysis,"" after deciding a supplemental test was necessary after rolling out the original test before the pandemic spread to the United States.
After those results, the Fed announced that banks would be prohibited from buying back stock and would face caps on dividend payments in the third quarter. On Thursday, the Fed said it would decide by the end of September whether those policies would continue into the fourth quarter to help banks preserve capital.
""Uncertainty over the course of the next few quarters remains unusually high, and these two additional tests will provide more information on the resiliency of large banks,"" said Randal Quarles, the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, in a statement.
The next test will include two additional scenarios for banks to pass. One envisions a severe but short-lived economic decline that sees unemployment spike to 12.5% at the end of 2021 but rapidly decline afterward.
The second scenario is less severe but longer-lasting, with unemployment jumping to 11% by the end of 2021 but declining more slowly. Both scenarios also include sizeable economic declines both in the United States and abroad. 

The current U.S. unemployment rate is 8.4 percent.

In a Thursday court filing, Eric Trump's lawyers said his ""extreme travel schedule and related unavailability"" and ""the importance of avoiding any appearance of politicizing the investigatory process"" justified the delay.
They also said they had proposed four dates for Eric Trump to be questioned in the civil probe, beginning on Nov. 19.
""Eric Trump has been, and continues to be, willing to appear pursuant to a subpoena,"" the lawyers said.
A spokesman for Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement: “While we cannot comment on the particular steps we’re taking on specific litigation, we won’t allow any entity or individual to dictate how our investigation will proceed or allow anyone to evade a lawful subpoena.""
James on Aug. 24 accused the Trump Organization, where Eric Trump is an executive vice president, of resisting subpoenas for her probe into ""potential fraud or illegality,"" while there had been no determination any laws had been broken.
The attorney general said her probe began after Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen told Congress the president's financial statements had inflated some asset values to save money on loans and insurance, and deflated other asset values to reduce real estate taxes.
Four properties were being probed: the Seven Springs Estate in Westchester County, New York; 40 Wall Street in Manhattan; the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, and the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles.
The Trump Organization has said the probe into Donald Trump, a Republican, by James, a Democrat, was ""all about politics.""
In Thursday's filing, its lawyers also said it should not be required to turn over ""thousands of pages of privileged communications"" from its lawyers that James also subpoenaed.

A hearing is scheduled for Sept. 23 in a New York state court in Manhattan.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada launched a fund on Thursday to invest in community-based projects to curb emissions, with bulk of the money coming from a fine that Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) paid for breaking the country's diesel emissions rules.
The C$206 million ($157 million) fund is part of the government's new Climate Action and Awareness Fund which seeks to boost climate science research by empowering youth and communities.
""The new Climate Action and Awareness Fund will create jobs for Canadians in science and technology, academia, and at the grassroots community level,"" Johnathan Wilkinson, minister of environment and climate change, said in statement.
In January, a judge in Canada approved a C$196.5 million fine against Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) after the company pleaded guilty to dozens of counts of diesel emissions violations. The fine was by far the largest environmental penalty in Canadian history, prosecutors said.

The minister also announced a C$50 million investment over three years towards a number of priorities such as supporting additional research to bring down the country's emission to net-zero.

(Reuters) - A group of about 60 American businesses on Thursday urged their insurers to stop providing coverage to and investing in fossil fuel producers.
In a letter, companies including outdoor-gear producer Patagonia and ice-cream maker Ben & Jerry's, a unit of Unilever (NYSE:UL), called on U.S. insurers to drop ties to coal, oil and gas. 
""The insurance industry is underwriting and investing in fossil fuels which we now know are the key drivers of climate change,"" they said. 
""As insurance customers, we are therefore expressing our desire for insurance coverage in the U.S. market that isn't tied to supporting fossil fuels and actively supports renewable energy.""
U.S. insurers reported almost $7 trillion in cash and invested assets, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. 
Insurers highlighted in the letter include American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG), Liberty Mutual [LBRTML.UL], Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd,  Axis Capital  (NYSE:AXS) and Hartford Financial (NYSE:HIG) Services. 
According to the letter, Chubb, Axis Capital, The Hartford, and Liberty Mutual have policies to scale back or end underwriting of fossil fuels, but still continue to insure such projects. 
A spokesman for The Hartford said the company announced its coal exit policy in December.
AIG said on its website it does not publicly comment on underwriting decisions related to specific projects, while Chubb declined to comment. 
In recent years, environmental activists have pressured banks to drop financing for fossil-fuel companies.
Lobby groups such as Unfriend Coal have put pressure on insurers to stop underwriting carbon-intensive fuels like coal and oil sands.
Insurers can accelerate a transition to a low-carbon economy because having insurance is typically a condition for loans and investment. 
The first 10 insurers to exit the coal sector were European, but some U.S. and Australian peers have also adopted coal exit policies, Unfriend Coal said. 

Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) AG and Zurich Insurance are the leaders in ending coal insurance, Unfriend Coal said.

1340,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>","Pfizer vaccine trial bets on early win against coronavirus, documents show","By Marisa Taylor and Dan Levine
(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) is betting that its coronavirus vaccine candidate will show clear evidence of effectiveness early in its clinical trial, according to the company and internal documents reviewed by Reuters that describe how the trial is being run. 
In recent weeks, Pfizer has said it should know by the end of October whether the vaccine, developed together with Germany's BioNTech SE (F:22UAy), is safe and effective. If the vaccine is shown to work by then, Pfizer has said it would quickly seek regulatory approval. It has not said what data it would use. 
President Donald Trump, who is seeking re-election, has said a vaccine to fight the coronavirus pandemic is possible before the Nov. 3 U.S. vote, raising concerns over political interference. Scientists have questioned whether drugmakers will have enough evidence to achieve success by that time. 
Pfizer's clinical trial protocol outlines for the company, scientists and regulators how the drugmaker could show that its vaccine meets efficacy and safety standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
A company's protocol is submitted to the FDA for review and is overseen by an independent panel of experts known as a Data and Safety Monitoring Board. 
The protocol calls for a first assessment of the vaccine's performance by the monitoring board after 32 participants in the trial become infected with the novel coronavirus. So far, more than 29,000 people have enrolled in the trial that started in July, some receiving the vaccine and the others receiving a placebo. 
The FDA has said that a coronavirus vaccine must prove to be at least 50 percent more effective than a placebo in a large-scale trial to be considered for approval. However, a smaller sample of infections in a clinical trial changes the calculation of how that standard is met, according to researchers. 
Pfizer's vaccine would need to be at least 76.9% effective to show it works based on 32 infections, according to its protocol. That would mean that no more than six of those coronavirus cases would have occurred among people who received the vaccine, the documents showed. 
If the drugmaker's vaccine does not meet the 76.9% efficacy target at this first interim analysis, it would face tougher statistical significance thresholds during subsequent interim assessments, biostatisticians who reviewed the protocol said.
Pfizer said its interim analyses were designed to show conclusive evidence ""as quickly as possible amid the devastating pandemic if our vaccine meets the stringent standards set by FDA."" Pfizer would not say whether it would use an interim analysis as the basis for seeking approval. 
The FDA declined to comment on whether it would consider such data sufficient for approval. 
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE?
Interim analyses typically are used by data and safety monitoring boards to determine whether an experimental drug appears safe and effective enough to continue a trial, or whether it should be stopped if a safety problem arises.
But if a vaccine meets FDA benchmarks at an interim analysis without any serious safety problems, it could make sense to use it as a basis for authorization to help curb a pandemic that has killed about 940,000 people globally, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. 
 Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA), another front-runner in the vaccine race, told Reuters it would seek emergency FDA authorization to use its vaccine in high-risk groups if an interim assessment of its trial showed its vaccine was at least 70 percent effective. 
Moderna, which made its protocols public on Thursday, said its first interim analysis of 53 infections is likely to come in November. 
Some vaccine experts have said drugmakers should wait to reach their final analyses of more than 150 cases before seeking FDA approval. They note the speed at which vaccines are being developed for COVID-19, compressing what can be a decade-long process into months. 
Relying on the more limited interim analyses could overstate a vaccine's effectiveness simply because not enough trial participants fell ill, they have said. Moving more quickly through the trial process also means a drugmaker could miss potential side effects that could materialize if trials were given more time. 
""These interim analyses have a flashing sign of short cuts,"" said Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. ""You miss safety issues and you may very well exaggerate the benefits."" 
In addition to Pfizer and Moderna, Reuters reviewed the clinical trial protocols for vaccine candidates developed by AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ). AstraZeneca set its first interim analysis when about 40 coronavirus infections are reported among participants. Its U.S. trial is currently on hold after a patient fell ill. J&J's first analysis would begin at 20 infections, according to the protocol of their large-scale trial due to begin on Sept. 21.

AstraZeneca and J&J declined to comment.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) ranked as the top adviser to companies targeted by activist investors during the first half of 2020 while  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) dropped into fourth position as the coronavirus weighed on corporations, new Refinitiv data show.
During the first six months of 2020, Goldman advised on 21 campaigns, including eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Twitter and Harley Davidson, down from 23 in the first half of 2019.
Morgan Stanley, which had long held the top spot, advised on 8 campaigns compared with 9 the same time a year ago.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) said on Thursday it has now returned to service about half the 115 Boeing (N:BA) 737-800 aircraft it temporarily grounded after it discovered discrepancies in aircraft weight data.
The Dallas-based airline said in a statement late Wednesday that ""out of an abundance of caution, we have temporarily ceased flying the respective aircraft to enter the correct weights of the aircraft in question into the system and reset the program.""
Southwest said the discrepancy in weight data is 75 pounds (34 kg). Southwest initially said the issue applied to 130 airplanes, but said Thursday the actual number was 115.
The airline said the temporary halt to flights would ""cause some delays and/or cancellations; however, we anticipate the impact to our operation to be minimal.""
Boeing declined to comment. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also declined to comment. 
In January, the FAA said it was seeking to fine Southwest $3.92 million for alleged weight infractions on 21,505 flights on 44 aircraft between May 1, 2018 and Aug. 9, 2018.
The FAA alleged that Southwest operated the flights with incorrect operational empty weights, and center of gravity or moment data, which is used to determine how many passengers and how much fuel can be safely carried and where cargo should be located.
A February report by the Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General said the FAA violated its own guidance in addressing non-compliance by Southwest.
The report said from early 2018 until August 2019, FAA allowed Southwest Airlines ""to continue reporting inaccurate and non-compliant weight and balance data based on the carrier's risk determination.""

The FAA told the inspector general's office in January it had been monitoring Southwest's performance weight and balance program and ""continues to monitor (Southwest's) implementation of corrective measures.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) foreign exchange trader was sentenced on Thursday to eight months in prison, following his Nov. 2019 conviction for conspiring with traders at other banks to rig currency trades.
Akshay Aiyer, 37, was also sentenced to two years supervised release and fined $150,000 by U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in Manhattan.
Prosecutors had sought up to 46 months in prison, while the defendant sought probation.
Aiyer was charged with colluding with other traders from Oct. 2010 to July 2013 to fix prices of and rig bids for Central and Eastern European, Middle Eastern and African currencies.
Prosecutors said the traders would swap trading positions, customer information and order pricing through chat rooms, phone calls and text messages, to boost profits at customers' expense.
Aiyer's case was part of a broad U.S. probe into currency manipulation by the banking industry.
""The conspiracy threatened the integrity of the market,"" and the idea ""everyone did it"" is ""plainly not an excuse,"" Koeltl said.
Aiyer grew up in Pune, India, about 93 miles (150 km) southeast of Mumbai. He came to the United States in 2002 to attend Vassar College.
Before being sentenced, Aiyer told the judge he had tried to conduct himself professionally, and it was a ""total shock"" to be charged.
""I recognize that I have no one to blame but myself,"" Aiyer said.His lawyer Martin Klotz objected to the sentence, saying ""it doesn't seem fair"" to single out Aiyer. He also said Aiyer's asthma heightened his risk of illness from COVID-19 in prison.
Aiyer is among at least six people criminally charged in the Manhattan court in the currency probe.
Two cooperated with prosecutors in Aiyer's case, while three London-based traders were acquitted in Oct. 2018.
Banks including JPMorgan have paid more than $10 billion of fines to resolve regulatory probes worldwide into currency manipulation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state filed civil charges on Thursday accusing Johnson & Johnson of insurance fraud for downplaying the risks of opioid painkillers, including to doctors and elderly patients.
J&J and its Janssen Pharmaceuticals affiliate were accused of targeting elderly patients for opioid treatment despite the risks of side effects such as falls, fractures and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
The company was also accused of employing marketing materials, ""seemingly independent"" advocacy groups and ""key opinion leaders"" to dismiss opioid addiction as a myth.
""Misrepresentation of opioids to consumers for profit is inexcusable,"" Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement.
In a statement, J&J called its marketing and promotion of opioids ""appropriate and responsible. Janssen provided these medicines for doctors treating patients suffering from pain and worked with regulators to provide appropriate information about their risks and benefits.""
The charges by New York's Department of Financial Services are the fourth in its opioid industry probe, following charges against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd and Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc, Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc and  Mallinckrodt  (NYSE:MNK) Plc.
J&J, based in New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey, has proposed paying $4 billion to settle opioid claims by U.S. states, cities and counties.
It is separately appealing a $465 million judgment in Oklahoma from last November over its opioid marketing there.
New York said J&J manufactured opioid products in the state including Nucynta and the fentanyl patch Duragesic, and received multiple U.S. Food and Drug Administration letters challenging its Duragesic marketing claims.
The state also said J&J's ""Norman Poppy,"" developed in 1994, once accounted for as much as 80% of the global supply for oxycodone raw materials.

Oxycodone is the main ingredient in OxyContin, made by the now-bankrupt Purdue Pharma LP.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said opioids have contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997.
J&J was charged with violating two New York insurance laws, with civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.

LONDON (Reuters) - An Amsterdam court on Thursday froze a stake held by Exem Energy, a company owned by the husband of Angola's former first daughter Isabel dos Santos, in a dispute over a deal struck with Angolan state oil firm Sonangol in 2006.
The dos Santos family has faced legal battles around the world since José Eduardo, who installed two of his children as heads of key state enterprises during four decades of rule, stepped down as Angolan president in 2017.
Dutch law firm Van Doorne, which represented Isabel's husband Sindika Dokolo in the dispute between Sonangol and Exem, did not respond to a request for comment on the Amsterdam appeal court's ruling, which was posted on its website on Thursday. 
A representative for Isabel dos Santos did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. She has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing by the family and says she faces a political ""witch hunt"" by Angola's new leadership.
The former Sonangol chairwoman lives outside Angola, where her assets were seized last year in an ongoing investigation.
The dispute, which is being heard in Amsterdam after both sides agreed on arbitration, concerns Sonangol's sale of a 40% stake in holding company Esperaza to Exem in 2006.
Sonangol later rejected the deal and returned the funds.
(Graphic: Exem and Sonangol - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvyqgozvg/Amorim.JPG)
This sale agreement goes to the heart of Angolan allegations that the Dos Santos family manipulated its influence over government institutions for their own gain.
Exem was required to pay only 11.3 million euros up front and the remaining 85%, 63.8 million euros, was financed by Sonangol through loans, court documents showed.
""There was no commercial reason to give 40% of the newly acquired Esperaza to Exem,"" Emmanuel Gaillard of law firm Shearman & Sterling, which is representing Sonangol, said.
In its ruling, which applies for the duration of the proceedings, the appeals court in Amsterdam froze Exem's stake, removed Exem's representative from Esperaza's board and ordered dividends to be paid into an escrow account.

The court also ordered an investigation into the way in which Sonangol agreed, shortly before Angola's new leadership sacked Isabel Dos Santos in 2017, that Exem's loan repayment could be made in Kwanza, Angola's relatively weak currency.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",TikTok faces another test: its first U.S. presidential election,"By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - TikTok, already under scrutiny over its Chinese ownership and threatened with a possible ban by U.S. President Donald Trump, is facing another major challenge: how to handle content around its first U.S. presidential election.
Originally known for teenagers' viral dance routines and prank videos, Tiktok is now increasingly a destination for political content from its users. The hashtags Trump2020 and Biden2020 have collectively had more than 12 billion views on the app.
But TikTok's head of U.S. safety Eric Han, in the first interview he has given about TikTok's approach to election misinformation, told Reuters his team's goal is to ensure the app can stay a place for entertainment and ""silly self-expression.""
TikTok, which says it has about 100 million monthly active U.S. users, is charting its own approach to election-related material, factoring in what Han called the ""cautionary tales"" of more-established social media rivals.
TikTok fact-checking partners Lead Stories and PolitiFact said they have reviewed hundreds of videos containing political misinformation on the app, such as that Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris had threatened revenge on Trump supporters or about who appeared on disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's flight logs. 
But unlike  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR), TikTok does not flag any misinformation to its users. Instead, the social media app keeps fact-checkers' assessments internal and uses them to remove content, or, less frequently, reduce its reach.
""A lot of us have come from other platforms, we've seen how fact-checking works, we've seen how labeling works,"" Han said, adding that the company was ""very well aware"" that fact-checking labels could backfire by making users double-down on inaccurate beliefs or assume all unlabeled content was legitimate.
Social media companies came under pressure to combat misinformation after U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russia used such platforms to interfere in the 2016 election - which Moscow has denied. Facebook, which uses ratings from fact-checkers - including Reuters - to publicly label posts and reduce their distribution, said warnings on COVID-19 misinformation deterred users from viewing flagged content on 95 percent of the time. 
TikTok, which does not accept political ads, says it does not allow misinformation that could cause harm, including content that misleads users about elections. It has also banned synthetic media – such as a recent video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi manipulated to make her seem drunk.
""Their whole mission was to bring joy,"" said David Ryan Polgar, a tech ethicist and member of TikTok's new content advisory council that helps it shape policies. ""But with anything that is popular, you're going to have somebody who is going to say 'how can I exploit popularity?'""
To combat such exploitation before and after the election, Han said TikTok staff are meeting weekly to plan for scenarios, from contested election results to disinformation campaigns by ""state foreign actors...or a kid in someone's basement."" 
Members of TikTok's content advisory council also told Reuters that in a meeting last week they discussed issues including voter suppression and whether public supporters of the unfounded political conspiracy theory QAnon should be allowed on the platform, as well as what to do if the app is used to spread misinformation about contested results or incite post-election violence.
""Even if it's not organic to TikTok, it's going to end up there,"" said Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert and council member, who said he hoped TikTok's election policies would become ""clearer."" 
TikTok's fact-checkers, who also partner with Facebook, said political falsehoods found on TikTok were similar to those spread on Zuckerberg's platform: ""It's not just dance challenges any more,"" said Alan Duke, co-founder of fact-checking partner Lead Stories.
Even as TikTok grapples with content around the U.S. election issues, the fate of the ByteDance-owned app in the country remains uncertain: the Trump administration is expected to make a decision soon on a proposed deal with Oracle (N:ORCL), a plan orchestrated to avoid a U.S. ban.
FALSE CLAIMS 
With about six weeks to the Nov. 3 election, social media companies' responses to misinformation on their platforms are in the spotlight. On TikTok, Reuters found videos containing false claims about mail-in voting and presidential candidates, several of which TikTok removed after they were flagged by Reuters.
Searching TikTok for 'mailinvote' returns suggestions including 'mailinvotingfraud,' used on videos both spreading and debunking concerns. 
A search for the Democratic presidential candidate 'Biden' turned up 'bidentoucheskids' and 'bidensniffskids.' Following questions from Reuters, a TikTok spokeswoman said it was no longer serving results on those hashtags.
Allegations of child sexual abuse are a key element of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which proposes Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of child-sex predators including prominent Democrats and ""deep state"" allies. 
TikTok recently said it had blocked dozens of Q-Anon related hashtags. But misinformation researcher Rory Smith at non-profit First Draft identified several more still being used, including 'thestormisuponus, '2q2q,' 'digitalsoldier,' and 'jfkjr' which collectively had hundreds of thousands views. Following Reuters questions, TikTok said it had blocked some of these hashtags.
TikTok's content moderation practices have come under some scrutiny, including from U.S. lawmakers concerned it may be censoring politically sensitive content after reports that it blocked videos about protests in Hong Kong. A TikTok spokeswoman said its content and moderation policies are led by a team in California and are not influenced by any foreign government. 
In June, the company apologized after it was accused of censoring #BlackLivesMatter content, blaming a technical glitch it said made posts appear to have zero views.
This year, the company announced a council of outside experts would help it shape U.S. content policies. Rob Atkinson, a council member and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think-tank, told Reuters he has advised the company a number of times about how policy decisions, such approaches to hate speech, might play in Washington, D.C. 
But data security concerns also stemming from TikTok's ownership by Chinese tech giant ByteDance have kept major U.S. political figures and groups largely off the app, allowing it to avoid the scrutiny faced by Facebook and Twitter over their handling of inflammatory posts by Trump or other candidates. 
The Democratic National Committee Chief Technology Officer Nellwyn Thomas told Reuters the DNC has not engaged with TikTok in much depth, and focuses its counter-disinformation work more on Facebook and Twitter. A TikTok spokeswoman said the company has provided the Republican and Democratic National Committees with direct ways to escalate problems. 
Graham (NYSE:GHM) Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab said the counter-disinformation community would be ""remiss"" not to communicate with TikTok: ""We don't get to choose...where we have vulnerabilities.""
Misinformation experts remain concerned about the difficulties of moderating TikTok's many-layered videos, which can involve visual and sound effects, overlaid text and hashtags. Users can use 'green screen' effects to share news articles behind them or create split-screen 'duets' with existing videos.
TikTok's comedic tone also makes it hard to tell spoof from skullduggery: last month, the company removed a video shared by the Republican Hype House, which the account's 17-year-old founder Aubrey Moore said was satire. 
In the video, which liberal media watchdog Media Matters For America said racked up at least 40,000 views, a Republican Hype House creator, alongside 'BREAKING NEWS' text, falsely claimed that due to COVID-19, Democrats should head to the polls after Election Day. Though Moore said it was a gag, she said the group did not bother to appeal the takedown: it pumps out multiple videos a day.
TikTok advisory council member Farid said he had suggested to the company, partly to be provocative, that to curb misinformation and abuses it could ban new videos in the United States for a few days before and after the election.

His Plan B? ""Honestly, I don't know,"" he said. ""I'm struggling with that.""

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>","LVMH, Tiffany wrangle over court dates after acquisition turns sour","By Sarah White and Silvia Aloisi
PARIS (Reuters) - LVMH (PA:LVMH) tried on Thursday to block an attempt by Tiffany (N:TIF) to fast-track legal proceedings in the United States to force the French luxury group to honour an acquisition deal agreed last year. 
LVMH's $16 billion purchase of Tiffany hit the rocks last week after the Louis Vuitton owner said it could no longer complete the purchase, citing an intervention by the French government and the U.S. jeweller's weakening performance. 
Tiffany sued LVMH and asked a court in Delaware, where the case has been filed, to expedite proceedings, as it seeks to have a ruling before a Nov. 24 deadline for closing the acquisition.
The hearing on Tiffany's fast-track request is set for Sept. 21. Should the court decide against it, Tiffany's chances of obtaining a ruling in less than two months would dim significantly. 
LVMH, run by France's richest man Bernard Arnault, said in a statement it saw no reason to speed up the case and argued that having a trial in six to seven months' time would allow the parties to prepare properly. 
""Tiffany offers no reason why this court should move mountains and conduct a full-blown trial involving complex facts and international discovery in less than two months amidst a global pandemic,"" LVMH said in its filing.
It accused Tiffany of trying to rush a decision to avoid scrutiny of its management of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Tiffany has defended its handling of the health crisis, which hit the luxury sector hard, and said LVMH was trying to run out the clock and cause the deal to collapse. 
""We have already returned to profitability and expect to remain profitable for the balance of the year, with fourth quarter profits actually exceeding those of the fourth quarter of 2019,"" Tiffany said on Wednesday.
The acquisition - which would be the biggest ever in the luxury industry and was meant to expand LVMH's relatively modest presence in jewellery - was agreed before the coronavirus emergency.
The French group, which has said it would counter-sue, has rejected Tiffany's accusations that it deliberately stalled anti-trust filings, including with the European Union, to delay the purchase.

LVMH has in turn lambasted some decisions by Tiffany's management since the purchase was agreed last November, including to pay dividends even after the pandemic hit and retailers were forced to close stores.

Rivals Steelcase (NYSE:SCS) and Knoll (NYSE:KNL) rose 15% and 16%, respectively.
Unsurprisingly, retail business led the quarter, with sales up 40% from a year earlier. The real standout was the Home Office category, which increased nearly 300% over last year. That helped outweigh a 40% decline in the North America segment, though the company says it is seeing modest improvements in order trends.

Suez sees rival Veolia's bid plan as hostile and is working on finding a consortium of financial investors to make a rival bid for the stake French energy group Engie wishes to sell.
Engie said Veolia's August 30 offer of 2.9 billion euros ($3.43 billion) for a 29.9% share in Suez, could not be accepted under its proposed terms.
""The board has decided to grant a mandate to Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, chairman of the board, and to Claire Waysand, interim chief executive officer, to seek improved terms from Veolia, as well as further assurances with regards to the quality of the industrial project (...)"", Engie said.
The outcome will be a decisive moment for Suez, as Veolia has expressed interest in taking full control of the French utility firm after becoming its leading investor.
Veolia has already anticipated possible antitrust hurdles and as a remedy would sell Suez's French water activities to Meridiam Infrastructure if the acquisition goes through to preserve competition and employment.
Engie said that while no alternative proposal has yet been submitted by Suez, it would study any such offers sent to Engie ""in the next few days"".
A source recently told Reuters that Spain's Criteria, the parent company of lender Caixabank (MC:CABK) and Suez' second biggest shareholder, had no plans to take part in any bidding consortium.

The new F-150 launch is “on time and on track,” Ford's incoming Chief Executive Jim Farley said during an event Thursday at Ford’s Dearborn Truck plant. 
Ford shares were up 2.3% in early trading. 
The F-150 is Ford's top selling vehicle and, along with other large pickups and commercial vans, generates the bulk of the company's global profit.
Ford also confirmed plans to build an electric version of the F-150, which is expected to come to market by mid-2022.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s new paid online fitness class service, designed to work with its Apple Watch, was a long-planned extension of the watch's fitness features rather than a quick reaction to a pandemic that has closed many gyms, executives said in an interview.
The Fitness+ service is Apple's first subscription geared to make money directly from the sensor-packed device it has been selling since 2014. 
The service, which Apple said will be available by the end of the year, has new workouts each week filmed by a team of trainers in a purpose-built studio in Los Angles and focuses on exercises that require little or no gym equipment, using Apple Watch sensors to track progress.
Many analysts viewed the service, which was announced on Tuesday, as well timed for a work-from-home world. But Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams (NYSE:WMB) said in an interview on Wednesday that work on the service started ""quite a while ago."" He described it as ""a natural extension of the goal of Apple Watch, which is to help people live a better day."" 
“At least pre-Covid, if you could write one prescription for the world from physicians, it would have been to be more active. It’s so powerful,"" Williams said in a press briefing. ""So anything we do in that realm that helps people be more active is something we're excited about.”
Once gyms do reopen, the Fitness+ service will also work with compatible gym equipment such as smart treadmills. The service will cost $10 per month or $80 per year.
Jay Blahnik, senior director of fitness technologies at Apple, said the service's goal is to reach as broad an audience as possible and that Apple aimed to assemble a diverse lineup of instructors.

“We have trainers in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and even their 60s. Showcasing that kind of diversity was really important to us because how we move and how we train is different as we age,"" Blahnik said.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - LATAM Airlines (SN:LTM) has presented a new $2.45 billion financing proposal in the middle of its bankruptcy protection process in the United States, replacing a proposed debtor-in-possession loan that prompted the judge to reject the original plan earlier this month.
LATAM, the largest air transport group in Latin America, told the Chilean securities regulator in a letter on Wednesday night that the new debtor-in-possession loan maintained ""basically"" the structure presented in July.
In one tranche, asset management firm Oaktree Capital Management amended the proportion of the loan it was offering to $1.125 bln from $1.3 billion originally, with a group of creditors put together by investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Group providing an additional $175 million. 
In a second tranche, several key LATAM shareholders, including the Cueto family, which controls the airline, and Qatar Airways, changed their offering from the $900 million convertible loan previously rejected by the judge amid opposition from other creditors to $750 mln with $250 mln additional financing from creditors led by Jefferies Group and $150 mln from other LATAM shareholders or new investors. 
LATAM said in its statement that if new investors could not be found, key LATAM shareholders and the Jefferies Group creditors would make up the difference. It also stipulated that both tranches of loans had to be paid in cash, rather than equity as previously in the plan rejected by the judge. 

LATAM filed for bankruptcy protection in May, aiming to reorder $18 billion in debt as it was hammered by the world travel crisis generated by the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, it was the world's largest airline to file for bankruptcy due to COVID-19.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A 27-year-old U.S.-born yeshiva student has secured control of  El Al  Israel Airlines (TA:ELAL) following a public share offering that was a government condition for the carrier to receive a 75% state-backed $250 million loan.
Eli Rozenberg's newly created Kanfei Nesharim Aviation bought $107 million of shares that would give him a nearly 43% stake in Israel's flag carrier, his spokesman said Thursday.
Rozenberg, who resides in Israel, is the son of Kenny Rozenberg, chief executive of New York-based nursing home chain Centers Health Care.
The government bought a 15% stake for $34 million while the holdings of El Al's current owners, Knafaim Holdings (TA:KNFM), fell to 15.2% from 38%.
Rozenberg in July had offered to funnel $75 million into the airline in return for a 44.99% stake.
The deal needs approval from parliament's finance committee. 
Kanfei Nesharim's spokesman said Rozenberg will meet Finance Ministry officials next week.
He said once Rozenberg is approved, he will seek to make changes to El Al's board and elsewhere to move the cash-strapped carrier forward. Kanfei Nesharim said it would invest heavily in improving El Al's service and to upgrade its food service.
Rozenberg has surrounded himself with advisers including Jason Greenblatt, a former adviser to President Donald Trump.
El Al suspended scheduled passenger flights in March at the outset of the coronavirus outbreak when Israel closed its borders to foreign citizens.
Earlier on Thursday, it said it would resume flights to Athens on Oct. 1, followed by daily flights to New York, London and Paris starting Oct. 12. 
The airline has reported losses for two years and racked up debt to renew its fleet. In addition to the share offering, the government has required El Al to slash costs.

Most of its 5,940 employees remain on unpaid leave and El Al said it would gradually bring a small number back.

LONDON (Reuters) - Ferroglobe, the largest western producer of silicon metal, and its creditors have hired finacial advisers to speed up a restructuring of the company's $451 million of debt, two sources familiar with the situation said. 
Ferroglobe (O:GSM), 53% owned by Spanish billionaire and former finance minister Juan Miguel Villar Mir, is under pressure as the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates a slowdown in demand from the automotive industry, the main consumer of silicon metal, in Europe and the United States.
The company has hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) and its creditors - a mixture of funds and banks - are working with U.S. investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC) as negotiations to restructure the company's debt gather pace, the sources said.
Houlihan Lokey and Moelis declined to comment. 
Ferroglobe said it is exploring some combination of a potential new financing and/or refinancing of existing debt, without giving further details.
Its debt amounted to $451 million in notes and credit facilities, with $350 million maturing in March 2022. 
Grupo Villar Mir (GVM), the private holding of the octogenarian industrialist, had reportedly been in talks with distressed debt investors including Atitlan Venture Capital and Apollo Asset Management to sell part or all its stake in Ferroglobe, but the virus outbreak put a break on the discussions.
The advisory mandates may mean that talks have restarted between the holding company and investment funds, which could buy the debt and swap it for equity, one of the sources said.
GVM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ferroglobe's market capitalisation has fallen sharply to just $111 million, compared to more than $2 billion on its public market debut in 2015. 
Silicon metal is typically added to aluminium alloys to strenghten them and make them lighter. It is also used in solar cells and computer chips.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets tumbled at the opening on Thursday, before paring losses somewhat, as the Federal Reserve's warnings about a slow recovery from the pandemic forced a rethink on the outlook for earnings growth in the years ahead.
By 10:05 AM ET, the Dow Jo8nes Industrial Average was down 157 points, or 0.6%, at 27,875 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2%, weighed on by losses of over 1.7% in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and 1.3% in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Cloud data company Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), which more than doubled on its stock market debut on Wednesday, initially fell 13% but was holding on to most of its gains. By 10:05 AM, it had pared its losses to 8.6%. Jfrog (NASDAQ:FROG) stock, which also debuted strongly on Wednesday, was down 2.2%.
At its meeting, the Fed had suggested that it would need to keep interest rates at or near zero for at least the next three years, but gave no hint of when it might increase its monthly bond purchases, which have been a key factor in driving the post-pandemic rally.
""We now think that some additional trigger—such as a disorderly rise in yields at longer maturities or a deterioration of the economy—would likely be required,"" for the Fed to provide further stimulus, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategist David Mericle wrote in a morning note. By contrast, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had said repeatedly that the central bank considers its current policy stance ""appropriate"" and reminded his audience of the need for support from fiscal policy. 
Such support is still in the balance. Politico reported on Thursday that Republican Senators are still resisting pressure from President Trump to craft a new stimulus package closer to the size of the one proposed by a bipartisan committee of lawmakers from the House of Representatives.
Signs that the hitherto buoyant U.S. housing market is cooling off, and that layoffs continue to run at a high rate, also weighed on the market. Housing starts fell for the first time in four months in August, as did building permits, but analysts expect this to be a temporary dip. 
Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that the drop in housing starts was ""more than accounted for"" by the impact of Hurricane Laura and Tropical Storm Marco, which hit the southern U.S. last month. The drop in building permits, meanwhile, was entirely due to the volatile multi-family segment, whereas permits for single-family homes continued to rise rapidly.
""Further increases in permit issuance are coming, and starts will rebound strongly too,"" Shepherdson said.
Elsewhere, airline stocks were generally outperforming, while still in negative territory, as industry chiefs headed to Washington to plead for more bailout funds. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock was down 0.4%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock was down 0.8% and Southwest  (NYSE:LUV) stock was down 1.4%. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock was down 0.9%.

U.S. airlines have cut costs and raised debt to survive what they call an unprecedented industry crisis and the situation is not expected to improve anytime soon.

Delta said on Monday that it is pledging its loyalty program to raise $6.5 billion comprising of $4 billion bonds and $2.5 billion loan, as it burns through $27 million a day.
Earlier this month, the carrier said it would not chase a $4.6 billion federal loan available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, although it continues to lobby for a second round of federal payroll grants.

Smaller rival United Airlines (O:UAL) in June had pledged its loyalty program MileagePlus for a new $5 billion loan aimed at further buffering its liquidity.

Britain is phasing out coal plants and investing in renewables to help meet its climate targets. But many of its nuclear plants - another source of low-carbon electricity - also need replacing, and progress so far has been mixed. 
Japan's Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) on Wednesday dropped its plans to build a new nuclear plant in Britain, while Japan's Toshiba Corp (T:6502), scrapped its British NuGen project in 2018 after its U.S. reactor unit Westinghouse went bankrupt.
""The government is looking at options to invest in Sizewell, nuclear energy has a key role in meeting our net zero commitments,"" Johnson's spokesman told journalists.
""We regularly engage with all developers on their projects and are considering a range of financing solutions.""
EDF is building Britain’s first new nuclear plant in more than two decades, Hinkley Point C, with backing from China's CGN. It also hopes to build Sizewell C, in which CGN also owns a 20% development phase stake.
EDF has called on the government to launch a new regulated asset base (RAB) funding model to help more projects get built, which could see British households pay through their electricity bills while the plants are still being constructed.
Proponents say the model, previously used in Britain to finance monopoly infrastructure assets such as water, gas and electricity networks, would ultimately lower the cost of new projects for consumers.
However, critics say it will leave taxpayers liable for any cost over-runs and delays during construction. 
Britain's nuclear power plants can supply around 20% of the country's electricity demand, but around half the plants are set to close in the next four years.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Commission will propose easing listing rules for small companies and create a widely available record of share prices to help deepen the bloc's capital market, a document showed on Thursday.
The EU executive will commit to 16 ""actions"" in total to complete a Capital Markets Union or CMU over the next two years and help the bloc's economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic, the document seen by Reuters showed.
""The Commission will start work on the actions announced in this action plan by launching public consultations on the legal framework for European long-term investment funds and non-bank insolvency shortly,"" the document said. 
""The CMU cannot be built in a single stroke.""
The first CMU action plan was launched five years ago but progress has been patchy and a deeper market has become all the more urgent given the need to recapitalise companies hit by the pandemic, and the departure of Britain, the bloc's biggest capital market, from the EU.
The EU is currently assessing how much access it will give to the City of London financial centre in future.
""A CMU is a precondition for a stronger international role of the euro and Europe’s open strategic autonomy,"" the document said.
The 16 actions also include setting up an EU-wide platform to give investors financial information on companies, and assessing if banks that turn down a loan request from small companies should direct them to providers of alternative funding.
The Commission will also propose a common EU-wide system for withholding tax relief at source on cross-border investments, the document showed. It will also seek to harmonise non-bank insolvency law.
The EU executive will also propose the creation of a post-trade consolidated tape of volume and prices data for equity and equity-like financial instruments to help investors find the best deals, the document said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Storm-tossed U.S. offshore energy producers and exporters began clearing debris on Thursday from Hurricane Sally and booting up idle Gulf of Mexico operations after hunkering down for five days.
The storm toppled trees, flooded streets and left about 570,000 homes and businesses from Mississippi to Florida without power. Sally became a tropical storm and spread heavy rains overnight from Alabama to Georgia.
Crews returned to at least 30 offshore oil and gas platforms.  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) began restaffing its Blind Faith and Petronius platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Bristow Group, which transports oil workers from a Galliano, Louisiana, heliport resumed crew-change flights to facilities in the west and central Gulf of Mexico. 
""We are making flights offshore and experiencing a slight increase in outbound passengers,"" said heliport manager Lani Moneyhon. 
The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, a deepwater oil port that handles supertankers, reopened its marine terminal after suspending operations over the weekend.
Sally had shut 508,000 barrels per day of oil production and 805 million cubic feet of natural gas, more than a quarter of U.S. Gulf of Mexico output, and halted petrochemical exports all along the Gulf Coast.
About 1.1 million bpd of U.S. refining capacity were offline on Wednesday, according to the U.S. Energy Department, including two plants under repair since Laura and another halted by weak demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The storm helped lift U.S. oil and gasoline futures. U.S. crude rose more than 4% on Wednesday and gasoline gained nearly as much. 
Phillips 66 (N:PSX), which shut its 255,600-bpd Alliance, Louisiana, oil refinery ahead of the storm, said it was advancing planned maintenance at the facility and would keep processing halted. 
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa)'s Mobile, Alabama, chemical plant and refinery, reported no serious damage from an initial survey, the company said. Chevron said its Pascagoula, Mississippi, oil refinery operated normally through the storm.

MADRID (Reuters) - A large majority of shareholders in Spanish telecoms firm MasMovil have accepted a private equity bid to take it private in the first major deal of its kind since the coronavirus pandemic struck, the stock market regulator said on Thursday.
United States-based funds KKR (N:KKR), Providence and Cinven had secured support from the company's board and owners of almost 30% of its stock before announcing a bid worth 3 billion euros ($3.54 billion) in June. 
Holders of 86.4% of the company tendered their shares for the 22.50 euros each on offer, the bourse filing said.
Under Spanish takeover law, the new owners still need to call a shareholder meeting to approve the firm's delisting. 
MasMovil's new owners aim to take the company off the Spanish stock market, where it has been trading just below the offer price since early August, having soared above the bid level when the buyers showed their hand.
The stock has racked up an accumulated 10% rise so far this year, a polar opposite performance to the 17% drop for the sector benchmark index (SXKP). 
Some shareholders had said the offer undervalued a company that has grown quickly by acquiring low-cost brands to grab market share from stalwarts  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) and Orange (PA:ORAN).
European telecoms executives often champion a reduction in the number of companies operating in the industry, through mergers and acquisitions, to help share the high costs of investing in infrastructure to carry next-generation 5G internet.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), which manages the pensions of 20 million Canadians, is investing billions of dollars in fossil fuel companies, exposing it to significant climate-related risks, research by two universities said on Thursday.
The study was done by Canada Climate Law Initiative (CCLI), a project of the University of British Columbia and Toronto's York University.
The research acknowledged the progress made by Canada's biggest pension fund, including the doubling of its renewable energy holdings, but found the board's continued fossil fuel investments revealed a ""troubling incrementalism."" 
Six of CPPIB's 15 private transactions in the past six years were in fossil fuels, and an earlier analysis found the fund has invested in 79 of the world's top 200 public oil, gas and coal companies.
The energy sector has ""the strongest of motives to adapt, have the access to capital to do so and the technology knowhow to innovate,"" CPPIB spokesman Michel Leduc said. ""The idea, through divestment, of starving them of capital, would... likely be harmful or counterproductive."" 
The report says globally, climate risk is recognized as a material enterprise risk, impacting supply chains, future cash flows and disrupting business models across industries. CPPIB's public and private investments raise questions about its ability to cope with sudden or unexpected changes in consumer and investor preferences or in government policy.
CCLI called for the fund, which had C$434 billion in funds under management as of end June, to set ""transparent and aggressive"" targets for a carbon-neutral portfolio.
Fossil fuel producers and services made up 2.8% of CPPIB's investments as of March 31, from 4.6% two years earlier. CPPIB CEO Mark Machin told Reuters in May the fund is comfortable with its energy exposure.

Hygo plans to sell 23.1 million shares at a price range of $18-$21 apiece, according to the filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1806220/000114036120020674/nt10010929x10_f1a.htm#tS. At the higher end of the range, the company will be valued at $2.58 billion. 
It is the latest among those looking to take advantage of the strong rebound in U.S. capital markets from March lows when the COVID-19 pandemic put listing plans of several private companies on hold.
Natural gas and LNG have also been investor favorites as climate concerns continue to dominate the conversation surrounding energy companies.
Hygo was formed in 2016 by Golar to develop and operate integrated LNG-based transportation, downstream solutions and other power generation infrastructure.
Golar, which currently owns 50% stake in Hygo, will own nearly 41% of the company after its IPO. 
For the six months ended June 30, Hygo's net loss attributable to common shareholders widened to $60.8 million from $16.6 million a year earlier. Operating revenue for the same period fell more than 5% to $22.8 million.

CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Williams (NYSE:WMB)' great-grandfather founded their Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) distribution business in Corinth, Mississippi, in 1907, just a handful of years after Coke was first sold in bottles across the United States. 
He's part of the fourth generation to run it, and he's determined not to be the last.
Williams' business is one of nearly 70 U.S. Coca-Cola ""bottlers"" - third-party, independent companies that put Coke and other beverages into cans and bottles and deliver the drinks to retailers and restaurants in every corner of the country.
The future of such companies is not only critical for their owners and employees, but also key for their main supplier - Coca-Cola, the world's No.1 soft drink maker - which needs them to flourish to help it recover from a slump in sales.
But COVID-19 has upended their business models.
""It was chaos. You just had no idea what the world was going through and what we were up against,"" said Williams, the finance head of his family's firm. ""It's on our shoulders to try to take our business forward into the future and to maintain the work that our ancestors have done.""
Shoppers in lockdowns snapped up cases of Coke, Fanta and Sprite at grocery stores rather than at gas stations, restaurants and stadiums. 
That left bottlers scrambling to keep stores stocked with bigger, often less-profitable packages. Lucrative sales to restaurants and convenience stores are still only a fraction of what they were before the pandemic hit the United States.
The bottlers - now saddled with too much product meant for restaurants - have also been hit by a shortage of aluminum cans due to a surge in demand for canned drinks as people stay home.
Williams, whose business distributes rather than makes drinks, has adapted to this new order over the last six months, while grappling with higher costs for fuel, transportation, labor, safety gear and cleaning products. Pressures have eased since the lockdown, but his firm is still affected.

COCA-COLA MASS LAYOFFS
Coca-Cola sells syrups, powders and base ingredients - known as concentrates - to bottlers, who mix, package and sell drinks to retailers, giving a cut back to the soda giant.
The company works with many large publicly listed bottlers around the world, including in Europe and Asia. But many U.S. players are small, family-owned businesses, with limited reserves to draw from as sales and profits shrink. 
About two-thirds of them received pandemic aid from the U.S. government to keep in hand or stay afloat, which is important for Coca-Cola to increase its own sales.
All the while Coca-Cola, with whom they have a symbiotic relationship, has also been under intense pressure.
The drinks giant's volume sales in North America declined 16% in the latest quarter. Nearly 40% of its over 10,000 employees in the region will decide by Thursday whether to volunteer for severance as part of a sweeping restructuring.
""It was a very difficult time throughout April and May, in particular, and our bottlers have to deal with that on a regular basis,"" Chaly Moyen, Coca-Cola's North America head of strategy, told Reuters. As lockdowns have eased, worldwide volume declines have moderated, from about 25% in April to about 10% in June.
She declined to say whether Coca-Cola would bail out any bottlers close to going bankrupt. 
NEW BUSINESS REALITIES
Coca-Cola is the U.S. leader in fizzy drinks - excluding tea, water and energy drinks - with about 38% of the $41.8 billion retail market, followed by PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP), according to Euromonitor.
While the food-service sales that make up about half of Coca-Cola's business have dived, Moyen said North American sales to large stores have risen. At the height of the pandemic, they were up by a double-digit percentage versus a year earlier, and remain up by double-digits for 2020 so far, she added.
However she acknowledged bottlers and distributors had been hit hard by the shifting retail landscape. ""The impact that bottlers had from a mix shift was real,"" Moyen said, adding that Coca-Cola expected the new consumer habits to stick.
Selling less product has also hurt; in the quarter ended June 26, Coca-Cola sold 22% less concentrates worldwide as demand fell.
Some bottlers have been forced to lay off or reassign workers specializing in supplying restaurants to bottling and distributing retail-friendly products, tasks in which they are not experienced, driving down productivity.
Reyes Holdings, Coca-Cola's second-biggest U.S. bottler, told Reuters it laid off 30 people - or about 6% of staff - at its Alsip facility in Illinois in April. As things improved, it reinstated half of those workers. 
Coca-Cola Consolidated, the biggest U.S. Coke bottler - last month reported a 3.6% fall in quarterly net sales. But the company, whose No.1 shareholder is Coca-Cola, increased adjusted operating income by 5.4%, after furloughing about 700 people without pay.
Duane Stanford, publisher of the Beverage Digest newsletter, said such moves simply reflected the new business realities.

1386,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 07:04AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Fall 250 Pts After Fed Underwhelms; Claims Data Due,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Thursday, with investors disappointed that the Federal Reserve decided against adding more stimulus in order to advance its goal of spurring inflation.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 41 points, or 1.2%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 250 points, or 0.9%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 168 points, or 1.5%. 
The U.S. central bank announced Wednesday that interest rates would remain anchored near zero through 2023, and promised to keep rates there until inflation rises consistently.
Chairman Jerome Powell also announced that the central bank had lifted its forecasts for growth, employment and inflation for 2020, but warned that parts of the U.S. economy will keep struggling unless lawmakers come forward with further fiscal stimulus. 
Congress continues to struggle to reach a deal on a new coronavirus aid bill--although President Donald Trump has injected some life into talks--and thus some investors had hoped the Fed would carry out more of the heavy lifting by injecting more monetary stimulus.
Earlier Thursday, the World Bank's chief economist Carmen Reinhart said the global economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis is likely to take as much as five years.
Economic data Thursday centers around the jobless claims report, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Initial claims are expected to come in at 850,000, which would be a slight tick down from the 884,000 claims the prior week. Continuing claims are expected to be around 13 million, down from 13,385,000 the previous week.
Housing starts for August are due at the same time, and are estimated to be around 1.48 million, a small reduction from 1.49 million the prior month.
In corporate news, cloud software company Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is likely to be in focus again after its stock doubled on its first day of trading. As is Uber (NYSE:UBER) after Bloomberg reported that it’s planning to sell part of its $6.3 billion stake in Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing to raise cash.
Oil prices fell Thursday, rebalancing after recent strong gains as producers in the Gulf of Mexico took steps to resume output in the wake of Hurricane Sally.
A panel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, together known as OPEC+, meets Thursday to review the market, but is not expected to announce any market-moving measures.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $40.11 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $42.17. Both benchmarks saw gains of close to 5% during the previous session.

1387,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 06:46AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, September 17th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The dollar's post-Fed bounce fades as other central banks around the world also stay on hold. President Trump puts pressure on Senate Republicans to vote for more stimulus; jobless claims and housing starts will shed light on what have recently been the weakest and strongest parts of the U.S. economy, and OPEC+ ministers meet to review their deal on output restraint. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, September 17th.
1. Dollar's post-Fed bounce fades 
The dollar gave up most of the gains it made in response to the Federal Reserve’s inaction on Wednesday, as investors embraced the narrative of higher inflation tolerance being a long-term negative for the greenback.
The dollar had risen and risk assets had slipped after the Fed failed to give any hint of when it might increase its monthly bond purchases to give further support to the economy. That was despite signalling that U.S. interest rates are set to remain near zero through 2023.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the dollar index that tracks the buck against half a dozen developed-market currencies was back at 93.240, off 0.3% from its overnight high.
The move was helped by evidence that the global trend of easier monetary policy is on pause. Indonesia, Taiwan, Brazil and Japan all left their key interest rates and other tools unchanged in meetings over the last 24 hours, while the Bank of England is also expected to stay on hold when it makes its post-meeting statement at 7 AM ET (1100 GMT).
2. Trump leans on GOP Senators 
President Donald Trump leaned on the Republican Party to approve more fiscal stimulus, in an effort to break a deadlock on Capitol Hill that is now visibly affecting the U.S. economy.
Trump urged Republican Senators to “go for the much bigger numbers” mooted by a bipartisan group of House lawmakers, who have proposed a compromise stimulus package worth around $1.5 trillion. So far, the Senate has only approved $650 billion of extra spending to support the economy through the fall, while the White House has suggested a package worth $1.1 trillion.
At his press conference on Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had again highlighted the need for fiscal policy to fill a gap in incomes created by government measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
3. Stocks set to extend losses on Fed disappointment
U.S. stock markets are poised to extend the losses that they made on Wednesday in outrage at the Fed’s failure to offer yet more stimulus candy.  The disappointment hasn’t yet been mitigated by thoughts that Trump’s tweet could herald the approach of a much-delayed fiscal support package.
By 6:30 AM, Dow 30 futures were down 254 points or 0.9%, while S&P 500 Futures were down 1.1% and NASDAQ Futures were down 1.0%.
Stocks likely to be in focus on a day without major earnings updates include Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW), which more than doubled on its first day of trading Wednesday in a reflection of how eager investors are to jump on any growth story. Also in the spotlight will be Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), whose deal to partner with TikTok in the U.S. reportedly doesn’t satisfy some of the U.S. officials reviewing the national security aspects.
4. Jobless claims, housing starts due
Weekly jobless claims data wlll be released at 8:30 AM ET, at the same time as August data for U.S. housing starts and building permits.
Initial jobless claims are expected to have continued their painfully slow decline with a drop of only 34,000 to 850,000 last week. Continuing jobless claims are expected to fall more clearly to a new post-pandemic low of 13.00 million, although it will - as always - be useful to cast an eye on the overall number of those claiming under all jobless-related programs. That had remained stuck at over 29 million in last week’s release.
High unemployment has fed through into a slowdown in retail sales growth, visible in August data released on Wednesday.
Figures from the housing market are, by contrast, expected to be a lot stronger: housing starts are expected to fall only marginally from last month’s 1.496 million, while building permits are expected to top 1.5 million for the first time since February.
5. Oil steady above $40 as 'OPEC+' ministers meet
Crude oil prices drifted, having reclaimed the $40 a barrel mark overnight on the back of a solid drop in U.S. inventories and signs of more production discipline from key exporters in the OPEC bloc.
By 6:40, U.S. crude futures were up 0.1% at $40.12 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 0.1% $42.27 a barrel.
The so-called OPEC+ bloc of producers will hold a ministerial meeting later to review the group’s plans to gradually raise production. The plans have had doubt cast on them this week by two gloomy forecasts for global demand from OPEC itself and from the International Energy Agency."

Hongqiao’s smelting capacity is currently located in the city of Binzhou in Shandong and relies on coal-fired power for the electricity-intensive smelting process. The move to Yunnan allows it to swap coal for cleaner hydropower.
The project, led by Shandong Weiqiao Pioneering Group, is located at Wenshan prefecture and has an annual capacity of 2.03 million tonnes, the company said in a statement. 
Hongqiao aims to move about one-third of its aluminium capacity out of Shandong province to the hydropower-rich Yunnan province amid China's environmental curbs.
The first phase of the project put into production on Thursday has capacity of one million tonnes per year, according to Hongqiao. 
""Currently, the company does not have an exact timeline for the launch of phase two, but will complete by 2025"", it told Reuters. 
The whole project involves total investment at 40 billion yuan ($5.91 billion) and is expected to eventually bring in sales of 100 billion yuan per year, according to China's official Xinhua news agency. 
Ge Honglin, head of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, said the project would help enhance China's clean production level in the aluminium industry as it strives to make ""world-class"" high-end aluminium products.
China, the world's top aluminium producer, set a record monthly high production of 3.17 million tonnes in August.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's  Top Glove Corporation Bhd  (KL:TPGC) said it planned to list in Hong Kong within six to nine months after ""supernormal"" demand for gloves during the COVID-19 pandemic saw its quarterly profit skyrocket to a company record.
Executive chairman Lim Wee Chai said the world's top glove maker, which is already listed in Malaysia and Singapore, was in talks with bankers about the Hong Kong deal.
""It's only a plan and we are talking to the bankers to see which is the most suitable method to go for listing in Hong Kong,"" he added in a virtual briefing. ""As a whole we are a global company, we must expand our company to a bigger market so that (we are) visible in the world market.""
Top Glove outlined the plans to list in the Asian financial centre as it posted its highest-ever quarterly net profit of 1.29 billion ringgit ($311.37 million), for its fourth quarter which ended on Aug. 31.
That was 17 times higher than the 74.2 million ringgit it made a year ago, and easily surpassed the 349.2 million ringgit average analyst estimate from a poll by Refinitiv.
Revenue was up 161% year-on-year to 3.11 billion ringgit.
Managing Director Lee Kim Meow said the financial results ""hit an unprecedented high"". Protective gear will still be required even when a vaccine becomes available, Top Glove added.
""With a triple-digit increase in the group's monthly order book and lead times closing in on the two-year mark, we expect to continue delivering solid results well into financial year 2021,"" Lee said .
Glove demand remains at a ""supernormal level"", the company said, estimating demand would grow 25% next year from the 20% this year, and 15% post-pandemic.
Sales volumes for the quarter rose 42.5% from a year ago, and 16.6% for the 2020 financial year.
Top Glove currently has the capacity to produce 85.5 billion glove pieces - one of a pair - a year and has earmarked 8 billion ringgit of capital expenditure over the next six years to add an additional 100 billion pieces of capacity.
Its new Vietnam factory is scheduled to be commissioned next month.

1393,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 05:44AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Recovery in Europe's Car Sales Spells Bad News for Automakers,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s auto stocks were on the skids again on Thursday after fresh data showed that the recovery in sales had gone into reverse in August.
Passenger car registrations across the 27-member European Union fell 18.9% in August, according to numbers from industry group ACEA. That breaks a three-month trend of improvements after lockdowns all but brought the motor trade to a standstill in April.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), BMW (DE:BMWG_p) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) preferred stock were both down 1.1%, while  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) stock was down 1.2% and  Renault  (PA:RENA) stock down 0.9%. As has often been the case this year, supplier stocks such as  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) and Schaeffler  (DE:SHA_p) underperformed, losing more than 2% each.
From a lowpoint of -76% in April, the year-on-year decline in sales had flattened out to only 5.4% in July. A brief sugar rush from a scrappage scheme in France, together with aggressive discounting in markets such as Germany and the release of pent-up demand, combined to paint a picture of recovery that now seems in doubt once again.
ACEA gave little commentary on its raw data. However, it was noteworthy that France and Germany, the two biggest European markets, posted two of the largest drops, with sales falling around 20% in both.
The pent-up demand effect is visible in that declines were softer in Italy and Spain, where the initial collapse in sales in the spring was more severe. Over the first eight months of 2020, Spain and Italy are still registering the biggest declines, with falls of over 40.6% and 39.8% respectively.
The news is likely to put fresh pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to support the crucial auto sector more actively, after the federal government refused to include a broad car-scrappage scheme in its first major fiscal stimulus package. The German car industry association says one third of its members plan to cut jobs by more than 10% as a result of the crisis. All three of the big automotive groups have announced large-scale layoffs, as have big suppliers such as Continental (DE:CONG) and Schaeffler, the latter of which had to resort to a 1.3 billion euro ($1.5 billion) cash call on shareholders last month.  
By contrast, French President Emmanuel Macron’s government threw some 8 billion euros into a car scrappage scheme that started in June to encourage the transition to electric vehicles. But the benefits of that appear to have been short-lived: French registrations rose in year-on-year terms in July, by 3.9%, but fell 20% in August.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's accounting regulator said on Thursday it has fined Deloitte a record 15 million pounds ($19.4 million) for its audit of software firm Autonomy that contained ""serious and serial failures"".
Deloitte, one of the world’s Big Four auditors, and two of its now former partners, Richard Knights and Nigel Mercer, were investigated in relation to their audit of Autonomy’s financial statements for 2009 and 2010.
Autonomy, founded by Mike Lynch, was bought for $11 billion by Hewlett Packard (HP (NYSE:HPQ)) in 2011, but the deal turned sour a year later when HP wrote off three-quarters of the former FTSE 100 company’s value, alleging it had been deceived by its finances.
The Financial Reporting Council said Deloitte has also been severely reprimanded, and has agreed to provide a ""root cause"" analysis of the reasons for the misconduct.
Deloitte said it regretted that the FRC tribunal had ruled that aspects of its audit work on Autonomy between 2009 and 2011 fell below the professional standards required. 
""Our audit practices and processes have evolved significantly since this work was performed over a decade ago, and we continue to transform our audit by investing in firm-wide controls, technology and processes,"" Deloitte said.
Knights has been excluded from membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants for England and Wales for five years and fined 500,000 pounds, the FRC said. Mercer has been fined 250,000 pounds and received a severe reprimand.
Knights and Mercer said they believe they had acted professionally, diligently and in good faith, and disagree with the findings. ""We are grateful for the full and unwavering support of Deloitte in this matter,"" they said.
The FRC's previous record fine, of 10 million pounds in 2018, was for Big Four rival PwC's audit of retailer BHS, which later collapsed.
Deloitte had challenged the FRC sanctions at a Tribunal hearing in July.
""After lengthy, fully contested proceedings, the Tribunal concluded that the audit work fell significantly short of the standards expected of an audit firm and its partners,"" said Elizabeth Barrett, the FRC's executive counsel, in a statement.

The tribunal's report has not been published at this time, the FRC said. Deloitte was also ordered to pay all costs of the investigation, totalling 5.6 million pounds, together with tribunal costs.

Banks will be allowed to exclude coins, banknotes and deposits held at central banks when calculating a financial-strength metric known as the leverage ratio until late June next year, the ECB said in a statement on Thursday in Frankfurt.
Based on data from the end of March, the relief would increase banks’ aggregate leverage ratio from 5.36% to about 5.66%, the ECB said.
The coronavirus pandemic “has resulted in an ongoing need for a high degree of monetary policy accommodation, which in turn requires the undeterred functioning of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy,” the Governing Council said in an opinion laying the ground for the decision.
The option to temporarily relax the leverage ratio during the pandemic was introduced by European Union policy makers earlier this year when they tweaked legislation meant to support credit to companies and households. The ratio measures capital as a share of assets.
The ECB is already allowing banks to dip into their capital buffers and take a flexible approach to soured loans in order to give them the financial resources to swallow losses and keep lending.
A leverage ratio of 3% will become a binding requirement for banks in the European Union by the middle of next year. Lenders already disclose the metric now to give a better picture of their financial strength."

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Thursday, following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision not to provide additional stimulus at its latest meeting.  
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.8%.
The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday, and signalled that interest rates would stay close to zero at least through 2023, to support the economy's ongoing recovery.
However, in its first meeting since adopting a more tolerant stance on inflation, the U.S. central bank gave no indication of when it might increase its monthly bond purchases, disappointing some investors hoping for further largesse.
The focus now shifts to the Bank of England, which is expected to announce its latest policy decision at 7 AM ET (1100 GMT).
“The BOE’s not done,” said James Rossiter, an economist at TD Securities, reported by Bloomberg. “More quantitative easing is necessary and this meeting does provide a bit of an opportunity to shift things in that direction. The big cliff coming is on the employment side.” 
In corporate news,  Next  (LON:NXT) stock rose 2.6% after the U.K. fashion chain raised its profit outlook for the full year for a second time. It said business had proven ""more resilient than we expected"" in the first half, despite a 34% fall in sales and a pretax loss. Rivals  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and H&M (ST:HMb), had both reported a return to profitability in the latest three months. 
Trainline (LON:TRNT) also detailed the extent of the hit from the measures taken to curb the spread of Covid-19, with sales down 81% in the first half of fiscal 2021. That said, the U.K.-based company said trading started recovering in the second quarter, with the relaxation of travel restrictions. Its stock rose 2.1%.
IG Group (LON:IGG) soared 5.6% after the online trading platform posted a substantial jump in first-quarter revenue, benefiting from high levels of trading activity during these turbulent times.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Stocks fell and the dollar advanced on Thursday after the Federal Reserve pledged to keep interest rates low for a long time but stopped short of offering further stimulus to shore up a battered U.S. economy.
European stocks are expected to follow suit, with the futures for the bellwether Euro Stoxx 50 index trading 0.96% lower in early trade.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1.01%, running out of steam after five straight days of gains. Japan's Nikkei shed 0.63%.
U.S. S&P 500 futures fell 1.03% in Asia on Thursday following a 0.46% drop in the S&P 500 on Wall Street.
Tech shares fared worse, with the Nasdaq Composite dropping 1.25% on Wednesday. Nasdaq futures fell 1.14% in Asia.
""In essence, high-tech shares were overbought and we've seen a correction since early this month,"" said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at Nishimura Securities in Kyoto. ""I think that is still continuing, with the Fed just being a fresh trigger.""
The Fed said it would keep interest rates near zero until inflation is on track to ""moderately exceed"" the central bank's 2% inflation target ""for some time.""
New economic projections released with the policy statement showed most policymakers see interest rates on hold through to at least 2023, with inflation not breaching 2% over that period.
""Of course, sensible people wouldn't really hold anyone to macro forecasts that far out so we'll cross that bridge when we get to it,"" said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank in Toronto.
""Nevertheless, markets are priced for basically one outcome here and that is little inflation and no hikes for years to come.""

""By and large the Fed delivered the minimum of what had been expected by markets with a key focus on the implications of a move to 'flexible' inflation targeting,"" said Stephen Miller, investment strategist at GSFM in Sydney.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yielded 0.677%, a few basis points above its levels before the Fed.
The U.S. dollar gained against most other currencies.
The euro dropped 0.4% to $1.1767 while the Australian dollar lost 0.4% to $0.7278, having erased earlier gains made after stronger-than-expected local jobs data.
The Chinese yuan also dropped about 0.35% to 6.7686 per dollar, stepping back from a 16-month high hit on Wednesday.
The yen was little moved at 104.98 to the dollar having hit a 1-1/2-month high of 104.80 per dollar overnight.
With focus on new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who is seen by some as a strong opponent of a higher yen, some traders said the market may be tempted to test his resolve on the currency.
""One interesting speculative trade in the near-term will be to long the yen ahead of the coming long weekend in Japan,"" said a senior trading manager at a major Japanese bank.
The Bank of Japan maintained its policy as widely expected.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Thursday, as investors react with disappointment to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision not to add additional stimulus at its latest meeting.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.7% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 1.2%.
The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday, and signalled that interest rates would stay close to zero at least through 2023, to support the economy's ongoing recovery.
However, in its first meeting since adopting a more tolerant stance on inflation, the U.S. central bank did not offer further specifics on the central bank’s approach to monthly bond purchases, disappointing some investors hoping for further largesse.
“Nonetheless, the Fed remains wary, suggesting that the pandemic will ‘continue to weigh on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near-term, and pose considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term’,” wrote analysts at ING, in a research note.
Earlier Thursday, the Bank of Japan kept its key interest rate at -0.1% and left its asset purchases unchanged, while stating that the economy has started to pick up. 
The focus now shifts to the Bank of England, which is expected to announce its latest policy decision at 7 AM ET (1100 GMT).
“The BOE’s not done,” said James Rossiter, an economist at TD Securities, reported by Bloomberg. “More quantitative easing is necessary and this meeting does provide a bit of an opportunity to shift things in that direction. The big cliff coming is on the employment side.” 
In corporate news, EssilorLuxottica (PA:ESLX) is likely to be in the spotlight after the Franco-Italian eyewear manufacturer announced plans to join forces with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for the development of smart glasses. The first product is set to carry the Ray-Ban brand, and is expected to launch next year.
Oil prices fell Thursday, rebalancing after recent strong gains as producers in the Gulf of Mexico took steps to resume output in the wake of Hurricane Sally.
Additionally, the U.S. Energy Information Administration late Wednesday announced a draw of 4.389 million barrels for last week, a substantial figure but the market had already moved on the 9.517 million-barrel draw recorded by the American Petroleum Institute the day before.
A panel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, together known as OPEC+, meets on Thursday to review the market, but is not expected to announce any market-moving measures.

NEW DELHI/DETROIT (Reuters) - Delays to General Motors' (N:GM) sale of its Indian plant to Great Wall Motor (SS:601633) due to tensions between India and China are likely to result in hefty unplanned costs for the U.S. automaker, people familiar with the matter said.
Gaining Indian government approval for China-related deals is now expected to take quite some time and although the sale should still happen at some point, GM has not changed its plan to begin winding down the plant's operations next month, they said.
""By next year, it will either be a closed GM site or it will be an operating site with Great Wall,"" said one source.
GM had planned to use the expected sale proceeds of $250 million-$300 million to pay off liabilities incurred with its exit from manufacturing in India in what a second source said would have been a ""no gain-no loss"" situation.
Although money will come through once the deal is done, it will now have to pay out of pocket for severance pay, some of which would never have occurred had the deal proceeded smoothly, as well as other costs - which could amount to a couple hundred million dollars, according to the second source. 
Sources also said severance pay costs could be much higher than usual due to lack of clarity about the deal's prospects and workers' demands for greater relief given the low chances of finding new jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The sources were not authorised to discuss the deal and spoke on condition of anonymity.
GM stopped selling in the world's second most populous nation at the end of 2017 after years of low sales but the factory continues to build vehicles for export. Located in the western state of Maharashtra, the plant employs about 4,000.
If workers don't agree to the severance offered, GM will need local government clearance to lay off staff. That is often a long, bureaucratic process which could help stoke worker protests or political opposition, the sources said. 
GM said in a statement it continues to work toward ending production at the plant and closing the deal with Great Wall. Great Wall did not respond to a request for comment. 
ENSNARED IN TENSIONS
The sale was announced in January and had been slated to close in the second half of 2020. Just when it might proceed remains highly uncertain.
In April, India introduced stricter rules for investments from China and other neighbouring countries aimed at preventing pandemic-hit Indian companies being taken over at bargain prices. A number of central government ministries are now required to sign off on the deal, instead of just Maharashtra state.
Then in June, a deadly border clash between the two nations resulted in a further clampdown on Chinese businesses and Maharashtra put three investment proposals from Chinese companies, including Great Wall's, on hold.
Further complicating matters, GM and Great Wall did not seek central government approval until late July, the sources said.
Investment proposals from Chinese companies are unlikely to be approved until tension at the border dissipates, two central government officials told Reuters. 
India's finance and commerce ministries did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Great Wall ""now feels it is impossible to finish the transaction this year,"" a company source said.
The hold-up has made the Chinese automaker nervous as it had planned to launch its first India-made car in the first half of 2021, said a separate person aware of the plans.
The company, which plans to invest $1 billion in India, has started hiring staff, including executives to run the plant, and is in talks with auto parts suppliers, the person said. 

But even after the central government greenlights the project, Great Wall will still need more than three months to finalise investment terms with Maharashtra state and to revamp the plant, the person added.

1405,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 12:54AM ET</span>",Oracle Would Get Access to TikTok Code in Proposed Deal,"(Bloomberg) --  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). will get full access to review TikTok’s source code and updates to make sure there are no back doors used by the company’s Chinese parent to gather data on the video-sharing app’s 100 million American users, according to people familiar with the matter.
TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd. and Oracle submitted these details in their proposal to the Trump administration with a goal of averting an outright sale of the app or a shutdown of its U.S. operations set to take effect Sept. 20. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to ban the app in a pair of executive orders issued last month based on U.S. national security concerns.
The terms of the agreement seem to fall short of meeting those national security concerns expressed by administration officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to people familiar with the matter. Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr and other members of the administration have been talking directly with Oracle executives, one person said.
Beijing is less likely to oppose the current deal since it doesn’t involve the transfer of ByteDance’s algorithms, which recently enacted export restrictions specifically encompass, a person close to the negotiations said. But Trump, speaking Wednesday with reporters, said he is getting a briefing on the issue Thursday morning, adding that he didn’t like the idea of ByteDance retaining control of TikTok.
“Just conceptually, I can tell you I don’t like that,” he said after a reporter told him that ByteDance would retain a majority of the company’s assets, with Oracle acquiring a minority stake.
“I’m not prepared to sign off of anything,” Trump said. “I have to see the deal.”
TikTok has emerged as a top target in Trump’s effort to crack down on China ahead of the Nov. 3 election. The president is trailing his Democratic opponent Joe Biden in the polls and seeking to use his tough stance with Beijing as a selling point to voters. That’s despite the fact that American investors collectively hold roughly 40% of ByteDance’s equity, with the rest owned by founder Zhang Yiming, ByteDance employees and non-U.S. investors, the person said.
TikTok declined to comment. Oracle didn’t respond to requests for comment.
ByteDance plans to create a new standalone company for TikTok’s U.S. operations in which it would remain majority owner, but give Oracle and other American investors minority stakes in the new business. Public statements made by both companies calling Oracle the newly formed company’s “trusted technology partner” were met with confusion, one of the people said.
The new details shed light on Oracle’s role in the partnership and go beyond just housing data inside the software company’s U.S. cloud servers, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
Oracle will be able to check all source code from the algorithms that decide which TikTok videos get shown to which U.S. users to ensure there are no entry points for the Chinese parent. Oracle, the world’s second-largest software maker, will be able to continue to review the technology as updates come in to make sure there are no new points of access to the data, the people said.
Under the proposed deal, the newly formed TikTok would also hire an independent board approved by the U.S. government. The new U.S.-based company would allow oversight by a third party, which will report to the U.S. government and provide continuous audits, reports and protocols for handling any incidents that may arise, according to the people. That means if, say, Beijing finds a way to infiltrate TikTok’s code, Oracle and the independent board would have the means and agency to spot it.
Despite the terms, administration officials remain wary about the proposed new ownership structure and how much influence that would give China over the company.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has reviewed the proposed deal. Attorney General William Barr was only briefed on the deal Wednesday and is reviewing it, according to a Justice Department official who declined to comment further. Barr spoke with Oracle executives Wednesday morning, two people familiar with the situation said. Pompeo had a conversation with the company officials last week.
The Treasury, State and Justice departments are all part of the Committee for Foreign Investments in the U.S., or Cfius, which reviews deals for national security implications. In a meeting Tuesday afternoon, officials raised concerns about a deal that would leave a majority stake of TikTok’s U.S. assets in ByteDance’s hands, with Oracle taking a minority share, the people said.
The proposal also calls for the newly formed U.S. company to hire 25,000 American workers in a wide range of jobs from content moderation, engineering, product and marketing.
However, the company is not going to recreate the powerful algorithms that run the app based on data that ByteDance has collected for years, one person said. ByteDance will still have visibility into the algorithms, but Oracle will be able to monitor the data flows and review and approve all updates to the code.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 12:50AM ET</span>",Japan government contacted Toshiba shareholders before AGM: sources,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Takashi Umekawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government contacted several foreign shareholders in Toshiba Corp (T:6502) ahead of the conglomerate's annual meeting, three people familiar with the matter said, in what at least one investor saw as an attempt to influence voting.
The revelations raise further questions about interference in governance at Toshiba, following calls for an investigation into uncounted votes at the contentious July 31 shareholder meeting.
Representatives of the powerful Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) called at least three funds ahead of the meeting to inquire if they had collaborated with other investors, two of the people said.
The ministry was particularly focused on whether the funds collaborated with Toshiba's top shareholder, Effissimo Capital Management, communication that could violate rules preventing shareholders from ""acting in concert"", the two people said. 
One of the funds interpreted METI's questioning as a signal to back Toshiba's management and not investor proposals at the meeting, one of the sources said. Foreign shareholders had proposed electing some new directors to the board, something management had opposed.
The sources declined to be identified because the information is not public.
METI declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, calling the allegations ""rumours"".
A representative for Effissimo said the fund could not comment. A Toshiba spokeswoman said the company would not comment on speculation. 
Reuters reported this month that about 1,300 postal voting forms went uncounted at the meeting.
Last month, a major investor called for an investigation, saying its vote had not been recognised.
Reuters previously reported activist fund Effissimo was kept in limbo by the government over its vote until the day before the gathering. 
Together, the revelations have deepened concerns about the treatment of minority shareholders and what appears to be a retreat from the push for better governance in recent years.
'ACTING IN CONCERT'
Singapore-based Effissimo, which owned around 15% of Toshiba but has since scaled that back to around 10%, had nominated three candidates to the Toshiba board. Effissimo has said Toshiba's governance has not improved since a 2015 accounting scandal. 
Under Japanese regulations, shareholders deemed to be ""acting in concert"" can be required to submit ownership disclosure filings or, in some cases, can be charged with insider trading.
METI used a similar approach with several foreign shareholders last year, when U.S. hedge fund King Street Capital Management sought to replace a majority of the Toshiba board, according to one of the sources and another person.
King Street declined to comment.
Investors have often complained about what they say is ambiguity in the regulations. Some investors and experts also say the regulations prevent shareholders from working together to improve governance at companies.
In 2017, when Japanese regulators revised the code, one of the public comments submitted to regulators complained the government failed to give investors assurance they could collectively engage with companies without infringing on regulations.
Nicholas Benes, head of the Board Director Training Institute of Japan and an expert on governance, said Japanese regulators should come up with ""safe harbour"" criteria, similar to those in Britain, that prohibit use of insider information but allow investors to make joint recommendations to companies.
Toshiba has been under pressure from activist funds since it sold 600 billion yen ($5.6 billion) of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017.

At the meeting, Toshiba CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani saw a precipitous slide in his support to just 58% from 99% a year earlier - a rare rebuke of a Japan Inc chief executive.

Investment, both direct investment by companies and venture capital flows, between the two countries fell 16.2% to $10.9 billion in January-June from the same period a year earlier - also hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, according to figures from consultancy Rhodium Group.
That's a far cry from half-yearly totals of nearly $40 billion seen in 2016 and 2017.
Citing national security risks posed by Chinese technology firms, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has sharply expanded actions to hobble Chinese companies.
This has included putting telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on its trade blacklist, threatening similar action for Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981) and ordering TikTok owner ByteDance to divest the short-form video app. 
ByteDance is currently seeking approval for a deal with  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) that is structured as a partnership rather than an outright sale. 
""At a time of rising discomfort with US-China technology integration numerous other companies - both Chinese firms operating in the U.S. and U.S. firms with a presence in China may be forced to divest,"" the report said. 
It added that the U.S. treatment of ByteDance and the broader shift away from U.S.-China technology integration may lead to policies which make it more difficult for U.S. tech firms to operate in China.
Investment by U.S. firms in China in the first half tumbled 31% to $4.1 billion, while investment by Chinese companies in the United States rose 38% to $4.7 billion, the report said. That was mostly due to one deal - a Tencent Music (N:TME) -led consortium’s purchase of a minority stake in Universal Music group for $3.4 billion.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 12:35AM ET</span>",Chip group to warn Trump administration against blacklisting China's SMIC: document,"By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Companies that supply the chip sector with sophisticated and expensive equipment plan to warn the Trump administration against a proposal to blacklist China's top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981), arguing it would be ""detrimental"" to U.S. industry. 
The companies are represented by the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing suppliers industry group SEMI, which drafted a letter seen by Reuters that could be sent as soon as this week to Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross. 
In the draft letter, the group argued that blacklisting SMIC would jeopardize the United States' technological edge by making it harder for U.S. companies to supply the company, which accounts for as much as $5 billion in annual U.S. origin equipment and material sales. 
They also argue that such a move would ""contribute to a growing perception"" that the delivery of U.S. goods is ""unreliable"" and hit U.S. market share worldwide. 
""We urge the Department to carefully consider the immediate and long-term detrimental impacts to U.S. industry, economic and national security that may result from the addition of SMIC to the Entity List,"" said the group, which has 2,400 members worldwide, including SMIC and U.S. chip equipment makers  Lam Research Corp  (O:LRCX) and Applied Materials Inc (O:AMAT). 
The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Joe Pasetti, SEMI's vice president of global public policy, said: “We don't comment on draft letters leaked to the press."" 
Reuters reported earlier this month that the Defense Department was working with other agencies to determine whether to add SMIC to the Commerce Department's ""entity list,"" which would force U.S. suppliers to seek hard-to-get licenses before shipping to the company. 
Shares of the company plunged by nearly a quarter on the news.
SMIC said in a statement at the time that it was ""in complete shock"" over the news but was open to communication with U.S. government agencies in hopes of resolving any misunderstandings. While a Defense Department official did not disclose the motive for the proposed action, SMIC's relationship to the Chinese military is under scrutiny, sources told Reuters, as the Trump administration increasingly trains its focus on China's military muscle. 

The entity list has been used as a tool by the administration against Chinese companies under scrutiny in Washington over national security concerns, from telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to surveillance equipment producer Hikvision (SZ:002415).

Investing.com – Asian stocks were down on Thursday morning, with investors digesting the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision alongside yet another U.S. tech stocks selloff during the previous session.
The Fed said on Wednesday that it would keep interest rates near zero until inflation is on track to “moderately exceed” its 2% inflation target “for some time”, aiming to correct years of weak inflation and the addition of as many jobs for as long as possible.
But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did not offer further specifics on the central bank’s approach to monthly bond purchases, disappointing some investors expecting more details on plans for longer maturities. Powell also said that policy would continue to be accommodative but warned that the path towards U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 “remains highly uncertain”.
Other Fed officials have also recently emphasized that recovery is highly contingent on better control of the COVID-19 virus, with over 6.6 million cases in the country as of September 17, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Another factor is the U.S. Congress’ ability to pass the latest stimulus measures to support jobs and incomes. The White House is signaling a willingness to increase the package’s price tag and is urging Senate Republicans to work with Democrats to seal a deal within the next week to 10 days, raising investor hopes for a long-awaited deal.
But some investors remained optimistic that further Fed stimulus measures would compensate even if Congress delays approving the package even further.
“Even with the risk of a delayed fiscal package, more fiscal support will be delivered and along with easy financial conditions and a low rate outlook for the next couple of years maintains a supportive backdrop for risk assets and downward pressure on the dollar,” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management global market strategist Kerry Craig told Bloomberg.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - WeChat users will not face civil or criminal penalties even if the United States bans the Chinese-owned messaging app through other actions next week, the Justice Department said on Wednesday.
In August, President Donald Trump unveiled a proposed sweeping ban on U.S. transactions with Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd, owner of the popular mainland Chinese app. The executive order, which called WeChat and Bytedance's short-video app TikTok ""significant threats"" to national security, followed stepped-up U.S. efforts to purge ""untrusted"" Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is set to release regulations by Sunday clarifying what WeChat transactions will be prohibited.
WeChat users have filed a motion in U.S. District Court in San Francisco seeking a preliminary injunction to bar the Trump administration from prohibiting the use of WeChat in the United States by individual users, businesses and groups. A hearing on the request is for Thursday.
The Justice Department responded in a filing on Wednesday that Ross does not plan to target persons or groups who only download or use WeChat to convey personal or business information and said they would not face criminal or civil penaltes.
But the department added that ""use of the app for such communications could be directly or indirectly impaired through measures targeted at other transactions.""
The WeChat users who sued said the order apparently prohibits ""millions of WeChat users in the United States ... from using the most popular social media space for Chinese speakers in the world.""
WeChat has been downloaded 19 million times in the United States, showed data from Sensor Tower, but in China, the app is ubiquitous as a medium for services, games and payments.

Trump's order said WeChat ""automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users,"" which ""threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information.""

1411,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 08:35PM ET</span>","Trump contradicts CDC director on vaccine, masks: 'He was confused'","By Manas Mishra, Carl O'Donnell and Alexandra Alper
(Reuters) - President Donald Trump took exception on Wednesday to comments from the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who said a coronavirus vaccine could be broadly rolled out in mid-2021 and that masks might be even more effective.
Robert Redfield, in testimony to a congressional committee, said that general availability of a vaccine could come by ""late second quarter, third quarter 2021.""
Trump, at a news conference, said he believed a vaccine will be rolled out much sooner. He said he called Redfield after his testimony to question him about it, and that Redfield appeared to have been confused by the question.
""I think he made a mistake when he said that,"" Trump said of Redfield's testimony. ""I dont think he means that. When he said it, I believe he was confused.""
Trump said a vaccine may be available in a matter of weeks and that there was a plan to begin distributing it widely soon after the Food and Drug Administration approves it. Trump is eager to have progress on a vaccine ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Trump also criticized Redfield for saying wearing a mask can be just as effective as a vaccine. Trump was initially reluctant to urge Americans to wear masks but has since been more willing to do so. Still, he has held a number of tightly packed events where many participants have not worn face coverings.
""Number one, it's not more effective than a vaccine and I called him about that,"" Trump said.
Reiterating remarks he had made on Tuesday at an ABC News town hall, Trump said people wearing masks at restaurants can be problematic.
""Masks have problems too,"" said Trump. ""The masks have to be handled very carefully...I see people in restaurants and they’re playing with their masks.""
Despite quibbling with Redfield, Trump said he retained confidence in his performance at the CDC.
Redfield, who is a member of Trump's coronavirus task force, did say that a vaccine could be ready as soon as this November or December, and that limited first doses could go to those who were most vulnerable, but that it might take until mid-2021 for it to be widely available.
""As soon as (a) vaccine gets approved or cleared, we want to be in a position to distribute it within 24 hours,"" Redfield told the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.
But ""in order to have enough of us immunized to have immunity, I think it’s going to take six to nine months,"" he added.
Several companies are in late-stage trials and have expressed optimism, but none of the vaccines are yet proven to be effective and safe. 
The federal government will allocate vaccines for each state based on the critical populations recommended first for vaccination by the U.S. CDC.
Testing also is accelerating and U.S. capacity could reach 3 million per day this month, Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told the same hearing. 

The capacity could scale up to as high as 135 million tests a month by October, Giroir added.

(Reuters) - EQT Corp (N:EQT), the largest U.S. natural gas producer by volume, has placed a bid on  Chevron  Corp's (N:CVX) Appalachia gas properties and a pipeline stake, people familiar with the matter said. 
EQT offered $750 million for the properties, one of the people familiar with the matter said. 
Chevron last year said it was considering sale of the properties and took an $8.17 billion charge to earnings to write down their value and an unrelated U.S. offshore project. Most of the impairment charge was for the gas properties. 
Chevron is marketing about 800,000 acres in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins of Pennsylvania and neighboring states and a 31% non-operating interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream, which has intrastate and gathering lines servicing the Marcellus shale area.
EQT declined to comment. EQT Chief Executive Toby Rice in July described Appalachia shale as ""a buyer's market,"" and called consolidation an opportunity for the Pittsburgh-based company. 
Bids for the properties were received on Aug. 12 and are being evaluated, Chevron said in response to inquiries. It declined to comment on the bids. 
There is no guarantee the talks will lead to a sale to EQT or another company. 
The shale assets are from Chevron's purchase of producer Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Energy for $4.3 billion including debt in 2010, a time when shale gas fields were selling at large premiums. A year earlier,  Exxon Mobil  Corp. (N:XOM) agreed to pay $30 billion for XTO Energy, then a large Appalachian shale basin operator.
The deals soured for both companies. In addition to Chevron's writedown, Exxon later took a $2 billion writedown on the value of its natural gas assets. 
U.S. natural gas futures (NGc1) are trading at about $2.27 a million British Thermal Units (BTUs) and have languished well below their peak 12 years ago when gas traded as high as $12.78 per million British Thermal Units. 

The Appalachian assets last year produced 262 million cubic feet of natural gas, on a net daily basis. EQT had average daily sales volumes of about 4.1 billion cubic feet equivalent.

BOSTON (Reuters) - For 17 years Jeffrey Smith, the co-founder of activist investment firm Starboard Value LP, has been telling public companies he and his team can help improve their operations. Now he is saying the same thing to private companies.
Starboard this week said it had raised $360 million through a blank-check acquisition vehicle called SVAC and plans to buy a solid but underperforming private business in the technology, healthcare, consumer, industrials, hospitality or entertainment sector to then merge it into a publicly traded company.
There are already nearly 100 so-called SPACs, including activist investor William Ackman's Tontine Holdings and former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive Gary Cohn and former hedge fund manager Cliff Robbins' CohnRobbins Holdings, searching for deals.
What makes Starboard stand out, Smith said in an interview, is the firm's long history of improving public companies like Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) with a team of experts.
""If a family places their company, their baby essentially, with us, we will take their business to a better place,"" he said, adding that he and the advisers and directors he recruited to SVAC can identify and repair weaknesses and be a bridge to the public markets that would not have existed before.
Starboard, which won 17 board seats in the first half of 2020, more than all other activists, has been known to frighten ""insecure"" corporate chiefs with its phone calls, Smith acknowledged. 
But now, he said, chiefs of private companies are flattered when he calls. ""They know I can't do anything without their permission and they want to hear what I have to say.""
After the initial approach, Smith says the work that needs doing at a private or public company is often similar and that Starboard's approach would be the same; following a time-tested playbook that lifted returns at Darden Restaurants (O:PZZA) and Papa John's Pizza (O:PZZA).
At a time many companies have seen their business upended by the COVID-19 crisis, Smith said it was more critical than ever to have top performing executives. But some boards are using the pandemic as a shield to stick with the status quo, he said, warning ""boards cannot accept mediocrity now because the difference between the great and mediocre will be magnified.""
After selling nearly three quarters of its holdings in eBay (O:EBAY) and exiting Resideo Technologies (N:REZI) , Starboard, which invests roughly $6 billion in assets, has dry powder for new campaigns.

""We are finding great opportunities, and this is a good environment to keep doing what we are doing,"" Smith said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three senior Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday asked government auditors to study why U.S. auto safety regulators have failed to write dozens of new auto safety regulations. 
The delayed rules include rear belt warnings, revisions to vehicle defect reporting requirements, child restraint side impact tests, requiring automakers to e-mail recall notices, large bus and motor-coach rollover structural integrity requirements and making it easier to install child safety seats. Many have been delayed by more than four years.
Representative Frank Pallone, who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, along with Representatives Jan Schakowsky and Lisa Blunt Rochester, asked the Government Accountability Office to study the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) research and rulemaking process ""to identify factors contributing to delays.""
Under President Donald Trump, NHTSA has never had a Senate-confirmed administrator, the first time in history the agency has gone so long without a permanent head. It has been more than a year since the White House had a nominee pending.
In 2012 and 2015, Congress directed NHTSA to implement numerous safety mandates but lawmakers said ""NHTSA has failed to implement nearly 20 congressionally mandated rulemakings, reports, and research initiatives by their statutory deadlines.""
A NHTSA spokesman did not immediately comment, but lawmakers said the agency told them it ""initiates a rulemaking when it has sufficient data to do so.""
NHTSA has historically struggled to meet congressional deadlines to write new vehicle safety regulations and complete other reports.
In August, the Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General said it would audit oversight of U.S. vehicle safety standards by NHTSA.
Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said NHTSA has ""actively chosen to ignore the will of Congress for years when it comes to implementing safety laws, costing lives and money.""

Investing.com – The Dow eased from highs on Wednesday, as investors weighed up a rout in tech and the Federal Reserve's pledge to keep rates lower for a prolonged period. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.13%, or 37 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.43%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.25%.
Tech took a breather following its strong start to the week, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) falling 3% a day after unveiling new iPads and Apple watches and a new bundled subscription service as well as a personalized workout service.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were also lower.
The weakness in tech pressured the broader market to retreat from session highs offsetting the Fed's dovish policy announcement.     
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would target inflation to run above 2% for some time. 
""With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent,"" The Fed said in a statement. 
The latest economic projections from the Fed appear to support expectations for rates to remain lower for longer, with policymakers backing the central bank to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.1% through 2023. 
Energy surged 4% as U.S. oil prices rallied after crude inventories fell by 4.4 million barrels last week, confounding expectations for a build of 1.27 million barrels.
EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) were among the biggest gainers, with the latter rising more than 7%.
Financials also climbed higher even as Treasury yields moved higher despite the Fed's low-interest-rate pledge. 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) rose 2.7%, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) rose 1.3%. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) added 0.4%.
Signs of softer retail sales raised concerns about the economic recovery at a time when the prospect of further fiscal stimulus appears murky at best.
U.S. retail sales rose less than forecast in August, up 0.6% after a downwardly revised 0.9% increase the prior month, The Commerce Department said. The increase for August had been expected at 1%.
“August retail sales data, along with downward revisions to July data, show a clear slowdown in consumer demand over the summer months,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. “The combination of fading fiscal support and lack of pentup demand clearly contributed to the summer slowdown.”

Investing.com -- Stocks initially surged Wednesday when the Federal Reserve said it would hold rates steady and vowed not to raise them until 2023, but technology didn't join in the festivities.
Heading into the closing bell, however, stocks lost momentum and erased earlier gains, with the S&P 500 even going negative.
Tech stalwarts like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) helped lead the declines, along with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW)rolled out the biggest software IPO on record, more than doubling at the open.
The week is set to be a big one for IPOs, with several more on tap for Thursday. Jobs and home building data are also on deck.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. The IPO party continues
Investors continue to pounce on new stock offerings, especially in the tech sector, despite high prices. Cloud software maker Snowflake proved that on Wednesday, more than doubling when it opened from its $120 IPO price. The shares soared as high as $319 and settled back in the $260 range by the end of trading.
It's the biggest week for IPOs since May 2019, with Snowflake being the biggest so far this year. Also due out this week are IPOs from Amwell, a telehealth company, and Dyne Therapeutics, a muscle disease therapeutics company.
2. More jobs data as Fed adjusts unemployment projection
Thursday is the weekly report on jobless claims, which have been holding steady in recent weeks. The numbers are due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Initial jobless claims are expected to come in at 850,000, which would be a slight tick down from the 884,000 claims the prior week. Continuing claims are expected to be in the neighborhood of 13,000, down from 13,385 the previous week.
The four-week average for jobless claims is around 970,000. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve projected the year-end unemployment rate to be 7.6%, down from an earlier projection of 9.3%. The jobless rate in August was 8.4%.
3. Housing starts boost shares of home builders
Housing starts for August are estimated to be around 1.48 million compare to 1.49 million the prior month, a positive sign of economic recovery. The report is also due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Homebuilder stocks jumped more than 3% each on Wednesday and are having a strong year despite the interruptions caused by Covid lockdowns.  LGI Homes  (NASDAQ:LGIH) is up 63% this year,  Lennar  Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton Inc (SA:D1HI34) are up more than 40%, PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM)is up 19% and  Toll Brothers  Inc (NYSE:TOL) is up 13%.

While shares shorted on the electric automaker had been decreasing over the last month, shorting picked up pace since a report by Hindenburg last week, S3 Partners said.
In its scathing report, the short-seller alleged Nikola of misleading investors and partners. But the electric carmaker has denied the charge and accused Hindenburg of manipulating the stock.
Shares shorted on Nikola decreased by 362,000 units worth $12 million last month, according to S3. But over the last week, there were 2.2 million of new short sales.
""Short sellers are burning through the last of the stock borrows over the last week with 2.2 million of new short sales, worth $74 million,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of Predictive Analytics at S3.
A short sale involves borrowing of shares by an investor who then sells them expecting to buy back at a lower price to pay back the loan.
S3 said stock borrowing fees on existing shorts were 11.33%, but for new shorts, they were trending as high as 50%.

Short interest on Nikola currently stood at $387 million, or 8.69% of its outstanding shares, S3 said.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) Chief Executive Doug Parker and seven major airline unions on Wednesday made a new push to win additional government assistance to keep nearly 20,000 workers on the payroll past Oct. 1.
In a letter to congressional leaders, the White House and Treasury, Parker and the unions warned ""nearly 20,000 American Airlines team members are facing furloughs in just two short weeks, and several markets in our domestic network are at risk of significant reductions in air service.""
The letter implored the leaders ""to find a way to work together to reach agreement on a COVID-19 relief bill that includes a clean extension"" of payroll support.
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany did not offer details on what actions the administration might take to help airlines.
""The president has mentioned previously that he wanted to take a good look at airlines and help where he can. Of course, we need Congress in a lot of this,"" she said.
The letter added: ""Our conversations with each of you suggest a deal is within reach, and there is no time to waste.""
Last month, American said it planned to suspend flights to 15 smaller U.S. airports in October as travel demand remains low due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Congress has been weighing for weeks whether to grant U.S. airlines another $25 billion in payroll assistance that would keep tens of thousands of airline workers on the job for another six months and extend minimum service requirements.
American said it will cancel just over 700 flights in October to and from those 15 airports.

Major U.S. airlines that received portions of $25 billion in payroll assistance were required to maintain minimum flights through Sept. 30, but the government could opt to extend those requirements. American received $5.8 billion in payroll assistance.

""We will deliver positive cash flow in the back half,"" Culp said.
The Boston-based industrial conglomerate reported cash outflow of $2.1 billion from industrial operations in the second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic pummeled demand in its aviation business.
Analysts expect GE third-quarter cash outflow to be about $656 million and cash inflow of about $1.17 billion in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

Culp said the company's performance in the second half of the year will set the stage for a positive cash flow in 2021 as well.

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",Novartis ties bond sale to malaria treatment access in sustainability push,"By Yoruk Bahceli
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Novartis raised 1.85 billion euros on Wednesday from the sale of a bond on which interest payments will rise if the drugmaker fails to expand access to medicines and programmes to combat malaria and leprosy in a number of developing countries. 
Investors are increasingly pushing companies to improve their track record on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues while sustainable investing grows in popularity, spurring an increase in sustainable debt issuance year after year.
Novartis' bond is only the third issue to date to link payments to creditors to company-wide sustainable development targets. 
Italian utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) pioneered the structure in late 2019, tying interest payments to key performance indicators (KPI), and Brazilian pulp and paper maker Suzano sold a heavily oversubscribed $750 million carbon emissions-linked bond less than a week ago. 
The Swiss drugmaker received 3.25 billion euros of demand for its eight-year bond, which priced with a 0.08% yield, according to a lead manager. 
Unlike green bonds - the biggest financing vehicle in the sustainable investment space which links funds to specific environmentally-focussed projects - sustainability-linked bonds are tied to goals at the company level.
While Enel and Suzano's linked interest payments to climate-related goals, Novartis is the first company targeting a social goal. 
It will have to pay an additional 25 basis points in interest payments after 2025 if the company fails to achieve either of its two targets - a threefold increase in access to a number of drugs and a 50% increase in access to its programmes targeting diseases like leprosy and malaria in lower middle income countries. 

""Today's announcement is another important step on our journey to integrate ESG into the core of our business, measure our progress, hold ourselves accountable, and demonstrate our dedication to making good on our promise to broaden global access to our medicines,"" Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said in a statement.

Snowflake is valued in the IPO at more than $33 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its prospectus. That compares with a valuation of $12.4 billion in a private funding round announced in February, according to Bloomberg. Demand was oversubscribed by 40 times, according to CNBC.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) and Salesforce Ventures, of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), each committed to buy $250 million of the company’s Class A common stock in a private placement.

1433,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Delta to Borrow $9 Billion in Largest Airline Debt Deal Ever,"(Bloomberg) -- Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). is raising $9 billion in the industry’s largest debt deal ever, tapping into investors’ rampant demand for yield while seeking to survive a slowdown that’s causing it to burn through $27 million a day.
The bonds, secured by Delta’s frequent-flier program, carry high-grade ratings, but some may yield as much as 4.875%, according people with knowledge of the matter. That’s more than double the average 2.31% yield on the lowest-rated unsecured investment-grade bonds, even with a higher duration, according to a Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index.
The prospective payout is so alluring to investors that they’ve placed three times as many orders as bonds and loans available for sale. That allowed Delta to boost the size of the deal from an original $6.5 billion -- which the company said already would’ve been enough to rule out the need for additional federal aid.
The carrier is taking advantage of a wide-open market for corporate debt that’s seen both record supply and demand spurred by an accommodative Federal Reserve. Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. similarly said it wouldn’t seek government funding after borrowing $25 billion in April in the year’s largest bond sale.
Investor Interest
As of Wednesday morning, investors had placed about $16 billion of orders for the bonds and around $10 billion for the loan, the people said, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. The $2.5 billion of five-year bonds may yield between 4.5% and 4.625%, while the $3.5 billion eight-year portion is being marketed around 4.75% to 4.875%, the people said.
Commitments on the $3 billion of loans have been accelerated to Wednesday, which is also when the bonds are expected to price.
Representatives for  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., which is lead manager on the bond sale, and Barclays Plc, which is leading the loan, declined to comment. A representative for Delta also declined to comment.
At $9 billion, Delta’s transaction would be the largest ever for a commercial carrier. United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. previously set that record with a $6.8 billion sale of bonds and loans in June, inspiring peers to similarly pledge their miles rewards programs as collateral.
The debt will help boost Delta’s liquidity as passenger volumes are only 30% of what they were this time last year, according to a memo by Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian on Tuesday. Proceeds could also be used to help repay a $3 billion term loan due in March, as well as a revolving credit facility of the same amount, according to Moody’s Investors Service.

The Court of Justice of the European Union this month ruled that an Italian law which forced Vivendi (PA:VIV), Mediaset's second-biggest shareholder, to freeze most of its voting rights in the Italian group violated the bloc's rules.
The EU court decision prompted AGCOM to start a review of its decision to curb Vivendi's stake in Mediaset, which is controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. 
Last week the authority asked the Italian state lawyer's office for an opinion on the case which was then discussed during a meeting on Wednesday, sources said.
But the authority did not reach a conclusion yet as it needs more time to evaluate the opinion given the complexity of the case, the sources said, adding a decision could come as soon as next week. 
In 2017 AGCOM ruled that Vivendi's stakes in Mediaset and Italy's biggest phone group  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) broke rules designed to prevent a concentration of power in the telecoms and media sectors. 
It ordered Vivendi to reduce one of its holdings to below 10%.
To comply with the Italian regulator's request, Vivendi transferred two-thirds of its 29% stake in Mediaset into an arm's-length trust, which has been barred from voting at the Italian broadcaster's shareholder meetings.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>",September green bond flurry puts market on track for record year,"By Yoruk Bahceli
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Global green bond sales are heading for another record year as a flurry of September deals, including Germany's debut sovereign issue, have roused the market from a coronavirus-induced lull.
Green issues, which source financing for environmentally beneficial expenditures, are crucial to the growing pool of money dedicated to investing sustainably. Sales slumped when the pandemic erupted but are now back on track.
Worth around $700 billion worldwide, the market's prospects were boosted this year by the European Union's 750 billion-euro coronavirus recovery fund. Around a third of it should be financed by green debt, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday.
Issuance of EU green debt, which may eventually double the global green bond universe, is yet to start but year-to-date issuance by other borrowers has reached $150 billion, topping that raised by this point last year, according to data from Dealogic.
Most notable was Germany's debut green bond, the first step towards establishing a pricing reference point for regional borrowers which should entice more borrowers into the market.
Other big names hitting green markets in September were Sweden, JPMorgan (JPM) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn). On Wednesday, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) saw big demand for its green deal despite being tainted by an old emissions cheating scandal.
Graphic: Green bond market on track for growth - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbjkqqvq/mO084-green-bond-market-on-track-for-growth-after-covid-hit.png
Joshua Kendall, head of responsible investment research and stewardship at Insight Investment, expects green issuance to surpass the 2019 record of $206 billion -- unless the pandemic slows markets again. Another forecast, by ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO), says full-year issuance could hit as much as $225 billion. 
""Companies are recognising that they had to, maybe, hold off on their plans, but I don't think there was any concern that it would be a permanent change or an adjustment,"" Kendall said.
""The (green) bond market is fairly resilient and companies are very committed to this issue.""
STILL A WAY TO GO 
Despite its fast paced growth, the green bond market only accounted for 3.5% of last year's total global bond issuance of $7.15 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlement.
And the lead green debt enjoyed over the other two main avenues of sustainable fundraising - social bonds and sustainable bonds, a blend of green and social - has been eroded this year.
That's because the coronavirus outbreak has spurred a rise in social bond sales, many earmarked to fund coronavirus-related spending. 
Social bonds account for 21% of all sustainable issuance this year, versus 6% in 2019, while the share of green bonds has declined to 62%, down from 79% last year, Dealogic data up to Sept 10 shows. 
Finnish public sector lender MuniFin and French agency Caisse d'Amortissement de la Dette Sociale (CADES) are among those to have issued social bonds in September. 
""As we're normalising to the COVID economy, I don't think green is going anywhere,"" said Trisha Taneja, head of ESG advisory at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), one of the banks which managed the German sale.
""I think social will simultaneously rise, but not at the expense of green.""

The new car, the first to be launched since Ferrari (MI:RACE) shut its operations for seven weeks during a COVID-19 lockdown, was launched online, with video presentations outlining its restyling and technical innovations.
The Portofino M convertible grand tourer (GT) features a redesigned powertrain, eight-speed gearbox and a five-position Manettino switch that includes a race mode.
Ferrari, best known for its high performance sportscars, is now aiming to increase sales of GTs, which are designed to be comfortable on longer road trips. 
It has said previously that about 40% of total sales could come from GT models by 2022, up from 32%.
Enrico Galliera, Ferrari's chief marketing and commercial officer, told a virtual news conference that deliveries of the Portofino M would start in Europe from the second quarter of next year, with a starting price in Italy of around 206,000 euros ($244,000) - just above the standard Portofino.
After a record five new models last year - including the SF90 Stradale, Ferrari's first hybrid car in series production - the Portofino M is the seventh in a pipeline of 15 models promised in Ferrari's 2018-2022 plan.
""We're planning another launch before the end of the year and the remaining (seven) in the next two years. Despite some delays that occurred to our product development because of the closing down of the factories we're maintaining the plan as originally presented,"" Galliera said. 
The carmaker, controlled by Exor (MI:EXOR), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, has also pledged that 60% of its cars sold by 2022 would be hybrid.
A full-electric model, however, is not expected until after 2025, as the battery technology requires more development and the group needs to prepare customers more used to roaring engines than a quiet drive.

The House last moved on coronavirus relief in May -- passing the $3.4 trillion Heroes Act that died in the Senate -- and members of the moderate New Democrat Coalition have privately pushed for a vote on a bill reflecting a $2.2 trillion offer Pelosi has made to the White House.
“What we want is to put something on the floor that will become law,” Pelosi said on MSNBC Wednesday. She said some members want her to agree to a re-vote on the Heroes Act to stand firm, something she also rejected.
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday that President Donald Trump wants to get a stimulus deal and it is Pelosi who has been “fundamentally unserious.”
Centrists in the Problem Solvers Caucus, which includes 25 Democrats, on Tuesday backed a $1.5 trillion compromise plan that would automatically rise to $2 trillion if the pandemic persists. Pelosi also rebuffed this idea.
“We did come down,” she said of her willingness to compromise. “We can only go so far.”
The speaker downplayed the divisions in her caucus, which have erupted on a series of conference calls in recent days, saying she is used to building consensus in a diverse group of Democrats.
Pelosi said the White House is only interested in approving $1,200 stimulus checks to go out with Trump’s name on it ahead of the election, but that ignores a range of needs of the American people including food and housing needs.
“It isn’t about finger pointing and it isn’t about machinations. It is about meeting the needs of the American people,” she said. “”Right now we need to do more that have Republicans check a box”

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>","Exclusive: GM to manufacture own 'family' of EV drive systems, motors","By Norihiko Shirouzu
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) is set to announce plans on Wednesday to put into production an interchangeable ""family"" of electric vehicle (EV) drive systems and motors, boosting manufacturing efficiencies as it transitions to a fully electric lineup.
The move, which follows earlier GM initiatives on next-generation batteries, comes as the Detroit automaker looks to build a vertically integrated electric car business, comparable to Tesla (O:TSLA), inside its ongoing operations. 
According to a GM media release viewed by Reuters, the automaker is set to announce that it has designed and plans to produce on its own five interchangeable drive units and three motors, which it calls the ""Ultium Drive"" system. 
GM said its new electric drive systems, sometimes referred to as e-axles in the industry, will have a versatile enough power output to allow them to be used with vehicles ranging from beefy pickup trucks to performance vehicles. 
GM already has some EV partnerships, such as with truck startup  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA), but has chosen here to design its own e-drive technology, rather than buy from suppliers that might be able to offer greater scale and lower cost.
Adam Kwiatkowski, GM's executive chief engineer for global electrical propulsion, said that by designing its own e-axles, GM could better integrate them with an EV's battery and the rest of the car. E-axles combine gear, motor and power electronics into a single system and help convert the electricity from batteries efficiently to propel the vehicle.
GM ""designed these drive units simultaneously with a full gambit of electric vehicles that fill out our portfolio,"" Kwiatkowski told Reuters in an interview last week.
""They become synergistic and make them a really efficient package that's good for the performance of the vehicle, good for driving customer enthusiasm, and most importantly it's good for cost efficiency,"" he said.
The new self-designed technology means ""more of the battery energy now goes to the road"", which helps make GM's EVs more economical, Kwiatkowski said.
That in turn meant GM could give its EVs greater driving range, or vehicles could have less batteries, he added.
Other benefits include size, leading to a smaller drive train and more room for passengers, and also a more spontaneous motor response, Kwiatkowski said.
""There is very very little, totally imperceptible motor lag, so as soon as you touch the accelerator pedal the vehicle responds in a very smooth fashion.""
The new technology highlights GM's effort to transform itself and catch up with Tesla, whose share price has jumped over 400% this year as it has reported improved profitability.
GM will still consider purchasing drive units and components from suppliers in some cases, said Detroit-based company spokesman, Phil Lienert.
However, it will continue to lead the design, development and manufacturing of Ultium Drive units, he said.

(Reuters) - Shares of Eastman Kodak Co (N:KODK) surged more than 40% on Wednesday after an independent review cleared its chief executive of insider trading in relation to a $765 million U.S. government loan to produce pharmaceutical ingredients.
The review by Washington-based law firm Akin Gump, published on Tuesday, found securities transactions made by Chief Executive Jim Continenza around the time of the loan did not violate internal policies, but found certain ""gaps"" in Kodak's insider trading processes.
If premarket gains hold, it will mark Kodak's best day since late-July, when news of the deal catapulted the stock to $30 a share from $2 in just three sessions, partly due to retail investors on the Robinhood trading app piling into the shares.
Kodak, once an industry leader in cameras and the imaging business but long in decline as a global name, has since lost about 80% of its market capitalization as the transaction came under scrutiny from the federal government. 
The White House said last month the loan would not proceed unless the company is cleared of the alleged wrongdoing.
""Whether the U.S. government accepts this analysis and restores its business relationship with the company remains an open question,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey
""For now, investors seem to feel it is worth speculating on given how high the stock rose on the initial news of the loan.""

Short interest in the company - reflecting bets that its stock would decline after hitting the highs in July - had jumped to about 22% as of Aug. 31, according to Refinitiv data, from nearly 4% on July 16.

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Walmart Inc-controlled (N:WMT) Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart is preparing for an initial public offering overseas as early as 2021, which could value the firm up to $50 billion, sources familiar with the company's plans told Reuters.
Bengaluru-based Flipkart, which vies with players such as Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) local unit in India and India's  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI), will be aiming for a valuation in the $45-$50 billion range, according to one source with knowledge of the matter.
If achieved, that would mean Walmart would have more than doubled its investment.
Flipkart is likely to choose between Singapore, or the United States for the initial public offering (IPO), said two other sources, who asked not to be named as discussions are private.
""Flipkart is incorporated in Singapore, but listing in the United States, where parent Walmart is headquartered, could give it access to a deeper pool of funds,"" one of the sources said.
Flipkart and Walmart did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
The sources said the preparations and discussions have been largely internal for now, but the company is preparing to tap external advisers on the process soon.
The discussions come as India drafts new regulations that could pave the way for domestic companies to directly list overseas.
Two other sources familiar with the plans said that work has begun to ensure compliance, legal and finance functions will meet regulatory standards ahead of a potential listing. 
""Right now, the IPO target is more or less considered to be late 2021, or early 2022, but the current crisis has made things a little blurry,"" said one of these two sources.
The second person added that being ""IPO ready"" has become a constant refrain in top level meetings internally.
BUMPER VALUATION EYED
Walmart acquired a roughly 77% stake in Flipkart for about $16 billion back in 2018. That deal remains the single largest foreign direct investment in India.
It turned Flipkart's founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal into billionaires, and confirmed Flipkart's status as the country's most successful start-up at the time.
Later that year, Bentonville, Arkansas-headquartered Walmart in a regulatory filing said it could take Flipkart public in four years.
In July this year, Flipkart raised $1.2 billion in fresh funding with Walmart as its lead investor. That round valued Flipkart, which counts China's Tencent (HK:0700), U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global, and Microsoft (O:MSFT) among its investors, at $24.9 billion.
Flipkart said it would use the funds, to be received in two tranches this fiscal year, to support the development of its e-commerce marketplace as India emerges from the COVID-19 crisis.
Like its rival Amazon, Flipkart began by selling books, but diversified rapidly into sell selling smartphones, clothing and other items. It now competes with Amazon in most categories.
India's e-commerce sector is expected to be worth $99 billion by 2024, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), as more Indians switch to online shopping.
That expanding market has attracted not only global giants such as Walmart and Amazon, but also India's oil-to-telecoms conglomerate Reliance, which has jumped into the fray.

Mumbai-based Reliance this year launched an online grocery service, JioMart, with its billionaire boss Mukesh Ambani telling shareholders in July that deliveries will expand into electronics and fashion products.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia looked set to press on with the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project despite mounting Western opposition after data on Wednesday showed a Russian ship had sailed for the project's supply base in Germany. 
Russia's plans for a second Nord Stream pipeline across the Baltic Sea have faced opposition from the European Union and others, especially since Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
Last month's alleged poisoning of Alexei Navalny, a prominent Kremlin critic, has added to calls from Western politicians to block the project.
The Ivan Sidorenko departed St Petersburg for the German port of Mukran, where pipes for Nord Stream 2 are stored, ship tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon showed. 
It will supply pipes to allow another Russian ship, the Akademik Cherskiy, to finish laying the pipeline, the Kommersant newspaper reported, without citing its sources.
The Akademik Cherskiy is currently moored in Mukran, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
Nord Stream 2 project leader Gazprom (MM:GAZP) did not reply to a request for comment.
European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said regarding Navalny that Russia was systematically seeking to eliminate pro-democracy opponents. 
It was wrong to think that Nord Stream 2 would help to improve tense EU-Russia ties, she said. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in response that the project should not be linked to the Navalny case.
""This is a commercial project that is absolutely in line with the interests of both Russia and European Union countries, and primarily Germany,"" he said.
Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is chairman of Nord Stream's shareholders committee and German firms and others have teamed with Gazprom on the project.
Opponents to it include Poland as it will increase the EU's reliance on Russia energy while undermining Ukraine as a transit state for Russian gas exports to Europe.
Nord Stream 2 is designed to export 55 billion cubic metres of Russian gas annually, or around a third of planned Gazprom's overseas gas supplies for this year.
It was halted in December as pipe-laying company Swiss-Dutch Allseas suspended operations due to U.S. sanctions targeting companies providing vessels laying the pipes.

The U.S. airline had previously estimated daily cash burn of $20 million for the current quarter.
The airline maintained its capacity cut outlook of between 30% and 35% for the third quarter, year-over-year. It plans to reduce its November 2020 flight schedule as well.

The airline had cash and short-term investments of about $14.8 billion as of Sept. 15.
Earlier this week, bigger rival Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said it intends to raise $6.5 billion through new bonds and loans, backed by its SkyMiles loyalty program, in efforts to bolster its cash position.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's chief executive laid out ambitious goals on Wednesday to ensure that the bloc is more resilient and united to confront futures crises after the coronavirus pandemic, which has plunged Europe into its deepest recession in history.
In her annual State of the Union address, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen doubled down on the flagship goals she set out on taking office last December: urgent action to combat climate change and a digital revolution.
""This is the moment for Europe,"" von der Leyen told the European Parliament in a wide-ranging speech that ran for around 80 minutes. ""The moment for Europe to lead the way from this fragility to a new vitality.""
Von der Leyen, who wants Europe to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by mid-century, unveiled a plan to cut the EU's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, up from an existing target of 40%. She also pledged to use green bonds to finance those climate goals.
""There is no more urgent need for acceleration than when it comes to the future of our fragile planet,"" she said. ""While much of the world's activity froze during lockdowns and shutdowns, the planet continued to get dangerously hotter.""
She acknowledged her proposals would divide member states because the goals will require huge investments in transport, heavy industry and energy, and businesses will also face higher carbon costs under a plan to revamp the EU's carbon market. 
The former German cabinet minister also called for greater investment in technology for Europe to compete more keenly with China and the United States, and said the EU would invest 20% of a 750 billion euro economic recovery fund in digital projects.
""FEAR AND DIVISION""
Officials said that, far from backing off the plans she laid out at the beginning of her term because of the coronavirus pandemic, von der Leyen believes they remain key to Europe's long-term economic and political survival. 
The EU has been buffeted for years by crises, from the financial meltdown of 2008 to feuds over migration and the protracted saga of Britain's exit from the bloc.
Solidarity among the 27 member states frayed badly at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when countries refused to share protective medical kit with those worst-affected and closed borders without consultation to prevent the spread of the virus.
The bloc's leaders also jousted for months over a joint plan to rescue their coronavirus-throttled economies.
But in July they agreed on a stimulus plan that paved the way for the European Commission to raise billions of euros on capital markets on behalf of them all, an unprecedented act of solidarity in almost seven decades of European integration.
""In the last months we have rediscovered the value of what we hold in common,"" Von der Leyen said. ""We turned fear and division between member states into confidence in our union.""
""BE COURAGEOUS""
Turning to the troubled talks with London on the future relationship between the world's fifth-largest economy and biggest trading bloc, von der Leyen said every passing day reduces chances for sealing a new trade deal.
She stressed that the EU and Britain negotiated and ratified their Brexit divorce deal and warned London the agreement ""cannot be unilaterally changed, disregarded or dis-applied"".
Brexit talks were plunged into a new crisis this month after Prime Minister Boris Johnson put forward a new Internal Market Bill that would undercut Britain's Withdrawal Agreement.
That increased the risk of the most damaging, no-deal economic split precipitating at the end of the year.
Chiding EU countries for an ineffective foreign policy, von der Leyen said the bloc must get better at responding to events unfolding around the world.
Once able to boast of a soft power that helped transform communist neighbours into market economies, the EU increasingly finds itself unable to agree common positions on diplomacy because of the need to secure unanimity among member states.

""When member states say Europe is too slow, I say to them 'be courageous and finally move to qualified majority voting',"" she said. ""Be it in Hong Kong, Moscow or Minsk: Europe must take a clear and swift position.""

1455,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Europe Virus Stars Scramble After Declaring Victory Too Fast,"(Bloomberg) -- When more than 2,000 people gathered on Prague’s medieval Charles Bridge in a “farewell party” for Covid-19 in June, it was to celebrate one of Europe’s most effective efforts to halt the virus’s spread.
The Czech government, which had acted faster and more strictly than almost any other in the European Union, lifted rules on social distancing and mandatory masks wearing. Two months later, it’s trying to contain an explosion of new cases that has eclipsed numbers seen earlier this year when the virus raged across Europe.
In an unfortunately growing trend, eastern EU states that acted more decisively than peers like France and Spain are battling a resurgence that took root when restrictions fell. Governments loath to shut down schools and businesses after lockdowns hammered their economies are facing pressure at home, while their neighbors are erecting new limits on travel.
“In June, we all felt like the virus was gone,” Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said Sunday. “Unfortunately, we were wrong.”
With cases rising again worldwide, in the eastern EU, authorities from Slovenia and Croatia to Romania have taken a lax approach toward imposing fines for mask-wearing violations.
In the latter, which reported a new daily record of 1,713 coronavirus cases and 49 new fatalities on Wednesday, students protested against reopening schools and called for the education minister to resign, while several thousand people protested against face coverings in Zagreb earlier this month.
In Hungary, new infections have doubled each week in September to eclipse those seen at the start of the pandemic. Eight people died on Wednesday, matching the highest daily count since May 29.
“Compared with the rest of Europe, the pandemic is raging in Hungary as a proportion of population,” Ferenc Jakab, head of the virology research group at the University of Pecs, said at an online conference Tuesday. “That’s the dark truth.”
Still, Prime Minister Viktor Orban is resisting measures that will shut down parts of the economy after the country suffered one of the worst downturns in the region. His Romanian counterpart, Ludovic Orban (who’s not related), also announced it was up to citizens to stay safe.
“I don’t think new restrictions should be imposed,” the Romanian leader said. “Quite the contrary, we need a permanent dialogue and to help people understand that they’re the ones that have to protect themselves.”
Babis also rejects shutting down the economy again, even after the Czechs’ former federation partners, Slovakia, put it on its red list for accepting travelers.
The Czech premier overrode government epidemiologists’ recommendations last month for mandatory mask wearing in public. He also attacked the World Health Organization after it expressed concern over the worsening situation and criticized his government for considering cutting down on tracing cases.
Along with other leaders who just weeks ago declared the virus defeated, he has since ordered people to wear masks and be more vigilant.
“I want to ask all of you, please, to persuade those, who aren’t wearing them, to start wearing them,” he said Sunday. “We’re in the same boat. We have to get through this together.”

1456,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Steel Price Hikes Signal More Supply Squeeze than Demand Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S.Steel Corp (NYSE:X) kicked off another round of price hikes this week for benchmark steel products, though industry observers don’t see the gain as signaling a post-pandemic rebound in demand.
The second-largest U.S. producer raised prices on new orders of flat-rolled products by a minimum of $60 a ton, according to a letter sent to customers and seen by Bloomberg. Supplies remain tight, mostly because steel-plant usage has been running near multi-year lows as Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns sapped demand for areas including construction, automobiles and appliances.
“There’s a lot of capacity off the market that’s being restricted that will ultimately come online,” Phil Gibbs, an equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a phone interview. “Demand is improving for sure at the margin, but this is really a supply-side squeeze and those tend to be short-lived.”
U.S. steel plant usage is running at about 65% capacity, down from about 80% a year ago, and was near half capacity at the peak of lockdowns in the spring. Researcher CRU estimated last month at one of the industry’s largest conferences in North America that consumption of U.S. steel sheet -- the benchmark product -- will drop 18% in 2020 and is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels until some time in 2022 to 2023.
U.S. Steel raised its steel sheet prices by at least $40 a ton in July, following a similar increase in May. The producer said the second quarter was the trough, and Chief Executive Officer David Burritt said he’s confident that the worst of 2020 is behind them, though uncertainty will remain through 2021.
“I think they got away with the last few price hikes and now it appears to me it’s just getting too aggressive; arguably unwarranted,” Keybanc’s Gibbs said.

The deal marks the second acquisition this year by Berlin-based sennder, a digital freight forwarder founded in 2015 that specialises in full-truck loads, as it seeks to extend its lead in Europe.
""This acquisition strengthens our position as Europe's number one digital logistics provider,"" said David Nothacker, CEO and co-founder of sennder.
For Uber, which only entered the German freight market in July 2019, the deal will extend its reach in Europe while the alliance with sennder would extend to offering advanced freight logistics services in the United States and Canada.
sennder is one of a number of logistics-focused startups in the bustling Berlin tech scene that has sought to modernise an industry dominated by family-owned trucking firms still used to working with a phone, pen and paper.
Its founders see huge potential to boost efficiency in the full-load market - where sennder matches 50,000 cargoes a month - by reducing the number of trips in which trucks make a return journey empty.
Investors Accel, Lakestar, HV Ventures, Project A and Scania have invested 120 million euros ($143 million) into sennder, which earlier this year merged with France's Everoad as it targeted 1 billion euros in revenue by 2024.

Terms for the deal were not disclosed. ($1 = 0.8419 euros)

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Color blind? How boardroom diversity data eludes advocates,"By Ross Kerber, Jessica DiNapoli and Simon Jessop
BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Last month CtW Investment Group urged Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE:FMS) AG to add diverse directors to its board. The group determined the German company lacked diversity by studying photos of directors and reviewing their backgrounds online to determine their race.
""It’s a very crude way,"" Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of labor-affiliated CtW, acknowledged in an interview with Reuters. He added that without formal declarations by the directors themselves, outsiders could not be certain of their race.
Fresenius said its six-member board includes directors of five different nationalities and two women. But a spokesman noted that the company does ""not ask our board members, nor our employees, to make statements on their ethnic or racial origins.""
Racial diversity in the boardroom has come under new scrutiny after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in police custody in May triggered global protests about racism in Western societies. 
But as investors, executives and politicians demand greater racial and ethnic diversity in Western corporate boardrooms, they say they are running into a thorny problem: how to tell the ethnicity of directors in the absence of much self-reporting and disclosure. 
The lack of data, they said, is slowing progress on efforts to improve diversity in the top echelons of global corporations. Their attempts to increase disclosure so far have run into hurdles, such as concerns the practice is divisive or that some directors don’t want to list their family backgrounds.
""We would like to see the makeup of all directors,"" said Benjamin Colton, co-head of stewardship efforts at  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT), which has $3.1 trillion under management. ""We understand there may be directors who don't want to self-identify, and in those cases we might engage on that a little more.""
Sandy Boss, stewardship chief at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), said the world’s largest asset manager is reviewing its current policy on diversity for its portfolio companies. The policy currently says companies should have at least two women directors but does not give specific guidance on racial representation. 
She acknowledged the lack of disclosure of executives' ethnicity could make it hard to push for change. ""Data is quite important here,"" Boss said.
LOW REPRESENTATION 
The lack of boardroom diversity is stark. Among the top 200 companies in the S&P 500, African-Americans hold only about 10% of board seats and Hispanic or Latino people hold only 4% of board seats, according to executive search firm Spencer Stuart. That representation falls below their shares of the U.S. population of 13% and 19%, respectively.

Factors including insular social and professional networks have kept boardrooms largely white for years. Some business leaders also blame a relative lack of minority CEOs, a traditional resume item for directors, leading to calls for companies to recruit candidates with other backgrounds.
Women are also underrepresented on boards, but they have made faster gains in recent years. https://rb.gy/fqppdw
Analysts say one reason is that top investors, including BlackRock and State Street, have prioritized gender diversity, which is easier to determine by name.
The concern about underrepresentation of minority groups is leading to new data-gathering efforts and legislation. A number of U.S. companies have started to include racial identification tables in their annual proxy statements in recent years, for example. Some states, such as Illinois and California, are also mandating steps to improve corporate diversity.
In addition researchers Institutional Shareholder Services and Equilar have each launched new efforts to gather more diversity data, both drawing on information from groups including the Latino Corporate Directors Association.
Esther Aguilera, the president of the association, said her group has been calling and emailing current and potential directors to ask if they would like to be included in its database. ""If the individuals were to self-identify in a table somewhere, then we wouldn't have to go through this song and dance,"" Aguilera said.
These efforts, however, are fledgling and the data are patchy. Researcher Just Capital says 21% of 931 companies in the Russell 1000 index now offer at least some information about their boards’ racial diversity. But often it is not very specific, and the range of disclosures is wide. 
Some give only a general percentage. Medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX), for example, said in its proxy this year that its 10-member board is 70% white and 30% ""ethnically diverse.""
Boston Scientific General Counsel Desiree Ralls-Morrison said in an e-mail that as investors grew more interested in boardroom diversity, the company started making the disclosure in 2018 ""as part of a broader effort to make key governance insights more accessible.""
Others go further and specify the race and gender of each director. Utility holding company Edison International (NYSE:EIX), for example, has a table in its latest proxy filing that shows one director as African-American and two others are Hispanic. Michael Camuñez, one of the two Hispanic directors, is also identified as part of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community.
In an interview, Camuñez said he suggested the identification in early 2018 and was met with enthusiasm. ""I do identify as Latino and as an openly gay man, and the days when that had to be a source of concern or fear are long behind us. I felt it was important to stand up and be counted,"" he said.
Donna James, an African-American woman who is a director at Boston Scientific Corp and L Brands Inc (NYSE:LB), said the extra detail would help broaden diversity efforts beyond adding more women to boards.
""Gender diversity is a good first step, but we can't stop there,"" said James. She declined to discuss actions by specific boards.
More corporate disclosures are likely, according to Spencer Stuart managing partner Julie Daum, but some directors might not want certain characterizations publicly listed, or might recall how such information was once used to exclude minorities. 
""It's one of those touchy issues,"" she said. Spencer Stuart estimates directors' race by checking sources like proxies and the affinity groups a person lists in their biographies or LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) pages.
FORCING QUOTAS?
Recently, California legislators passed a bill mandating boards have one director from an underrepresented community by the end of next year, and requires the state to publish a report on companies' compliance. But the bill faced opposition from some lawmakers who argue it is overreach by the government.
""Rather than using the heavy hand of government to force quotas, Senator Brian Jones believes consumers in the marketplace and shareholders in the boardroom are a better approach,"" said a spokesman for Jones, a Republican from Santee, California, near San Diego.
Mary Winston, an African-American woman, member of the National Association of Corporate Directors and director at companies including Bed Bath & Beyond Inc, said the law is needed to force companies to act.

""If there are no metrics, it's hard to hold people accountable,"" she said.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>","U.S. House report blasts failures of Boeing, FAA in 737 MAX certification","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An 18-month investigation by a U.S. House panel blasted  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and the Federal Aviation Administration over the 737 MAX which has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people.
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's Democratic majority found numerous missteps in a nearly 250-page final report released Wednesday into the troubled plane's development.
""Boeing failed in its design and development of the MAX, and the FAA failed in its oversight of Boeing and its certification of the aircraft,"" the report says, detailing a litany of problems in the plane's design and the government's approval of the plane.
The review found the crashes ""were not the result of a singular failure, technical mistake, or mismanaged event.""
""They were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing’s engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing’s management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA — the pernicious result of regulatory capture on the part of the FAA.""
Boeing said in a statement it ""learned many hard lessons as a company from the accidents... and from the mistakes we have made. As this report recognizes, we have made fundamental changes to our company as a result, and continue to look for ways to improve.""
FAA said in a statement it will work with lawmakers ""to implement improvements identified in its report."" It added it is ""focused on advancing overall aviation safety by improving our organization, processes, and culture.""
The report said Boeing made ""faulty design and performance assumptions"" especially surrounding a key safety system, called MCAS, which was linked to both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes.
MCAS, which was designed to help counter a tendency of the MAX to pitch up, could activate after data from only a single sensor.
The report criticized Boeing for withholding ""crucial information from the FAA, its customers, and 737 MAX pilots"" including ""concealing the very existence of MCASfrom 737 MAX pilots.""
FAA is requiring a number of new safeguards to MCAS, including requiring it receive data from two sensors, before it allows the MAX to return to service. 
The report cited instances where Boeing employees granted permission to represent interests of the FAA ""failed to disclose important information to the FAA that could have enhanced the safety of the 737 MAX.""
Boeing did not disclose the existence of MCAS in crew manuals and sought to convince regulators not to require more expensive simulator training for MAX pilots. In January, Boeing agreed to back simulator training before pilots resume flights. 
The report said the FAA ""failed to ensure the safety of the traveling public.""
Lawmakers have proposed numerous reforms to restructure how the FAA oversees airplane certification. A Senate committee will take up a reform bill Wednesday.
Lawmakers suggested Boeing was motivated to cut costs and move quickly to get the 737 MAX to market.

""This is a tragedy that never should have happened,"" House Transportation Committee chairman Peter DeFazio told reporters. ""We're going to take steps in our legislation to see that it never happens again as we reform the system.""

1461,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 05:39AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Inditex, H&M Put Fashion Back in Fashion","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Fashion is back in fashion.
Europe’s two largest fast-fashion names, Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and H & M  Hennes & Mauritz  (ST:HMb), have both returned to profitability after a chaotic six months that has seen two successive seasons of new catalogues disrupted by Covid-19 and its associated lockdowns.
After rising some 15% over the last 30 hours, both stocks are now trading at their highest levels since early June.
As with so many other sectors, Covid-19 sharpened the need for both Inditex and H&M to improve their online distribution, given the closure of their physical stores. Both have, eventually, risen to the challenge, with Inditex’s online sales rising 74% in the six months through July. H&M didn’t break out its online sales numbers in preliminary numbers for the three months through August, but they rose at a 40% clip in the first half, from a higher base.
The pandemic has also been a severe test of the two companies’ ability to manage inventory. Zara attributed its online performance to the success of its ‘single inventory platform’ and noted that unsold stock levels had actually fallen 19% from a year earlier.  “The closing inventory is considered to be of high quality,” it added. 
H&M’s inventories won’t be known until it releases its full results in another couple of weeks, but it had warned at the six-month mark in June that it expected inventory levels to rise again. However, it seems that the company managed to outdo its own expectations handily, with a pretax profit of some 2 billion Swedish kronor and a reference to “higher-than-expected full-price sales” in the quarter.
Both companies boasted of their stringent cost control, a phrase that tallies with reports of drastic and sudden stops of orders to suppliers in emerging markets earlier in the year. In addition, H&M in particular has been able to use the pandemic as a way of accelerating an overdue program of store closures after an ill-judged expansion over recent years.
Inditex chairman Pablo Isla told an analyst call on Wednesday that he’s confident Inditex has turned a corner. His optimism – and H&M’s numbers – have pepped up other fashion stocks in sympathy:  Next  (LON:NXT), ASOS (LON:ASOS), boohoo.com (LON:BOOH) and Zalando (DE:ZALG) are all up by more than 5% over the last two days.
The more interesting question is: if apparel retailing, a central pillar of discretionary consumer spending and a bellwether of ‘animal spirits’ in the economy, is back on the up, will there be a broader read-across for consumer-focused stocks in Europe? The Stoxx 600 has traded sideways in a ‘summer box’ for the last three months. If – if – the current rise in Covid-19 numbers can be contained, then the spring in fashion’s step could be a herald of better times all round."

(Reuters) - A fourth day of gains in retail stocks nudged European equities higher on Wednesday as Zara-owner  Inditex  posted a quarterly profit, although UK blue-chip stocks came under pressure after a surge in the previous session.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) inched 0.3% higher, extending a winning run this week.
Inditex (MC:ITX) said current trade showed a progressive return to normality with online sales growing sharply and store sales recovering, pushing its shares 6.3% higher. The retail sector (SXRP) was up 1.1%.
London's blue-chip shares (FTSE) were dragged lower by a weakness in the banking sector. A bright spot in the market was a 26.4% surge in shares of the Hut Group (L:THG), the first major British initial public offering in seven years.
Signs of compromise emerged on the Brexit front, with Reuters reporting that Britain offered tentative concessions on fisheries in trade talks with the European Union last week, just as London was threatening to breach the terms of its divorce deal with the bloc.
""The only catalyst that I can see for European equities is Brexit that could push markets one way or the other,"" said Julien Lafargue, head of equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Private Bank.
""Europe, in our mind, is a trading market. You want to buy Europe when everybody hates it, you want to sell it when everybody loves it. At this stage, we're at a neutral.""
After a bounce from March lows, the STOXX 600 has been stuck in a range even as Wall Street has hit record highs as investors fret about a resurgence in coronavirus cases and its impact on a nascent economic recovery.
Markets globally appeared to be in a holding pattern ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy announcement, which is due at 1800 GMT.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways is having to take every measure possible to make it through the winter because a fear of flying during the pandemic has destroyed any hope of a rapid return to normality, its boss said on Wednesday.
BA CEO Alex Cruz told a parliamentary select committee that the airline was running at 25 to 30% of its normal flight schedule, prompting it to cut thousands of jobs because ""fewer flights means fewer people required to actually service them"". 
""This is the worst crisis that British Airways has gone through in its 100 years of history,"" he said. ""We're still fighting for our own survival.
""We are taking every measure possible to make sure we can actually make it through this winter. We do not see a short-term coming back of our passengers. All the feedback we get ... is still pointing at a slow recovery process."" 
Britain's leading airline has been heavily criticised by politicians and unions for laying off 13,000 staff and renegotiating the contracts of many of its remaining employees. 
It says it has no choice, because it is burning through 20 million pounds a day and straining the finances of parent company IAG (L:ICAG) which is in the process of raising 2.74 billion euros from shareholders.
Cruz has cut his own pay by around a third. UK-based airlines have benefited from government employment retention schemes and loans, but have not had the kind of industry-specific support deployed in France and Germany to bail out Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).
Cruz said a return to flying had been hampered by the weekly changes to quarantine rules and the lack of a testing system at airports. A two-stage testing system, where passengers are tested on arrival and five days later could remove the need for 14-day quarantines, he said. 

""We remain worried with regards to the evolution of the rest of the winter season. People are still afraid of travelling and we are having weekly changes to the quarantine list, we don't have a testing solution yet.

Hitachi last year froze the 3 trillion yen ($28 billion) project on the island of Anglesey, in north Wales, and booked a writedown of 300 billion yen on its British nuclear unit as the project failed to find private investors.
Sources at the time said Hitachi had called on the British government to boost financial support for the project.
The project was expected to provide around 6% of Britain's electricity.
Hitachi said it would coordinate with the British government and relevant organisations regarding the handling of the planned construction sites and other matters.

The decision was not expected to have significant impact on Hitachi's business results as the company has already written down most of the related assets, the company said.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged mostly higher Wednesday, helped by strong results from Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), with investors cautiously awaiting the Federal Reserve for guidance on the economy.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.3%.
Equity markets have mostly regained their pose after last week’s turmoil, mainly surrounding the tech sector, helped by upbeat economic data from China and the U.S., the two largest economies in the world. 
Recent news out of Europe has also been encouraging, with Germany’s ZEW sentiment index – the first of the big gauges of sentiment to be released this month – defying expectations for a fall.
Staying on theme, consumer prices in the U.K. rose by 0.2% in annual terms in August, the smallest increase since December 2015, data showed Wednesday. However, this was still a touch better than expected as a subsidy scheme to support the hospitality sector helped to push the inflation rate down.
Investors are looking to central banks for direction, and in particular the U.S. Federal Reserve which concludes a two-day policy meeting later Wednesday, the first since adopting a more tolerant stance on inflation in August.
The Fed is due to announce its decision at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), followed by a news conference from Chairman Jerome Powell.
The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England also announce their respective policy decisions on Thursday.
In corporate news,Inditex (MC:ITX) stock climbed 5.6% after the fashion retailer returned to quarterly profit in the three months from May to July despite sales slumping as consumers stayed away from city centre shopping districts.
This follows Swedish rival H&M (ST:HMb) beating quarterly profit forecasts on Tuesday, and could represent a rebound for the battered retail sector. H&M stock rose another 4.4% on Wednesday.
Oil prices rose after the American Petroleum Institute detailed a big drop in U.S. stockpiles and Hurricane Sally continued to disrupt offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico.

MADRID (Reuters) - The owner of fashion retailer Zara,  Inditex  (MC:ITX), returned to quarterly profit in the three months from May to July despite a 31% fall in sales as the coronavirus crisis kept consumers away from city centre shopping districts.
Inditex, which also owns the Massimo Dutti and Bershka brands, said 98% of its stores had reopened and that current trade showed a progressive return to normality with online sales growing sharply and store sales recovering.
In the current quarter, sales in store and online from Aug. 1 to Sept. 6 at constant exchange rates were on an improving trend, though still down 11% from a year earlier.
Inditex shares rose 5% on Wednesday morning, adding to gains booked on Tuesday after Swedish rival H&M (ST:HMb) beat quarterly profit forecasts. 
Shoppers have started to buy fashion again since stores reopened following shutdowns. JP Morgan estimates continental Europe fashion sales were down 15% in July on average compared to May's 42% drop.
Inditex reported a second-quarter net profit of 214 million euros ($253 million), beating the 96 million euro mean forecast from Refinitiv's SmartEstimate model, which is weighted towards more recent estimates and higher-ranked analysts. 
It saw a 74% jump in online sales in the first half, a trend seen at apparel retailers worldwide, as shoppers bought from home with many stores closed and movement restrictions in place. 
In a sign of how apparel spending has switched to more comfortable styles with many working from home and parties cancelled, Zara's app showed autumn looks with wide trousers and flat shoes on models climbing fences and riding bikes.
For the first half, it reported a net loss of 195 million euros on sales down 37%. 

It said it would have reported a profit had it not booked a 308 million euro charge related to its integration of its store and online platforms.

1469,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 03:41AM ET</span>",Oil Extends Gains With Weaker Dollar And Declining Stockpiles,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil extended gains to trade near $39 a barrel in New York, buoyed by a weaker dollar and a surprise drop in U.S. crude stockpiles.
Futures advanced 2.3% after the dollar slipped for a fourth session, making commodities priced in the currency more appealing. The American Petroleum Institute reported crude stockpiles declined by 9.52 million barrels last week, according to people familiar. Government data Wednesday is forecast to show inventories climbed for a second week.
The IEA, however, warned on Tuesday that the outlook for global oil markets is “even more fragile” due to a resurgence of the virus. That followed similarly bearish calls this week from BP (NYSE:BP) Plc, Trafigura Group and OPEC.
Oil’s rally from an April rout has stalled this month, with rising infections raising doubts about a sustained recovery in consumption, while supply has increased. An OPEC+ committee meets on Thursday to discuss if the group’s production curbs are enough to prevent a glut, with Trafigura this week predicting a surplus will return as demand stagnates.
“If the API forecast proves to be accurate and we see an additional decline in crude inventories, that should further aid the cause of oil bulls,” said Howie Lee, economist at Oversea Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. The market will also be watching the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday to gauge the extent of central bank support for the economy, he said.
OPEC and its allies may have to address the issue of compliance again at its gathering. The United Arab Emirates almost entirely disregarded its commitment to production quotas last month when it opened the taps even further, the IEA said in a report Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Vitol Group offered a starkly more bullish outlook than some of its rivals, saying oil inventories have been falling sharply and will continue to decline. Global stockpiles should drop by a further 250 million to 300 million barrels in the last four months of the year, Chief Executive Officer Russell Hardy said in an interview.

The once high-flying company, which owns Hainan Airlines (SS:600221), is in the midst of a restructuring led by the Hainan government to resolve its liquidity risks stemming from years of aggressive acquisitions abroad. 
The group and its affiliates have delayed payments on a few bond products this year.
HNA chairman and legal representative Chen Feng has also been barred from spending at star-rated hotels, nightclubs and golf clubs, and buying properties and high-premium insurance products, an order from the People's Court in Xi'an city's Beilin district showed on Tuesday. The order also disallows his children from attending private schools. 
The conglomerate declined to comment on the order.
While such court-ordered bans in China are indefinite, there are precedents where bans have been lifted after the defendants paid. 
The Xi'an court had ruled in March that HNA Group, along with its three affiliated companies, needed to return money they owe to a plaintiff named Chai Jin in a dispute involving HNA's high-interest online investment platform Jubaohui. 
The companies were told to pay Chai more than 36,000 yuan ($5,320) of principal and interest within 10 days of the March ruling, according to the court. But they failed to do so, the court order on Tuesday said.
It was not immediately clear if HNA subsequently paid the sum to Chai.
HNA has not been able to fully pay back its Jubaohui investors since early 2018 as its liquidity worsened even as it began a frenetic sales of assets. There's still some 37.1 million yuan of overdue and unpaid debts at the end of August, according to data released on Jubaohui's official website.
To make matters worse, the coronavirus pandemic this year, which had devastated travel demand and hurt HNA's main aviation business, led many to believe that HNA's survival was at stake. However, a move for a government-led restructuring of HNA following a plea by the conglomerate in February rekindled hopes that a solution for its debt problem may be on the horizon.

The announcement marks a continuation of Alibaba's expansion beyond its core business of e-commerce and into sectors on other parts of the online retail supply chain.
In a statement, Alibaba said the factory, run by an internal division called Xunxi Digital Technology Company, at present will primarily work with apparel companies.
The company in an explanatory video said it will use data it garners from e-commerce traffic, searches and sales to help brands anticipate what items will be popular and bring them to market quickly.
In 2016, Alibaba founder Jack Ma identified ""new manufacturing"" as one of five trends he referred to as future business opportunities for Alibaba.
The others were ""new retail,"" ""new technology,"" ""new finance"" and ""new energy"".
The move into manufacturing comes as China's e-commerce players look for ways to work more closely with the country's legions of factories.
Rival  Pinduoduo  Inc (O:PDD) rose to prominence in China's online retail sector by enticing manufacturers to sell directly to consumers. 
Alibaba's opening of the factory also marks another move into the offline realm for the e-commerce giant.

In 2016 the company opened its first Freshippo store, marking its foray into offline grocery retail. The chain now has hundreds of outlets across China.

Allegro is expected to achieve an equity value of about $13 billion, according to a person familiar with the transaction, with about 20%-25% of the company to be floated. For Trigon Dom Maklerski SA analyst Maciej Marcinowski, that should be enough to meet the Warsaw bourse’s criteria for an extraordinary revision of the WIG20 benchmark’s membership, clearing the way for Allegro to displace MBank SA.
Such a revamp, with an expected 6% weighting for Allegro, has the potential to boost the gauge’s performance in the long term, by reducing the still-dominant share of stagnant banking and utility stocks, according to Marcinowski and  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors Poland TFI SA’s head of equity investment Rafal Janczyk.
In recent years, near-zero interest rates and FX-mortgage lawsuits have held back the country’s banking industry. Meanwhile, the hands-on government’s reforms, consolidation proposals and rising costs of coal power all hit valuations of state-run companies, rendering the WIG20 an underperformer.
In 2020, the index has lagged peers both in Western Europe and emerging markets, despite Poland’s coronavirus infections remaining among the lowest in the region. Soaring valuations of newer index members -- video game studio CD Projekt SA and grocer Dino Polska SA -- couldn’t offset the gloom.
“Allegro’s IPO is the big thing for Warsaw. It shows that the structure of the market is changing towards the new economy and brings new reasons to invest in the Eastern Europe, even as local investors are not ready to accommodate such high valuations,” Andras Szalkai, a fund manager at Raiffeisen Kapitalanlage GmbH in Vienna, said in a phone interview. “Allegro’s success may also incubate new entrepreneurs, as was seen in the case of CD PROJEKT (WA:CDR) causing a boom in the local gaming industry.”
Poland’s new wave of stock debuts is a positive phenomenon, Barlomiej Chylek, equity analyst at  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) Investment Partners TFI SA, told Bloomberg by phone. Still, he cautioned investors against expecting quick returns in the index given demanding valuations of CD Projekt and Allegro. Any short-term uplift to Poland’s benchmark will also be tempered by local investors dumping other stocks to make room for Allegro in their portfolios, Aviva’s Janczyk said."

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hurricane Sally crawled offshore along the U.S. Gulf Coast on Wednesday, moving away from oil fields while soaking the region with heavy rains that could damp fuel demand in the U.S. southeast. 
The hurricane has shut more than a quarter of U.S. offshore Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production and stirred heavy seas that closed ports from Louisiana to Florida. It moved at a snail's pace toward a Wednesday landfall on the coast between Mississippi and Florida.
While Sally's intensity lessened, it remained a Category 1 hurricane with 85 miles per hour (140 kmh) winds. Oil and chemical ports along the Mississippi River were moving to reopen with restrictions and some offshore operators were preparing to return workers to offshore platforms on Thursday.
OIL PRICES RISE IN ASIA
Nearly 500,000 bpd of offshore crude oil production and 759 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of natural gas output were shut in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, according to the U.S. Interior Department.
Crude oil prices were higher in Asian trading on Wednesday, extending the day-earlier's gains on shut-ins and an industry report forecasting a drop in U.S. crude stockpiles. Oil futures (LCOc1) (CLc1) rose about 1.5% after trading up more than 2% on Tuesday.
The National Hurricane Center warned Sally could drop 10 to 20 inches (25-50 cm) of rain and up to 30 inches in some spots. It warned of life-threatening flash flooding along the coast between Mississippi and the Florida Panhandle. 
Sally's slow crawl will continue after landfall and leave as much as 6 inches of rain through Friday as far inland as Atlanta, said Jim Foerster, chief meteorologist at weather data provider DTN. ""It's going to be a catastrophic flooding event"" for much of the southeastern United States, he said,
Rain will spread across Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina by Friday, forecasters said, cutting into travel and damping fuel demand in the southeast. 
U.S. gasoline stocks rose by 3.8 million barrels last week, according to data released on Tuesday by trade group American Petroleum Institute, above analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a draw of 160,000 barrels.

LONDON (Reuters) - Achieving net zero emissions by mid-century would cost an estimated $1 trillion-$2 trillion a year of additional investments, or 1-1.5% of global gross domestic product, a report by the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) said on Wednesday.
To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century, global greenhouse gas emissions will need to reach net zero.
When this is achieved, the reduction in 2050 living standards in developed and developing countries would amount to less than 0.5% of global GDP, the report said.
The ETC is a global coalition of 40 energy producers, industrial companies and financial institutions, including ArcelorMittal (LU:MT), HSBC [HSBCUK.UL],  BP  (L:BP), Shell (L:RDSa), Orsted (CO:ORSTED) and Bank of America (N:BAC), which are committed to achieving a carbon-free economy by 2050.
The report said dramatic improvements in energy efficiency will need to be made; annual global electricity supply will have to grow four to five times to reach 90,000-115,000 terawatt hours and the annual pace of wind and solar capacity will need to be five to six times the increase achieved in 2019. 
In addition, buildings, transport and industry sectors need to be electrified and hydrogen should be used in cases where that is not possible. Any remaining energy use should be decarbonised using carbon capture and storage and sustainable bioenergy. 
""There is no doubt that it is technically and economically possible to reach the zero-carbon economy which we need by 2050; and zero must mean zero, not a plan which relies on the permanent and large-scale use of 'offsets' to balance continued emissions,"" said co-chair of the ETC, Adair Turner.
""But action in the next decade is crucial – otherwise it will be too late,"" he added.

China has the resources and technology to become a rich, developed carbon-free economy by 2050. All developing nations should be able to reach net-zero emissions by 2060 at the latest but will require development investment to attract private green investors, the ETC said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening a little lower Wednesday, as investors cautiously await the Federal Reserve for guidance on the economy.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.3%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. underperformed, falling 1.1%, overturning Tuesday’s oversized gains.
Equity markets have largely regained their pose after last week’s turmoil, mainly surrounding the tech sector, helped by upbeat economic data from China and the U.S., the two largest economies in the world. Recent news out of Europe has also been encouraging, with Germany’s ZEW sentiment index – the first of the big gauges of sentiment to be released this month – defying expectations for a fall.
Investors are looking to central banks for direction, and in particular the U.S. Federal Reserve which concludes a two-day policy meeting later Wednesday, the first since adopting a more tolerant stance on inflation in August.
The focus of the meeting “will be at the operational consequences of Average Inflation Targeting,” wrote Nordea’s Martin Lund, in a note. “As the Fed needs to show full AIT commitment, we see a clear risk of a hike in the current QE pace.”
The Fed is due to announce its decision at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), followed by a news conference from Chairman Jerome Powell.
The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England also announce their respective policy decisions on Thursday.
Economic data in Europe center Wednesday around U.K. inflation numbers, with the country’s CPI climbing 0.2% on the year in August, a touch better than the 0.1% widely expected.
In corporate news,  ENI  (MI:ENI) will be in focus after the Italian oil-and-gas major said late Tuesday that it has agreed to pay an interim dividend for 2020.
Additionally,  Geberit  (SIX:GEBN) said Wednesday that it is about to start a buyback program of up to 500 million Swiss francs, starting on Thursday and lasting for a maximum of two years.
Oil prices rose Wednesday after the American Petroleum Institute detailed a big drop in U.S. stockpiles and Hurricane Sally continued to disrupt offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico.
The API recorded a 9.5 million-barrel draw for the week ending Sept. 11, against forecasts of a build of 2 million. The U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to release its own data later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $38.87 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.3% to $41.06. Both benchmarks rose by more than 2% during the previous session,

Baer is in what it described as ""advanced"" talks with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) over the FIFA scandal, a holdover from the era of former Chief Executive Boris Collardi, who is now at Pictet, that has kept its lawyers busy for years.
Baer this year was reprimanded by Switzerland's financial supervisor FINMA for ignoring money laundering risks of FIFA-linked payments, while an ex-banker was convicted in 2017 in U.S. District Court of conspiracy charges for arranging payments from a sports marketing executive to the Argentine soccer association's president.

Similar to the Robinhood craze in the U.S., retail investors in the kingdom are piling into small and medium-cap stocks, driving average daily turnover to levels more than double those of a year ago. That’s helped propel a rally in the Tadawul All Share Index, which is poised to be the first benchmark in the Gulf to erase 2020 losses even as the world’s biggest oil exporter grapples with a tumbling oil price.
“We see money chasing good quality companies that were beyond the purview of institutional fund managers,” Joice Mathew, the head of equity research at United Securities in Muscat, said in written comments. “It may not be appropriate to call them Robinhooders of Saudi Arabia, but people are definitely excited about the gains in U.S. markets, and want to mimic it.”
While heavyweight  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) has shared in the market’s rally from a March low, the top gains have been in much smaller names. The Tadawul’s best-performing stocks of 2020 include an information technology provider, an insurer, a fishery firm in the desert kingdom and a media company, all of which have more than doubled since December as investors have latched onto a phenomenon that has boosted stocks from Turkey to South Korea.
While institutional, mutual funds keep buying larger stocks, individuals are “lapping up the mid-cap names,” said Mathew at United Securities.
According to Mazen Al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital, many investors have excess cash that would otherwise have been spent on foreign trips. As inflation climbs and bond yields drop, people are flocking to the stock market in order to protect wealth, Al-Sudairi said.
For the Saudi stock market, the retail buying spree has provided a lift when it was needed in light of the oil price’s crash to $40 a barrel. The average daily turnover for Saudi shares rose to near 12 billion riyals as of Sept. 15, or about 2.5 times the amount of a year ago. The average value of trade is about five times higher than in Sept. 2016, when Brent crude was trading at a higher level and the country was boosting measures to attract foreigners.
Khalid Al Hussan, chief executive officer of the Saudi exchange, the Tadawul, also cited rising activity among retail investors as a reason for increased trading volume, in a Bloomberg TV interview on Sept. 1.
The recent surge in appetite doesn’t mean investors are finding bargains across the board in the Middle East’s biggest exchange. The main Saudi index is trading near the highest premium to shares in emerging markets in at least 12 years. That pricing gap could widen more once FTSE Russell increases the weight of some Saudi shares in its widely followed EM benchmark next week, leading to forced buying by passive funds.
Investors are not finding “many other attractive investment avenues available,” said Muhammad Faisal Potrik, head of research at Riyad Capital.

Investors are continuing the search for a catalyst to return global stocks back to their months-long rally, which came to halt earlier in the month. Central bank stimulus measures have provided some protection against risks such as the ever-rising number of global COVID-19 cases, November's U.S. presidential election and the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress’ stalemate over the latest round of stimulus measures continued to raise concerns about the economic recovery from COVID-19.

Oracle (N:ORCL) announced on Monday it was part of a proposal submitted by Bytedance to the U.S. Treasury Department to serve as ""trusted technology provider,"" to Bytedance, with no further details on the terms of the deal. 
Trump has made it clear he wants to see an outright sale of TikTok to a U.S. company, raising questions about the deal's approval amid concerns that U.S. user data could be passed on to China's government.
Trump issued an executive order last month that would ban TikTok in the United States as early as Sept. 20 if ByteDance does not comply with a sale.
In a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who heads a national security panel that reviews such deals, Republican Senator Josh Hawley called on Monday for the proposal to be rejected. 
""An ongoing 'partnership' that allows for anything other than the full emancipation of the TikTok software from potential Chinese Communist Party control is completely unacceptable, and flatly inconsistent with the President's Executive Order,"" Hawley wrote. 
Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal stopped short of demanding the deal be scuttled but sought key assurances. 
""I want specific, ironclad commitments on how Oracle & ByteDance will guarantee users’ privacy, cyber security, & freedom of expression,"" he tweeted. 
While the Trump administration has not yet said whether it will approve the deal, White House adviser Jared Kushner on Tuesday said the White House is reviewing Oracle's bid, even as other lawmakers took aim specifically at the firm's own track record. 
""Making Oracle a middleman won't protect Americans against Chinese government influence, and to make matters worse, Oracle has an awful record of harvesting and selling Americans' private data to anyone with a credit card,"" Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement. 

Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in 2015, it settled allegations by the Federal Trade Commission that it failed to notify customers about unaddressed hacking dangers when it released security updates for the estimated 850 million U.S. computers with Java SE software.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 10:40PM ET</span>",Air New Zealand plans to cut up to 385 more cabin crew jobs,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Air New Zealand Ltd (NZ:AIR) said on Wednesday it aims to cut up to 385 more cabin crew jobs due to the lack of long-haul international flying, which would take its COVID-19 related job losses to around 37% of its workforce.
The percentage figure is higher than the cuts to nearly 30% of jobs at Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and around 20% at Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL).
Air New Zealand said in a statement it would need fewer cabin crew due to the decline in demand on North American routes, which had led it to reduce return flights to Los Angeles to three a week from daily and convert San Francisco flights to cargo only.
""In the foreseeable future, we have around 385 more widebody cabin crew in the business than we have work for,"" an airline spokeswoman said. ""Any decision we make will be made in consultation with our people and the unions, with redundancies as the last resort.""  
E tū, the union representing flight attendants, said in a statement the latest job cuts are proposed to be carried out by December. It called on Air New Zealand to stop outsourcing work to a cabin crew hire company in Shanghai.
Air New Zealand declined to comment on the timing of the planned cuts. The airline had announced 4,000 job losses before the latest proposal to cut cabin crew.
The airline said last week it would extend the grounding of its  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 777 fleet until at least Sept. 2021 due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic, though it has a fleet of 787-9s it can use for long-haul flying.
Its prospects in the domestic market were boosted this week by the end of a requirement for physical distancing on flights that will allow it to sell all of the seats.

Air New Zealand said on Tuesday it would fly a domestic schedule of around 70-75% of normal levels, while Qantas-owned low-cost rival Jetstar Airways said it would resume domestic services from Sept. 17 at around 60% of normal levels.

""Given the U.S.-China tensions and U.S. suppression on a range of Chinese technology enterprises, if Arm falls into U.S. hands, Chinese technology companies would certainly be placed at a big disadvantage in the market,"" said the op-ed, the author of which was not named. 
SoftBank said on Monday it had agreed to sell Britain-based chip designer Arm to Nvidia for as much as $40 billion in a deal set to reshape the global semiconductor landscape.
The Global Times op-ed said Chinese companies put on the U.S. ""entity list"" risk getting cut off from using Arm-based chips, while European companies using Arm might also face difficulties supplying China. 
In May 2019, the U.S. department of commerce placed Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on a list of companies that American firms are barred from supplying and servicing.
Before Nvidia can assume full control of Arm, anti-monopoly regulators in major markets must signal approval of the transaction.
In 2018, U.S. chipmaker  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) reversed its planned acquisition of Netherlands' NXP Semiconductor NV (O:NXPI) after Chinese regulators declined to approve it.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 08:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: AT&T considers cellphone plans subsidized by ads,"By Sheila Dang, Helen Coster, Krystal Hu and Kenneth Li
(Reuters) - AT&T Inc is considering offering wireless phone plans partially subsidized by advertising as soon as a year from now, Chief Executive John Stankey said in an interview on Tuesday.
The consideration, which has not been previously disclosed, underscores AT&T’s commitment to the advertising business as the U.S. phone carrier reviews its portfolio to identify assets to sell in order to reduce its debt load. AT&T is considering selling its advertising-technology unit Xandr, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.
“I believe there's a segment of our customer base where given a choice, they would take some load of advertising for a $5 or $10 reduction in their mobile bill,” Stankey said. 
Various companies including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Virgin Mobile USA and Sprint's Boost Mobile have tested advertising supported phone services since the early 2000s but they have not caught on. AT&T is hoping that better advertising targeting could revive the idea.
The planned launch of an ad-supported version of AT&T’s video-streaming service HBO Max next year will serve as a “foundational element” that will provide new advertising inventory, and would be key to new phone plans supported by ads, Stankey said without offering details. 
Stankey said ad-supported phone plans could be introduced in “a year or two.” 
AT&T engineers are creating “unified customer identifiers,” Stankey said. Such technology would allow marketers to identify users across multiple devices and serve them relevant advertising. 
The ability to fine tune ad targeting would allow AT&T to sell ads at higher rates, he said.
AT&T has invested in developing targeted advertising on its own media properties using data from its phone, TV and internet customers, but the company has been “slower in coming up the curve” on expanding its marketplace that allows advertisers to use AT&T data to target other media companies’ audiences, Stankey said. 
In March, AT&T's Xandr struck a deal to partner with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) to let advertisers buy TV commercials across the networks
AT&T's advertising marketplace, which incorporates data from outside AT&T, could face privacy challenges as consumers express rising concern about tracking of their media use across platforms and laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act have been passed.
“I don't know if we can count on it in perpetuity,” Stankey said, referring to the use of non-AT&T-owned data. 
Stankey, who last week penned an op-ed for Politico stating that the U.S. government should provide subsidies to encourage companies to build fiber broadband networks in underserved areas, said in the Reuters interview that AT&T believes it could double its fiber footprint if it had the economic incentive. 
Fiber or fiber optics are thin cables often installed underground that allow companies to deliver internet services to homes. AT&T uses fiber to deliver internet to homes and businesses as well as to power its 5G network.

AT&T’s fiber currently passes 18 million homes in the United States. The company could grow that number by 3 million to 5 million homes per year, he added.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 07:50PM ET</span>",Trump says Oracle close to TikTok deal as ByteDance aims for majority ownership,"By David Shepardson, Echo Wang and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had heard  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) was very close to a deal over ByteDance's TikTok, even as sources said the Chinese company was seeking to keep majority ownership of the popular short video app. 
Trump has ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok amid U.S. concerns user data could be passed to China's Communist Party government. He has threatened to ban TikTok in the United States as early as Sunday if ByteDance does not comply.
Under ByteDance's proposal, however, the Beijing-based company would keep a majority stake in TikTok's global business and create headquarters for TikTok in the United States, the sources said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that ByteDance has also offered to create 20,000 U.S. jobs with TikTok.
Oracle would become ByteDance's technology partner responsible for the management of TikTok's data and take a minority stake in TikTok, the sources added.
""I heard they are very close to a deal,"" Trump said, adding his administration would be making a decision soon on whether to approve it, and that he was a fan of Oracle's Chairman Larry Ellison. 
The ByteDance proposal calls for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the U.S. government panel that is overseeing the deal talks, to supervise how TikTok will be operated, one of the sources said.
Mnuchin, who chairs CFIUS, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross were meeting at the White House on Tuesday to consider ByteDance's proposal, two of the sources said.
It is unclear whether Trump will approve ByteDance's proposal, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. The White House, ByteDance and Oracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Signing off on a deal for TikTok that would allow ByteDance to retain majority ownership would represent a U-turn for Trump and the U.S. government agencies and departments that comprise CFIUS.
Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 14 calling on ByteDance to divest TikTok in the United States. 
In its lawsuit against Trump's previous executive order, dated Aug. 6, which calls on TikTok to be banned, the app said CFIUS had not identified any mitigation measures that would address the national security risks, despite TikTok proposing to bring in ""trusted U.S. technology partners,"" as it has now branded Oracle.
Some CFIUS experts said the deal's approval would signal a major departure from the traditional national security reviews of deals driven by U.S. civil servants.
""Nothing about this transaction is usual. It appears to be in the hands of the politicians rather than the professional CFIUS staff,"" said Paul Marquardt, a regulatory lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP. ""What is extraordinary here is how public and political the process is, and the continuation of negotiations after the issuance of a divestiture order."" 
While TikTok is best known for dancing videos that go viral among teenagers, U.S. officials have had concerns since last year about whether the personal information of its 100 million U.S. users could be compromised under its Chinese owner.
ByteDance's plan calls for restrictions in its control of TikTok, the sources said. It asks CFIUS to agree to operational arrangements similar to those it put in place when it allowed SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) to acquire U.S. wireless carrier Sprint in 2013, according to the sources. These could include the U.S. government approving board directors at TikTok, as well as its relationships with major vendors, the sources said.
ByteDance is also hoping that Ellison’s fundraising for Trump, as well as Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz’s backing of Trump’s transition team four years ago, will boost its chances, Reuters has reported.
DEAL DOES NOT ENVISAGE PAYMENT TO U.S. GOVERNMENT 
ByteDance's top investors - General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital and Coatue Management LLC - have discussed taking minority stakes in TikTok, though their participation in the deal remains uncertain, one of the sources said. 
Also uncertain is Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) participation in the deal, after  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), which the retail giant had aligned with, was rejected by ByteDance. 
Walmart and the investment firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump said last month ""a very substantial portion"" of any proceeds ByteDance receives from selling a stake in TikTok should go to the U.S. government ""because we’re making it possible for this deal to happen."" ByteDance's proposal, however, does not envision paying any such fee.
China also got involved in the process last month, updating its export control rules to give it a say over the transfer of technology, such as TikTok’s recommendation algorithm, to a foreign buyer. Chinese officials have said ByteDance should not be coerced by the United States into a deal.
Reuters reported last week that China’s government would rather see TikTok shut down in the United States than see it be part of a forced sale. 
The proposed deal with Oracle would not require ByteDance to apply to Chinese authorities for an export license for TikTok’s 

algorithm.

China-based  Fosun Tourism Group  (HK:1992), which was the biggest shareholder in the original Thomas Cook and also owns Club Med, said it was reviving the name to sell holidays online, having bought the brand and online assets last November. 
Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 and was the world's oldest travel firm until it went bankrupt in September 2019, some six months before the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the travel industry.
The new Thomas Cook will sell holidays to destinations on Britain's safe travel corridor list including Italy, Greece and Turkey, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
But the timing of the launch during the pandemic could raise eyebrows. Many airlines and holiday companies have been brought to their knees, including the world's biggest travel company TUI Group, which has had to rely on German state support.
Thomas Cook's UK CEO Alan French said that launching during the pandemic posed short term challenges but Fosun was taking a long-term view. 
""Our new business will combine fantastic UK-based customer service with an updated operating model protected by Atol and with the backing of a multi-billion-dollar organisation,"" he said. 
Atol is a UK financial protection scheme for holidays, giving customers confidence in their booking. 

Fosun said Thomas Cook's relaunch in Britain would support the growth of the brand in China.

(Reuters) - U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (N:FDX) reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, after price hikes, lower fuel costs and efficiency gains countered negative impacts associated with a pandemic-fueled surge in e-commerce shipments. 
Shares in the Memphis-based company jumped 7.6% to $254.66 in extended trading.
Average daily package volume for FedEx Ground, which handles e-commerce deliveries for retailers like Walmart (O:WMT), jumped 31% to 11.6 million during the fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31. Revenue per package rose 2% to $9.33 during the quarter, which also included one additional business day.
COVID-19 upended operations at FedEx and rival  United Parcel  Service (N:UPS). Lucrative deliveries to businesses dried up and higher-cost residential deliveries boomed as workers sheltered at home and placed online orders for everything from office furniture and exercise equipment to snacks and pet food.
Home deliveries traditionally have been more expensive because they involved fewer packages and far-flung stops. Rising volumes and investments in things like automated sorting centers and route optimization are bringing those costs down. 
""Minor improvements can make a big difference whenever you're moving this many packages a day. The worst of the pressures on profitability are probably behind the company,"" Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said. 
FedEx spent $565 million on fuel across the company during the quarter, 35% less than a year earlier. 
FedEx did not provide an earnings forecast for fiscal 2021, citing continued uncertainty, but said it expects annual capital spending of $5.1 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $4.96 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Fiscal first quarter adjusted net income at FedEx jumped 60% to $1.28 billion, or $4.87 per share. 
Revenue rose 13.5% to $19.3 billion.

Analysts expected earnings of $2.69 per share and revenue of $17.55 billion.

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 06:25PM ET</span>","Dunkin' Donuts parent settles New York cyberattack lawsuit, is fined","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The parent of Dunkin' Donuts on Tuesday agreed to upgrade its security protocols and pay $650,000 in fines and costs to settle a lawsuit by New York's attorney general claiming it ignored cyberattacks that compromised the online accounts of tens of thousands of customers.
Attorney General Letitia James said Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) Group Inc will notify customers affected by the attacks between 2015 and 2018, reset their passwords, and provide refunds for unauthorized use of their Dunkin'-branded stored value cards.
The settlement resolves a civil lawsuit filed last Sept. 26 in a New York state court in Manhattan, and requires a judge's approval.
Dunkin' did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
The case arose after hackers began in early 2015 using previously stolen user names and passwords to conduct automated ""brute force"" and ""credential stuffing"" attacks, and steal tens of thousands of dollars from accounts created through Dunkin's website or free mobile app.
James said the Canton, Massachusetts-based company did nothing for years to address the compromised accounts despite repeated alerts from its own app developer, including when it identified 19,715 customers targeted over a five-day period.
The attorney general also said Dunkin' failed to adopt safeguards against future attacks despite reports of continuing fraud. She said that came to roost in late 2018, when more than 300,000 customer accounts were accessed in new attacks. 
""For years, Dunkin' hid the truth and failed to protect the security of its customers, who were left paying the bill,"" James said. ""It's time to make amends and finally fill the holes in Dunkin's' cybersecurity.""
In a separate statement, Dunkin' said the cyberattacks potentially affected less than 1% of its Perks Loyalty members, and the hackers had no access to credit card information.

""We have taken steps to make sure that any stored value cards associated with [digital customers'] accounts are protected and secure,"" it added.

Workers in the retail and commercial divisions of many large banks are expected to see lower bonuses as banks have had to set aside billions in reserves to cover loan defaults due to shutdowns and unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, those estimates were less severe than the up to 30% cut Johnson projected in August. (https://reut.rs/2ZHNLxH)
Workers in insurance and asset management could see a 10% to 15% fall in bonuses this year, according to the report, which is closely watched by financial professionals.
Johnson estimates the industry headcount to be 10% lower in July 2021, compared to February 2020, while compensation for chief executives will also face more scrutiny this year.
Traders at major banks, however, could see their bonuses surge up to 30% this year, the report said, as they handle record-high volumes of transactions from investors looking to benefit from the volatile capital markets.

Underwriters and workers in fixed income departments could also see their bonuses improve, the report said.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Investors expect reprieve on contentious U.S. shareholder voting rights rule,"By Katanga Johnson and Jessica DiNapoli
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. investors expect the securities regulator to drop a contentious provision in a new rule that would make it tougher for them to push companies on issues such as climate change and social justice, according to three people briefed on the matter. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) next Wednesday is scheduled to finalize the rule, first proposed last November, that would raise the bar for submitting shareholder proposals at companies' annual general meetings. It says the decades-old rule needs to be modernized.
Talks on the rule have gone down to the wire as investors made last-ditch efforts this month to halt the changes in meetings with SEC staff and letters, the people said. 
While the SEC next Wednesday will push ahead with the new rule, it is poised to drop one of its most contentious provisions, which would have allowed companies to exclude proposals that have declining shareholder support, the sources said. SEC staff were still working on the final draft on Tuesday, one of the people said.
The expected removal of the provision, which has not been reported before, marks a critical reprieve for supporters of social and environmental motions, which can take years on the ballot to gain traction. 
With nationwide racial justice protests, and wildfires in the U.S. West that scientists say are fueled partially by climate change, corporate America should be under more pressure to confront environmental and social issues, not less, investors argue.
""The rulemaking is tone-deaf to the surge in market support for environmental and social governance disclosure, and the groundswell of demand from young people that their investments and employers have a positive effect on the environment and society,"" said Sanford Lewis, director of the Shareholder Rights Group, which campaigns for greater corporate democracy.
An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on Tuesday.
Once seen as distractions, U.S. shareholder proposals have taken on a new importance at many corporate annual meetings in recent years as investors, especially younger ones, pay more attention to issues like climate changes and social inequality.
Corporate lobbying groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have pushed to rein in shareholder proposals and have argued that the bar for resubmitting them should be higher in order to stop niche issues with diminishing levels of support from clogging up company ballots.
The so-called ""momentum"" provision would have allowed companies to block motions for which shareholder support declines annually by more than 10% and which receive less than majority support. 
Investors argued the provision made no sense, since it would allow companies to cut proposals which command a large chunk, if not a majority, of support and have fought hard to water down that and other aspects of the rule they say will gag them.
Lewis wrote to the SEC https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-23-19/s72319-7760742-223259.pdf on Friday calling for it to review the economic effects of the whole package after other regulators warned https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-market-risks/us-regulator-calls-climate-change-a-systemic-risk-idUSKBN260120 climate change poses systemic risks.
The Council for Institutional Investors, the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility this month also wrote to the agency https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-23-19/s72319-7741268-223144.pdf highlighting flaws in its economic analysis of the rule.

While SEC Chairman Jay Clayton can typically rely on his two fellow Republican commissioners, who are in the majority on the five-member panel, to pass rules, the SEC has been wary of alienating investors and has been looking to strike a compromise, the sources said.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>",Banks lower revenue outlook as pandemic crimps loan demand,"By Imani Moise and David Henry
(Reuters) - Executives at the top U.S. banks warned investors this week that 2020 revenue will be lower than expected due to weak loan demand and an uptick in repayments during the coronavirus pandemic.
Bank of America (N:BAC), the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, said it found little appetite for new loans when it surveyed its corporate clients twice this year.
""Most of them are saying, 'We don't need money,'"" CEO Brian Moynihan said in a virtual investor conference on Tuesday. ""We tended not to believe them, honestly.""
But loan balances at the Charlotte-based bank dipped below pre-pandemic levels earlier this month, potentially setting up its loan book to shrink in the third quarter for the first time since 2015, according to an investor presentation and Refinitiv data.
Consumers with additional cash from government stimulus programs and from spending less have used some of that money to pay off debt. In addition, large corporate clients have raised cash from the capital markets, which have been propped up by the Federal Reserve, rather than banks.
The shifts caused Bank of America to slash its outlook for quarterly net interest income by roughly $400 million.
In the same conference, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) trimmed its outlook for annual net interest income by $1 billion, citing an expected drop in loan demand.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C), one of the largest credit card issuers, cited less consumer borrowing as a reason its third-quarter revenue will decline.
Lending is also lagging also because business activity is slower, PNC Financial Services Group, (N:PNC) CEO William Demchak said.
Sluggish loan demand is the latest headwind for banks that have been hit by prospective costs for bad loans in the recession.

The Federal Reserve is holding interest rates near zero to support the economy, but that also means banks earn less from loans.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain offered tentative concessions on fisheries in trade talks with the European Union last week, two diplomatic sources told Reuters, just as London was publicly threatening to breach the terms of its divorce deal with the bloc. 
The sources, who did not attend last week's talks between the sides' chief negotiators but were briefed on them by the EU negotiating team, described the offer as a possible bid by London to overcome a key obstacle to a new trade deal from 2021.
They said it also suggested London might still be open to clinching an agreement despite a crisis in Brexit talks over Britain's Internal Market bill which, if passed by parliament as proposed, would breach Britain's international legal obligations as well as the EU divorce treaty. 
Britain formally left the EU in January but the two sides are seeking a new trade deal before a status-quo transition arrangement ends in December.
The talks have all but stalled over disagreements on fishing rights, state aid rules and other guarantees of fair market competition, and ways to solve future disputes. 
But the two EU sources said London had floated two ideas on fisheries which were a departure from Britain's position so far that it must take control of its territorial waters in the Channel from next year.
""The UK definitely seems to be coming around on this, they seem to be moving cautiously towards some opening on fisheries in the technical talks,"" said one of the sources.
The second source reported a ""tentative, modest"" move on fisheries after Britain this summer pushed a more rigid line, which the EU has rejected.
Asked to comment, a British government spokesperson did not address the main point directly but said: ""Our position on fish is reasonable and straightforward.""
""We want a simple, separate fisheries framework agreement which reflects our rights under international law and which provides for annual negotiations over access and sharing opportunities based on the scientific principle of zonal attachment.""
""This is a fairer, more modern and scientific approach that is already the basis for the EU's existing fisheries agreement with Norway and respects each party as an independent coastal state,"" the spokesperson said.
SYMBOL OF SOVEREIGNTY
Britain has said it will become an ""independent coastal nation"" after the transition period ends, enabling it to control its own waters, and who fishes in them, and to increase the British catch.
Brexit supporters see fisheries as an important symbol of sovereignty and say fishing grounds in British waters should be primarily for British fishing crews. The EU says it wants a ""fair deal"" that gives access for boats from the bloc's member states like France and the Netherlands.
Failure to agree on trade would be expected to lead to trade barriers being erected between Britain and the EU, the world's largest trading bloc.
Officials on both sides have said there has been some progress on technical aspects of the talks on fisheries, including on quota sharing and a list of stocks, but London says the EU has not accepted that Britain will become an independent coastal state.
Under one proposal described by the EU sources, the sides could agree to a ""phasing-out mechanism"" for fish quotas that would increase Britain's share in time, rather than overnight from Jan. 1, 2021. 
Under the second idea, EU vessels around the Channel islands including Jersey and Guernsey could be exempted from restrictions that would be tighter than those now in place on fishing in British waters up to 12 nautical miles from shore.

Britain wants to be responsible for managing its territorial waters out to 12 nautical miles from shore, out to 200 nautical miles in a so-called exclusive economic zone, or out to a median line between the British coast and the costs of other states.

Investing.com - U.S. oil stockpiles fell sharply last week, easing worries that the recovery in demand is under threat.  
U.S. crude inventories  fell by 9.5 million barrels last week, according to an estimate released Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute, after a build of 2.97 million barrels the previous week.
Crude Oil WTI Futures, the U.S. benchmark for oil, was up 3.25% after settling 2.74% higher at $38.28 a barrel on Tuesday.
The surprise draw comes a day ahead of the official government report expected to show weekly U.S. crude supplies rose by 1.271 million barrels last week.
The rise in oil prices comes as experts continue to warn on weaker crude demand. 
The International Energy Agency said it expects global oil demand growth to fall by 8.4 million barrels per day year-on-year to 91.7 million bpd. That is a deeper contraction than the 8.1 million bpd decline previously estimated.

Investing.com - FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported Tuesday fiscal first-quarter results that beat analysts' forecasts, driven by higher margins and volume growth as the pandemic-led boosted demand for delivery services.
FedEx surged 6% in after-market hours.
FedEx announced earnings per share of $4.87 on revenue of $19.30B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.65 on revenue of $17.51B.
Adjusted operating margin rose 8.5% from 6.1%. 
""Operating results increased due to volume growth in FedEx International Priority and U.S. domestic residential package services, yield improvement at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, and one additional operating weekday,"" the company said. ""These factors were partially offset by costs to support strong demand and to expand services, variable compensation expenses, and COVID-19 related costs incurred to ensure the safety of FedEx team members and customers.""
Looking ahead, the company said it was not providing guidance, though it upped its capital spending forecast by $200 million to $5.1 billion.
“While business demand improved in the first quarter, continued uncertainties cloud our ability to forecast full-year earnings,” said Alan B. Graf, Jr., FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. 
FedEx shares are up 56% from the beginning of the year, still down 1.71% from its 52 week high of $240.85 set on September 14. They are outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 5.24% from the start of the year.

FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - German financial watchdog BaFin said on Tuesday it was looking into allegations of market manipulation by German financial services provider Grenke (DE:GLJn) following a critical report by a short-seller.
Grenke said in a statement that it strongly rejected allegations made in the report by Fraser Perring of Viceroy Research and that one of the central accusations against it was ""demonstrably false"".
The report by Viceroy Research, which raised the alarm and bet big against collapsed payment company Wirecard (DE:WDIG), sent Grenke shares down as much as 29%. It accuses Grenke of malfeasance including money laundering.
""This report contains allegations which Grenke strongly rejects,"" the company said in a statement. ""A central accusation is that a substantial portion of the EUR 1,078 million in cash and cash equivalents reported in the 2020 half-year financial report does not exist. This is demonstrably false.""
Grenke said it was preparing a detailed reply to the accusations, adding it reserved the right to take legal action.
BaFin said in a statement that it was investigating the allegations of market abuse in the report.
The watchdog said its probe included possible market manipulation by Grenke through accounting issues or by third parties in the form of an attack by short sellers.
Possible insider trading before the Viceroy report's publication was also under review, BaFin said.
Perring said Viceroy had posted two copies of its report on Grenke to BaFin, once in July and once this month, before publishing it on Tuesday.
""We are ready to cooperate with regulators,"" he told Reuters. ""We are happy to show where the irregularities lie.""
Grenke, founded in 1978, with 1,700 employees in 32 locations around the world, is listed on Germany's MDAX index of mid-cap companies. It provides mainly small and medium-sized companies with leasing, banking and factoring services.
The shares posted their biggest ever intraday drop to trade at the lowest level in more than five years. At 1527 GMT, shares were down 20% at 44.12 euros, up from a low of 39.30 euros ($46.56).

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose after its big event where it added a fitness subscription service, as well as a bundling subscription service for users to have access to the various products the company offers. Shares closed little changed. Other big tech stocks stayed strong, while financials and energy lagged. 
Investors digested positive regional market data as a sign that the economic recovery remains intact. The Empire State Manufacturing index rose to a reading of 17 in September, from 3.7 last month, topping economists’ estimates of 7.
Markets remained optimistic even as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNBC that she would not back the Republican’s “skinny” version of her party’s coronavirus stimulus plan.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. The Fed
The U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement is due out at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT) after the two-day meeting wraps up. It is the primary tool the panel uses to communicate with investors about monetary policy, and it's the last such meeting before the presidential vote in November. Investors will be looking for details on the bank's new inflation framework, after its traditional 2% approach.
2. Oil inventory

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat or 1 point higher. The S&P 500 was up 0.49%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.21%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled Tuesday a slate of new hardware including a new iPad and Apple Watch and launched its much-rumored services bundle, Apple One, starting at $14.95 per month. Apple rose 0.2%, but had been up more than 1% in early trade.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Families of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crash victims are urging U.S. lawmakers to ensure the planemaker is held accountable for accidents that together killed 346 people by blocking a key legal defense, according to a letter sent on Tuesday and seen by Reuters. 
Chicago-based  Boeing Co  is facing around 100 lawsuits by families of 157 victims of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash and has argued that because the aircraft was certified by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, it is immune from liability, court filings show.
But families say manufacturers should not be allowed to ""hide behind"" FAA certification when a certified airplane turns out to be defective.
""No amount of regulation should shield Boeing and other manufacturers from responsibility when airplanes crash and kill innocent people,"" they wrote in the letter to bipartisan leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee.
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said: ""Boeing has offered to work with the victims’ families to schedule mediations to discuss settlement of claims on terms that fairly compensate them and are committed to this mediation process.""
However, some families are pursuing a jury trial, which would give liability lawyers greater access to Boeing's internal records and expose the company to deeper scrutiny over its relations with the FAA. 
The 737 MAX crash in Ethiopia occurred just five months after a similar disaster on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia. It triggered a global grounding of the aircraft, which has been parked for 18 months.
""Accountability is the best way to encourage the design and manufacture of safe airplanes—so this does not happen again,"" said the families of Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302.
The letter comes ahead of a Senate Commerce Committee vote on Wednesday on sweeping reforms to how the FAA certifies new aircraft.

Boeing has already settled the majority of lawsuits related to the Lion Air crash but is still the target of a U.S. federal criminal probe and investigations by U.S. lawmakers and aviation and transportation authorities.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) is exploring options in the aerial taxi market, including whether to build the vehicles known colloquially as ""flying cars,"" as part of a push by the U.S. automaker to look for growth in related transportation markets, two people familiar with the matter said.
Chief Executive Mary Barra on Monday briefly made her first reference ever to Detroit-based GM's interest in the air taxi market, saying that it fit with development of electric vehicles (EVs) and its Ultium advanced electric battery.
""We believe strongly in our EV future and not just for vehicles,"" she said at an RBC conference. ""The strength and flexibility of our Ultium battery system opens doors"" for many uses, she added, ""including aerial mobility.""
Air taxis are vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft that use electric motors instead of jet engines. Designed to avoid the need for long runways, they have rotating wings and, in some cases, rotors in place of propellers.
Electric air taxis are likely to fly low-level routes, relieving traffic congestion on roads. But they could add to air traffic congestion as they become more popular.
GM spokesman Stuart Fowle declined to elaborate. ""It's an area we're really excited about and looking at.""
GM shares rose as much as 5.4% and were still up 1.4% in afternoon trading. 
Corporate and private investors have poured at least $2.3 billion into more than 100 aerial vehicle startups, including drones and electric air taxis, but the technology still faces significant roadblocks to commercialization and profitability, according to investor website PitchBook. 
GM is weighing all options - whether to build, supply or partner - as it decides whether to join such automakers as  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Geely Automobile (HK:0175) in the still-developing market, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. GM could make an announcement early next year. 
""I am not surprised that GM and others are looking into this,"" said investor and corporate adviser Evangelos Simoudis, managing director of Synapse Partners. He noted that companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are pushing to use package delivery drones, but said transporting people with flying cars will take a lot longer to develop as a business.
GM's study of the aerial mobility market is part of the push by GM's innovation group to explore other transportation markets for growth, one of the sources said. The group is headed by Alan Wexler, who reports to Barra and was hired in July in the newly created position of senior vice president of innovation and growth.
Other efforts that originated in the innovation group include formation of a defense business unit and a $214 million contract to build troop carriers for the U.S. Army based on the Chevrolet Colorado pickup, as well as a new mobile app for OnStar members. 
Hyundai teamed up with  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) in January to develop electric air taxis and has pledged to invest $1.5 billion in urban air mobility by 2025.
Toyota led a $590 million investment round in air taxi startup Joby in January, while Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Geely have invested in Stuttgart-based Volocopter. Volkswagen's Porsche brand is working with Boeing (N:BA) to develop a concept electric flying vehicle.
Last year, Tesla (O:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk called electric supersonic VTOL a ""hard problem,"" and last month said a more powerful battery that could enable electric airplanes was three to four years away. Musk has said ""many exciting things"" will be unveiled during Tesla's Battery Day on Sept. 22.

Separately on Tuesday, the World Economic Forum and the city of Los Angeles released a set of principles to support the rollout of urban air mobility in U.S. cities, and a spokeswoman for the organization said it is talks with other cities to adopt the same roadmap.

MILAN/ROME (Reuters) -  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) is ready to approve the listing of its motorway assets as early as next week, challenging the solution favoured by the Rome government to solve a long-running dispute with the infrastructure group, two sources said.
Benetton-owned Atlantia has been embroiled in a legal dispute with the state since the deadly collapse in 2018 of a bridge operated by its Autostrade per l'Italia toll-road unit.
In July, Atlantia agreed to pull out of Autostrade under a government plan that would see state lender CDP work with Atlantia on spinning off the group's toll-road assets, of which CDP and other investors would get control.
The sources said a stalemate in talks had prompted Atlantia to consider proceeding with the spin-off without CDP's involvement.
The move would further complicate negotiations with the government, but it may not travel far with investors due to the government's threat to revoke Autostrade's motorway licence.
Atlantia has already set up a new company to house its motorway assets, drafted bylaws and appointed a managing director for the entity, one source with knowledge of the company's plan told Reuters.
However it has not gone as far as to transfer its 88% stake in Autostrade to the vehicle, the source added. 

Atlantia said no board meeting had been called at present for next week. Italy's transport ministry declined to comment.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>",Bayer settles thousands of U.S. Roundup cases with trial attorneys,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) has settled thousands of U.S. Roundup weed killer lawsuits as part of an $11 billion settlement, reaching deals with the only lawyers who took cases to trial over allegations the herbicide caused cancer.
In letters filed with U.S. District Court in San Francisco late on Monday, three lawyers said they had reached binding settlements. 
The agreements covered 15,000 lawsuits, according to attorneys familiar with the talks, bringing the resolved cases to about 45,000. Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) has estimated it faces 125,000 filed and unfiled claims over Roundup.
“We indicated last week that we were accelerating efforts to finalize and implement current settlements and our progress is consistent with our commitment to pursue a holistic settlement to the Roundup litigation,"" Bayer said in a statement.
The letters from Brent Wisner, Jennifer Moore and Aimee Wagstaff, who took cases to trial, did not disclose settlement terms. 
""I cannot speak to Monsanto/Bayer’s plans, but with trial counsel out of the way, I think they are in an excellent position to find a way to resolve the remaining claims quickly,"" said Wisner. 
Shares of Bayer closed up 2.7% at 56.82 euros on Tuesday.
In August, Bayer's stock fell 3% after it said there were ""bumps"" in talks to seal the $11 billion settlement of the Roundup cases and the judge overseeing the case, Vince Chhabria, threatened to restart the litigation.
Bayer in June struck an agreement on about 75% of the 125,000 claims stemming from its $63 billion takeover of seed and chemical company  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
Chhabria raised concerns in July over the plan to create an independent panel of scientists to assess whether glyphosate-based weed killers such as Roundup caused cancer, delaying a key part of the proposed settlement.

The parties are expected to discuss next steps at a Sept. 24 hearing.

1516,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",A $79 Billion Gold ETF Halts Record Run as Haven Demand Abates,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest gold exchange-traded fund is suffering an exodus after a ferocious run.
Traders have pulled cash from the $79 billion SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) for a third straight week -- following eight consecutive months of inflows, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The fund has surged almost 30% this year as the coronavirus pandemic sparked demand for gold as a store of value. Unprecedented economic stimulus from governments and central banks has also raised the specter of inflation, adding to bullion’s appeal. Yet the rally has shown signs of losing momentum as economies reopen, eroding demand for haven assets.
“With the price of gold recently flattening out after a stellar run through early August, traders likely viewed this as an opportune time for some profit-taking,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store.
Despite the recent outflows for the giant ETF, its peer iShares Gold Trust (IAU) is still going strong -- with 25 weeks of inflows. The short-term market moves would have a greater impact on GLD since it’s used as a trading vehicle, while investors interested in buy-and-hold strategies usually turn to IAU because of its lower costs, Geraci said.
The recent fluctuations in gold ETFs could also be due to market volatility and unknowns regarding policy tweaks from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
“There’s just more uncertainty as to how we proceed from current levels, whether the economic recovery is going to continue or if there will be a more sustained pullback and just different views on the inflation trajectory,” said David Perlman, an ETF strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.
It’s exactly this high degree of uncertainty that may keep the interest in gold and bullion-related assets strong. GLD is currently second place in ETF inflows this year, attracting $19.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, total gold ETF holdings are around record-high levels.
Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy for Natixis Investment Managers, said she still sees upside potential for the precious metal.
“Demand is going to stay, whether it’s because rates stay lower for even longer or eventually people think inflation is coming back,” Dwek said.

Such a cut would mean a reduction of at least 30 planes more than the recently bailed-out airline had planned previously.
Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr informed staff on Monday that the airline's management would make a decision about the move in the coming week, the people told Reuters.
The number of workers at Lufthansa, which stood at around 140,000 before the coronavirus crisis hit the airline sector, is likely to have to be reduced by a fifth, the sources said.
This would equate to 28,000 positions, slightly more than the 26,000 under previous plans to weather the crisis.
A Lufthansa spokesman declined to comment, saying there had been no decision on the matter.
Lufthansa, which in June received a 9 billion euro ($10.7 billion) government bailout, said last month it expected capacity to recover to only around 50% of normal by the end of 2020 and to two thirds of last year's level in 2021.

Shares dropped 3% as the company said in a statement that continued compression of interest rates has been pressuring investment yields, and the sharp reduction in long-term rates has led to an acceleration of prepayment activity in the mortgage-backed securities in its investment portfolio. As a result, third quarter net interest margins are in the upper 130s basis point range, pushing sales rates lower.  
In August, the company reported total client assets were $4.49 trillion as of month-end August, up 21% from August 2019 and up 5% compared to July 2020. 
“We continue to drive strong business momentum,"" said Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford in a statement. ""August new accounts and core net new assets were among the highest we’ve seen for a summer month in recent years, and client assets reached a record $4.49 trillion at month-end, up $773 billion, or 21%, year-over-year.

1527,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>","Robots Driving Forklifts Score Venture Capital, Create Jobs","(Bloomberg) -- Silicon Valley investors are increasing bets on a Pittsburgh company that turns a venerable machine of the past century of industrialization -- the forklift -- into a driver of the e-commerce boom.
Seegrid Corp., a maker of autonomous forklifts and robot-powered vehicles used to move materials around warehouses and factories, just closed on equity financing totaling $52 million from Menlo, California-based venture fund G2VP LLC and an undisclosed group of tech and robotics investors.
The deal, with UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) serving as an adviser, brought to $150 million the total amount of funding received by Seegrid, which has a valuation of more than $400 million.
The fresh round of financing during a pandemic underscores the rising demand to shore up supply chains increasingly dependent on warehouses and distribution hubs as consumer dabbling with online shopping turns more habitual. Seegrid expects to double revenue this year and plans to add 100 workers to an existing payroll of 240 employees, Chief Executive Officer Jim Rock said.
“2021 is looking to be an even bigger and better year,” he said in an interview. “We’re adding customers like mad and our existing customers are adding more, so it’s a good time to be in the robot business.”
Made by divisions of Toyota and Mitsubishi and then outfitted with software and robotic technology, Seegrid’s vehicles are joining workplaces teeming with humans.
In the U.S., employment in warehousing and storage rose to a record 1.22 million in August, government data show, marking a recovery of all such jobs eliminated during the depths of Covid-19 lockdown in April.
The pandemic is turning the traditional seasonal patterns in e-commerce demand into a year-round lift to online consumption. That’s forcing companies to invest in better technology and more labor to ensure their supply chains can identify and adjust to the new purchasing patterns.
“They’re teaching people how to work with the technology, not how to replace people by technology,” said Peter Bolstorff, executive vice president of corporate development at the Association for Supply Chain Management, an industry group based in Chicago. “The idea is, how do you scale that supply-chain workforce to be able to work more effectively with technology -- either physical robots or system robots.”
Seegrid, founded in 2003 by scientists including robotics pioneer Hans Moravec from Carnegie Mellon University, remains heavily influenced by the school renowned for scientific and industrial research. Giant Eagle Inc., a Pittsburgh-based chain of grocery stores, is a majority shareholder.
Rock said the coronavirus crisis is accelerating what had been a more gradual embrace of automation not unlike the advances of America’s industrial past that raised worries about job losses for people.
“The wheel barrel and the conveyor belt didn’t put people out of work -- they made companies more competitive so they can hire more people and that’s exactly what’s happening with robots,” he said. “There will be shifts in the nature of work, but I don’t buy into the overall net decrease in available work and labor opportunities -- it’s an evolution to a different type of job.”

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC) on Tuesday forecast better-than-expected quarterly sales growth and said it would step up its marketing budget and overhaul of its supply chain, hoping to save $2 billion by 2024 and halt weak sales and brand deterioration.
Shares in Chicago-based Kraft Heinz jumped about 3% in premarket trading.
Packaged food companies like Kraft Heinz and  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB) that market canned food and salty snacks have for years faced a perception that their products are unhealthy. At the same time, the industry is battling aggressive competition from cheaper private-label brands from Walmart (N:WMT) and Kroger (N:KR).
At its virtual investor day, Chicago-based Kraft Heinz said it plans to increase spending on marketing by 30% to just over $1.4 billion, a move many shareholders have hoped for since media and advertising veteran Miguel Patricio took over as chief executive in July 2019. Shares of Kraft Heinz have risen 4.6% since then.
""We are totally rethinking our operations in manufacturing logistics and procurement - it is absolutely critical because in the five next years, we are going to improve our operations big-time,"" Patricio told Reuters in an interview ahead of the presentation - his first major strategic update.
Of the $2 billion cost cuts, $1.2 billion will come from procurement and $800 million will come from making Kraft Heinz's logisitical network more efficient.
The company expects third-quarter net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range versus last year, beating analysts' expectations of a 2% increase in sales, according to Refinitiv data. The highly leveraged company, whose debt pile was $27 billion at the end of last year, also said it will reduce net leverage to about four times EBITDA by the end of this year. At the end of the second quarter, the company's net leverage ratio was 4.2 times EBITDA.
Fueled by shoppers in lockdowns buying more packaged food, Kraft Heinz forecast high-single-digit quarterly adjusted core earnings growth and mid-single-digit full-year adjusted core earnings growth. Patricio said sales growth has slowed from that early peak, but is still faster than last year. ""That first period was a big competitive advantage because we had a big spike in consumption when people (were) panicky and stocking up products at home.""
The company has begun streamlining its supply chain, Patricio said, and is trying to build better relationships with suppliers - many of whom have been critical about Kraft Heinz's culture under the management of cost-focused private equity firm 3G Capital.
""When you cut costs too much, actually your costs increase because you lose efficiencies,"" Patricio said. Kraft Heinz will continue to reduce costs but doesn't need to be as aggressive if it can work with factories, transportation and logistics companies to preserve margins by being more productive.
""We had a very transactional relationship with our suppliers. ... They are part of the equation to find solutions to improve productivity in our factories,"" he said.
Patricio said Kraft Heinz will invest most of its media budget in five areas, including ready-made meals like Mac & Cheese and healthy snacks.
It also aims to promote products that can be used as ingredients, such as Oscar Mayer bacon and Planters nuts that can be used in salads.
The company, whose portfolio doesn't currently include many sweet foods, plans to spend heavily on promoting ""indulgent desserts"" and children's beverages.
Kraft Heinz, which owns the Capri Sun drink brand, needs to invest in making existing brands better, not making more types of products, he said.

""For example, we launched more than 50 different flavors of salad dressing in the last five years. ... That brings an unbelievable problem of complexity to our factories.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher again on Tuesday, as faith in the growth narrative underpinning the rally in tech stocks withstood the pressure of its first serious correction in months. 
That faith was expressed in strong demand for two software IPOs which are due to price later Tuesday, those of Snowflake and JFrog. Both raised their marketing ranges on Monday and Snowflake is now set to come to market with a valuation of some $30 billion. 
The market was unfazed by data showing that the rebound in industrial production in the U.S. petered out in August, rising only 0.4%, its weakest rise in four months. July's gain was revised up to 3.5% from 3.0% at the same time. Redbook Research's monthly survey of the retail  sector also showed a slight deterioration in conditions in August. Together, the data point to a modest weakening of the economy as the Federal Reserve prepares to begin its regular two-day policy meeting.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 126 points, or 0.5%, at 28,119 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was back to its habit of outperforming, with a rise of 1.5%.
The army of retail investors that has driven this summer's rally appeared to have seen last week's sell-off as little more than a dip to be bought, especially through the options market. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts pointed out that the open interest in single stock call options was now equal to that in index put options, something unprecedented in at least the last 10 years. 
The fresh pile-on in tech megacaps added 4.9% to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, 2.3% to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock and 1.8% to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, with little or no news flow behind any of the moves. Amazon, at least, remained well supported by reports on Monday of it hiring another 100,000 workers across North America. 
Elsewhere, DraftKings continued to post new all-time highs after announcing its groundbreaking partnership with Disney-owned ESPN on Monday. DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) stock was up 1.4%, while Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) stock and William Hill (OTC:WIMHY)ADRs, the two other names included in the 'co-exclusivity' deal with ESPN, were up 0.9% and 4.6% respectively.
Another stock to hit an all-time high was Nextera Energy (NYSE:NEE), which announced a four-for-one stock split after the close on Monday. The renewable power company's decision comes at a time when raging forest fires along the Pacific coast have again inflamed the debate over Climate Change, with both presidential candidates chiming in in unsurprising fashion on Monday.

1530,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",EU to grant Britain temporary euro clearing access until June 2022: sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is expected to grant clearing houses in Britain access to the bloc's market for 18 months from January, industry sources said on Tuesday.
Britain left the EU in January and unfettered access under transition arrangements ends on Dec. 31, meaning EU banks would not be allowed to use clearing houses like the London Stock Exchange's LCH and ICE (NYSE:ICE) Clear Europe from January.
LCH clears the bulk of euro-denominated interest rate swaps and the EU has acknowledged that a sudden cut-off in access could undermine financial stability as users sought to shift large derivatives positions at short notice.
Industry sources said they expected the bloc's executive European Commission to agree an 18-month extension, subject to confirmation following a consultation with EU states launched on Monday.
""This is going to be good news,"" one industry source said after market concerns that a shorter period was on the cards.
Euro clearing has long been a point of tension between Britain and the EU, where policymakers want the activity relocated to the euro zone under the eye of the European Central Bank.
Temporary access is aimed at putting pressure on banks to shift positions from London's financial hub and to give more time for euro zone based clearers to build up capacity in an orderly way.

The European Commission had no immediate comment.

Nikola has rejected the accusations and threatened to take legal action against short-seller Hindenburg since its research into the company sparked the first of a series of falls in the company's shares last week. 
Nikola did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""Nikola's response has holes big enough to roll a truck through,"" the short seller said in a new report on Tuesday.
Hindenburg took a stab at Nikola and its founder Trevor Milton's use of words like ""functional"" and ""fully built"" for the Nikola One truck, which the company claimed had 1,000 horsepower back in 2016.
""Obviously, the truck can't have 1,000 horsepower or even 1 horsepower if it doesn't power itself,"" Hindenburg said in the new report.
Hindenburg had earlier alleged that the seemingly functional truck, Nikola One, was ""simply filmed rolling down a big hill"" in 2017, a claim Nikola disputed by saying it had never stated that the truck was driving ""under its own propulsion"".
""We view the company’s new admission that the Nikola One was not powered on its own in the video as a tacit admission of securities fraud"", the report added.

Bloomberg News reported late on Monday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was probing Nikola to assess the merits of Hindenburg's claims that it had misled investors about its business prospects.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global accounting firm EY said on Tuesday it regretted not spotting fraud at German payments company Wirecard sooner and that it would improve how it verifies information from clients through greater use of technology.
German regulators are examining EY's role as auditor for Wirecard, which collapsed in June after a 1.9 billion euro ($2.3 billion) hole was discovered in its books.
""Many people believe that the fraud at Wirecard should have been detected earlier and we fully understand that. Even though we were successful in uncovering the fraud, we regret that it was not uncovered sooner,"" EY's Global Chairman and Chief Executive Carmine Di Sibio said in a note to clients.
EY said it will mandate the use of data analytics for fraud testing, use more outside data such as social media and match banking transaction records with those provided by the bank.
It said that using innovative technologies can help detect management-led fraud faster in future.
""All of these raise the bar significantly and go beyond currently accepted professional standards,"" Di Sibio said.
Auditors are not primarily responsible for detecting fraud, but pressure on accounting firms to up their game has increased in Britain following corporate scandals at builder Carillion, retailer BHS, and cafe chain Patisserie Valerie.
A British government-sponsored report last year recommended that auditors should be required to look for fraud.
EY said Germany's investigations into audits it carried out are likely to go on for several months.
""The collusive acts of fraud at Wirecard were implemented through a highly complex criminal network designed to deceive everyone – investors, banks, supervisory authorities, investigating lawyers and forensic auditors, as well as ourselves,"" Di Sibio said.

People using the Yelp site will be able to search for businesses via the tag to channel spending towards the Latino community.
""Latinx"" is a gender-neutral term to describe people of Latino or Hispanic origin.
Yelp introduced a similar feature for Black-owned businesses in June after the death of George Floyd prompted a upsurge of consumer interest in supporting the Black community.
""During COVID-19, Latino business owners were disproportionately left out of the economic stimulus effort, and have been struggling,"" Henry Muñoz III, head of community organisation Momento Latino, which is partnering with Yelp to introduce the tag, said. 
Latinos opened businesses at a faster rate than any other ethnic group in the past decade, a Stanford University study showed, contributing $500 billion to the U.S. economy.
But many were severely hit by the pandemic, with a third reporting they stopped working during lockdown compared to 17% of white business owners, according to a University of California study.
Andrea Aguirre, owner of donut store Art of Donut in San Antonio, Texas, said the company would be introducing the tag. 
""We had to close our dining area, so we're doing take-out and delivery only,"" Aguirre said. ""Social media helped us so much but it's not the same. Still, we're thankful just to be in business.""
Yelp's share price, which was at $36.5 in February this year from a September 2018 high of $49.2, tumbled to $14.46 on March 18 as restaurants closed in the United States, but has since partially recovered to $21.93.

The company, which relies on advertising by restaurants, shops and night life for 95.8% of its revenues, had a 31.6% year-on-year revenue decline in the second quarter of 2020.

“Businesses do need support,” the finance minister told Parliament on Tuesday after being asked by Treasury Committee Chairman Mel Stride if he will provide more assistance after the end of October. “I hope that he will be reassured that throughout this crisis I have not hesitated to act in creative and effective ways to support jobs and employment and will continue to do so.”
The Treasury has repeatedly said the furlough program -- under which the government has paid as much as 80% of the wages of more than 9 million people -- will close on Oct. 31. Amid warnings that unemployment could spike to levels not seen since the 1980s, Sunak has come under growing pressure to either extend or replace the program with more targeted support for jobs in the most affected sectors.
Sunak’s remarks followed data that showed the U.K. lost almost 700,000 jobs to the coronavirus-induced recession.
Sunak still isn’t planning to extend furlough -- but he is preparing new measures to support jobs, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The chancellor told the Cabinet earlier on Tuesday that “indefinitely keeping people out of work is not the answer. But rest assured we will be creative in order to find ways of effectively helping people.” The comments were reported earlier by The Sun newspaper."

Nikola sank 8.8% to $32.65 at 4:36 a.m. New York time, after a day of wild price swings. The stock fell as much as 11% Monday after the company issued a lengthier rebuttal to a Sept. 10 report from Hindenburg Research, only to turn higher and finish up 11%.
After the market closed, Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that the SEC was looking into the allegations from Hindenburg to determine whether Nikola may have violated securities laws. The short seller called Nikola an “intricate fraud” that, among other things, overstated the capabilities of its earliest test trucks.
Nikola has pushed back, accusing the short seller of making misleading statements that were designed to manipulate its shares. The company has encouraged the SEC to get involved, saying it reached out to the agency to discuss its issues with the Hindenburg report."

BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Vanguard Group Inc said it voted against the pay of Alphabet Inc executives, including new CEO Sundar Pichai, one of several examples of proxy voting the top mutual fund firm gave in a report to be released on Tuesday as it names a new stewardship chief.
The parent of search engine Google (O:GOOGL) paid Pichai's stock awards valued at $276.6 million for 2019, according to the company's proxy, accounting for nearly all his compensation. 
Vanguard said in the report it ""found a misalignment between pay and performance"" and would have liked to see more long-term compensation tied to metrics like relative total shareholder return.
In an advisory ballot at Alphabet's annual meeting in June 25% of votes cast were ""against"" the pay. An Alphabet spokeswoman declined to comment on Vanguard's votes.
Vanguard also opposed Alphabet's executive pay in prior years. But like other fund firms lately, Vanguard has begun to disclose more details about its reasoning behind specific proxy votes on topics like director elections, social issues or climate policies.
John Galloway, whom Vanguard will name as its new head of stewardship on Tuesday, said an argument to keep the talks behind closed doors would be to have more candid conversations with company executives. But he is more concerned about making Vanguard's views transparent to its clients, as many votes are decided for subtle reasons.
""How we evaluate nuance is really important and certainly outstrips other concerns,"" Galloway said in a telephone interview.
In another example, in Britain, Vanguard said it declined to back a shareholder resolution at  Barclays  (L:BARC) aimed at pushing the bank to phase out financial activities in the energy and utilities sectors. 
Instead, after talking to management, Vanguard wrote that it backed the company's own climate-related proposal as ""we determined that management’s approach was in the best interest of long-term shareholders.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Tuesday, continuing the previous session’s gains as the tech sector finds its footing ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 23 points, or 0.6%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 180 points, or 0.7%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 104 points, or 0.9%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday 1.2% higher, while theS&P 500 index gained 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite index added 1.9%, snapping its two-day losing streak as deal activity lifted sentiment on the sector.
News that Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is likely to partner with the U.S. TikTok and chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to buy chip licensing company ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) helped return confidence to an equity market, and the tech sector in particular, that had been battered last week. 
This enthusiasm is likely to continue, with this week featuring a dozen stock debuts, including the highly anticipated IPO of software provider Snowflake, which is due to price later Tuesday, as is the IPO of fellow software group JFrog. Both raised their marketing ranges on Monday amid strong investor demand.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve starts its two-day policy meeting, its first since adopting a new approach to meeting its 2% inflation target, later Tuesday. The central bank is expected to update its projections for the economic and interest rate outlook, which will include forecasts for 2023 for the first time. 
That said, the Federal Reserve may have to do more heavy lifting to prop up the economy given a new stimulus bill from Congress now looks unlikely before the presidential election in November.
Without a breakthrough on pandemic relief, the U.S. economy won’t get back to where it was before the coronavirus until the fourth quarter of 2021, economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote in a note on Sunday, two quarters longer than with stimulus.
Industrial production numbers for August are due at 9:15 AM ET (1315 GMT), and analysts expect a 1.0% increase on the month. This follows upbeat data from China which revived optimism around an economic rebound.
Oil prices gained Tuesday after strong Chinese economic data, while companies halted oil refineries and pulled workers from offshore oil and gas production platforms in preparation for the arrival of Hurricane Sally to the U.S. Gulf Coast. However, the International Energy Agency trimmed its 2020 oil demand forecast by 300,000 barrels per day to 91.7 million b/d, in its second downgrade in as many months, citing caution about the pace of economic recovery from the pandemic.

(Reuters) - After adapting to working from home in the COVID-19 pandemic, cash-rich technology and healthcare companies have now mastered dealmaking from home.
This week,  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) unveiled a $40 billion agreement to acquire chip maker Arm Ltd from SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), while  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) inked a $21 billion deal for biotech company  Immunomedics  Inc (O:IMMU).
They are the latest examples of companies whose business is minimally affected by, or in some cases benefiting from, the pandemic's financial fallout and which are embarking on big acquisitions.
""They've largely learned to do work from home for their own business, and now it's about strategic deployment of capital,"" said Tom Miles, co-head of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) for the Americas at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
To be sure, U.S. M&A volume so far in 2020 is down nearly 50% on the same period in 2019, Refinitiv data showed. But of the $715.9 billion spent on acquisitions this year, 41% has gone towards either a technology or healthcare transaction. 
Tech deals account for 27% of deal volume, the highest level for this point in a year in the last 23 years, and are up 37% year-on-year. 
""August was the busiest month ever for us. For tech and healthcare, the regular cadence of M&A is coming back,"" said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, global co-head of M&A at UBS.
Technology and healthcare have historically the most active M&A sectors. But many companies in this sector have also fared better in the downturn, either because their offerings are accelerating the transition to digital workplaces and big data, or because they are benefiting from increased investment and spending on healthcare.
As a result, many of the companies are flush with cash, and if they also want to borrow to do deals, they can do so at very low interest rates.
Some smaller companies in these sectors have also emerged as popular targets for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which have already spent a record sum to acquire companies to take public this year. The largest SPAC deal ever was July's $11 billion purchase of healthcare services firm MultiPlan Inc by Churchill Capital Corp III (N:CCXX).
What is more, technology and healthcare companies can be easier to carry out due diligence on remotely in the pandemic, compared to industries that have factories or stores, dealmakers said. 

""As much as any sector, diligence can be completed entirely virtually (for healthcare companies) with limited necessity for on-site visits,"" said Cary Kochman, global co-head of M&A at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).

1541,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Peugeot, Fiat Keep the Show on the Road","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- There’s a big sigh of relief going around northern Italy on Tuesday as shareholders in  Fiat  Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) celebrate success in keeping the auto group’s proposed merger with France’s  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) on track.
Fiat Chrysler (MI:FCHA) shares rose 6.7% by mid-morning in Milan to their highest since March on the back of news, released after the close on Monday, that shareholders will still get a special dividend ahead of the merger.
The dividend won’t be as big as originally planned, but the fact that there is still any dividend at all is a major boost, given the mess that the pandemic had made of the original arithmetic underlying the deal.
The two companies said in a statement late on Monday that the dividend to FCA shareholders would be cut to 2.9 billion euros ($3.4 billion) from the 5.5 billion euros initially foreseen. That’s because the pandemic, which has decimated car and van sales across the world, has sharply raised the need for liquidity at the two companies: FCA lost over 2.7 billion euros in the first half the year, while  operating cash flow was negative to the turn of over 6 billion euros in the second quarter.
Peugeot – almost alone of all the big automakers – stayed profitable even in Q2, which most people expect to have been the low point of the cycle. Even so, net income of 595 million euros in the first half was less than one-third of the previous year’s level.
So Stellantis – the atrociously-named holding company for the new group – will start life with 2.6 billion euros more cash than foreseen. If sales recover enough, then Stellantis will consider paying out another 1 billion euros equally to all shareholders. A big 'if', one might think.
The pandemic hasn’t changed the strategic logic for the merger. If anything, the contrary is true – it’s one of the many long-term trends accelerated by Covid-19. So it was a further boost to see that there’s no pushing back of the expected date of closure, which is still in the first quarter of next year, pending antitrust approval. The companies expect cost efficiencies of over 5 billion euros a year from the deal, a figure that is lent credibility by the excellent track records both of Peugeot's Carlos Tavares and FCA's Michael Manley.
FCA’s shareholders get one more sweetener under the new arrangements: Peugeot, which had expected to distribute its 46% stake in components company  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) to its shareholders ahead of closure, will now distribute half of that to FCA shareholders.
Given that many FCA shareholders won’t want that exposure, Faurecia shares reacted the most negatively out of the four shares involved on Tuesday, falling 6.7%. FCA’s were the biggest gainer, while the Agnelli family’s holding company Exor (OTC:EXXRF) rose 3.8%. Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) stock fell 1.1% in Paris."

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) paused share repurchases Aug. 4-31 ahead of major asset sales announcements, a stock exchange filing showed on Tuesday, in a drop-off in support for the stock after spending 1 trillion yen ($9.4 billion) since March. 
The Japanese conglomerate ""determined that there were facts that could be classified as non-public material facts under insider trading regulation,"" it said in the filing.
The group announced a major cut in its stake in wireless unit SoftBank Corp (T:9434) on Aug. 28, followed by the sale of chip designer Arm to  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) on Sept. 14.
A company spokeswoman declined to comment on whether SoftBank is again in a position to buy back shares.
Buybacks have been a major driver for SoftBank's shares, which climbed 160% from March lows to peak on Aug. 3 when they closed at 6,932 yen. 
The shares have since fallen around 8%, and closed flat on Tuesday. 
SoftBank previously signalled a slowdown in the pace of its remaining 1.5 trillion yen worth of planned stock repurchases.
The group has been selling assets to fund the buybacks and raise cash. SoftBank has invested in publicly traded tech stocks and, sources told Reuters, in equity derivatives. 
Executives are frustrated with SoftBank's share performance and have held early stage talks on taking the group private, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's H&M (ST:HMb), the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, beat quarterly profit forecasts as it recovered more quickly than expected from a coronavirus-induced slump, in a positive sign for the industry. 
Profit before tax for June-August, the company's third quarter, came in around 2 billion Swedish crowns ($229 million).
That was well below 5 billion crowns a year earlier, but much higher than analysts' mean forecast of 191 million crowns, according to Refinitiv's SmartEstimate model, which is weighted towards more recent estimates and higher-ranked analysts.
""H&M group's recovery is better than expected,"" the company said in a statement on Tuesday. ""More full-price sales combined with strong cost control enabled the company to already turn to profit in the third quarter.""
Sales fell 19% to 50.9 billion crowns, against expectations for an 18% drop. In local currencies, the fall was 16%.
""Very good news and well above consensus,"" said Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) analyst Anne Critchlow of the third-quarter profits.
She has a 'hold' rating on the shares, which were up 11% in early trade, reducing their year-to-date decline to 16%. 
Shortly after company veteran Helena Helmersson replaced the grandson of H&M's founder as CEO in January, the pandemic slammed H&M, pushing it into a deep loss in the March-May quarter as sales halved.
The company, which will publish its full quarterly report on Oct. 1, has been cutting staff, opening fewer new stores than planned and permanently closing others to cut costs. 
""After its Q2 results, management warned that increased markdowns would hamper its earnings by around 2-3%-points, but this now appears to have reversed to a slight positive effect,"" analysts at Carnegie said in a note.
Analysts have been warning it will take time for fashion retailers' sales to recover to pre-pandemic levels, and recent signs of second waves of COVID-19 infections in some countries have added to the uncertainty.
RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain, with a 'sector perform' rating on H&M, said H&M's profit improvement augured well. 
""We think most of this can be sustained going forward and expect consensus profit before tax upgrades for 2021-22 in the range of 5-10% following today. We also think this is a positive read for the apparel sector in general, eg, (Primark owner) ABF (L:ABF),  Inditex  and  Next ,"" he said.
H&M's biggest rival, Zara owner Inditex (MC:ITX), will report May-July results on Wednesday. Britain's Next (L:NXT) and John Lewis report on Thursday.

Flipkart, Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Indian unit and  Reliance Industries  Ltd's (NS:RELI) fledgling e-commerce business are vying for a share of the booming online retail market, which received a big boost from the COVID-19 pandemic as more Indians used their smartphones to shop for groceries and other items.

The company said it would also sign up more than 50,000 kiranas, or small grocery stores, for last-mile delivery.

Consumers have suffered from a string of financial scandals going back decades, from endowment mortgages to pensions and the sale of payment protection insurance, costing banks billions of pounds in compensation and raising questions about the competence of regulators.
The FCA has issued a ""call for input to help it decide how existing rules can address such ""harms"" and identify where other authorities could help, or if the government should consider extra powers for the watchdog.
""The consumer investment market is not working as well as it should,"" said Christopher Woolard, the FCA's interim chief executive.
""There have been too many scams and scandals and too often consumers are offered unsuitable products or advice. As a result, many consumers lack confidence in the investment market.""

U.S. retail sales are expected to inch up 1% to 1.5% to as much as $1.15 trillion between November and January, led by a 25% to 35% rise in e-commerce sales, the consultancy firm said. 
While the overall rise in sales would be slower than previous years, Deloitte's U.S. retail and distribution leader Rod Sides said a surprise increase in back-to-school spending and higher savings rates than last year showed demand could be strong between Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
""We don't see many of the higher and upper middle income folks being impacted by job losses, so we think for that group holiday sales go up as much as 2% to 3%,"" Sides said.
Purchasing among lower income households will likely be flat to up just 1%, as the coronavirus lingers and the health crisis related government spending dries up.
Brick-and-mortar sales could fall as much as 3.4%. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, has shown signs of recovery, but July figures were still about 4.6% below February levels.
Big box chains are expected gain the most in the holidays as consumers consolidate shopping trips, Sides said, while independent main street stores could struggle. 
Walmart (N:WMT),  Target  (N:TGT) and  Home Depot  (N:HD) have already seen their sales surge during the pandemic as revenue from their websites and apps showed unprecedented growth. But analysts said their supply chains could come under immense stress during the holidays. 
Holiday sales last season rose 4.1%, compared to Deloitte's estimated 4.5% to 5% increase.

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) said on Tuesday it would develop a regional hub for Southeast Asia in Singapore, opening a new office and becoming the latest Chinese tech firm to invest in the city-state.
The new hub comes on the heels of a planned expansion by TikTok owner ByteDance and investment by  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) as firms look to deepen their exposure to fast-growing Southeast Asia - home to about 650 million people.
Singapore has also gained fresh appeal as a base for Chinese corporate operations, benefiting from the political tensions that have rocked rival hub Hong Kong and growing distrust of China in the United States and other parts of the world.
Tencent will develop a full-scale comprehensive hub in Singapore that will house its international game publishing business, said a source with knowledge of the matter, who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
Tencent did not disclose further details of the office.
The plans highlight Tencent's international ambitions despite setbacks in India where some of its apps have been banned and in the United States which has flagged an imminent ban on U.S. transactions relating to its WeChat messaging app.
""We view Tencent's decision as a necessary step to extend its enterprise service offering (Tencent's cloud computing business) to this new market,"" said Alex Liu, an analyst with China Renaissance.
He also noted Tencent had several minority investments in Southeast Asia such as its stake in Singapore online gaming and e-commerce firm Sea Ltd (N:SE), and has been making deeper forays into the region's gaming market.
Offering lucrative grants and incentives, Singapore has been ramping up its efforts to lure tech firms and investors in recent years. Ethnic Chinese also make up a majority of Singapore's population and Mandarin is widely spoken, making it one of the most popular locations for Chinese firms looking to expand overseas.
ByteDance, whose short-form video app TikTok has also been deemed a national security risk by the Trump administration, plans to invest billions of dollars and recruit hundreds of employees in Singapore after opting to base its Southeast Asia regional headquarters there, according to a source.
Alibaba, which owns Singapore-based e-commerce firm Lazada, this year bought a 50% stake in a Singapore office tower. It is in talks to invest $3 billion in Grab Holdings Inc, Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing firm and Singapore's most-prized tech firm, Bloomberg news agency has reported.
In addition to the Chinese investments, America's  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) has recently opened a new data centre in Singapore.

Britain's largest pizza delivery chain also said it was launching over 1,000 work placements for young people as part of a government scheme to boost employment in a COVID-19 hit economy.
These new roles are on top of the 6,000 jobs the company has created since the start of the pandemic, Domino's said.
""Together, these over 6,000 new roles will help Domino's continue to safely serve our local communities as we head towards the busy festive period,"" Chief Executive Officer Dominic Paul said.
The lockdown led to more Britons ordering in, but Domino's had to re-think operations, rationalise its menu, close restaurants during restocking and implement contact-free, hygienic deliveries, it said last month.
At a time when companies including high-street retailers, hotels and airlines have laid off tens of thousands of workers to cut costs, some sectors like UK supermarkets have had to take on additional staff to deal with more demand for deliveries and groceries at home.

Britain's largest supermarket  Tesco  (L:TSCO) said last month it would create an additional 16,000 permanent jobs, while discount supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl said they would create an additional 1,200 and 1,000 jobs respectively this year.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed on Tuesday, with better-than-expected economic numbers helping the U.K. market outperform ahead of key central bank meetings.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.2% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.3%.
Economic data from the U.K. wasn’t especially positive, but while the country's unemployment rate rose for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown began in March there was a less severe fall in employment than feared.
Additionally, British grocery sales rose by 5.3% year-on-year in the four weeks to Sept. 5, boosted by households working from home during the coronavirus pandemic. The signs that consumer spending is still skewed by the pandemic were also evident in results from Ocado (LON:OCDO), which climbed 6.2% after it said revenue from its joint venture Ocado Retail was boosted in its third quarter by a continued shift to online grocery in the U.K. Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY), Ocado’s partner in its joint venture, also climbed 4.8%, amid signs that Ocado's customers preferred M&S's product range to that of Waitrose, its former partner.
Elsewhere in corporate news, H & M (ST:HMb) stock soared 11% after the world's second-biggest fashion retailer reported a strong third-quarter profit, saying its recovery from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic was better than expected in the three months through August.
Earlier Tuesday, data showed continued progress in China's economic recovery in August, with retail sales increasing 0.5% year-on-year and industrial production increasing 5.6% year-on-year. Both figures beat expectations, with retail sales notably reporting their first increase in 2020.
The European data calendar delivered an expected collapse in French consumer price inflation to 0.2%, while Italian inflation fell to -0.5% on the year. The German ZEW business sentiment survey is due at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT).
Both sets of data are likely to be overshadowed by the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting which starts later on Tuesday, the first since unveiling a landmark shift to a more tolerant stance on inflation in August.
The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England announce their respective policy decisions on Thursday.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, weighed by worries about the outlook for global fuel demand ahead of a meeting later this week of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+.

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 02:05AM ET</span>",Fee bonanza on China's STAR Market IPOs passes by Western banks,"By Scott Murdoch and Samuel Shen
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A fee bonanza on China's Nasdaq-style STAR Market, which is set to surge with Ant Group's mega-listing, is passing Western banks by due to their limited local presence and worries about a unique co-investment rule for managing IPOs.
Chinese financial technology giant Ant plans to raise more funds on the year-old STAR than in Hong Kong as part of its up to $30 billion dual-listing, sources have told Reuters.
Regulators dictate lead underwriters for STAR IPOs must buy 2% to 5% of stock on sale and hold it for two years, which bankers and analysts said is risky in volatile financial markets and at a time when many banks face capital pressure.
Companies raised $10.3 billion via initial public offerings (IPOs) over January-July on the STAR Market, making it the second-biggest market globally, showed Refinitiv data, behind Nasdaq but ahead of Shanghai's main board and Hong Kong.
""That's a lot of risk you're holding and that can either work out very well or not,"" said an investment banker at a U.S. firm in Hong Kong when asked about the co-investing requirement.
The co-investment rules are aimed at discouraging underwriters from setting IPO prices too high as they need to put some of their money at stake, said the China Securities Regulatory Commission when the STAR Market was launched in 2019.
For the STAR tranche of Ant's IPO, China International Capital Corp Ltd (HK:3908) and China Securities Co Ltd (HK:6066) are sponsors - the most senior role in an IPO.
Not all Western banks have Chinese underwriting licences, and they struggle to compete with local rivals due to limited securities distribution networks. This could change as China opens up its financial sector, allowing for expansion.
""Chinese banks have led the majority of deals to date although we are beginning to see increased participation from international banks on certain deals,"" said analyst Alex Owen at banking data provider Coalition.
LUCRATIVE FEES
All but three of the STAR Market's 177 listings - raising $38 billion - have been led by mainland Chinese banks.
UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) is the only Western bank to be sole sponsor when it led a $224 million listing in October. Zhong De, a venture between  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and Shanxi Securities Co Ltd (SZ:002500), was sole sponsor of two deals last year.
For those underwriters willing to take the risk, rewards could be lucrative.
Equity offerings at the STAR Market have paid an average of nearly 6% in fees to investment banks in the year since launching, showed Dealogic figures, versus 5.3% for Nasdaq and just 2.4% for Hong Kong.
The global average for IPO fees so far in 2020, said Dealogic, is 4%.
STAR's higher fees reflects challenges Chinese bankers face in pricing innovative tech start-ups under a revamped IPO system, analysts said.
Before STAR, regulators capped IPO prices, which, analysts said, made bankers' jobs less complicated.

""Bankers need to set prices themselves, have more expertise, and shoulder more responsibility, so naturally, the fee ratio is higher,"" said analyst Li Xingjin at Capital Securities in Beijing.

The city will provide more information about another round of stimulus spending at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a weekly briefing before a meeting of her advisory Executive Council.
The fresh funding would add to nearly HK$290 billion ($37 billion) in direct Covid-19-related relief measures since the pandemic began, including cash handouts, tax relief, industry subsidies and funding for hospitals and other virus control measures.
Hong Kong’s economy has been battered by repeated setbacks over the past year from the U.S.-China trade war and anti-government protests. The virus has only further devastated the city’s tourism, retail, food and beverage and hospitality sectors. In mid-August, the government revised its 2020 economic forecast to a record low range of -6% to -8%.

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 09:35PM ET</span>","Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis shakes up senior ranks, hires from BlackRock","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Influential proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Monday said it is replacing its head of research and head of sales with two outsiders, marking another shakeup in its top ranks one year after its chief executive officer left.
Eric Shostal joins the San Francisco-headquartered firm as senior vice president of research and engagement, and Aaron Bertinetti, an eight-year Glass Lewis veteran who had been global head of research, said he will leave the firm.
Glass Lewis helps shape the outcomes of major corporate ballots and provides global governance services.
Shostal most recently worked at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) in its investment stewardship group which determines how the mutual fund giant casts its votes in corporate elections.
Glass Lewis also hired Dan Concannon as chief commercial officer where he will oversee the company's worldwide sales functions. He most recently worked at Concannon Consulting.
Both Concannon and Shostal once worked at Institutional Shareholder Services, Glass Lewis' larger and more powerful competitor.
""Dan and Eric have deep experience in ESG (environmental, social and governance) and shareholder engagement within the institutional investment community. We are thrilled to bring their leadership and expertise to Glass Lewis to meet the evolving needs of our clients,"" John Wieck, Glass Lewis' chief operating officer, said in a statement.
The shakeup comes exactly a year after Katherine ""KT (NYSE:KT)"" Rabin stepped down as chief executive officer at a time Glass Lewis was facing increasing competition from its main rival and increased regulatory oversight by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 08:50PM ET</span>",Mexico issues 'world's first' sovereign bond linked to U.N. sustainability goals,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico on Monday issued what it described as the world's first sovereign bond linked to the sustainability development goals set by the United Nations, raising 750 million euros ($889.73 million).
Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said reducing inequality, financial inclusion and the gender gap were among the U.N. goals. 
""Mexico is the first country to issue a sovereign bond that is linked to the sustainable development objectives of the U.N.,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Our country starts its sustainable finance program as a pioneer.""
The government did not specify how it would spend the money raised. The bond's preliminary investment prospectus cautioned that there was no guarantee Mexico would make disbursements for projects that meet the U.N. characteristics.
The bond is part of an emerging trend of debt issuance aimed at raising funds that attempt to tackle social, environmental and other issues. It was more than six times oversubscribed.
The coupon of 1.350% was the second lowest among all euro-denominated bonds issued by the Mexico federal government, the ministry said, allowing the government to borrow at an attractive rate. The bond matures in September 2027.
The Finance Ministry added that the euro bond allowed Mexico to tap into international investment funds, many of them in Europe, that are committed to financing sustainable economic development.
Mexico presented a tight budget last week that envisages cuts to most sectors. 
Areas that locked in additional funds included health. A draft circulated by members of Congress also appeared to outline a slight increase in real terms for national oil company Petroleos Mexicanos over its planned 2020 budget.

It also detailed some $2 billion for the construction of Dos Bocas, a new oil refinery.

Farmer, 50, has worked at BNSF for 28 years, most recently as executive vice president of operations.
She will succeed Carl Ice, who is retiring after 42 years at the company, on Jan. 1, 2021. Both will remain on the railroad's board of directors.
""Carl has been critical to BNSF's success for a very long time. I thank him for his leadership and his accomplishments,"" Buffett said in a statement. ""We look forward to Katie's leadership and more success. She possesses all of the qualities that make us excited about the future.""
BNSF is one of Berkshire's biggest units, generating $5.48 billion, or 23%, of its operating profit and about 9% of its revenue in 2019.
In the second quarter, profit fell 15% and revenue fell 22% from a year earlier, as the coronavirus pandemic hurt shipping volumes.
Berkshire acquired BNSF in 2010, paying $26.5 billion for the 77.4% it did not already own. It was at the time Buffett's largest acquisition.
Farmer's promotion is the latest in a series of high-level changes at Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, which had long been overseen by Buffett, 90, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96.
In 2018, Berkshire tapped Greg Abel and Ajit Jain as vice chairman, making them top candidates to eventually succeed Buffett as CEO.
They oversee Berkshire's dozens of operating businesses, with Abel overseeing BNSF.

Last December, Berkshire tapped Todd Combs, one of Buffett's portfolio managers, to run the Geico auto insurer, giving him experience managing a business as well as money.

LONDON, Sep 15 (Reuters) - Taxi app Uber (NYSE:UBER) will battle in court on Tuesday to win back its licence to operate in London after the city's transport regulator removed it over safety concerns.
Transport for London (TfL) refused in 2019 to grant the Silicon Valley-based company a new licence due to what it called a ""pattern of failures"" on safety and security, including on driver identification. 
Uber, which was also denied a licence by TfL in 2017 before a judge restored it on a probationary basis, has made changes to its business model so it can keep operating in one of its most important markets. 
“We have worked hard to address TfL’s concerns over the last few months, rolled out real time ID checks for drivers, and are committed to keeping people moving safely around the city,"" said its Northern and Eastern Europe boss Jamie Heywood.
TfL said in November 2019 that unauthorised drivers were able to upload their photos to other Uber accounts, resulting in at least 14,000 trips where drivers other than those advertised picked up passengers.
Deputy Senior District Judge Tan Ikram will preside over the hearings at Westminster Magistrates' Court from Tuesday until Thursday. 
Uber's 45,000 drivers in London are still able to operate until the appeals process is exhausted, which could go on for several more months or years depending on when a decision is made and any further legal action.
The Silicon Valley company has run into regulatory barriers and a backlash in other countries, forcing it to withdraw from some markets.

In London, traditional black cab drivers who see Uber as a threat to their livelihoods have blocked streets in protest. Their trade body, the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association, is also part of the court case.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 05:15PM ET</span>","Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot maker PSA revise merger terms due to COVID-19 crisis","PARIS (Reuters) -  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) said on Monday they had restructured the terms of their planned merger to conserve cash, and also stepped up the promised levels of cost cutting during the continuing pandemic. 
The two companies, which are set to merge into Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker, said in a joint statement that FCA (MI:FCHA) would cut to 2.9 billion euros ($3.4 billion) the cash portion of a 5.5 billion euro special dividend its shareholders will receive under the terms of the accord they signed last year.
France's PSA, whose brand portfolio also includes Citroen and Opel, in turn, will postpone after the merger's closing the planned spinoff of its 46% stake in parts maker  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) to all shareholders of the new group.
Faurecia's market capitalisation amounts to around 5.9 billion euros.
""Amendments preserve the balance of original combination agreement,"" the two groups said.
A source said on Monday that the aim of those changes was to reinforce the balance-sheet structure of both companies after the COVID-19 crisis and ensure that the merger plan is concluded as soon as possible. 
Analysts had argued that such a large cash payout to FCA shareholders, led by controlling investor  EXOR  (MI:EXOR), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, could weaken the new carmaker's finances, as the auto industry was paying a high price for the coronavirus outbreak this year.
Confirming last week that the deal was on track, FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley said both he and PSA CEO Carlos Tavares were aware of the need for the two firms to get to the merger with the strongest balance sheet possible as well as for shareholders to get what they expected.
FCA and PSA said annual estimated synergies from their merger were now seen over 5 billion euros, compared with an initial estimate of over 3.7 billion euros.
The two carmakers confirmed that they expected to complete their tie-up process by the end of first quarter of next year.

Both carmakers earlier this year scrapped dividend payments on 2019 results, each worth 1.1 billion euros.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks surged on Monday as a wave of tech mergers lifted the sector and erased some of last week's sell-off.
Investors are awaiting the outcome of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday, when we will hear an update on the state of the economy from Chair Jerome Powell.
Big tech stocks rebounded after a flurry of weekend deals. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is on board to partner with the U.S. TikTok, just before President Donald Trump's deadline to sever the popular social media app from its Chinese owner. Chip maker Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)also bounced on a deal for the chip licensing company ARM Holdings (LON:ARM).
This week features a dozen stock debuts in the biggest IPO rollout since last year. Earnings from Fed Ex and Adobe are also on tap, and Kraft Heinz updates investors on its outlook.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow
1. IPOs galore this week, including the biggest deal of the year so far
It's the biggest week for new stock debuts since Uber (NYSE:UBER) listed in May 2019. Twelve deals are lined up this week, including the highly anticipated IPO of software maker Snowflake.
In fact, according to IPO tracker Renaissance Capital, Snowflake will be the largest software IPO ever, twice as big as the 2007 listing of VMware Inc (NYSE:VMW).
Snowflake raised its price range on Monday to $100 to $110 from an earlier range of $75 to $85, an indication of strong investor interest. It plans to offer 28 million shares in the $3 billion offering, the biggest deal of the year so far.
2. Earnings from two companies aided by the pandemic shutdowns
The pandemic and troubles at the U.S. Postal Service are expected to give a boost to package shipping giant FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect earnings per share of $2.65 on revenue of $17.5 billion. The EPS target would be down from $3.05 last year, but e-commerce trends point to a favorable fall for the company.
FedEx shares are up more than 54% this year and rose slightly on Monday to a new 52-week high ahead of the release of earnings on Tuesday morning.
Software maker Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) is also on deck for earnings. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect EPS of $2.41 on revenue of $3.2 billion. Its shares are up 47% this year and hit a 52-week high earlier this month.
The increased number of people working from home is boosting demand for Adobe's Acrobat and Sign products, analysts noted.
3. Investors to hear what's next for Kraft Heinz
Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC) scheduled an investor meeting for Tuesday. Expect an update on new direction for the company, which has struggled with sales in the last few years. Competition against cheaper store brands is a challenge. Some analysts expect to hear about how Kraft intends to manage brands like Maxwell House and Ore-Ida, which trail private label brands, with an eye to a potential sale of underperforming units as the company streamlines.
Kraft is one of Warren Buffett's biggest holdings through his conglomerate  Berkshire Hathaway  B (NYSE:BRKb). The shares are down 0.9% so far this year.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine trial remains on hold in the United States pending a U.S. investigation into a serious side effect in Britain even as other trials of the vaccine resume, sources familiar with the details told Reuters. 
AstraZeneca on Saturday said it had restarted its trial in Britain after regulators completed their review of a serious side effect in one trial participant there.
This was the first indication that the U.S. trial will remain on hold until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and a safety panel investigate the case.
Enrollment in the company's global trials of the vaccine, which it is developing with researchers at Oxford University, was put on pause on Sept. 6.
Sources told Reuters that enrollment of new patients and other trial procedures for the pivotal U.S. trial were being rescheduled until at least midweek and that it was not clear how long it would take for the FDA to complete its probe.
Governments around the world are desperate for a vaccine to help end the pandemic, which has caused more than 900,000 deaths and global economic turmoil. The World Health Organization (WHO) had flagged AstraZeneca's as the most promising. A prolonged delay in the U.S. trial could slow access to the vaccine in the United States.
The British adverse event involved a study patient thought to be suffering a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.
An AstraZeneca spokeswoman declined to comment on when the U.S. trial would resume. She said in an email the company ""will continue to work with health authorities across the world, including the FDA, and be guided as to when other clinical trials can resume.""
The status of the South African and Indian trials remains unknown, but the trial in Brazil has also restarted. The company has not commented on timing of resumption in other parts of the world besides Britain.

FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dimon made the comments on Friday to stock analyst Brian Kleinhanzl of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, who wrote about their meeting in a report.
Dimon added that earlier government stimulus had delayed the full effects of the recession. As it hits, customers who have borrowed from the banks will feel the impact, the note said.
Consumers are spending less. ""Based on their data it is unclear if that trend is getting better or worse,"" Kleinhanzl wrote.
JPMorgan is largest U.S. bank by assets and estimates spending trends from transactions through accounts in its 4,900 branches and its credit card businesses.
Dimon also said that having employees work from home during the pandemic has hurt overall productivity and reduced what he called the ""creative combustion"" that happens more in offices, Kleinhanzl wrote.
JPMorgan is moving to people back into the office safely, Dimon said.

(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday cleared the way for New York state to collect about $200 million from drug manufacturers and distributors by imposing a surcharge on them to defray the costs of combating the opioid addiction epidemic.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled a lower-court judge lacked authority to strike down the requirement that the companies collectively pay $100 million annually because it was tax rather than a regulatory fee or a punitive fine.
Industry trade group Healthcare Distribution Alliance, which along with the Association for Accessible Medicines and drugmaker  Mallinckrodt  (NYSE:MNK) Plc challenged the law in court, called the ruling disappointing. AAM said it was reviewing it.
The payments were owed under the Opioid Stewardship Act, which Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law in 2018 to address the costs the U.S. opioid addiction epidemic imposed on the state.
The law marked the first time a state had sought to impose a tax or fee related to the epidemic on opioid manufacturers and distributors. Delaware and Minnesota have since adopted their own taxes and other states have considered similar legislation.
The New York law envisioned collecting $100 million annually from manufacturers and distributors of prescription painkillers based on their market share. Distributor AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp, for example, has set aside $22 million to cover potential payments.
A federal judge in 2018 ruled that a provision barring the companies from passing on the costs of making the payments to consumers was unconstitutional and could not be severed from the rest of the law.
Following that ruling, New York enacted a new tax law that did not include the pass-through prohibition. The state consequently only revived the rest of the law, allowing it to collect $200 million based on 2017 and 2018 market shares.

He added: ""Free cash flow has also been strong and our confidence in positive industry trends has increased.""This month, the company will use operating cash flow to repay a $200 million 364-day incremental term loan closed in the second quarter, resulting in an annual interest savings of approximately $5 million.

International accounting rules applied in Britain were endorsed by the European Union for use in listed company financial statements.
After the end of Brexit transition arrangements in December, Britain will endorse the international standards itself.
""Effective international accounting standards support vital global investment,"" Martin Callanan, Britain's minister for corporate responsibility, said in a statement on Monday.
Wallace has over 30 years' experience in the development of accounting standards as a partner at PwC, one of the world's Big Four auditors.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",Former Nissan executive Kelly's trial to start in Tokyo without Ghosn,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) executive Greg Kelly goes on trial in Tokyo on Tuesday, almost two years after prosecutors charged the American lawyer with helping his ex-boss, Carlos Ghosn, hide his earnings.
Kelly, who has been on bail in Japan since his release from jail in 2018, denies wrongdoing. He goes to court without co-accused Ghosn, who fled to Lebanon in December, following a dramatic escape from Japan.
""I'd love to have him here to testify. I think it is a little hard for everything to come out when the main witness isn't here,"" Kelly said of Ghosn in an interview aired by Japanese broadcaster TBS on Monday. 
""I am not guilty of violating any laws in Japan.""
Kelly, who was a representative director at Nissan, has been charged with helping Ghosn hide 9.3 billion yen ($88 million) in compensation over eight years through deferred payments.
The trial, in which Nissan (T:7201) is also a defendant, could take about a year. If found guilty, Kelly could face up to 10 years in prison and a 10 million yen ($94,330) fine.
The proceedings will include evidence and testimony from some prominent company executives, including a former chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, that could shine a light on the inner workings of the Japanese automaker.
The renewed spotlight on Nissan comes as it attempts to rein in losses and revamp an aging vehicle line-up following Ghosn's departure as chief executive. The company, like other carmakers, is also struggling with a drop in demand and disruptions in production caused by the coronavirus.
Nissan has cooperated with prosecutors. It declined to comment.
The trial has also focused international attention on judicial practices that critics in Japan and overseas see as overly harsh. 
Prisoners on remand are sometimes kept in isolation and often refused bail if they deny charges brought against them. Detainees are also interrogated without a lawyer present. 
The conviction rate in Japan is about 99%.
Ghosn was smuggled out of Japan in a speaker case on a private jet as he awaited trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.
After the disappearance of the once-feted executive, Japan said it guaranteed individuals' rights and had dealt appropriately with him.
Ghosn, who also ran French carmaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), faces two separate breach of trust charges that he enriched himself at Nissan's expense through $5 million in payments to a Middle East car dealership, and that he temporarily transferred personal financial losses to his employer’s books. 

Ghosn said he was a victim of a boardroom coup by former colleagues worried he would push through a merger between Nissan and Renault, its largest shareholder.

1578,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Triple-Leveraged Nasdaq ETF Lures Record Cash Amid Retail Fervor,"(Bloomberg) -- As the crowd of day traders rushed to buy the dip, a triple-leveraged ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100 notched its best streak of inflows on record.
The $7.8 billion ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) exchange-traded fund attracted more than $1.5 billion in the past eight days, the most for such a span since it began trading in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, its non-leveraged peer Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) saw $4.8 billion in outflows last week -- the worst in more than 20 years.
Although the index faced a correction amid concerns over lofty valuations, faith in tech shares won’t be erased so easily among day traders who use leveraged products -- even as investors who are more likely to hold conventional ETFs take profits, according to Todd Rosenbluth at CFRA Research.
“Bullish sentiment toward growth and technology securities remains high, and TQQQ provides an aggressive approach to gaining short-term exposure,” said Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA
Despite TQQQ’s risks as a leveraged product, it’s become popular with day traders, who pushed volume to a record earlier this month, according to a report from Bloomberg Intelligence. The product is held by 24,000 Robinhood accounts, ranking 20th among ETFs.
“The new variable this year is the number of new, typically younger day traders who use many platforms, but are most visible on Robinhood,” Eric Balchunas, ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in the report. “These more aggressive traders prefer single-stock and 3x ETPs to vanilla ETFs or mutual funds, which are less risky.”
Day traders are likely drawn to TQQQ’s eye-popping returns. Before the Nasdaq dropped 5.2% on Sept. 3, the product had returned more than 10,000% since its creation. Even after the correction, its lifetime return is still 8,400%.
Meanwhile, the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ), which seeks investment results that correspond to three times the inverse of the daily performance of the Nasdaq 100, posted its worst week of outflows since March. That may signal some traders are abandoning bets on tech declining, according to Linda Zhang, chief executive officer of Purview Investments.

Gilead on Sunday agreed to buy the biopharmaceutical company for $21 billion and acquire all the outstanding shares of Immunomedics for $88 per share, at a premium of about 108% over Friday's closing price of $42.25.
The deal gives Gilead access to Immunomedics' cancer treatment drug, Trodelvy, which was granted an accelerated approval in April by the U.S. Food and Drug administration for an aggressive and tough-to-treat type of breast cancer.
Brokerage Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said investors may take some time to digest the deal, but it believed the deal offered a path for Gilead to quickly move into the solid tumors market. 
Brokerage Oppenheimer views the purchase price as ""reasonable"", and said the cancer drug ""slots neatly"" in Gilead's oncology strategy.

LONDON (Reuters) - France and Germany have called on the European Union to ease bank capital and bonus rules to avoid crimping the flow of credit to an economy trying to recover from the coronavirus crisis, a paper seen by Reuters showed.
World leaders agreed a package of capital requirements after banks had to be shored up by taxpayers in the financial crisis a decade ago and the EU is now putting into law final elements of what is known as the Basel III accord.
It is also reviewing other EU banking rules to help banks continue lending to companies which have been hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
In a paper to other EU states, finance ministry officials from France and Germany suggest ""avenues"" on how to ""faithfully"" implement the package while ensuring loans flow uninterruptedly, and that variety in size of banks in Europe is acknowledged.
Basel introduces a ""floor"" or level of capital below which a bank cannot go to cover risks from loans on its books.
France and Germany say in the paper that the floor should in the main only relate to risk-based capital requirements.
Under the new rules, banks would have to apply a flat risk weighting of 100% of capital on loans to companies which are not given a score by credit rating agencies, something that poses ""serious risks"" to financing the economy, the paper said.
Unlike other parts of the world, almost 75% of company exposures are unrated in Europe.
The EU should opt for a ""hybrid approach"" that would allow banks to cut the risk weighting to 65% for financially sound companies, the paper said.
Disclosure requirements for small and non-complex banks should be further reduced to cut costs, it added.
Under EU rules, banks pay a portion of a bonus upfront in cash, with the rest deferred over several years and paid in shares.
""Requirements on variable remuneration should not apply to small and non-complex banks where the share of variable remuneration is sufficiently low,"" it added.
The definition of a non-complex and small bank should exclude derivatives contracts concluded on behalf of customers to hedge risks and not for speculation, it said.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",Nvidia acquisition of Arm throws company into tech spat between U.S. and China,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp's $40 billion acquisition of chip designer Arm is set to catapult it into the fray of geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, analysts and lawyers say.
Arm's blueprints for powering chipsets are a critical component for many Chinese smartphone makers and AI firms and China is expected to take a dim view of an American company having so much sway in an industry it has prioritised in its battle for tech supremacy with the United States.
""Anything that creates more concentration in the industry to the benefit of a U.S. company, I would think that's not aligned with what China wants, said Art Dicker, director at Shanghai-based R&P China Lawyers.
China's State Administration for Market Regulation, which has to give the go-ahead for the deal alongside other regulators globally, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Shares of Nvidia rose 7.6% on Monday following the announcement. 
Stewart Randall, who tracks China's chip sector at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink, said that the acquisition, one of the largest semiconductor takeovers ever, will prompt many Chinese chipmakers to look for and develop alternatives to Arm, which is being sold by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp.
However, while a handful of options exist such as other open-source technologies RISC-V and MIPS, most cannot currently compete with Arm's mature ecosystem, tech experts say.
An executive from one Chinese startup said it had been looking at moving away from Arm for some time but considered it too much trouble. Now, he said, they plan to accelerate efforts.
Meanwhile, Arm's ownership by an American company also raises the possibility that Washington could place restrictions on its business in China, industry experts said. 
The chief executives of Nvidia and Arm told Reuters in an interview that Nvidia will retain Arm’s United Kingdom headquarters - which exempt it from many U.S. export control laws - and open licensing model.
Britain's government will scrutinise the deal, including what it might mean for the company's headquarters in England, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday. 
Chinese companies including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Huawei [HWT.UL] are members of the RISC-V foundation, an open-source project that originated at the University of California, Berkeley and which many experts see as a potential beneficiary of any retreat from Arm.
China's government has also been pouring money into its domestic chip sector in hopes of fostering companies that can rival giants from the United States, South Korea and Japan.
Beijing helped close a 204 billion yuan ($28.9 billion) fund last year to finance semiconductor companies, after raising a nearly 140 billion yuan fund in 2014.
CLIENTS AND COMPLICATIONS 
A key supplier to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Arm does not make chips but licenses an instruction set architecture - the most fundamental intellectual property underpinning computing chips.
According to the company's most recent public filing before it was acquired by SoftBank in 2016, it generated about one-fifth of its revenue from China, where semiconductor startups have mushroomed in recent years.
First as a publicly traded British company and then as a unit of Japan's SoftBank, Arm's ownership was not an issue for China. 
Huawei's Hisilicon chip unit used Arm designs to build its Kirin chips before Washington's trade restrictions on the Chinese company crippled the division, while Unisoc, a chipmaker owned by China's state-backed tech conglomerate Tsinghua Unigroup, counts on the company's blueprints. 
They are used too by more specialised firms such as Shenzhen Goodix Technology Co Ltd, which makes chips for the internet of things, and Horizon Robotics, a Beijing-based startup maker of automotive chips valued at $3 billion in early 2019. The two companies did not respond to a request for comment.
Smartphone brands such as Oppo and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp indirectly rely on Arm as purchasers of chips based on its designs made by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and MediaTek. Both companies declined to comment.
Further complicating the deal is a corporate dispute between Allen Wu, CEO of Arm's China JV, and the unit's parent company.
In June this year, Arm issued a statement saying that Wu had stepped down from his role, while Arm China has said Wu retains his position.
Arm and Nvidia say they are confident the dispute will be resolved quickly and will not interfere with the acquisition. Arm China declined to comment on the implications of the acquisition on its business.
Some analysts see Beijing using the uncertain status of Wu's control of the JV as leverage as it mulls approving the deal, perhaps pushing for a spinoff. 
""The deal would include 47% of Arm China, but what does that mean anymore?"" says Intralink's Randall.

""If this needs Chinese government regulatory approval, I can't see it getting it unless they get something big in return.""

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",Airbus CEO warns of compulsory layoffs as airline crisis deepens,"By Johanna Decorse and Tim Hepher
TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has stepped up warnings of compulsory layoffs as air travel fails to recover as quickly as expected from the coronavirus crisis, putting itself on a potential collision course with unions and the French government.
The warning in a letter to its 130,000 staff from Chief Executive Guillaume Faury, seen by Reuters, marks a more pessimistic tone from the planemaker, which had previously said only that it could not rule out compulsory measures.
""I owe it to you to be transparent: it's unlikely that voluntary departures will be enough,"" Faury wrote in the letter distributed on Friday evening.
Unions and the French government have urged the Toulouse-based planemaker to avoid compulsory layoffs as it sheds up to 15,000 posts to cope with plummeting travel demand.
Airbus has repeatedly warned that the outlook is uncertain as the industry's worst crisis hits aircraft deliveries and severely weakens airline finances. 
But a disappointing rise in air travel over the summer has cast a fresh pall over the company's biggest ever restructuring plans.
""Unfortunately, the recovery in airline traffic over the summer period has not been at the level the industry was counting on,"" Faury wrote.
""We must now prepare for a crisis that will probably be even deeper and longer than the previous scenarios suggested"".
The group representing most of the world's airlines, the International Air Transport Association, said last week that air traffic had failed to recover as quickly as expected during July, a key part of the peak season for airline revenues.
July traffic was down 80% compared with the same month of 2019, compared with a 94% drop at the low point in April.
IATA says inconsistent border rules are hampering the recovery, making it difficult for airlines to plan ahead.
Airbus reported solid deliveries for August, but industry sources say many aircraft are going straight into storage.
An Airbus spokesman confirmed that Faury had issued a ""general business update"" to staff.
""This is part of the constant dialogue between Airbus’ top management and employees, which is crucial in these challenging times in order to ensure transparency and share information with our global workforce,"" the spokesman said by email.
He declined further comment. 
An official with France's CGT union accused Airbus of deliberately stoking up staff anxieties ahead of further labour negotiations starting in one week.

Airbus has so far launched an internal call for voluntary departures and early retirements, in a scheme expected to run until the end of the year.

1591,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 10:47AM ET</span>","Nikola Fights Back, Shares Bounce Down, Then Up","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) offered a detailed defense against accusations of deceit in a statement on Monday.
The stock first tumbled only to reverse course, now trading up more than 4%.
Shares last week spiked after General Motors (NYSE:GM) took a stake in the electric truck maker, only to tumble after short-seller Hindenburg Research called the company a fraud. 
Nikola said Monday that the Hindenburg report was designed to provide a false impression to investors and to negatively manipulate the market in order to financially benefit short sellers, including Hindenburg itself. Nikola said the report contains false and misleading statements regarding the company’s operations and R&D efforts.
Hindenburg cited a 2017 video as showing a truck “simply filmed rolling down a big hill.” Nikola does not quite dispute that fact, and says the company ""never stated its truck was driving under its own propulsion in the video."" 
""The fact is, Nikola has real working hydrogen fuel-cell powered semi-trucks,"" Nikola said in the statement. ""Any reports intended to suggest that Nikola’s trucks do not drive are erroneous.""     
Wedbush also defended Nikola, seeing more than 50% upside, according to Seeking Alpha. That is, if the company can execute, said analyst Dan Ives.
""If Trevor and the team can successfully build out its Arizona factory, morph prototypes into models (both on Badger and trucking front), lay the groundwork for its charging network, and catalyze delivery trucking orders with an attractive gross margin structure then the opportunity for NKLA is massive and the stock will reflect this dynamic,"" said Ives, who maintained his neutral rating on the company, with a price target of $45. 
Nikola has two buy ratings, three holds and no sells, according to MarketWatch. The average target price is $53.60. The shares are currently trading around $33.80.

With an emphasis on defense, investors should consider assets that haven’t “skyrocketed on dreams of back-to-normal economic prosperity followed by even lower artificial real interest rates,” Gross, who retired last year, said in an outlook released Monday.
“There is little money to be made almost anywhere in the world -- Covid 19 vaccine or no,” wrote Gross, who co-founded Pacific Investment Management Co. and later worked for Janus Henderson Group (NYSE:JHG) Plc.
Gross favors value stocks that pay healthy dividends, and says investors should consider using leverage to amplify returns. Central banks are unlikely to raise interest rates in the foreseeable future, lowering the risk a leverage trade would backfire, Gross said in an interview on Bloomberg television Monday.
“You’ve got to lever,” he said. “You’ve got to be able to borrow.”
Much, if not all, of the fiscal stimulus that has helped to drive stocks higher and interest rates lower is over, he said in his latest outlook. The U.S. government would have to push the deficit out to around $6 trillion in future years to keep lifting markets and the economy, according to Gross.
The former fixed-income manager also predicted inflation, as monetary policy and fiscal policy have merged in the U.S.
“The Fed is the dog and the treasury is wagging it,” said Gross. “Is it inflationary? Probably yes.”

1595,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",A Quarter of ETF Portfolios Could Be Actively Managed by 2023,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. investors expect actively managed ETFs to skyrocket in popularity in the next few years, surging to more than a quarter of client allocations by 2023.
Money managers in the world’s largest exchange-traded fund market predict the share of active products in ETF portfolios will rise to 26%, up from 19% today, according to a survey by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
American respondents are more bullish on the funds than their counterparts in other regions. In Asia-Pacific, predictions are that active products will make up just 4% of allocations, while in EMEA, the figure is 21%.
One thing they all agree on: Passive funds will face increasing competition from both active and smart-beta strategies. The share of index-tracking ETFs globally will shrink to 61% of portfolios by 2023 from the current 69%, respondents to the survey predict.
“Active ETFs give clients a tremendous set of new opportunities to tap into, so we’re at the very beginning,” Olivier Paquier, head of ETF distribution in EMEA at JPM AM, said by phone. The appetite for asset classes beyond equities “will also dilute the very high portion of passively managed ETFs,” he said.
The JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income fund, ticker JPST, recently surpassed the long-reigning PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity Active product, ticker MINT, as the largest active ETF in the world.
Global asset managers and other finance professionals cited appetite for achieving specific investment objectives, like sustainable investing, as the key reasons for the projected rise in popularity of active ETFs. The survey took place in late March through early April and included 320 professional investors around the world, with average assets under management of $31.8 billion.
Active ETFs will get a boost from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of so-called non-transparent ETFs, according to Athanasios Psarofagis, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. Such structures allow fund managers to shield their strategies from copycats.
“We will see a big uptick in launches and more of the asset managers who were holding out to now jump in,” Psarofagis said by email.
However, active ETFs face heated competition from smart-beta strategies, he added.
The survey’s Asia-Pacific and EMEA-based respondents said they expect smart-beta products to grow faster than active ETFs in their regions.

1596,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>","Stocks Open Higher on Vaccine Optimism, M&A Fever; Dow up 335 Points","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply higher on Monday, as encouraging newsflow over the weekend on the hunt for a vaccine to treat the Covid-19 virus helped to restore confidence in the ability of the market to bounce from last week's setback. 
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 335 points, or 1.2% at 28,001 points, while the S&P 500 was up 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.2%. The corrections in both of the latter indexes had stopped on Friday more or less in line with their respective 50-day moving averages, a development that leaves them well placed to rebound this week, according to some technical analysts.
Last week had been the worst since March for the major boards, but the weekend brought some relief, as  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) CEO Albert Bourla told CBS that the company's vaccine could be ready for distribution within the U.S. by the end of the year. Pfizer stock was up 1.3%, while the stock of its partner in Covid vaccine development, German-based Biontech (NASDAQ:BNTX), was up 4.8%.  
The market was also supported by the news of some big acquisitions over the weekend, with chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stock rising 8.1% on the back of its $40 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of U.K. chip designer ARM from Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), and  Immunomedics  (NASDAQ:IMMU) stock more than doubling after Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) offered to pay $21 billion for the biotech company. 
The Nvidia acquisition would transform it into a global leader in chipset design. For that reason, the Chinese-based Global Times argued on Monday that Beijing could be inclined to refuse antitrust clearance, fearing that Huawei would no longer have access to ARM's designs. 
More positively for broader market sentiment, the dispute over Chinese video-streaming service TikTok appears to be nearing a resolution, after Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) confirmed it had been chosen by TikTok's owner ByteDance to be the service's 'trusted technology partner' in the U.S., edging out Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).  Oracle stock rose 4.8%, while Microsoft stock rose 1.7%. 
Among the losers were - once again - oil and gas stocks, as crude prices extended last week's decline in response to a gloomier forecast from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC's monthly oil market report revised down its forecast for global oil demand to by an average of 400,000 barrels a day to 90.2 million b/d, and also warned that it expects the weakness in Asian demand to last through the first half of 2021. Even more alarmingly. U.K. oil major updated its long-term forecasts to reflect its assumption that global oil demand will peak much earlier than previously reckoned. BP (NYSE:BP)'s latest energy outlook assumes global demand will plateau by the middle of the current decade before going into long-term decline as alternative energy sources displace it.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 0.4% while Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock fell 2.2%.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said on Monday it is seeking to raise $6.5 billion through new bonds and loans backed by its SkyMiles loyalty program, further bolstering liquidity to weather a drastic downturn in travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Atlanta-based Delta said it has parked about 40% of its fleet and cut its capacity by about 60% in the September quarter from last year as it continues to burn through $27 million in cash each day.
U.S. airlines have cut costs and raised debt to survive what they call an unprecedented industry crisis. Travel demand is hovering around 30% of last year's levels and the situation is not expected to improve until there is a meaningful recovery in demand.
With its latest financing deal, Delta said it will not pursue a $4.6 billion federal loan available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, although it continues to lobby for a second round of federal payroll grants. 
Delta is among U.S. airlines to have tapped funds under a $25 billion made available primarily in grants under the CARES Act to cover employees' payroll through September, but not a separate $25 billion package in secured loans.
The loan program has attractive financing terms but restricts executive compensation and share buybacks.
The airline has said it could furlough nearly 2,000 pilots in October without more federal aid, but believes it can avoid any flight attendant furloughs through the winter thanks to strong demand for voluntary departures or leaves. 
Delta had $15.7 billion in liquidity at the end of June, which it said equaled about 19 months of financial runway at a daily burn rate of $27 million.
It still has unencumbered assets worth $6 billion to $7 billion, primarily in the form of spare aircraft parts and engines, if needed, officials said.
Delta did not disclose the value of the loyalty program, or the terms of the new financing, which mirrors a debt deal by United Airlines (O:UAL) in June backed by its $20 billion MileagePlus program.

Delta's shares, which have lost about 46% this year, closed at $31.70 on Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) investors were disappointed after the company was snubbed in the S&P 500's latest round of inclusions, but the electric automaker's entry could still happen at any time and a merger by others in the benchmark index might help.
Merger activity within the S&P 500 (SPX) has historically been the biggest reason companies leave the index, and could provide an opening for a company like Tesla, said two sources familiar with how the committee has made decisions. 
While some in the market have questioned the quality of Tesla's earnings, it was still widely expected to gain entry to the benchmark.
""It will go into the S&P. There's no way it cannot at some point,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Maybe it's in the penalty box right now while they just assess the situation."" 
While Tesla's valuation ""seems absolutely crazy"" the company cannot be ignored, he added. 
A spokesman for S&P declined to comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Picking which companies make it in the S&P 500 is part science, part art. There are formal criteria a company is expected to meet, around things like profitability, share float and market capitalization, but the index committee has leeway in deciding who makes the cut. 
The S&P 500's aim is not to beat the market, but to emulate the performance of its 11 sectors, as well the 156 sub-industries within those sectors. 
Tesla, as an automaker, is part of the consumer discretionary sector, which currently has an 11.4% weighting in the index. That sector also includes companies like retailers, home builders and restaurants.
The index committee aims to pick the companies that best represent their industries, while keeping the weighting of the sector in check against the others, which include information technology, health care, and financials, so the index's performance matches that of the overall market, one source said.
Mergers among companies in the index give committee members - the names of whom S&P does not make public - additional opportunities to readjust weightings based on the ever-changing dynamic of the market.
Tesla's shares, for instance, have skyrocketted more than 300% this year, making it the world's most valuable automaker, and changing the entire sector's footprint. Since the S&P's latest index decision, Tesla stock is down more than 10%. 
When Tesla in July reported its fourth-straight quarterly profit, one condition for S&P 500 entry, many investors believed it was destined for admission, helping fuel the rally in the company's shares.
But Tesla was not on the list of new additions announced Sept. 4 ahead of the index's quarterly rebalancing on Sept. 18.
The committee's decision ""can only have come from a collective and committed view that (Tesla) is profoundly over-valued and sits on shakier fundamentals than its mega market cap indicates,"" said DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas.
Still, he said he was ""surprised"" Tesla was not admitted.
The omission came as Tesla's latest earnings showed the sale of emissions credits to other carmakers helped make up for losses in its core autos business.
At any moment there are 25 to 50 companies that technically qualify to be in the index, but are not in, and a handful of those are companies the committee agrees are acceptable candidates when discussed in its monthly meetings, one source said.
With a big name like Tesla, it is tempting to look for a big exit from the index, the person said, adding that the committee tracks announced mergers, which are opportunities to make unscheduled additions.

The deal vaults Nvidia into the very top echelon of the world's chip suppliers and its stock, which has more than doubled this year, gained 5.8% to $514.9 in early trading.
Shares in SoftBank, under pressure for months after a torrid year dominated by the troubles of its WeWork shared office venture, jumped 10%.
A host of analysts were quick to flag significant regulatory hurdles including from China for the buyout, which is seen to have big implications for the global semiconductor landscape.
""Although Nvidia had success in attaining regulatory approval from China for its Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) acquisition earlier in 2020, the magnitude and significance of this potential deal will undergo heightened scrutiny,"" Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri wrote.
The sale puts a vital supplier to Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and others across the industry under the control of a single player and faces likely pushback from regulators and rivals to Nvidia, the biggest U.S. chip company by market capitalisation.

While analysts pointed out that the deal may pose a significant threat to Nvidia's data center peers  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD), shares of the rival chip firms were little moved premarket.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>","U.S., California to unveil Daimler diesel emissions settlement: sources","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. and California officials will on Monday disclose the terms of  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s $1.5 billion settlement to resolve a long-running government investigation into its use of software to cheat diesel emissions tests, four people briefed on the matter told Reuters.
The German automaker and parent of Mercedes-Benz disclosed on Aug. 13 it had reached a settlement in principle resolving civil and environmental claims tied to 250,000 U.S. diesel cars and vans.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) said in August expected costs of settlements with U.S. authorities would total $1.5 billion, settling with owners will cost about $700 million and also disclosed ""further expenses of a mid three-digit-million EUR (euro) amount to fulfill requirements of the settlements.""
The U.S. Justice Department, Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board (CARB) will unveil details of the settlements Monday that will require Daimler to address the vehicles' excess emissions as part of binding consent decrees that must be approved by a U.S. judge.
The settlement includes one of the highest civil penalties ever levied under the Clean Air Act, sources said, and will label Daimler's diesel software ""defeat devices"" used to evade emissions tests.
It will also include a separate Customs and Border Protection civil penalty to resolve allegations of illegally importing noncompliant vehicles.
Daimler and the EPA declined to comment, but the automaker said last month the proposed settlements are an ""important step towards legal certainty"" in the U.S. states.
Diesel vehicles have come under scrutiny in the United States since Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software on 580,000 U.S. vehicles that allowed them to emit up to 40 times legally allowable emissions.
CARB spokesman Stanley Young said on Sunday extensive testing of Daimler vehicles by California showed vehicle software detected ""whether or not the test cycle was in operation or whether it was on the road"" to evade emissions requirements. 
""The emissions system did not operate as advertised,"" Young said.
The lengthy investigation was in part to address ""what was the fix going to be,"" Young added.
In September 2019, Daimler in Germany agreed to pay a fine of 870 million euros ($1 billion) for breaking diesel emissions regulations.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in 2019 reached a settlement worth about $800 million to resolve claims by regulators and owners that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests. 
Fiat Chrysler said in July it was in talks to resolve an ongoing Justice Department criminal probe.

1604,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",A Wall Street Giant Tapped $1.5 Billion in Federal Aid for Its Hospitals,"(Bloomberg) -- Like hospital chains across the U.S., LifePoint Health tapped federal relief money to blunt the cost of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a potent lifeline, a total of $1.5 billion.
But LifePoint is unusual in one respect, its owner: private equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), led by billionaire Leon Black. 
LifePoint was certainly eligible for the money. But the extent of the federal assistance could contribute to concern in Washington over whether private equity-backed hospitals should have been. In July, the U.S. House passed a bill that would require health-care companies to disclose any private equity backing when seeking short-term loans from the federal Medicare program.
The reason for lawmakers’ concern: Private equity firms have ample access to cash. As recently as June, the Apollo fund that owns LifePoint had more than $2 billion to support its investments. Apollo, which manages $414 billion, recently told investors in an internal document that LifePoint was in such a strong market position that it was planning to make acquisitions of less fortunate hospitals.The relief flowing to LifePoint illustrates a drawback of a government program designed to send out money quickly to every hospital, regardless of financial circumstances, according to Gerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University.
“This particular hospital system does not appear to need the money,” he said.
LifePoint and Apollo say they absolutely did. In their view, taxpayer money helped cover the soaring cost of treating Covid-19 patients and lost revenue because of the loss of fees from lucrative elective procedures. The assistance enabled the chain to retain all of its workers and provide essential service to its communities, they said.  
“No health-care provider, including LifePoint, is immune to this, regardless of their ownership,” said LifePoint spokesperson Michelle Augusty.
Said an Apollo spokesperson: ""Apollo is proud of LifePoint’s response to the Covid pandemic as they continue to provide vital care for both Covid and non-Covid patients.’’
LifePoint owns a far-flung collection of small-town hospitals, from Western Plains Medical Complex in Dodge City, Kansas, to Bourbon Community Hospital in Paris, Kentucky. For years, private equity has been pushing into every corner of American health care. Many medical professionals worry that these Wall Street-style investors will inevitably put profits before patients – something private equity denies.
In April, LifePoint Chief Executive Officer David Dill and other hospital officials met with President Donald Trump. Dill urged Trump to keep helping hospitals, noting that LifePoint’s medical centers tend to be in the middle of the country, “smaller communities, which I know are communities very important to you,’’ according to a transcript of the meeting.
“Rural hospitals are a very important part of the infrastructure in this country and also treating the uninsured and the Medicaid population as well,’’ Dill said.
Trump pointed out that the hospitals didn’t appear to be in the “hot spots.” Dill acknowledged they were handling only “a couple hundred Covid patients.” (The company said it has now cared for almost 20,000.)
In April, the month the government started distributing assistance, LifePoint borrowed $680 million in the capital markets. It also had access to $900 million in cash and an $800 million credit line, according to Moody’s Investors Service. 
By Apollo's own account, LifePoint was doing just fine when the pandemic struck. In fact, it was thriving – and looking to expand. As of March 31, shortly before LifePoint got taxpayer dollars, Apollo's investors were on track to double their money, internal documents show. On paper, they were sitting on a gain of more than $800 million.
“Independent hospital systems have greater difficulty weathering prolonged periods of financial stress,’’ Apollo wrote to its investors in May. “A  consolidation strategy will provide meaningful upside for Apollo funds' investment.’’
Apollo said the crisis represented an opportunity: “The coronavirus pandemic will serve as a catalyst for additional M&A opportunities given the attractive scale and overall position of the LifePoint platform.”
Apollo is one of three private equity firms whose hospitals, as a group, received a total of about $2.5 billion in bailout grants and loans, according to an analysis of the latest federal records. That’s a conservative figure because it doesn’t count the many smaller sums distributed to subsidiaries. Steward Health Care, a hospital  chain financed by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, received $675 million in grants and loans. In May, Cerberus transferred ownership of Steward to a group of doctors in exchange for a note that can be converted into a 37.5% equity stake. Another hospital company, Prospect Medical Holdings, owned by private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, took in $375 million. Apollo’s LifePoint hospitals received the most: $941 million in subsidized loans and $535 million in outright grants.  While Democratic lawmakers have said such firms could have instead tapped their own cash stockpiles, private equity industry representatives have said they have a duty to manage that money in the best interests of their investors, which include public pension plans.
Apollo built its rural hospital empire through the acquisition of three regional hospital chains in 2015, 2016 and 2018.  Apollo Investment Fund VIII LP owns 76% of LifePoint, which is based in Brentwood, Tennessee.
Even though many individual rural hospitals are struggling, Apollo says it can operate them more efficiently by merging them together. LifePoint now owns 88 hospitals in 29 states. It had almost $9 billion of annual revenue last year.
Apollo says that on its watch, the chain has improved its infrastructure and technology, recruited care providers and built new centers.
And for rural hospitals, Apollo argues, bigger is better.
“We continue to believe that rural hospitals can benefit from being part of a larger well-run system that enables access to greater resources and infrastructure for improved patient care,” the Apollo spokesperson said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Monday, seeking a fresh start after last week’s tech-inspired selloff. Positive Covid vaccine news and M&A deals are driving the positive sentiment, although this week’s Federal Reserve meeting could limit gains.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 38 points, or 1.2%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 234 points, or 0.9%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 173 points, or 1.6%. 
Over the weekend, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) announced it had resumed late-stage trials of its leading Covid-19 vaccine candidate, which it is developing with the University of Oxford, after the relevant U.K. authorities gave their approval.
Additionally,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) CEO Albert Bourla said the company’s own candidate, co-developed with German drug maker BioNTech, has a “good chance” of being rolled out to Americans by the end of the year. 
This positive news has been widely welcomed given on Friday the White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci described the current data on the U.S. Covid-19 outbreak as “disturbing.”  He added, “we’re plateauing at around 40,000 cases a day and the deaths are around 1,000.” 
Sentiment was also helped by the news of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) buying chipmaker Arm Holdings from SoftBank for $40 billion, while Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) now looks in pole position to be TikTok’s U.S. technology partner. Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) will also acquire biopharmaceutical company  Immunomedics  (NASDAQ:IMMU) for $21 billion.
Last week, the S&P 500 posted its worst week since late June and the Nasdaq Composite since March as the tech sector, the best-performing market sector year to date, was hit by sustained selling.
“Despite the sharp sell-off in the past week, we remain optimistic about the path of the U.S. equity market in coming months,” said strategists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in a note. “Since the financial crisis, the typical S&P 500 pullback of 5% or more has lasted for 20 trading days and extended by 7% from peak to trough, matching the magnitude of the most recent pullback if not the speed.”
The Federal Reserve concludes a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, and is expected to update its projections for the economic and interest rate outlook, which will include forecasts for 2023 for the first time. The central bank adopted a new approach last month to meeting its 2% inflation target. 
Oil prices weakened Monday despite another fierce storm in the Gulf of Mexico causing rigs to shut down production.
Tropical Storm Sally is gaining strength in the Gulf of Mexico and is forecast to be a category 2 hurricane. This is the second weather disruption to oil production in less than a month, with Hurricane Laura forcing shutdowns less than three weeks earlier. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $37.22 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.3% to $39.71. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,952/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1873.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 06:51AM ET</span>",Iconic new tower opens as pandemic crushes Manhattan office market,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - One Vanderbilt, the latest super-tall skyscraper to grace New York's skyline, opens Monday in a socially distant ribbon-cutting ceremony as COVID-19 leaves offices and the streets of Manhattan largely barren.
The airy $3.3 billion tower adjacent to Grand Central Terminal represents a major step in city efforts to ensure that a blocks-long swath of Midtown Manhattan, where buildings on average are 85 years old, remains a premier office district. 
Majority owner SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) Corp provided $220 million for new staircases and enhanced connections to the subway and suburban rail lines at Grand Central in a private partnership model the city plans to replicate in the area. 
But the 1,401-foot (427-meter) One Vanderbilt, the second tallest office tower in Manhattan after One World Trade Center, opens at a time when leasing prices are in decline thanks to work from home and the city's biggest construction boom since the 1980s.
Subletting and short-term renewals now account for more than 70% of leases as companies and landlords fight off the impact of a downturn that has given New York the highest unemployment rate, at 20%, among the biggest U.S. cities.
The average lease term at SL Green, the city's largest office landlord, in the second quarter slid to 4.3 years from 10.1 years in the prior period, while the number of free months' rent more than doubled to 4.5, regulatory filings show.
While One Vanderbilt is 71% leased with tenants that have taken out long-term leases at more than $100 a square foot, fear of COVID-19 has kept offices in Manhattan, the largest U.S. office market, mostly empty, which is likely to persist until a vaccine has been fully rolled out.
Tenants won't start to move in until later this year.
The tower, which tapers as it rises above the nearby Chrysler Building to the east, has above-average floor-to-ceiling heights, addressing demand in recent years for workplaces with more sunlight.
The challenge, at least in the near term, is getting people back in the office and confident that floor configurations, along with elevators, allow ample safe space between workers.
NEW VERSUS OLD
Quality space produces more value for tenants and landlords than just adding more conventional floorspace as employees tend to be more productive if their well-being is taken into account, said Dennis Frenchman, a professor of urban design at MIT who recently headed the MIT Center for Real Estate.
""That's the calculation being made in these new buildings with super-tall ceilings and windows,"" Frenchman said. 
New York has added millions of square feet of column-free floorplates with floor-to-ceiling smart windows during the recent boom times, forcing landlords to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade outdated buildings. 
Law firm Latham & Watkins recently left the Philip Johnson-created Lipstick Building, completed in 1986, for 1271 Avenue of the Americas, the former Time & Life Building that is 27 years older and just underwent a $600 million renovation.
Tales abound of people fleeing New York's dense neighborhoods for the suburbs or smaller cities. Yet large-scale asset sales have not occurred that would indicate investment is pulling out and endangering Manhattan's status as the premier global finance center and a budding U.S. hub for technology.
One Vanderbilt and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s leasing in August of the former Farley post office building adjacent to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden show there is demand for the very best workspace. But older stock face difficulties in a down market.
The market for luxury office space is not going to disappear, though it may encounter challenges ahead, said Jesse Keenan, a real estate professor at Tulane University's School of Architecture.

""The down-market buildings will feel the heat from non-credit tenants before the topline buildings feel the heat from credit tenants,"" Keenan said, referring to small businesses lacking financial strength versus well-run large corporations.

The Chinese conglomerate will be the sole investor in the funding round and will spend a portion of the funds to acquire some of the Grab stock held by Uber Technologies Inc (N:UBER), the Bloomberg report added.
Grab declined to comment, while Alibaba and Uber were not immediately available to respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Uber, which surrendered its Southeast Asian operations to Grab in March 2018, took a 27.5 percent stake in Grab's business.
In April, Uber said it expects an impairment charge of up to $2.2 billion, adding that the charge would be against the carrying value of some of the company's minority equity investments, due to the impact of the pandemic on the estimated value of those entities.
Grab, which has an estimated valuation of $14 billion and counts SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) as one of its backers, expanded into financial services, food delivery and mobile payments over the last few years, even before the COVID-19 pandemic hurt its mainstay ride-hailing business.

In June, Grab announced a 5% reduction in staff numbers as it cut costs amid slower growth.

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Global banks left on the sidelines in Brazil's IPO boom,"By Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The days of marquee global investment banks being shoo-ins for stock market listings could be coming to an end, in Brazil at least.
The Brazilian market for initial public offerings is booming this year despite the pandemic. Yet among the five banks leading managers' rankings in terms of deal volumes, four are domestic, according to Refinitiv data: Itau Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4), Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4), XP Inc (O:XP) and  Banco BTG Pactual  SA (SA:BPAC3). 
The other is Bank of America (N:BAC).
That's a marked reversal from the same period last year, when four of the top five were major global players - Bank of America,  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), Citi (N:C) and HSBC (L:HSBA) - with just one Brazilian outfit, Banco do Brasil (SA:BBAS3). 
Still, industry experts caution that, despite the shifting trends in 2020, it is too early to call a structural change in a market for IPOs that has been dominated by global banks for years. 
Key factors behind the shift, according to industry experts, include the increasing importance of reaching domestic investors, and local banks' existing relationships and loans to many of a new breed of midsize companies eager to go public. 
Brazilian investors have flooded into stocks in recent months as interest rates have slumped to all-time lows, making fixed-income investments less attractive. Foreign investors have accounted for 38% of the money in Brazilian IPOs this year, compared with 57% two years ago and below the historic average level of 60% since 2007. 
""Local investors are moving to equities and fund managers are having a hard time finding company shares to buy,"" said Pedro Mesquita, a partner at XP bank.
When cash rebates provider Méliuz began planning an IPO last month, for example, it could have opted for global players, also including the likes of JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS), which all have local offices.
Yet Méliuz's founders and venture-capital investors instead tapped BTG Pactual, Bradesco, XP and Itau Unibanco as its bookrunners. 
Global banks are, however, still likely to be seen as the safe go-tos for the biggest deals, and they will likely snag some big mandates by the end of the year, industry experts say. 
Multi-billion-dollar IPOs, such as those by insurance company Caixa Seguridade SA, hospital chain Rede D'Or and retailer Havan SA will be managed by international as well as local banks, for instance. 
""Local banks often have existing commercial relationships with smaller companies as they grow into the scale required for an IPO, but this does not mean that global banks will not lead in terms of volumes by year-end,"" said Fabio Medeiros, managing director at Morgan Stanley in Sao Paulo.
DEAL BOOM IN BRAZIL
IPOs in Brazil are on track for their biggest year since 2007. Thirteen companies have already made their debut and more than 40 others have filed for offerings with the regulator.
So far, companies have raised $3.1 billion, up 113% from the same period a year ago, in the 13 IPOs - outperforming global IPOs, which are up 20%, according to Refinitiv data. 
In India, by comparison, there have been 21 IPOs, but they raised $1.7 billion, down 22.8% from a year earlier, while in China 328 deals raised $52.4 billion, more than double versus a year ago.
The four domestic banks leading Brazil's ratings accounted for 54.3% of the country's $3.1 billion deal volumes.
Many companies propelling the new IPO wave hail from beyond the traditional Sao Paulo-Rio business corridor, where global banks often lack offices and relationships.
""For a long time, the Brazilian stock exchange was all about commodities and banks,"" said Alessandro Farkuh, head of investment banking at Bradesco. ""Now there are companies from different industries, from pure e-commerce to more regional retail businesses. Domestic banks know all these companies.""
COMPETITION HEATS UP
When family-owned homebuilder Moura Dubeux hired five banks for its IPO earlier this year, four were domestic.
Three of those were existing creditors. Credit Suisse (S:CSGN), the one global bank chosen, is the private banker for the family that owns the company.
""I realized that the majority of my investors would be Brazilians and I think local banks have reached a global standard to manage share offerings,"" said Diego Villar, CEO of Moura Dubeux, based in the northeastern state of Pernambuco.
Roderick Greenlees, head of investment banking at Itau Unibanco, said domestic banks had been well-placed to see the shifting IPO landscape.
""Brazilian banks realized there would be a growing demand for capital markets services and hired more bankers in recent years,"" he added.

Even so, with so many local and global banks pitching for business in Brazil, it's an increasingly competitive market. Average fees were 3.3% last year, compared with 4.4% in the United States, according to data provider Dealogic.

""Mr Le Drian took the decision which appeared to him to be the right one,"" Le Maire told France 2 television on Monday, adding that Le Drian was working to protect French interests in his intervention.
Last week, LVMH said its board had received a letter from the foreign ministry asking it to delay the acquisition of Tiffany to beyond Jan. 6, 2021, given the threat of additional U.S. tariffs against French products.
Both Tiffany and LVMH have started legal action over the state of the deal.
Tiffany sued LVMH after the French company said it could not complete the $16 billion takeover of Tiffany due to the French government request.
LVMH in turn said it said would counter-sue Tiffany, accusing it of mismanagement during the coronavirus crisis.
LVMH shares were flat by 0840 GMT, while Tiffany shares closed 0.5% lower on Friday.
""Hiding behind the French government is just an excuse for LVMH,"" said Ion-Marc Valahu, a fund manager at Geneva-based firm Clairinvest. 

""The reality is that they're seeing what's happening with COVID, and the fact that no-one is going out shopping, and they may be looking to see if they can get Tiffany at a lower price,"" he said.

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",ByteDance picks Oracle as partner to try to save TikTok U.S.: sources,"By Echo Wang and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) beat Microsoft in the battle for the U.S. arm of TikTok with a deal structured as a partnership rather than an outright sale to try to navigate geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, people familiar with the matter said.
ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese owner, had been in talks to divest the U.S. business of its hugely popular short-video app to Oracle or a consortium led by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the sale last month and said he might otherwise shut it down.
While TikTok is best known for dancing videos that go viral among teenagers, U.S. officials are concerned user information could be passed to China's communist government. TikTok, which has as many as 100 million U.S. users, has said it would never share such data with Chinese authorities.
Sale negotiations were upended when China updated its export control rules last month, giving it a say over the transfer of TikTok's algorithm to a foreign buyer. Reuters reported last week that China would rather see TikTok shut down in the United States than allow a forced sale.
On Monday, China's state-run English television channel CGTN cited sources as saying ByteDance would not sell TikTok's U.S. operations to Oracle or Microsoft, and would not give the source code for the platform to any U.S. firm.
Under ByteDance's latest proposal, Oracle would be the firm's technology partner and assume management of TikTok's U.S. user data, sources told Reuters on Sunday. Oracle is also negotiating taking a stake in TikTok's U.S. operations, they said.
The data is currently stored in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's cloud.
Some of ByteDance's top investors, including General Atlantic and Sequoia, will also be given minority stakes in those operations, one of the people said.
PRECEDENT
It is unclear whether Trump, who wants a U.S. technology firm to own most of TikTok in the United States, will approve the deal. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for national security risk, is overseeing the ByteDance-Oracle talks.
""User data protection and assurances around how the company's algorithms push content to U.S. users are thoughtful components of a substantive solution, but whether they can change political outcomes is a much more difficult question,"" said regulatory lawyer John Kabealo, who is not involved in the talks.
ByteDance plans to argue that CFIUS' approval two years ago of China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd's [OWREAC.UL] purchase of U.S. insurer Genworth Financial Inc (NYSE:GNW) offers a precedent for its proposal with Oracle, the sources said.
In that deal, China Oceanwide agreed to use a U.S.-based, third-party service to manage Genworth's U.S. policyholder data. ByteDance will argue a similar arrangement with Oracle can safeguard TikTok's U.S. user data, the sources said.
ByteDance and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment.
China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin declined to comment on Monday when asked at a press conference about the TikTok deal, but said TikTok was being ""encircled"" and ""coerced"" in the United States into a transaction. 
""We urge the U.S. government to provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for foreign firms operating and investing in the United States,"" he said. 
WALMART BLOW
Oracle's chairman Larry Ellison is one of the tech world's few Trump supporters. His firm has significant technological prowess in handling and safeguarding data, but no social media experience as its clientele comprises companies, rather than consumers.
Peking University professor of investment Jeffrey Towson said Oracle's ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations with access, but not ownership, of ByteDance's core technology mirrored how many Western companies operate in China.
Earlier on Sunday, Microsoft said it had been informed by ByteDance that the Chinese firm would not be selling it TikTok's U.S. operations. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, which had joined Microsoft's bid, said it was still interested in investing, and that it would talk further with ByteDance and other parties.
""This is bad news for Walmart more than anyone else,"" said Towson. ""Combining TikTok's entertainment and user engagement with its e-commerce platform was its best shot at catching up"" with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
TRUMP'S ORDERS
As Sino-U.S. relations deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong's autonomy, cybersecurity and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint.
Trump signed two executive orders last month targeting TikTok and ByteDance. The first, effective Sept. 20, bans U.S. companies from transacting with them. The second requires ByteDance to sell TikTok by Nov. 12.
Were Trump to agree to ByteDance's proposed Oracle deal, he would have to rescind his order calling specifically for divestment.
As many as 40% of Americans back Trump's threat to ban TikTok if it is not sold to a U.S. buyer, a Reuters/Ipsos national poll found last month. Among Republicans - Trump's party - 69% said they supported the order, though only 32% expressed familiarity with the app.
'UNTRUSTED' APPS
The White House has stepped up efforts to purge what it deems ""untrusted"" Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks. Beyond TikTok, Trump has also issued an order prohibiting transactions with Tencent Holding Ltd's messenger app WeChat.
Earlier this year, Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd sold gay dating app Grindr, bought in 2016, for $620 million after CFIUS ordered its divestment.

ByteDance acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly - whose user base was largely American - for $1 billion in 2017 without seeking CFIUS approval, relaunching it as TikTok the following year. Reuters reported last year that CFIUS was investigating TikTok.

1613,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 05:46AM ET</span>",StockBeat: One Swiss Bank to Rule Them All?,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The heads of Switzerland’s biggest banks are reportedly planning to merge the two in a deal that would restore their global competitiveness and cement their dominance of the wealth management industry – if only they can set aside a rivalry that has spilled over into outright enmity in recent years.
According to InsideParadePlatz, an often scurrilous but usually well-sourced gossip site for Swiss bankers, the plan is being cooked up by the chairmen of UBS Group (SIX:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), both of whom approve the deal in principle. Both stocks were outperformers among European banks on Monday, Credit Suisse stock rising 2.3% and UBS shares rising 1.1%.
Under the plan, the two would merge by the end of next year. Neither bank has confirmed the report. 
Strategically, such a merger would have a lot going for it. Cost efficiencies would be sizeable – InsideParadePlatz reckons around 15,000 of their combined workforce of 120,000 would be at risk, of which “at least 5,000” would be in Switzerland. That’s important given that there is no end in sight to the squeeze on revenues from the banks’ core lending business due to sub-zero interest rates in Switzerland and elsewhere.
Additionally, CS’s wealth management business would further strengthen UBS’s leadership in managing the money of the world’s super-rich, whose portfolio ideas and activities are also a valuable source of business for the pair’s investment bankers.
A further consideration may be that a stronger combined balance sheet would allow the banks to reclaim lost market share in global securities markets. That would represent a clear shift in strategy, given that both have scaled back their activities there since 2008, but the results of the big Wall Street houses – and U.K.-based  Barclays  (LON:BARC) - so far this year have been a powerful argument for the ability of securities markets to generate revenue and profit precisely when traditional lending can’t.
But the deal also creates plenty of problems of its own. A combination would – to all practical purposes – be a takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS. Relations between the two houses have never been good, especially since the defection of CS wealth management boss Iqbal Khan to UBS, to which CS reacted with a legally-dubious surveillance campaign that cost former CEO Tidjane Thiam his job.
One can argue that Khan would be ideally placed to pick and choose those CS managers worthy of keeping their place in the combined team, but the process of managing such egos will be even trickier than usual.
InsideParadePlatz argued that CS’s current CEO Thomas Gottstein, a Swiss native, would be a shoo-in for the CEO spot – principally because UBS chairman Axel Weber would keep his position on the combined board and having foreigners in both top slots would be politically awkward.
That would mean no place for Ralph Hamers, the former head of ING who is set to succeed outgoing UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti in November.  Any faint echoes of Andrea Orcel’s abortive leap from UBS’s investment bank to Santander (MC:SAN) last year are, of course, entirely accidental, but none the less amusing."

(N:MCD) plans to expand in Russia's far east in December, opening restaurants in cities such as Khabarovsk and Vladivostok for the first time, the company said on Monday. 
McDonald's did not specify how many new restaurants would open in the region, but said the first phase would create around 300 jobs. 
""The development of a network of branches in Russia is one of the company's top priorities. In 2020, the network is continuing to actively invest in Russia's economy and widen its presence on the market,"" McDonald's said in a statement.
""By the end of the year, we plan to open the 800th branch in the country."" 
McDonald's has over 750 restaurants in Russia, across 60 of the countries more than 80 regions. The company's total investments in Russia exceed $2.5 billion, while average annual growth of investments is around 14%. 

The first McDonald's restaurant opened in Moscow on Jan. 31, 1990, in the final months of the Soviet Union, with over 30,000 people queuing around the block for a first taste of American fast food. A 30th anniversary giveaway was scrapped earlier this year over coronavirus fears.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks in the European healthcare sector underperformed the broader market in early trading on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to lower drug prices in the United States. 
The healthcare index (SXDP) was down 0.25% at 0853 GMT, while the pan-European benchmark STOXX 600 added 0.15%. 
Trump aims to lower drug prices in the U.S. by linking them to those of other nations and expanding the scope of a July action. 
Analysts estimate that more than 60% of global pharmaceutical profits are generated in the United States due to the high drug prices.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said that the impact of the executive order would be negative if implemented and that some was resistance from the industry. 

European shares that could be hit by the U.S. move include AstraZeneca (L:AZN), GlaxoSmithKline plc (L:GSK),  Novartis  (S:NOVN), Roche (S:ROG), Sanofi (PA:SASY), Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and  Novo Nordisk  A/S (CO:NOVOb), according to Credit Suisse.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian fund managers on Monday sought to assuage investor concerns that a regulatory change affecting portfolio structures of some equity funds which manage assets worth $20 billion will make such holdings riskier and destabilise the market.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Friday said so-called multi-cap funds should invest a minimum 75% of their assets in stocks, but spooked industry by mandating equal allocation of 25% between large-, mid- and small-cap shares. 
Such funds, which roughly account for a fifth of India's over $100 billion equity mutual funds industry, faced no such restrictions before and were heavily invested in large-cap stocks, considered safer than their smaller peers.
The rule change sparked fears the funds will start dumping those stocks in favour of riskier bets to comply, causing market volatility, but fund managers on Monday said they won't act in haste and urged investors to stay put.
""I will not end up buying small- and mid-caps at any price, at any valuation, if it doesn't make sense for my investors,"" said Nilesh Shah, the CEO of Kotak Mutual Fund which manages India's biggest multi-cap fund with assets of about $4 billion.
The new rules announced by SEBI - set to come in force from Feb. 2021 - were aimed at addressing ""skewed portfolios"" of such funds as some of them, according to data from Morningstar India, have allocated more than 70-80% to large-cap stocks.
If the funds were to dump large-caps to comply with the new rules, they would have to collectively sell an estimated $5.6 billion in such stocks and buy $3.8 billion in small-caps and $1.84 billion in mid-caps, brokerage Emkay Global estimated.
Fund managers also said small- and mid-cap stocks surged in India on Monday in anticipation of possible big purchases by funds under the new rules in the coming weeks.
The Nifty small-cap index (NIFSMCP100) jumped about 5.5% and the mid-cap index (NIFMDCP100) rose more than 3% compared with a 0.7% rise in the main Nifty 50 index (NSEI) that largely represents large-cap.
But Shah and other managers said several options were being explored, including merging such schemes with large-cap funds or asking unitholders to shift to other plans. 
One Indian fund manager said the industry was planning to seek more time from SEBI to comply with the new rules, while also requesting a complete re-think.
""There is a lot of chaos and noise in the market ... We are not doing anything. Investors also should not do anything in a hurry,"" he said, declining to be identified.

SEBI on Sunday said it was conscious of the need to maintain market stability and will examine any proposals made by the mutual fund industry.

The stock was the biggest boost to London's bluechip, FTSE 100 (FTSE) index in early trading, but quickly pared gains as U.S. President Donald Trump's order to lower prices nationally hurt pharmaceutical stocks across the board.
AstraZeneca shares were trading at 8,431 pence by 0833 GMT. UK pharma stocks (FTNMX4570), however, underperformed the FTSE 100, with GSK (L:GSK) down 0.2% and Hikma  1% on Trump's order.
The resumption of the trials for AstraZeneca's vaccine, one of the most advanced in development and regarded by governments and financial markets as one of the best bets to tackle the health crisis in the months ahead, buoyed stock markets around the world. 
Late-stage trials of the vaccine were suspended last week after an illness in a study participant, casting doubts on an early rollout and sending the London-listed company's shares lower.
Global trials of the vaccine had also been paused following the UK suspension. Brazil has approved restarting the trials and the Serum Institute of India is awaiting permission from the Drugs Controller General of India.
Cambridge-based AstraZeneca's shares had risen about 11% this year up to their Friday close of 8,429 pence, giving the pharmaceutical giant a market capitalisation of 111 billion pounds ($142 billion).

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rallied on Monday on hopes for a coronavirus vaccine after AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) resumed its phase-3 trial, but caution lingered before a host of central bank meetings this week.
Sterling, which has been hit by renewed Brexit turmoil, was on firmer ground before a vote on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to break international law by breaching parts of the Brexit divorce treaty with the European Union. 
European stock markets opened broadly higher (STOXX) and U.S. stock futures rallied more than 1% (ESc1) (1YMc1) -- suggesting a strong start for Wall Street later on. 
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.9% to its highest in almost a week. Japan's Nikkei (N225) firmed 0.7% after Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga won a landslide victory in a ruling party leadership election, paving the way for him to succeed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Drugmaker AstraZeneca (L:AZN) said at the weekend it has resumed British clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine, one of the most advanced in development, after getting the green light from safety watchdogs.
The news provided a boost to sentiment in world share markets, hit last week by a selloff in U.S. tech stocks. 
""The news over the weekend that AstraZeneca clinical trials had resumed is likely to be well received, however it is unlikely to assuage concerns that the speed with which these trials are being done could result in a vaccine being rushed out too hastily, with unforeseen circumstances,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
U.S. chipmaker  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) said it would buy UK-based chip designer Arm from Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984) for as much as $40 billion in a deal set to reshape the global semiconductor landscape, spurring a 1% gain in Europe's tech sector. (SX8P)
Friday marked six months since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11. 
Since then, major global economies have slipped into recession and millions have lost their jobs, prompting central banks around the world to launch unprecedented stimulus. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve this week holds a two-day policy meeting and is expected to hold rates while elaborating on an earlier announcement of a shift to inflation targeting. The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England will announce their respective policy decisions on Thursday.
BREXIT WATCH 
Major currencies were stable on Monday, with the British pound holding above 1-1/2 month lows against the dollar  ahead of a parliamentary debate on the Internal Market Bill. After the debate, lawmakers will vote to decide if it should go to the next stage. 
Johnson's decision to explicitly break international law has plunged Brexit back into crisis less than four months before Britain is finally due to leave the EU's orbit at the end of a post-Brexit transition period.
""The question will be how many Conservative MPs (members of parliament) rebel on the matter,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid, referring to Johnson's ruling party.
The dollar was a tad weaker at 106 yen,  though still a long distance from its low this year of 101.2. The euro (EUR=) was a touch firmer at $1.1857.
In commodities, U.S. crude (CLc1) jumped 0.6% to $37.55 a barrel. Brent crude (LCOc1) climbed 0.4% to $40 per barrel. 
Gold was firm, with spot prices  at $1,946.9 per ounce. 

Elsewhere, Turkey's currency and dollar-bonds came under pressure after Moody's (NYSE:MCO) cut the country's sovereign rating and warned of the risk of a balance of payment crisis. The lira weakened 0.2% , flirting with fresh record lows last week.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Monday, boosted by renewed hopes of prompt delivery of a coronavirus vaccine..
At 4:25 AM ET (0825 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.2%.
AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) announced Saturday that it had resumed phase 3 trials in the U.K. of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, which it is developing with the University of Oxford.
The trials had been halted last week after a patient came down with an unspecified illness, casting doubt on the timing of the rollout of the vaccine, one of the most advanced in development.
Additionally, a day later,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) CEO Albert Bourla said the company’s own candidate, co-developed with German drug maker BioNTech, has a “good chance” of submitting key data from late-stage trials by the end of October, and once approved, could be rolled out to Americans by the end of the year. 
Still, gains are limited as Germany's economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis has weakened, the country’s Economy Ministry said, but the revival is likely to continue in the rest of 2020.
Additionally, there is likely to be a degree of caution ahead of a number of important central bank meetings later this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. It’s expected to update its projections for the economic and interest rate outlook, which will include forecasts for 2023 for the first time. 
The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England will also announce their respective policy decisions on Thursday.
In corporate news,  Euronext  (PA:ENX) stock fell 1.6% after submitting a non-binding offer to acquire Borsa Italiana from  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE). This is set to spark a takeover battle for the Italian exchange as Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), down 0.7%, submitted an offer on Friday. The deadline for bids is today.
Oil prices weakened Monday despite another fierce storm in the Gulf of Mexico caused rigs to shut down production, as demand concerns are strengthening with the coronavirus pandemic getting worse and global supplies continue to rise. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $37.12 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.7% to $39.55.

1621,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>",Trial of former JPMorgan banker begins in Hong Kong with plea of not guilty,"By Sharon Tam and Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan (N:JPM) did not carry out key checks when employing the son of a potential client, a prosecutor told a Hong Kong court on Monday, the first day of a bribery trial of the bank's former Asia investment banking vice-chairwoman, Catherine Leung. 
Leung, who repeated a not guilty plea on Monday, is charged with bribing the then chairman of Kerry Logistics Network Ltd (HK:0636), Ang Keng-lam, by employing his son at the U.S. investment bank's Hong Kong office in 2010. 
She did so, the prosecution said, in anticipation that Ang would influence his company to give JPMorgan a role on its up-coming initial public offering (IPO).
The investment bank did not consult its legal and compliance department until after the younger Ang's employment contract at JPMorgan was signed, prosecution barrister Robert Lee said in his opening submission. 
Lee also cited an email he said was written by Leung when Kerry Logistics was in the early stages of preparing for its IPO. 
""Son is very keen to do IB (investment banking), but does not interview well ... The last thing I want is for us to go slow and they ask another bank, and I am sure someone will give him a full time offer given the mandate that is up for grabs,"" Lee cited Leung as saying in the email.
Leung made no comment in court apart from her plea and declined to comment when approached by Reuters after the first day of her trial.
It was not immediately clear whether Ang or his son, Ang Ren-yi, would be asked to give evidence and neither could be reached through their employer on Monday after Leung's plea, or ahead of the trial. 
Ang Ren-yi left JPMorgan in 2011, the prosecution said in a statement last year.
A JPMorgan spokeswoman on Monday referred Reuters to a statement it made last year, when the bank said: ""This is a historical case, which J.P. Morgan reached agreement on and settled in 2016."" 
That year, JPMorgan agreed to pay U.S. authorities $264 million to resolve allegations it hired relatives of Chinese officials - known as ""princelings"" https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-settlement/jpmorgan-to-pay-264-million-to-resolve-china-hiring-probe-sec-doj-idUSKBN13C1Z8 - to win banking deals.
U.S. authorities at the time said JPMorgan's Asia unit created an elaborate programme, called ""Sons and Daughters"", that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires.
Kerry Logistics did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. A representative said last year Ang stepped down as chairman of the firm in August 2012 and that JPMorgan did not participate in Kerry Logistics' IPO in December 2013.

In a letter to Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra, Greenpeace set out its grievances and said it would press the case if the government does not respond with changes by Oct. 1.
Hoekstra's office could not be reached for immediate comment. After months of negotiations, the Dutch government on June 26 agreed to offer KLM NV an aid package to keep it afloat through the coronavirus crisis.
The bailout terms include new environmental and noise pollution targets for KLM which were insisted upon by the Dutch parliament, as well as cost cuts.
However, Greenpeace said the environmental conditions do not go far enough.
"" (KLM) only wants to cut its carbon dioxide footprint by 15% by 2030, while almost all other Dutch sectors must bring their emissions down by 49%,"" Greenpeace said. 
""The number of flights must be reduced, starting with scrapping unnecessary short-distance flights to Brussels or Paris,"" the group said. It also demanded a plan for annual emission cuts until the company reaches zero net emissions.
Dutch environmental groups have successfully challenged the government's failure to act on climate goals in the past, notably the ""Urgenda"" lawsuit which forced the government to follow through on promises to cut greenhouse emissions by 25% this year from 1990 levels.
KLM is losing around 10 million euros per day and is deadlocked with labour unions over jobs cuts and pay freezes mandated by the bailout, prompting Hoekstra to warn on Sunday that the company will need further support and could still go bankrupt.

A spokesman for KLM could not be reached on Monday for immediate comment.

The state oil giant’s stock has gained 1.1% in Riyadh this month, despite Brent crude dropping 12% to below $40 a barrel as concerns about an acceleration in coronavirus infections mount.
Meanwhile, Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) have fallen nearly 17% in September. That’s almost taken the stock into bear-market territory -- which is a 20% drop from a recent peak -- and the company’s market value has declined to $1.9 trillion from $2.3 trillion.
Apple and Aramco are the only two companies to have achieved valuations of $2 trillion. Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, peaked at just above that level in mid-December, shortly after its record initial public offering. Apple overtook it in July as technology firms soared amid massive U.S. monetary and fiscal stimulus to counter the fallout from the virus.
Aramco’s share price has been resilient partly because of its pledge to pay a $75 billion dividend this year. That would be more than five times what Apple’s paid out to shareholders in the past four quarters.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",Nvidia to buy chip designer Arm for $40 billion as SoftBank exits,"By Sam Nussey and Stephen Nellis
TOKYO/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp will buy UK-based chip designer Arm from Japan's SoftBank Group Corp for as much as $40 billion, the companies said on Monday, in a deal set to reshape the global semiconductor landscape.
The sale puts a vital supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and others across the industry under the control of a single player and faces likely pushback from regulators and rivals to Nvidia, the biggest U.S. chip company by market capitalisation.
Within hours of the announcement, critics questioned how Arm would maintain its open approach under U.S. ownership and at a time of friction with China.
For Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), the sale marks an early exit from Arm, just four years after the technology group's $32 billion acquisition. Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has lionised the potential of Arm but is slashing his stakes in major assets to raise cash. 
The move comes as SoftBank executives, frustrated at the group's share performance, have held early stage talks about taking the Japanese technology group private, a source told Reuters. Those talks could gain momentum following the Arm sale. SoftBank's shares soared 10% in Tokyo.
Nvidia will pay SoftBank $21.5 billion in shares and $12 billion in cash, including $2 billion on signing. The deal will see SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund, which has a 25% stake in Arm, take a stake in Nvidia of between 6.7% and 8.1%. 
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the deal, which will boost his firm in data centre chips, was ""pro competition"". It marked ""the first time in history the industry could see something that is genuinely alternative"" to  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s domination of the sector, he said.
Taiwan-born Huang emphasised he will retain Arm's neutral licensing model and expand it by licensing out Nvidia intellectual property for the first time. 
Nvidia said it will license its flagship graphical processor unit through Arm's network of silicon partners. It will build chips for devices like self-driving cars but also make its technology available for others. 
The companies did not discuss the deal with the British government until shortly before the announcement because the talks were secret, Huang said. A new artificial intelligence research center will be built at Arm's Cambridge headquarters.
""Cambridge is going to be a site of growth,"" Huang said.
CHINA SCRUTINY
Arm does not make chips but has created an instruction set architecture - the most fundamental intellectual property that underpins computing chips - on which it bases designs for computing cores. 
Arm licenses its chip designs and technology to customers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Apple and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd. Apple's forthcoming Mac computers will use Arm-based chips.
Arm will not become subject to U.S. export controls under the deal, said Huang. 
The purchase, which is subject to regulatory approvals including in Britain, the United States and China, is likely to come under close scrutiny in China, where thousands of companies from Huawei to small startups use Arm technology.
Nvidia will take control of the minority stake in joint venture Arm China. Arm is in dispute with the venture, which licenses chip architecture to local companies, over its management.
Co-founded by Huang, who has a penchant for leather jackets and an Nvidia arm tattoo, the firm began as a graphics chip designer but has expanded aggressively into products for areas including artificial intelligence and data centers.
The Arm acquisition will put Nvidia into even more intense competition with rivals in the data center chip market such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc because Arm has been developing technology to compete with their chips.
In what would amount to a direct challenge to those rivals, Huang said it is ""possible"" Nvidia will build its own server chips based on Arm designs. 
Nvidia is buying up technologies in parts of the booming data center business where it does not currently play. 
In April it completed the purchase of Israel-based Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) Inc, which makes high-speed networking technology that is used in data centers and supercomputers.
The Arm deal is expected to close by March 2022. 

SoftBank could be paid an additional $5 billion in cash or shares depending on the chip designer's business performance, with Arm employees to be paid $1.5 billion in Nvidia shares.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Monday said it is recruiting 100,000 more workers - the fourth hiring spree it has announced for the United States this year - to keep pace with e-commerce demand that jumped during the pandemic.
The world's biggest online retailer said the positions are for full and part-time work in its home country and Canada, and these will include roles at 100 new warehouse and operations sites it is opening this month. The Seattle-based company employed 876,800 people as of June 30, excluding contractors and temporary personnel.
The news reflects Amazon's constant need for labor to pick, pack and ship products to shoppers' doorsteps, with a 40% revenue rise last quarter and the biggest profit in the retailer's 26-year-history. It is rolling out automation at its newest buildings at the same time, said Alicia Boler Davis, Amazon's vice president of global customer fulfillment.
""We will continue to deploy technology where appropriate, starting from a safety perspective"" and ""where we can improve our overall operation,"" Boler Davis said in an interview.
She did not have comment on whether automation means fewer jobs per warehouse but said Amazon uses its systems for collaboration with people. ""We don’t look at it as an 'either/or.'""
Boler Davis, recently appointed to Amazon's senior leadership team, said the company is still evaluating seasonal employment needs for the winter holiday, apart from the 100,000 positions it is filling.
Earlier this month Amazon announced 33,000 openings for corporate and technology workers. It announced 100,000 and 75,000 new operations jobs in March and April, respectively, in an appeal to people who were laid off by other businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Monday, with positive news surrounding a potential vaccine helping the market take on more risk. However, ranges are likely to be tight ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting, and the focus is likely to be on sterling and yen movements given political uncertainty.
At 2:55 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 93.198, with EUR/USD largely flat at 1.1847.
News that AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) has resumed late-stage trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, coupled with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) CEO Albert Bourla saying its candidate has a “good chance” of submitting key data from late-stage trials by the end of October, has created a more positive attitude to risk, hitting the dollar.
Still, investors will exhibit some caution ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve’s policy meeting.
“The Fed story has undoubtedly been bearish for the dollar over the last couple of months, but a little caution may be warranted going forward – with perhaps the Fed’s hands now tied ahead of the November 3rd presidential election,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.2827, rebounding a touch after having hit $1.2767 on Friday, its lowest since July 24. EUR/GBP traded 0.3% lower at 0.9235, after previously reaching a 5 1/2-month high of 0.9290.
The pound has been under pressure from fears that Britain will end its post-Brexit transition period with no trade agreements.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new Internal Market Bill, which unilaterally breaks the Brexit divorce treaty with the European Union signed earlier this year, faces a vote in parliament on Monday. 
“Despite its profound fall in the past few days, we expect the pressure on GBP to continue building ... as until-recently complacent investors adjust to the new reality of a heightened no-deal Brexit risk and start/continue building GBP shorts,” ING added.
“With EUR/USD likely to remain range-bound (and hence giving limited support to GBP/USD), expect GBP/USD to head towards 1.2500 next week (and EUR/GBP to 0.9500).”
Additionally, USD/JPY slipped 0.1% to 106.04, with Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga poised to become head of Japan's ruling party on Monday and prime minister on Wednesday.
""The focus is on the line-up of his cabinet as well as whether he will call a snap election,"" said Minori Uchida, chief FX strategist at MUFG Bank, in a Reuters report. ""He is saying he will continue and advance Abenomics but it is questionable how much advancement he can make.""

""Let's not offer to the rest of the world the spectacle of a battle between two beautiful French industrial companies,"" Le Maire told France 2 television.
""This conflict is useless and we must find a way that will allow both parties to benefit from this operation.""
""The role of the state is to make sure there is no useless war in French capitalism but the creation of value and jobs for all,"" he said.
On Aug. 30 Veolia offered to buy a 29.9% stake in Suez from French gas and power utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) for 2.9 billion euros ($3.4 billion) and if successful, to then launch a full takeover bid.
The offer has been rejected by Suez, with its chairman saying in an interview published on Sunday that it represented an ""industrial mirage"" that would lead to job cuts in France.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Monday, boosted by renewed hopes of prompt delivery of a coronavirus vaccine. However, caution ahead of upcoming central bank meetings may limit the gains.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.5%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.
AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) announced Saturday that it had resumed phase 3 trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, which it is developing with the University of Oxford, after the relevant U.K. authorities gave their approval.
The trials had been halted last week after a patient came down with an unspecified illness, casting doubt on the timing of the rollout of the vaccine, one of the most advanced in development.
Additionally, a day later,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) CEO Albert Bourla said the company’s own candidate, co-developed with German drug maker BioNTech, has a “good chance” of submitting key data from late-stage trials by the end of October, and once approved, could be rolled out to Americans by the end of the year. 
Investors have long been looking for a vaccine to allow people across the world to return to the work and consumption habits they had before the pandemic and its lockdowns.
However, there is also likely to be a degree of caution shown ahead of a number of important central bank meetings later this week. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. It’s expected to update its projections for the economic and interest rate outlook, which will include forecasts for 2023 for the first time. 
The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England will also announce their respective policy decisions on Thursday.
In corporate news,  Euronext  (PA:ENX) will be in focus after saying Monday that it has submitted a non-binding offer to acquire Borsa Italiana from  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE).
This is set to spark a takeover battle for the Italian exchange as Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) submitted an offer on Friday.
Oil prices strengthened Monday as another fierce storm in the Gulf of Mexico caused rigs to shut down production.
Tropical Storm Sally is gaining strength in the Gulf of Mexico and is forecast to be a category 2 hurricane.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese automakers have announced plans to increase sales of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, a niche segment in the world's biggest auto market, and the government is expected to announce supportive new policies, possibly as early as this month . 
SAIC Motor (SS:600104), China's biggest automaker which has partnerships with Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors Co (N:GM), said on Sunday it plans to sell over 10,000 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2025.
Commercial vehicle maker Beiqi  Foton Motor  (SS:600166), a BAIC's unit, said last week it aims to sell 4,000 hydrogen vehicles by 2023, and 15,000 such vehicles by 2025.
The announcements came after a finance ministry official said earlier in September that China will roll out a new package of policies to support hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.
China now only has a fleet of over 7,000 hydrogen vehicles, compared with over 4 million pure battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.
Current policies to support electric vehicles offer subsidies on sales. But new supportive policies will require local city governments and companies to build up a more mature supply chain and business model for the industry.
Three industry sources familiar with policy discussions said authorities could announce a new policy as early as this month.
Pilot cities will likely include Beijing, Shanghai, as well as those in northern Shanxi and eastern Jiangsu provinces, according to sources, who declined to be named as the issue is not public.
The Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Some global automakers from Toyota Motor (T:7203) to  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) have already announced plans for hydrogen vehicles in China.

LONDON (Reuters) - A leading investor group has written to the boards of the world's biggest corporate emitters of greenhouse gases, warning they must produce a strategy to move their business to net-zero carbon emissions or face pressure at future AGMs.
Climate Action 100+, whose members include most of the world's biggest investors, collectively managing $47 trillion in assets, said the strategies needed to have clear targets and that companies would be assessed on their performance.
While some companies have already moved to commit to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner, many have not. It can also be hard to compare the relative merits of each company's strategy, which can make engagement harder.
To help fix the problem, CA100+ said on Monday it was launching a new benchmark to help its 500 members and others assess each company's progress on the way to net-zero against a set of 30 indicators.
In a letter to the boards of 161 companies collectively accounting for around 80% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, CA100+ said greater action was needed to meet the terms of the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming.
Specifically, the group called on the companies to create strategies that covered their full value chain - including so-called Scope 3 emissions from each company's products - and were science-based.
Companies also needed to set medium-term objectives and material targets to help demonstrate the longer-term goals were achievable and make it easier for investors to track the necessary changes to their core business strategy.
CA100+ said the companies' response would guide the way investors engage with the boards, ""particularly for unresponsive or poorly performing companies"", which could also include action during future annual general meetings.
""Companies across all sectors need to take more ambitious action to ensure otherwise devastating impacts of climate change are avoided while they still can be,"" said Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, part of the CA100+ coalition.

""The benchmark will ensure it's clear which companies are acting on climate change as a business-critical issue and embracing a net-zero future. Investors will be paying particular attention to those shown to be falling short.""

Investing.com – Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp (T:9984) divested its chip division Arm Ltd to Santa Clara-based Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp in a record deal, seeing its shares soar on the back of the news.
Softbank’s Tokyo shares rose as much as 10% and were up 10.26% to JPY6461 ($60.85) by 12:55 AM ET (5:55 AM GMT), reviving talk of the company going private.
The Japanese company looks to rake in $40 billion from the deal, with Nvidia paying $21.5 billion in stock and $12 billion in cash for Arm, inclusive of a $2 billion payment at signing. The deal also grants Softbank an additional $5 billion, either in cash or stock, when Arm’s performance meets certain targets. Arm employees also stand to benefit from $1.5 billion in Nvidia stock.
The sale, which unwinds a strategic investment, will boost Softbank’s liquidity, allowing founder Masayoshi Son to focus on more tactical investing.
However, obtaining regulatory approval could pose a challenge to both companies, with authorities in China, the U.K., the European Union and U.S. all needing to give the green light. Expected to take up to 18 months, the Chinese approval could take longer amid simmering tensions with the U.S. Another concern is whether Arm can continue to count companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) as customers, with the acquisition putting the companies in direct competition.
Meanwhile, Cambridge U.K.-based Arm counts the likes of Apple, Intel, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Huawei Technologies as licensees. The companies either use Arm designs as the basis of their chips or license the Arm instruction set for their own proprietary products."
1634,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2020 11:18PM ET</span>",Oracle Wins Deal for TikTok’s U.S. Operations,"(Bloomberg) -- TikTok has abandoned talks with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). to sell its music-video app in the U.S., favoring instead a business partnership with  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL)., people familiar with the talks said.
A deal between ByteDance Ltd., TikTok’s Beijing-based parent company, and Oracle is likely to include a stake in a newly configured TikTok business, but will look more like a corporate restructuring than an outright sale, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
The terms being discussed with Oracle are still evolving, one of the people said. For example, Oracle could take a stake of a newly formed U.S. business while serving as TikTok’s U.S. technology partner and housing TikTok’s data in Oracle’s cloud servers. Early offers from both parties valued the U.S. business at about $25 billion, but that was before Chinese officials weighed in with new rules imposing limits on technology exports, said people with knowledge of the matter.
Microsoft, which was working with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc., had been seen as the more likely winner but its talks had cooled in recent days, one person said. Microsoft wasn’t asked to make revisions to its initial offer in the face of recent signs of opposition to a deal from Chinese government officials, the person added.
“ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft,” Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said in a statement on Sunday. “We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests.”
TikTok, Hong Kong and More U.S.-China Flashpoints: QuickTake
Walmart, though, remains interested in making a TikTok investment alongside a consortium of investors led by Oracle. A Walmart spokesperson said Sunday that the company “continues discussions with ByteDance leadership and other interested parties. We know that any approved deal must satisfy all regulatory and national security concerns.”
ByteDance was negotiating bids for TikTok’s U.S. operations under orders from the Trump administration, which has said the company’s Chinese ownership threatens national security. TikTok intends to bring a proposal to the White House ahead of a mid-September deadline imposed by Trump, a person with knowledge of the matter said, and any bid will also need the blessing of government officials in Beijing.
Talk of a corporate restructuring harkens back to ByteDance’s original intentions earlier in the summer to sell a partial stake in TikTok’s operations or restructure the company with a global headquarters and board of directors outside of China. Those aspirations were complicated by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to ban the app in the U.S. and subsequent executive orders, which prohibit U.S. people and businesses from doing business with TikTok.
If ByteDance is able to get a deal through the White House that doesn’t involve an outright, forced sale, it would mark a major feat for ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming, who has been reluctant to hand over such a prized asset. But critics question how a technology partnership with Oracle, rather than an outright sale, would assuage the White House’s national security concerns.
“A deal where Oracle takes over hosting without source code and significant operational changes would not address any of the legitimate concerns about TikTok, and the White House accepting such a deal would demonstrate that this exercise was pure grift,” Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), said in a post on Twitter.
Read more: China Throws a Wrench Into Trump’s Plan to Force TikTok Sale
It’s unclear whether a deal with Oracle would pass muster with the Trump administration, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Some advisers would prefer shutting down TikTok’s U.S. operations if a sale doesn’t meet their demands for putting the business and related data into American hands.
Microsoft representatives declined to comment beyond its statement. Representatives for TikTok declined to comment, and Oracle didn’t respond to requests for comment outside normal business hours. The White House also didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Microsoft was the early front-runner for the acquisition, having started talks with ByteDance weeks before Trump’s executive orders and believing it had the preliminary framework of a deal the U.S. government could back. But events have been moving away from the software giant in recent weeks.
Oracle, a company with a closer relationship to the U.S. president, emerged as a bidder with the backing of Sequoia Capital, a key ByteDance shareholder.
Buying TikTok would have given Microsoft -- which owns the Xbox video-game platform and the LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) professional networking site -- access to an addictive video-sharing app used by more than 100 million people in the U.S. The app, which lets people record and edit short video clips ranging from lighthearted lip-syncs to more serious political statements, has gained popularity during the global pandemic that’s kept many people cooped up indoors.
Read more: Oracle’s Improbable TikTok Talks Have a Simple Explanation: Data
For corporate-software giant Oracle, TikTok is a less obvious fit, but makes sense in light of the company’s desire to build up its cloud-computing and consumer-data businesses. TikTok stores massive amounts of data and currently is a large customer of cloud services run by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google. A partnership with TikTok also resonates with Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison’s cheerleading for American tech interests.
Shortly after bids from Microsoft and Oracle were submitted, the Chinese government announced a plan to be closely involved in approval of any deal and opposition to exporting key algorithms needed in the sale. ByteDance appeared eager for a more limited sort of agreement than Microsoft wanted, where it would retain more control, one of the people familiar with the negotiations said.
For Oracle, a deal with TikTok gives the 43-year-old software maker best known for legacy corporate databases a trove of consumer information to bolster an advertising business. Oracle creates profiles of ordinary people and sells them to companies looking to reach specific audiences. The deal also buoys Oracle’s attempts to expand its cloud-computing business, providing a massive network that TikTok could use to run its application and store data via the internet.
Oracle has nurtured a relationship with Trump since before his administration began. In 2016, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz served on the president’s transition team, and two years later, dined with him at the White House, where she complained about a government contract she deemed unfair, Bloomberg reported. Vice President Mike Pence visited Oracle’s headquarters in Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, California. Catz has contributed more than $125,000 this year to support Trump’s re-election, according to Federal Election Commission data. And Ellison let Trump use one of his California estates to hold a fund-raiser in February.
In recent weeks, the U.S. president had publicly endorsed the Oracle bid and called Ellison a “tremendous guy.” Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro, who earlier came out against a potential sale to Microsoft and had at one time advocated banning TikTok completely, echoed that endorsement during an August appearance on Fox News.
“If you look at Microsoft versus Oracle, the one thing that separates the two companies with respect to national security is that Microsoft has a large footprint in China,” Navarro said. “Oracle on the other hand has a strong reputation of really putting a great firewall between its operations and China and that’s an important thing.”

Investing.com – Asian stocks rose on Monday morning, boosted by renewed hopes of a COIVD-19 vaccine after AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) resumed phase 3 trials, but the buoyancy was subdued ahead of ahead of central bank meetings in Japan, the U.K. and the U.S later in the week.
The British drugmaker said on Saturday that it had resumed U.K. clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, co-developed with the University of Oxford and one of the most advanced in development, after the U.K.’s Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) gave its approval. The trials were suspended during the previous week after a patient participating in the U.K. trials came down with an unspecified illness and cast doubt on the vaccine’s rollout time.
Another pharmaceutical company, this time in the U.S., added to the anticipation a day later.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) CEO Albert Bourla said that the company’s own candidate, co-developed with German drug maker BioNTech, has a “good chance” of submitting key data from late-stage trials to the FDA by the end of October, and once approved, could be rolled out to Americans by the end of the year. Bourla added that the company has already begun to produce the vaccine.
But memories of three U.S. tech stock selloffs in less than two weeks during the previous week led some investors to strike a cautious note.
“With no clear assured path to economic recovery and release from the grips of COVID-19 and with the added geopolitical risks of the fast-approaching U.S. presidential election and then the Brexit deadline at year-end, we expect broad market sentiment to remain fragile for the foreseeable future,” First Abu Dhabi Bank chief economist Simon Ballard told Bloomberg,

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>",Embattled SoftBank renews talks on taking the group private - source,"By Anirban Sen, Joshua Franklin and Sabahatjahan Contractor
(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp executives have held early stage talks about taking the Japanese technology group private as the company seeks a new strategy after disposing of several large assets, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The discussions are driven by frustrations over the persistent discount in SoftBank's equity valuation compared with the value of its individual holdings, which continues even after an asset sale programme tried to close that gap, the source said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are private.
The deliberations are at a very preliminary stage and SoftBank management is divided about whether or not move ahead with the deal, the source cautioned, adding it is not the first time SoftBank executives have held such discussions. 
A spokeswoman for SoftBank, which is led by billionaire Masayoshi Son, declined to comment. News of the talks was first reported by the Financial Times.
Shares in SoftBank on the Tokyo Stock Exchange are down a little over 10% so far in 2020 and are trading at 1,307.50 yen. This is a steeper fall than Japan's Nikkei 225 Index and below the 1,500 yen price at which it sold units in its 2018 initial public offing (IPO). 
The IPO, still Japan's biggest-ever stock market listing, was widely regarded at the time as finalizing the group's transition from domestic telecommunications company to a global tech investor.
Yet since then, SoftBank has faced a host of challenges including losses on investments made by its $100 billion Vision Fund, activist pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management and questions regarding significant option purchases during the recent run-up in the U.S. stock market. 
The talks on taking SoftBank private have also come as SoftBank has shifted its business strategy to become a long-term investor in businesses rather than a manager of companies.
SoftBank's recent investment track record has been checkered, including a large bet on shared office provider WeWork, resulting in SoftBank reporting an $18 billion loss at the Vision Fund in May, pushing the conglomerate to a record loss.
SoftBank announced on Monday it had agreed to sell British chip designer Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp for as much as $40 billion in a cash and share deal.

It is possible the go-private talks could gain momentum following the Arm sale, the source said.

The deal provides Gilead access to Immunomedics' breast cancer treatment drug, Trodelvy, which was granted an accelerated FDA approval in April.
Gilead said it would issue a tender offer to buy all the outstanding shares of Immunomedics for $88 per share, representing a premium of about 108% over their last closing price of $42.25 on Sept 11.
""This acquisition represents significant progress in Gilead's work to build a strong and diverse oncology portfolio,"" Gilead Chief Executive Officer Daniel O'Day said in a statement. ""Trodelvy is an approved, transformational medicine for a form of cancer that is particularly challenging to treat. We will now continue to explore its potential to treat many other types of cancer,""
Immunomedics is also on track to file for regulatory approval for Trodelvy in Europe in the first half of 2021, according to the statement.
The offer will be funded with $15 billion in cash on hand, and through $6 billion in newly issued debt, according to the drugmaker.
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020, the companies said.
The acquisition of Immunomedics is the latest of the several Gilead inked this year with the aim of expanding its oncology portfolio.
It bought a 49.9% stake in cancer drug developer Pionyr Immunotherapeutics in June for $275 million, just months after paying $4.9 billion for Forty Seven Inc, maker of an experimental treatment that targets blood cancer.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is signaling it might not compensate major telecommunications providers if the federal government bans equipment made by China's Huawei from 5G networks, setting up a potential fight over a bill that could hit C$1 billion ($758 million).
Canada, under pressure from the United States to ban Huawei Technologies Co Ltd gear on security grounds, is studying whether to allow the firm into the country's next-generation 5G networks. 
If Ottawa does announce a formal ban, the affected companies have made clear they want compensation for tearing out their existing Huawei gear, said two sources close to the matter. 
But the Liberal government, already pressing wireless providers to cut what it says are excessively high bills, seems less convinced.
""I'm not sure there is a solid legal case that we would have to compensate for making a proper national security decision,"" said a government source who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. Federal politicians, said the source, also had to worry about ""the public perception of handing over a billion dollars or more to very large companies.""
Ottawa has spent almost two years studying whether to allow Huawei into 5G networks and in June, with no sign of a decision coming any time soon, impatient Canadian providers took matters into their own hands.
Bell Canada and Telus (NYSE:TU) Corp said they would partner with Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA), even though they use Huawei in their 4G networks. 
Technical experts say it is hard to marry one company's 5G equipment with 4G gear from another provider. This effectively means the decision to go with Ericsson would eventually force Telus and Bell to remove the Chinese firm's 4G equipment. 
Bell and Telus do not have to act immediately, since a crucial auction of spectrum needed for 5G networks will not happen until June 2021. 
In a February 2019 filing, Telus said a ban without compensation could increase the cost of its 5G network deployment and make services more expensive for consumers. 
Telus did not respond to a query as to whether it still felt the same way about compensation. Bell did not respond to a request for comment. 
Scotiabank analysts said on June 2 it would cost Bell a total of between C$300 million and $350 million over three to five years to strip out Huawei gear. At the same time, BMO estimated Telus had roughly double the exposure than that of Bell.
In March, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to provide $1 billion to help small providers replace equipment made by Huawei and Chinese firm ZTE (HK:0763). 
Canada's government is on track to run up the highest budget deficit since World War Two as it tackles the coronavirus outbreak and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will on Sept 23 outline major measures to revive the economy. 
""We obviously want to spend money on things we feel are going to grow the economy rather than on something like that (compensation),"" said the government source. 
One person directly familiar with the file took a more jaundiced view, noting that while Britain had told firms to remove their Huawei equipment, it had given them until 2027.
The person said this also happened to be the time when the gear would become obsolete and require replacement.
""I don't think the thinking in the Canadian government is dissimilar with respect to that question,"" said the person. 

The office of Canada Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains - which will announce the decision on Huawei and 5G - said it would be premature to discuss future actions.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Two senior  Boeing Co  (N:BA) executives who oversaw the development of the 737 MAX defended the company's decisions on a key cockpit system later tied to two fatal crashes, according to testimony before congressional investigators seen by Reuters.
Michael Teal, then 737 MAX chief product engineer, and Keith Leverkuhn, who was vice president and general manager of the 737 MAX program, were questioned separately by investigators for the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in May.
""I don't consider the development of the airplane to be a failure,"" Leverkuhn told investigators for the House panel that is to release a final report next week on its investigation into the development of the plane, grounded since March 2019 after two crashes killed 346 people.
Leverkuhn defended the decision to tie a new safety system on the MAX, called MCAS, to a single sensor that has been implicated in both fatal crashes. Boeing has since agreed to use data from two separate sensors when the plane returns to service, which could come as early as this year.
""I think based upon our understanding and our assumptions of flight crew actions, that it wasn't a mistake,"" Leverkuhn said.
Later in his testimony, Leverkuhn added, ""Clearly what was in error was our assumptions regarding the human machine interaction. Because the process relied on the industry standard of pilot reaction to a particular failure. And what was clear post accidents was that assumption was incorrect.""
Congressional investigators also questioned testimony that Boeing had never conducted an internal financial analysis to determine the impact of whether the Federal Aviation Administration would require more expensive simulator training. 
Teal said that if the 737 MAX design warranted simulator training, Boeing would have created it, while acknowledging that customers may have been disappointed.
""Would airlines have been pleased with that, of course they would not have,"" he said, noting that Boeing had signaled all along that simulator training would not be necessary.
Last year, Boeing confirmed it had agreed to pay Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) a $1 million per MAX rebate if the training were required.
In January, Boeing reversed course and said it would recommend simulator training for all pilots before the MAX returns to service.
Teal, now the 777X chief project engineer, said the planemaker has since revised some pilot assumptions in the aftermath of the 737 MAX crashes. ""It's a learning that we are now putting forth on the new aircraft,"" he said.
The interviews show both executives were unaware of some key details about MCAS and other MAX features during development.
Boeing said Sunday the pair supervised the work of hundreds of engineers ""and could not have been, involved in every design decision and necessarily relied on engineering specialists to perform the detailed design and certification work associated with individual systems.""

Boeing confirmed Leverkuhn retired earlier this year as he had long planned.

""The survival of Air France-KLM is not a given,"" Hoekstra said in an interview on Dutch public television.
""They will have to address their cost base even as things stand now. And suppose this situation lasts until the end of next year, then they will have to cut even deeper."" 
Air France-KLM's immediate future was secured by the French and Dutch governments in July, as they provided a total of 10.4 billion euros ($12.3 billion) in bailout loans and guarantees to help the group survive the disastrous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel.
In return for the support, Dutch arm KLM has said it would cut another 1,500 jobs, reducing its staff by 20%, while a pay hike agreed for 2020 was frozen by the company.
French arm Air France plans to cut 6,500 jobs, or 16% of its workforce, through 2022. 
So far, however, KLM has failed to reach an agreement with unions on the cuts needed to meet the requirements set by the Dutch government.
Hoekstra indicated a thorough restructuring would be necessary for governments to contemplate further support.
""KLM will always be very important for the Dutch economy. But the question is whether that will be enough"", he said.

Air France-KLM said last month that it was losing 10 million euros per day due to the coronavirus crisis.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2020 05:12AM ET</span>","With airline fleets grounded, plane recyclers bet on parts boom","By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - As COVID-19 grounds swaths of airline fleets, companies that profit off the dismantling and trade of aircraft parts are seeing early signs of an expected rebound in activity as carriers accelerate plane retirements. 
While companies that store, dismantle, and buy and sell used aircraft parts see opportunity in parked planes, a sudden increase in the supply of used parts risks depressing prices in the estimated $3 billion a year industry, despite demand from airlines seeking to lower maintenance costs, executives and analysts say.
Even as aviation remains in a slump because of the pandemic, the head of U.S. commercial aerospace company GA Telesis was made aware of five airlines calling for offers to dismantle planes.
Across the border, Canada's Aerocycle is bidding to buy grounded planes for the first time to dismantle and resell for parts, instead of just recycling aircraft on consignment from carriers, its CEO said.
The fate of the world's pool of grounded planes is being closely watched by players in the market for used-serviceable material, with one report from consultants Oliver Wyman forecasting ""a tsunami of demand"" for such parts, as airlines seek to lower costs. 
Used materials could compete with new parts and defer immediate airline demand for ""aftermarket"" spend, referring to the maintenance, repair and overhaul sector, now estimated by Naveo Consultancy at $50 billion.
As a result, one industry executive said he has avoided buying parts, fearing a slump if too many planes are dismantled.
""I think we’re going to see a rapid decrease in pricing,” said the executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The number of planes dismantled for parts or scrap could double to 1,000 annually through 2023, up from roughly 400 to 500 planes a year since 2016, according to data firm Cirium. 
Naveo estimates 60% of global passenger and cargo fleets are currently flying.
In 2020, Naveo expects 2,000 aircraft will be retired, or parked and not returned to service, up from 680 in 2019. But those planes would not all be immediately dismantled, as some carriers wait in case market conditions improve, Managing Director Richard Brown says. 
Indeed, UK-based Air Salvage International, which normally dismantles between 40 and 50 aircraft a year, has parked more planes without a buyer for their parts since the COVID-19 outbreak. Founder Mark Gregory expects most will eventually be dismantled.
Before the pandemic, planes arrived at Air Salvage with a buyer, reflecting healthy demand for coveted parts like engines. 
Airlines seek viable used parts from retired aircraft for their younger planes that are due for heavy maintenance. That allowed airlines to avoid costly repairs and keep their aircraft flying.
GA Telesis, which counts Tokyo Century Corp (T:8439) as its largest shareholder, has seen airlines use spare parts from their grounded aircraft to put off maintenance at the company's repair business, chief executive Abdol Moabery said.
EARLY RETIREMENTS
The pandemic, which is expected result in a 55% drop in 2020 passenger numbers, has prompted early retirements of older planes, including the grounding of B747 jets by British Airways, some of which are headed to Air Salvage.
Fewer twin-aisle planes flying internationally means less demand for their parts, with the exception of certain aircraft used to transport cargo.
Gregory said Air Salvage was approached by an aircraft leasing company about dismantling several A380s, but with only about 5% of the jumbo jets still active according to Naveo, demand is slim for their parts. 
Airlines are looking for narrowbody parts, since around 64% of that single-aisle aircraft type are active, flying domestic routes.
James Benfield, a UK partner with Baird Capital, expects increased demand for disassembly services for single-aisle B737 and A320 aircraft, after the private equity company acquired a disassembler in August.
While maintenance companies and new engine producers also deal in used materials, a parts surplus could weigh on their sales.
 General Electric  Co's (N:GE) CEO said during a July earnings call that the company is ""well positioned to participate"" in the industry trend for used serviceable material. 
GE Aviation makes engines, but also uses second-hand parts. 
BARGAIN HUNTERS
Aerocycle sees opportunity in plane retirements. The small aircraft recycler has hired a new business development executive to drive demand, as it looks to buy planes, CEO Ron Haber said. 
""It's a calculated risk,"" Haber said. ""We know what type of aircraft are going to be flying and still in high demand.""
Airlines have avoided selling aircraft at losses, despite pressure from certain bargain-hunters.
""There's a lot of low-balling going on,"" Moabery said. ""But those offers aren't being accepted yet.""
Companies like Florida-based International Aircraft Associates (IAA (NYSE:IAA)) are watching in case airlines and lessors cut their losses by year's end and convert their parked planes for parts.

""If they do that, that's when people like us want to be ready,"" IAA President Mitch Weinberg said.

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2020 10:35PM ET</span>","Exclusive: India's secondary listing plan for firms joining foreign markets irks investors, sources say","By Aditya Kalra, Aditi Shah and Abhirup Roy
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian companies that list overseas will have to later launch on a domestic bourse under policy changes being considered by government officials, sources told Reuters, a move that global investors fear will harm valuations.
India said in March it would allow local firms to directly list abroad to better access foreign capital for growth, but the rules have yet to be decided. Currently only certain types of securities such as depository receipts are able to be listed in foreign markets, and only after the companies go public in India. 
The new policy, aimed at helping local firms achieve better valuations, could be a shot in the arm for Indian unicorn start-ups valued at over $1 billion and Reliance's (NS:RELI) digital unit which is eyeing a U.S. listing after raising over $20 billion from global names like KKR & Co (N:KKR).
But in recent weeks Indian officials told global investors and companies in meetings they were considering mandating a secondary listing for local companies on Indian bourses after they list abroad, five sources said.
The time period under consideration for such a requirement ranges from 6 months to 3 years, sources said.
A separate senior regulatory source in India said ""dual listing was being considered by the (finance) ministry for sure,"" but a final position on the matter has not been reached.
Japan's SoftBank (T:9984) and an Indian payment firm it backs, Paytm, as well as Reliance and U.S.-based Sequoia Capital have conveyed to the government the secondary listing provision risks splitting trading volumes, hurting long-term valuations and raising compliance needs and costs, the sources added.
""To require companies to subsequently list in India will make these rules meaningless,"" said a senior executive working at a global venture-capital firm. 
SoftBank and Sequoia have invested in various Indian firms like ride-hailing company Ola and hospitality firm Oyo. Foreign listings could provide exits for such investors at higher valuations but also allow Indian firms, especially from the tech sector, to access specialised investors abroad who can better value their companies.
The rules are being drafted by the finance and corporate affairs ministries, in discussion with the capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and will be finalised in coming weeks.
Spokespeople for SEBI and the two ministries did not respond to a request for comment. A SoftBank spokeswoman said ""we never comment on confidential policy discussions"". Sequoia, Paytm and Reliance did not respond to requests for a comment. 
GOING FOR GROWTH
Currently, Indian companies can list locally and then access foreign equity capital through instruments like American Depository Receipts (ADRs), a route used by India's  Infosys  (NS:INFY) and ICICI Bank (NS:ICBK).
India is concerned that the upcoming policy change will mean that companies hunting for higher valuations through access to a wider group of investors, would choose to only list abroad, the sources said. That risks hitting the growth ambitions of Indian capital markets and depriving local investors of the wealth-creation opportunity.
""The government needs to balance Indian aspirations so that (domestic) investors can invest in these companies,"" said Siddarth Pai, Founding Partner at Indian investment firm 3one4 Capital. ""This is a trailblazing endeavour, if India plays its cards right.""
India's equity market has a capitalisation of $2 trillion, compared with $39.3 trillion for the United States.
Between January and June this year, companies raised $23.6 billion via 63 initial public offerings (IPOs) on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq (O:NDAQ), compared with $2.3 billion raised on Mumbai's stock exchanges through 18 listings, data from Refinitiv showed. 
Lobbying group USIBC, part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has this week been seeking feedback on the plan from members in an e-mail saying ""the hope is"" there will be no dual listing requirement.

A 2018 SEBI report listed 10 possible foreign markets for overseas listings, including the United States and the United Kingdom.

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp is close to a deal to buy British chip designer Arm Holdings from SoftBank Group Corp for more than $40 billion in a deal which would create a giant in the chip industry, according to two people familiar with the matter.
A cash and stock deal for Arm could be announced as early as next week, the sources said.
Nvidia is known for its graphics chips that power video games, but it has developed other markets including artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and data centers.
Arm supplies the chip technology for virtually all mobile devices such as phones and tablets but is also expanding into processors for cars, datacenter services and other devices.
The British company does not make chips. Instead it licenses out the underlying technology so others can make chips with it. It has previously collaborated with Nvidia.
Last year Nvidia said it would make its chips work with processors from Arm to build supercomputers, deepening its push into systems that are used for modeling both climate change predictions and nuclear weapons.
SoftBank acquired Arm for $32 billion in 2016, its largest-ever purchase, in part to expand into the internet-of-things technology, which connects everyday devices from traffic signals to refrigerators to the internet.
The terms would mark a big win for the Japanese company which has struggled to jump-start growth in the business, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported on the deal earlier.

Nvidia declined to comment. SoftBank and Arm did not respond to Reuters' requests for comments.

LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) has resumed British clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine, one of the most advanced in development, after getting the green light from safety watchdogs, the company said on Saturday.
The late-stage trials of the experimental vaccine, developed with researchers from the University of Oxford, were suspended this week after an illness in a study subject in Britain, casting doubts on an early rollout.
""On 6 September, the standard review process triggered a voluntary pause to vaccination across all global trials to allow review of safety data by independent committees, and international regulators,"" AstraZeneca said.
It added that safety reviewers had recommended to Britain's Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) that it was safe to resume the British trials.
The patient involved in the study had been reportedly suffering from neurological symptoms associated with a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.
AstraZeneca, based in Cambridge, said it could not disclose further medical information. 
""The Company will continue to work with health authorities across the world and be guided as to when other clinical trials can resume to provide the vaccine broadly, equitably and at no profit during this pandemic,"" AstraZeneca said.
It declined to elaborate further on when other global trials were expected to restart.
The Serum Institute of India said it would restart its trials once it had permission from the Drugs Controller General of India.
Brazil's health regulator ANVISA said it was awaiting notice from the British MHRA confirming that resumption of trials has been authorized before resuming in Brazil. 
The Federal University of Sao Paulo, which is conducting the paused trials, said in a statement that 4,600 of the planned 5,000 volunteers have been recruited and vaccinated without any of them reporting any serious health issues.
Governments around the world are desperate for a vaccine to help end the pandemic, which has caused more than 900,000 deaths and global economic turmoil. The World Health Organization (WHO) had flagged AstraZeneca's as the most promising.
The vaccine is in late-stage clinical trials in the United States, Britain, Brazil and South Africa and additional trials are planned in Japan and Russia.
'WAKE-UP CALL'
The pause of the trials came after reports that the United States was aiming for fast-track authorization or approval of a vaccine before November's presidential election. 
Leading U.S. and European vaccine developers have pledged to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards for their experimental vaccines and not bow to political pressures to rush the process.
AstraZeneca has already agreed to supply close to three billion doses to governments across the globe - more than any other vaccine project.
The WHO's chief scientist said the pause in the trials should serve as a ""wake-up"" call that there would be ups and downs in the development of a vaccine.
""Inevitably with such a large trial there will be times when safety issues arise,"" said Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London.

""We must all hope that there are no future events and that the vaccine proves both safe and effective.""

1650,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 12, 2020 07:24AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Workhorse Eyes Electric Van Sales, With or Without USPS","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- It pays to be in the business of electric vehicles. 
Workhorse Group Inc (NASDAQ:WKHS) has rallied nearly 1,500% since hitting a 2020 low in March, but the stock really took off in late June, when the company received federal approval for its C650 and C1000 delivery vans.
That said, those looking for immediate gratification may want to look elsewhere. Ramping up takes time. 
The Loveland, Ohio-based company delivered three C-series electric step vans to Ryder System (NYSE:R) and Electric Vehicle Fleet Solutions, and should start producing five vans a day in the fourth quarter for  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), which has an order for about 1,000 vehicles.
And the big bucks are yet to come. A big part of why shares have rallied so is that Workhorse submitted one of three proposals for a U.S. Postal Service contract worth about $6.3 billion. That is expected to be awarded by the end of the year.
But even if they don't get the award, Workhorse Chief Financial Officer Steve Schrader says he is not worried.  
""The post office is transforming, obviously, but I like our business even without it,"" Schrader said in a phone interview.
Michael Shlisky, a senior equity research analyst at Colliers International, is the lone analyst with a hold rating on Workhorse -- four others say buy -- and he agrees with Schrader.
""Some portion of the run up is due to the fact that they might win the USPS contract,"" Shlisky said in a phone interview. ""We still think it's a great company whether or not they get the contract.”  
Workhorse peer Nikola has gotten some unwanted attention from an activist short-seller this week. The stock soared on an earlier announcement of a deal with General Motors (NYSE:GM), only to slump Thursday and Friday after Hindenburg Research called Nikola a fraud. Nikola, which intends to make trucks of the semi variety and a pick-up truck called the Badger, has strenuously objected to Hindenburg's report. The company has yet to produce any vehicles.
The demand for last-mile delivery vehicles is estimated at more than 350,000 a year, representing an estimated annual addressable market of $18 billion.
""This is the fastest growing segment of transportation,"" Schrader said, adding that Workhorse's product is unique. 
""We have a head start on the competition,"" Schrader said. ""Everybody else is on the chalkboard, saying they will build something in a couple years."" 
The here and now might want to speed up. In August, the company reported a loss per share of 31 cents compared to the estimated 11 cents on sales of $91,940, compared to the expected $275,000. 
Still, in July, BTIG raised its price target to $26, the second-highest on the Street, assuming Workhorse will produce about eight vans a day next year, and secure a portion of the USPS contract.
This summer, Workhorse clinched two key partnerships. Ryder System will offer the C-Series through its ChoiceLease and SelectCare product lines, as well as for short-term rentals. And Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) will provide an operational assessment of Workhorse's manufacturing and operational capabilities, while partner Hitachi Capital America will assist in developing a national dealer network and offer vehicle financing.
""Hitachi can help the company drive customer orders as a well-known and respected player in the commercial leasing and finance industry,"" Chief Executive Officer Duane Hughes said in an Aug. 31 statement. 
If those opportunities weren't enough to entice investors, in August, Workhorse's strategic partner Lordstown Motors agreed to a merger with  Diamondpeak Holdings Corp  Class A (NASDAQ:DPHC)., a special purpose acquisition company, that will result in LMC becoming a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq under the ticker ""RIDE."" 
Post-transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, Workhorse will retain its 10% ownership stake in the merged company, which is estimated at approximately $160 million based on a $1.6 billion valuation, as well as other royalty considerations. 
Finally, there is Workhorse's drone, which is linked to trucks and sets them apart, Schrader said.
""When the pandemic started, interest in our drone took off exponentially,"" Schrader said.
And while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) have been testing drone delivery from fixed locations, Workhorse has the only patent for drones taking off from trucks. Since the Federal Aviation Administration has limited the distance drones can fly, those that can take off from a truck have a leg up, Shlisky said.
So while concrete results still elude the company, opportunities are popping up all over the place.
""All that has to happen is one of these four or five things has to work,"" Shlisky said. 
Of course, much of this was true when it was a $2 stock -- an easy pitch, Shlisky said. The story's little changed, but now it's trading around $23. That's a bit of a harder sell.

""I consider cantonal banks with implicit or explicit state guarantees and tax privileges a major market distortion in the Swiss private sector,"" he told weekly Schweiz am Wochenende in an interview published on Saturday. 
Cantonal bank are retail banks in which regional governments hold significant stakes and shareholder voting rights. Liabilities of the majority of the cantonal banks are guaranteed by the owning canton. 
""A normal bank pays on average about 20% taxes and pays out 50% of profits to its shareholders. I do not see any reason why cantonal banks should not do the same,"" Gottstein added.
Credit Suisse has approved around 3.3 billion Swiss francs ($3.6 billion) for coronavirus-related emergency lending so far, he also told the paper. He confirmed the lender's plan to pay out the second dividend tranche for 2019 in autumn.
Gottstein said he had observed that family offices and wealthy private clients have started moving to Switzerland out of fear that other European countries could increase taxes including on wealth and inheritance to deal with the pandemic.
""This is a chance for our financial market and the private banking,"" he said.
There were currently no plans to re-enter the U.S. wealth management market but that was something to look at in the medium and long term, the CEO added.

Disney's $200 million live-action remake of its animated classic about a female warrior in ancient China has run into controversy for being partly filmed in the Xinjiang region, where China's clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims has been criticized by some governments, including the United States, and human rights groups.
""Disney's apparent cooperation with officials of the People's Republic of China (PRC) who are most responsible for committing atrocities - or for covering up those crimes - is profoundly disturbing,"" the Republican senators and representatives wrote in Friday's letter.
It urged Disney to make a detailed explanation.
The letter was retweeted by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), which monitors human rights and the rule of law and submits an annual report to President Donald Trump and Congress. 
Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The lawmakers, including former presidential candidate Marco Rubio, a Republican senator who co-chairs the CECC, said information on Beijing's role in the detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang was all over the media before the filming of ""Mulan."" 
""The decision to film parts of Mulan in cooperation with the local security and propaganda elements, offers tacit legitimacy to those perpetrators of crimes that may warrant the designation of genocide.""
China's foreign ministry has repeatedly denied the existence reeducation camps in the region, calling the facilities vocational and educational institutions and accusing what it calls anti-China forces of smearing its Xinjiang policy.
The lawmakers also asked Disney about the use of local labor, Uighurs or other ethnic minority labor, ""as well as due diligence performed to ensure that no forced labor was used during the film's production.""
The film, out on Disney's streaming service in many markets, was released in China on Friday and earned 46 million yuan ($6.7 million) at the box office by 8 p.m. (1200 GMT). 

The Trump administration said this week it has prepared orders to block imports of cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over the accusations of forced labor.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) said on Friday it had hired a Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) executive to run compliance for its Institutional Clients Group (ICG).
Jennifer Taylor will start as chief compliance officer for the ICG in December and will be based in the UK, according to a memo signed by Chief Compliance Officer Mary McNiff and ICG Chief Executive Officer Paco Ybarra. 
Taylor was most recently a regional head of compliance and operational risk at Bank of America and has also served as general counsel for different business lines across the Asia Pacific region.
""She has deep product knowledge across the institutional space and a proven track record in driving and embedding a compliance culture across a global franchise,"" the memo said. 
In her new role Taylor will be responsible for designing and executing risk management functions across the ICG, which accounted for more than half of revenue and two-thirds of profit for the third-largest U.S. bank last year. 

Regulators began giving Citi's operations a closer look last month after a high profile error caused the bank to misplace nearly $1 billion of its own funds.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Warner Bros movie studio on Friday postponed the debut of superhero sequel ""Wonder Woman 1984"" until Christmas Day as many theaters remain closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The film starring Gal Gadot had been scheduled for release in cinemas on Oct. 2 but will now debut on Dec. 25. It was the next big-budget Hollywood movie slated for theaters. 
""Because I know how important it is to bring this movie to you on a big screen when all of us can share the experience together, I’m hopeful you won’t mind waiting just a little bit longer,"" director Patty Jenkins said in a statement.
Movie studios have been shuffling their schedules for months as the industry tries to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced theaters around the world to shut their doors in March.
Cinemas have slowly reopened with capacity limits, and moviegoing is rebounding in countries such as China, the world's second-largest film market. But in the United States, theaters remain closed in major moviegoing hubs including Los Angeles and New York.
Warner Bros., owned by AT&T Inc, tested the market with the release of Christopher Nolan's thriller ""Tenet"" in late August. The movie, which cost more than $200 million to produce, had generated global ticket sales of $146.2 million through last weekend.
The next upcoming Hollywood blockbuster is ""Black Widow"" from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Marvel Studios. It is currently due to debut in theaters on Nov. 6.

James Bond movie ""No Time to Die,"" from Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Universal Pictures and MGM Studios, is scheduled for Nov. 20.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A training review for the grounded Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX will begin on Monday in London, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said, in a key milestone for the plane's eventual return to service.
The FAA said the Joint Operations Evaluation Board for the Boeing 737 MAX will take place at London Gatwick Airport and meet for approximately nine days ""to review Boeing’s proposed training for 737 MAX flight crews"" and will include civil aviation authorities and airline flight crews from the United States, Canada, Brazil and the European Union.
There are several other key steps to be completed that raise questions about if there will be any 737 MAX commercial flights before 2021.
Boeing did not immediately comment. 
This week in Vancouver, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency conducted flight tests of the Boeing 737 MAX after Canada conducted its own tests. 
The best-selling plane has been grounded globally since March 2019 after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people. 
Boeing has said it expects to win necessary approvals ""in time to support resumption of deliveries during the fourth quarter."" 
A Boeing spokesman said Friday all remaining steps are ""incorporated in our estimate. Not new hurdles or comment periods we didn’t expect."" 
After the nine-day review, the results will be incorporated into the draft FAA Flight Standardization Board report, which will be then be open for public comment.
Then, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson will undergo recommended training and conduct an evaluation flight at the controls of a Boeing 737 MAX. He will share observations with FAA technical staff.
The FAA will then review Boeing’s final design documentation to evaluate compliance with FAA regulations. The multi-agency technical advisory board will review the Boeing submission and issue a report prior to a final FAA determination of compliance.
The FAA will then issue a notice of pending significant safety actions and publish a final directive addressing known issues for grounding and advises operators of required corrective actions before aircraft may re-enter commercial service.
Then the FAA plans to rescind the grounding order.

The FAA will retain authority to issue airworthiness and export certificates for all 737 MAX airplanes manufactured since the grounding and will perform in-person, individual reviews of these aircraft.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.48%, or 131 points, after gaining 294 points intraday. The S&P 500 was up 0.05%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.60% in its week since March.

Lee also backed ""epicenter"" stocks, or those impacted by the pandemic. These stocks ""are going to be primary contributors to EPS growth in 2021, thus, we see better risk/reward.""
Tech moved off its lows of the day, but ended the week negative, led by weakness in the Fab 5. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended the day lower.
Apple came under added pressure after JPMorgan raised concerns about slowing sales ahead of the tech giant's 5G-enabled iPhone slated to launch later this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market pullback has raised hopes that the Federal Reserve will ramp up asset purchases to boost the economy, but the sell-off was not steep enough to warrant any action, according to market participants, strategists and an advisor to the U.S. Treasury.
What is more likely is for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to set U.S. monetary policy, to switch its Treasury purchases toward more long-dated debt to keep long-term yields low, some strategists said.
The Fed can increase the assets it holds during times of stress to stimulate the economy, or sell them when the economy is in danger of overheating. It has boosted its balance sheet from $4 trillion to $7 trillion since the coronavirus outbreak.
A technology-driven stock rally had lifted the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) 15% since the beginning of July to its peak close on Sept. 2. The Nasdaq Composite index (IXIC) rose 21% over the same period.
However, a brutal sell-off in heavyweight tech stocks pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory on Tuesday, commonly defined as a fall of 10% or more from a recent peak. Since then, the market has partially stabilized.
Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of macro research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, said it would take another sudden and dramatic fall in markets before the Fed would even consider stepping up its buying.
""The Fed will have no issues with the level of equities at this point,"" said Rajadhyaksha, who is on a committee that advises the U.S. Treasury on debt management and the economy. ""I think that you would need them to fall another 10%, at least, quickly, before the Fed even starts to take notice.""
Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities, also said equity sell-offs would not concern the Fed.
""A few declines after a massive rally is really not going to do it for them. They are looking for signs of instability,"" he said.
Some investors were looking for increased Fed buying to support the market.
Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer at SkyBridge, an alternative investments firm, said the fact the Fed's balance sheet had remained static for 12 weeks was part of the reason for investor caution.
""Unless we get another round of balance sheet expansion and another re-acceleration of money supply growth then markets are going to be much more two way and volatile,"" he said.
The Fed has slowed purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed debt as markets recover from chronic liquidity problems in March, when panic over the coronavirus sent stocks tumbling and resulted in logjams across debt markets.
It has bought around $190 billion of these securities in the past month, compared with as much as $125 billion a day during the worst of the panic in March.
The Fed has also reduced its average daily corporate bond purchases from around $300 million, when the program was introduced in May, to $26 million last week, as credit spreads have tightened.
The Fed last stepped up its corporate debt buying in June, which came after equity market sell-offs and widening investment grade credit spreads.
A decline in repo loans that were increased to loosen funding conditions during the market rout has kept the Fed's balance sheet steady at around $7 trillion since May, even as debt purchases continue at lower levels.

The Fed has committed to buying at least $120 billion monthly in Treasury and mortgage-backed assets and pledged it would do whatever was needed to ensure liquidity remains in the market.

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",U.S. proposes to waive minimum flight requirements for airlines until March 2021,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it favors the extension of temporary waivers of minimum flight requirements at some U.S. airports through late March 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Airlines can lose their slots at congested airports if they do not use them at least 80% of the time. The FAA said it proposed extending temporary waivers of the requirements at New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that were set to expire in October.
At four other U.S. airports where the FAA has a formal schedule-review process - Chicago O’Hare, Newark, Los Angeles and San Francisco - the agency proposes to extend credits to airlines for flights that were canceled due to the coronavirus as though those flights were operated.
The FAA said it planned to impose some conditions on the waivers and that slots that are not operated for extended periods should be made available to other airlines on a temporary basis.
American Airlines Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), Inc JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) and United Airlines (O:UAL) last week urged the administration to extend relief.
Major airline groups cited ""historically low levels of bookings, with overall bookings down 82% year-on-year for 2020 compared to the outlook for 2019; consumer demand that continues to fall... and the need for schedule flexibility to support sustainable loads,"" the FAA said.
 Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) opposed extension of the waivers, arguing that ""public policy should be directed toward enabling the free market to reallocate the use of these slots/authorizations – a public resource – such that passengers receive greater choice among offerings in these key markets.”
The FAA said its proposal ""reflects a delicate balancing of the competing interests of carriers interested in conducting ad hoc operations... against the interests of incumbent carriers seeking maximum flexibility in making scheduling and
operational decisions in an uncertain environment with ongoing COVID-19-related impacts."" 

Delta told the FAA it projected operating 50%-60% of its slot portfolio in New York and Washington airports in November.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Fed meeting in focus as stocks wobble and coronavirus bill stalls,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are shifting their focus to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting next week as they seek cues following a recent technology-led U.S. market sell-off. 
So far, few believe the past week’s volatility in stocks - which knocked the Nasdaq (IXIC) down as much as 10% from its highs and rocked other indexes - is the start of a larger sell-off that will throw the market off its course after a six-month rally.
Some worry, however, that the moves may herald the start of a volatile period, as a much-awaited fiscal aid package stalls in the Senate and the U.S. presidential election looms. That’s left investors looking to the Fed for its view of the nascent U.S. economic recovery and what the central bank may do if markets continue to slide. 
""The market, especially in absence of that fiscal policy package, is looking for the Fed to do even more,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. ""And it's not clear that they can do more or how much they're willing to do, at least at this point.""
The Fed slashed rates to near zero in March as stocks plunged on fears of the economic impact from the coronavirus, and has rolled out lending programs to support businesses and households. It is also buying tens of billions of bonds monthly to keep markets functioning smoothly.
Despite stocks’ recent slide, some market participants believe equities would have to tumble much further for the Fed to act. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that while the central bank will keep its foot on the monetary policy gas, lawmakers also need to help with recovery relief, making the government’s failure to pass the next round of stimulus an increasingly worrying development to some investors.
“We have an economy that has not yet cleared the woods of the pandemic,"" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""These risks that were ... maybe hidden a bit by all this stimulus are now starting to be highlighted and more transparent.""
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits hovered at high levels last week, suggesting the labor market recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was stalling as government financial aid to businesses and the unemployed dries up.
Analysts at BofA Global Research noted that September tends to be the weakest month of the year, with stocks notching gains less than half the time and the S&P 500’s average return at minus 1%. 
The bank’s data also shows that markets tend to dip in the weeks ahead of an election, then rallying after. In this case, among investors' concerns is that the Nov 3 vote will be unclear or disputed.
Investors are also hoping to learn more about the Fed’s strategic decision to allow periods of higher inflation as it puts more emphasis on bolstering the labor market.
Modestly higher real yields after the Fed’s shift on inflation have contributed to the recent wobble in tech-related stocks, analysts at Oxford Economics said in a report. 
""It'll just give us a bit more clarity in terms of how they are going to be looking at their mandate going forward,"" said Eric Theoret, global macro strategist with Manulife Investment Management.
Investors will also be looking to the Fed's summary of economic projections, known as the ""dot plot,"" for clues on how quickly the central bank expects labor markets to recover and how soon it may lift rates from record lows.
""I think the 2023 dots will be the ones everybody’s staring at,” said Jon Hill, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets.

The report https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-11/softbank-reconsiders-options-trading-strategy-that-hurt-shares?sref=y3YMCJ4e said SoftBank executives had met investors in recent days to assure them that the bets are ""relatively conservative"".
SoftBank has told investors that its positions have been concentrated in a few blue-chip tech companies, including  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), and have involved call spreads rather than highly leveraged short-term bets, according to the report. 
The group has made significant option purchases during the run-up in the U.S. stock market in recent weeks as a way of temporarily investing some proceeds from asset sales, people familiar with the matter told Reuters https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-softbank-group/softbank-option-purchases-raise-eyebrows-as-wall-street-backtracks-idUSKBN25V2DZ last week. 
Robust options activity from institutions like SoftBank and hordes of retail investors is widely believed to have contributed to last month's big run-up in stocks, as well as a recent sell-off.
Call options gain in value when prices rise, while puts rise when prices fall.
Buying options can be a cheaper way of investing in an underlying security than direct purchases; but selling uncovered options can be extremely risky. 
SoftBank, which has a history of making opaque trades through derivatives, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

SoftBank has debated internally about disclosing more details of its derivatives trading, but founder Masayoshi Son, has been reluctant to provide more information, the Bloomberg report said.

The advert by its TRESemmé brand, was posted on drugstore  Clicks  Group's (J:CLSJ) website last Friday, and described images of African black hair as ""frizzy and dull,"" while a white woman's hair was referred to as ""normal"".
It caused an outcry on social media and sparked protests led by the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in a country where unfair treatment of black hair evokes painful memories of prejudice during apartheid.
The then-government used a ""pencil test"" to determine someone's racial identity: a pencil was inserted into a person's hair and if it did not fall, that person was considered not white.
""We were shocked to discover that we had supplied images for the Clicks website that portrayed black hair as inferior. This was racist and we apologise unreservedly,"" Unilever said in a statement.
The firm is reviewing all the marketing campaigns and images in its South Africa portfolio ""to make sure they match our commitment to celebrate all beauty and promote diversity and inclusion.""
It will also set up a new diversity and inclusion assets committee and an advisory board with internal and external experts to review how its hair care products in South Africa can offer consumers solutions, it said.
The household goods conglomerate behind the Omo, Sunlight and Domestos brands will also work with the new advisory board to develop programmes to deliver immediate support to black hair stylists and small professional salons.
Lastly, Unilever will review its mandatory diversity and inclusion training to accelerate its training on unconscious bias for all staff.

On Thursday, Unilever agreed to pull all its TRESemmé haircare products from South African retail stores for 10 days to show remorse after some retailers had begun removing the products.

(Reuters) - Beijing opposes a forced sale of TikTok's U.S. operations by its Chinese owner ByteDance, and would prefer to see the short video app shut down in the United States, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
ByteDance has been in talks to sell TikTok's U.S. business to potential buyers including Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Oracle (N:ORCL) since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened last month to ban the service if it was not sold.
Trump has given ByteDance a deadline of mid September to finalise a deal.
However, Chinese officials believe a forced sale would make both ByteDance and China appear weak in the face of pressure from Washington, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. 
ByteDance said in a statement to Reuters that the Chinese government had never suggested to it that it should shut down TikTok in the United States or in any other markets. 
Two of the sources said China was willing to use revisions it made to a technology exports list on Aug. 28 to delay any deal reached by ByteDance, if it had to. 
China's State Council Information Office and its foreign and commerce ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent after working hours.
Asked on Friday about Trump and TikTok, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing that the United States was abusing the concept of national security, and urged it to stop oppressing foreign companies.
CLASH BETWEEN POWERS
Reuters has reported that TikTok’s prospective buyers were discussing four ways to structure an acquisition from ByteDance.
Within these, ByteDance could still push ahead with a sale of TikTok's U.S. assets without approval from China's commerce ministry by selling them without key algorithms. 
ByteDance and its founder Zhang Yiming have been caught in a clash between the world's two preeminent powers. 
Trump last month issued two executive orders that require ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. assets or face being banned in the country, where the app is hugely popular among teenagers. 
U.S. officials have criticised the app's security and privacy, suggesting that user data might be shared with Beijing. TikTok has said it would not comply with any request to share user data with the Chinese authorities.
Beijing has said it firmly opposes Trump's executive orders and on Aug. 28 moved to give itself a say in the process, revising a list of technologies that will need Chinese government approval before they are exported. Experts said TikTok's recommendation algorithm would fall under this list. 

Chinese regulators said last week the rules were not targeted at specific companies but they reaffirmed their right to enforce them.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday but quickly ran into fresh selling amid only selective bargain-hunting among tech stocks that had sold off heavily again on Thursday.
By 1:05 PM ET (1705 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 64 points or 0.23%. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was down by 1.17%.
The market was supported at the open by strong earnings posted after the close on Thursday by both software giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON), the maker of high-end exercise bikes. To a degree, the reports restored some confidence in the narrative that had driven the rally in the Nasdaq through the summer, namely that the disruption from the pandemic will bring accelerated benefits to companies that facilitate remote working - or working out. 
But Peloton stock fell 2.8%, and Oracle stock rose 0.3%.
Earlier, participants had shrugged off figures showing stronger-than-expected inflation in the U.S. in August. The consumer price index rose 0.4% to be up 1.3% on the year. After adjusting for volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI rose 0.4% to 1.7%, its highest since April and apparently back on course toward the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Given that the Fed has now said it will tolerate an overshoot of the 2% target to compensate for the time inflation has undershot, there is effectively no reason to fear it will tighten policy as a pre-emptive step.
The index was propelled higher by surging prices for used cars - as people shun public transport - and by higher costs for moving house and the storage of household goods, testimony to the surge in housing market activity since the pandemic began.
Elsewhere, gains were relatively muted at the end of a week that has shown that prices can go down as well as up. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 2.7%, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock fell 2.6% and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock fell 1.4%. The 'gigacap' stocks have been responsible for almost all of the market's gains through the summer, leaving them all ripe for a bout of consolidation.
Electric truck-maker Nikola continued to suffer in the wake of Thursday's attack on it by short-seller Hindenburg Research. Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) stock fell another 8% but was on course for a 2% drop over the week, despite the announcement of General Motors (NYSE:GM)' $2 billion investment in it earlier.
Nikola's bigger rival in the electric vehicle space, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), reversed early gains to be down 1.4%, after a report saying that it is to start exporting from its factory in Shanghai. The report suggested that sales in China, the world's biggest EV market, were weaker than expected."

The House “determined that implementing the deferral would not be in the best interests of the House or our employees,” Philip G. Kiko, the chamber’s chief administrative officer, said in an email to employees. “As a result, we will not implement the payroll tax deferral.”
Trump has been pushing employers to implement a directive that allows employers to forgo withholding payroll taxes due from Sept. 1 through the end of the year. Workers would need to pay back those levies next year unless Congress votes to forgive the bills. That could mean sharply higher withholding in early 2020.

Few employers outside the federal government and the military have taken up the option, hobbling the intended effort to boost incomes and spending. Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST).,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS). and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). are among employers that have said they aren’t participating.
The Senate Human Resources Department didn’t immediately respond to a request about whether they would implement the deferral.
The deferral applies to those making less than $4,000 a week, which amounts to about $104,000 a year. House lawmakers wouldn’t qualify because they earn at least $174,000 annually.

Even with the drop, college costs have surged in the last two decades, far outpacing inflation. The median published tuition and fee price at a four-year institution came to $12,710 in the 2019-2020 school year, according to the College Board. Over the last 20 years, the price index for tuition and fees has increased 164%, compared with 50% for the broader CPI. The component accounts for about 1.6% of the CPI.
The Covid-19 pandemic has upended higher education, and many students are attending virtual classes instead of sitting in classrooms with professors. With health risks in mind, numerous schools have also chosen to limit or even cancel an array of typical student activities including sports for those attending in-person classes.
As a result, some schools have worked to soften the blow by skipping scheduled tuition hikes or even cutting the costs. Many colleges also offered refunds for room and board when they sent students home in March due to worries about the spreading pandemic.
Williams (NYSE:WMB) College reduced its cost by 15% on a one-time basis for the coming academic year. Princeton University also approved a 10% tuition reduction for all undergraduate students for the 2020-21 school year.
Georgetown University approved a 10% tuition cut for the fall semester for students who are learning remotely, and the College of William & Mary is rolling back a previously adopted increase for incoming in-state undergraduates.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Investors in LVMH's Tiffany bonds left second-guessing on redemption payout,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - The holders of 9 billion euros (8.36 billion pounds) worth of bonds issued by LVMH to fund its now imperilled acquisition of Tiffany & Co have been left second-guessing as to when they might get their money back. 
The Louis Vuitton owner told Tiffany this week that it could not complete the $16 billion acquisition of the U.S. jeweller because of a French government request to delay closing the deal - as part of leverage in trade talks with the United States - and due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Tiffany said it would sue LVMH to try and enforce the deal. 
Most of the LVMH deal bonds initially rose on news the deal was off as holders bet they would be swiftly repaid at ""par"" or slightly higher along with accrued interest, having been previously trading below that level.
There are seven different tranches of the bonds of varying maturities, five denominated in euros and two in sterling. They were issued in February at a time when corporate funding costs were close to record lows.
But as corporate bonds were hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis and the outlook for luxury goods clouded in a recessionary environment, the LVMH bonds traded down as low as 90 cents on the euro. That is typically seen as a significant fall in value and means the yield on the bonds doubled in some cases from where they were priced. 
So a failed acquisition and swift repayment could make the bonds one of the best trades of the post-covid market in the European investment grade space. 
""A number of the bonds are a pretty good value proposition if the acquisition falls through, as there are calls at par or slightly above,"" said Gordon Shannon, a portfolio manager at Twenty Four Asset Management.
Moves by the two companies to file lawsuits against each other, however, have complicated the outlook for bondholders. Most of the bonds have retraced some of their gains in the past few days on the increasing likelihood that there will be months of legal wrangling until the deal's fate is finally confirmed. 
""I suspect we will see some trading around the 100 mark as this situation unfolds,"" said a banker who managed the original sale of the LVMH debt, speaking on condition of anonymity.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>",Analysis: Life without LVMH? How Tiffany might fare without the luxury giant,"By Melissa Fares, Silvia Aloisi and Sarah White
NEW YORK/MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, has called off its $16-billion engagement to Tiffany. Wall Street however seems to think the U.S. jeweler will fare just fine by itself.
The jilted bride thinks so, too.
On Wednesday, after news that LVMH would not proceed with its takeover deal, Tiffany Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo held a call with employees, saying the executives are in wait-and-see mode. He told employees that Tiffany executives hadn't solicited LVMH's takeover. If the deal collapses, he said, Tiffany will be fine as it is. Tiffany declined to comment.
Tiffany's shares ended trading Thursday at $114.36. Before news of the deal - in which LVMH offered $135 per share to Tiffany’s investors - came out in October, Tiffany shares were at $98.55. That means that investors value Tiffany 16% higher despite both COVID-19's blow to sales and the prospect of no LVMH deal.
""It certainly seemed as if this deal was a strength in numbers for both sides,"" said Robert Burke, founder of an eponymous luxury retail consulting firm. ""But at the end of the day, Tiffany will be OK... it offers an image and a history that is kind of second to none and is highly attractive because of that.""
LVMH, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, said earlier this week it could not complete its purchase after the French government requested a delay on closing the transaction.
Tiffany executives were thrilled with the deal when it was agreed with LVMH last year, seeing it as the culmination of their turnaround efforts, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Longer-term, there are questions about Tiffany’s prospects in a prolonged economic downturn, particularly if governments raise taxes and property prices plummet. 
In a lawsuit filed in Delaware on Wednesday, Tiffany alleged that starting in late March, LVMH began foot-dragging on antitrust compliance as a strategy to kill the deal. 
""LVMH has sought to delay and impede the regulatory approval processes in every manner possible,” Tiffany stated in its complaint.
The deal would have been the biggest-ever in the global luxury industry, allowing Tiffany to quickly expand its global presence and invest more money in spruced-up stores and new collections without having to report quarterly earnings to shareholders. LVMH could use Tiffany to broaden its U.S. presence and help grow its smallest jewelry and watch business.
OTHER TAKEOVER TARGETS?
Asked whether LVMH had any other U.S. acquisition plans, LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean Jacques Guiony said Tiffany is the only major jewelry player in the country and would not speculate further. 
Shares of a rival, the Switzerland-based luxury jeweler and watchmaker Richemont, were up 5% Thursday as its name surfaced in analyst reports as a possible alternative target for LVMH.
Some industry insiders say LVMH's U-turn opens the way to negotiations rather than an acrimonious break-up. Brokerage Oppenheimer expects LVMH to cut its bid to $108 per Tiffany share.
Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said Richemont, as well as LVMH’s French rival  Kering  (PA:PRTP) , could emerge as suitors for Tiffany. “While it is unclear if and at what level these companies could be interested, the notion that Tiffany is open to M&A should be a support,” he said.
A TOUGH ECONOMY
To be sure, Tiffany and peers face major headwinds as the health emergency has plunged major economies into recession and brought international tourism to a halt, and it may have less of a buffer against them on its own.
Based in New York and best known for its diamond engagement rings, Tiffany has worked to attract a younger clientele with more affordable offerings, invested heavily in its online business, and, over the last couple of years especially, prioritized China. The Asia-Pacific region accounted for approximately 28% of Tiffany's worldwide net sales in 2019.
Standalone luxury goods brands, including Britain's Burberry or Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo, have underperformed the major conglomerates that dominate the industry in recent years. They are less able to hedge themselves against changes in trends and tastes - while LVMH, for instance, has over 70 brands in its portfolio, including cash cows like Louis Vuitton, eclipsing problems at its smaller labels.
The big groups have also succeeded in drowning out rivals in the marketing stakes, with major investments in social media advertising, for example.
Back in November 2019, when LVMH sealed the acquisition, media-shy Bernard Arnault – France's richest man and a shrewd deal maker who has built an empire through acquisitions -- did a full round of press interviews waxing lyrical about what he called an American icon. He said Tiffany has created a strong brand image, including an identifiable blue-egg color of its own.
“We’re the owner of a color,” the 71-year-old told Reuters at the time. “It’s a pretty rare thing.”
This week, LVMH filed a countersuit against Tiffany, accusing it of mismanagement through the coronavirus pandemic. It said Tiffany had underperformed LVMH’s comparable brands in the first half of the year, and questioned the fact that it had gone ahead with quarterly dividend payments despite booking a net loss of $33 million and a revenue decline of 34% in the six months to end-July.

""We cannot be very pleased with a loss-making company,” LVMH finance chief Guiony told reporters.

The bond sale is its first dollar-denominated issuance since its tie-up with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) in 1999, a Nissan representative said. 
It comes as investors have expressed deepening concern about Nissan, which has warned of a record $4.5 billion loss this year as the pandemic hampers its turnaround efforts. 
Separately, IFR reported Nissan would sell some 2 billion euros ($2.37 billion) in euro-denominated debt. A Nissan spokeswoman said an issuance was under discussion, without confirming the figure.
The company will sell a $1.5 billion, 3-year bond with a coupon of 3.043%, and a $1.5 billion, 5-year bond with a coupon of 3.522%, according to IFR.
Its $2.5 billion, 7-year bond carries a coupon of 4.345% and another $2.5 billion bond, a 10-year, carries a 4.81% coupon, IFR said. 
Nissan had pledged to cut 300 billion yen ($2.83 billion)from annual fixed costs and become a smaller, more efficient company. Japan's second-largest carmaker is trying to recover from a rapid expansion that has left it with dismal margins and an ageing portfolio.

Its business has also been rocked by the arrest of long-time boss Carlos Ghosn.

Under the Lost Wages Assistance program -- which uses disaster-relief funds to provide an extra $300 a week from the federal government to most jobless-benefit recipients -- states will get funding covering six weeks, according to an emailed statement Thursday from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Several states announced they were notified Wednesday that funding would not extend beyond the benefit week that ended Sept. 5.
Almost every state and territory has applied and been approved, though the program will close to new applications at the end of Thursday, FEMA said.
The Trump administration is looking at ways to extend the program in lieu of a stimulus agreement in Congress, according to a White House official.
The end of the extra payments -- which were expected to last one to two months -- will make life tougher for the millions of Americans relying on other jobless benefits in a labor market that, despite improvement, remains depressed compared with before the pandemic. It also threatens to sap consumers’ spending power, and therefore businesses revenue, across the economy while lawmakers remain at a stalemate over another stimulus package.
A report Thursday showed applications for state unemployment benefits failed to decline as expected last week, a sign extensive job losses are persisting as the nation continues to struggle to control the coronavirus.
Trump signed an executive action Aug. 8 as a stopgap measure for jobless Americans after lawmakers failed to reach a deal before the added $600 a week in jobless benefits expired at the end of July. The program authorizes eligible claimants to receive supplemental payments backdated to the week ended Aug. 1.
Logistical hurdles, though, including an approval process, led to a delay in Americans actually receiving the money. While several states have at least begun distributing the additional aid, many states have not yet started.
Trump authorized FEMA to expend up to $44 billion from the Disaster Relief Fund for the payments. States also had the option to supplement the $300 federal grant with an extra $100.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the funding.

The company's shares rose 4% before the opening bell.
The virus outbreak has led to consumers cooking more meals at home, leading to rising demand for groceries and canned soups, as people work from home and classes at schools and colleges resume online.
The updated forecast for 2020 follows strong performance in the first half, and on expectations of sustained trends in food-at-home consumption, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said.
The company also forecast full-year earnings between $3.20 and $3.30 per share. Analysts are expecting 2020 comparable sales of 10.15% and earnings of $2.90 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
For the second quarter ended Aug. 15, Kroger said sales at stores open for more than a year rose 14.6%, beating estimates of a 10.96% rise, boosted by a jump in online sales.

On an adjusted basis, Kroger earned 73 cents per share, beating estimates of 55 cents per share.

Tesla shares were up 3.2% in trading before the bell, building on a 12.5% jump in the past two days in one of the most volatile weeks this year for technology-related stocks on Wall Street.
The carmaker's dizzying 500% surge this year has come courtesy of improved headline results and a flood of money into technology-linked shares, but Wall Street analysts are still less convinced about the company's longer-term prospects. 
The median price target on the stock is $300 - well below its Sept. 1 record high of $502.49, according to Refinitiv data, and of the 33 analysts covering the stock, 15 rate it ""hold"" and 10 ""sell"" or lower.
As investors look to ""Battery Day"" on Sept. 22 that is expected to showcase Tesla's latest improvements, the company still faces a long development path requiring huge investment if it is to durably challenge the world's biggest manufacturers.
""We (and the market) expect the announcements to be significant, cementing Tesla's cost and technology lead for several more years,"" UBS autos analyst Patrick Hummel wrote in a note, listing a series of announcements he expected from the day and doubling his price target to $325.
""(But) for as long as there is no big 'one more thing' on the agenda, we think all of the above is already fully discounted.""
Separately, sources told Reuters on Friday Tesla is planning to export Model 3 vehicles made in China to Asian and European markets. The automaker is expanding its manufacturing base in China to make Model Y sports-utility vehicles and adding lines to make more battery packs, electric motors and motor controllers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  IBM  Corp (N:IBM) said on Friday the U.S. Commerce Department should adopt new controls to limit the export of facial recognition systems to repressive regimes that can be used to commit human rights violations.
The company said in a statement the United States should institute new export limits on ""the type of facial recognition system most likely to be used in mass surveillance systems, racial profiling or other human rights violations.""
In July, the Commerce Department had sought public comments on whether to adopt new export license requirements for facial recognition software and other biometric systems used in surveillance. Comments are due by Sept. 15.
Christopher Padilla, IBM's vice president for government and regulatory affairs, told Reuters the U.S. government should focus on ""one to many"" systems that could be used to pick dissidents out of a crowd or for mass surveillance, rather than ""facial identification"" systems that allow a user to unlock an iPhone or board an airplane.
IBM said the Commerce Department should control ""export of both the high-resolution cameras used to collect data and the software algorithms used to analyze and match that data against a database of images"" and argued it should ""limit the ability of certain foreign governments to obtain the large-scale computing components required to implement an integrated facial recognition system.""
The company's written comments did not identify specific governments but said ""controls on the most powerful types of facial recognition technology should be focused on those countries that have a history of human rights abuses.""
The Commerce Department's July notice said China ""has deployed facial recognition technology in the Xinjiang region, in which there has been repression, mass arbitrary detention and high technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other members of Muslim minority groups.""
The department has added dozens of Chinese companies and entities to an economic blacklist that it said were implicated in human rights violations regarding China’s treatment of Uighurs, including video surveillance firm Hikvision (SZ:002415), as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology.
China has denied mistreating people in Xinjiang.
IBM said the Commerce Department should also restrict access to online image databases that can be used to train facial recognition systems.

In June, IBM told the U.S. Congress it would stop offering facial recognition software and opposes any use of such technology for purposes of mass surveillance and racial profiling. The company also called for new federal rules to hold police more accountable for misconduct.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>","As U.S. cracks down on more Chinese firms, global banks scramble to manage risk","By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The sharp expansion of U.S. actions to hobble Chinese firms in recent weeks has sparked a rush by global lenders to pare back exposure to the companies and to identify others that may become caught in Washington's crosshairs, banking sources said.
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) (HK:0981) became the latest company ensnared in escalating tensions between the world's two biggest economies, after a U.S. Defense Department official last week said Washington could add China's biggest chipmaker to its trade blacklist.
Soon after the news broke, bankers at a global lender which has more than $200 million in outstanding credit with SMIC huddled to discuss if there was a way to get the Chinese firm to prepay some of the loans.
""Issuing new credit lines or refinancing the existing debt is out of question, but how do we minimise the risk to the existing portfolio?"" a senior banker who took part in the discussions told Reuters. 
""It's bizarre ... we are spending more time in managing the risk from these actions and preparing for more sanctions than originating new business,"" he said. ""You never know where and when will the axe fall next.""
The banker, who is not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified, said internal discussions about SMIC's loans were ongoing and no conclusion had been reached.
SMIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the banker's remarks.
While bilateral tensions over trade and telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] have been cause for concern over the past two years, anxiety at global banks over their Chinese portfolios has ramped up in past months with the advent of the Hong Kong national security law, U.S. orders for China's ByteDance to divest video app TikTok and now SMIC.
Last month, Washington also blacklisted 24 Chinese companies and targeted individuals it said were part of construction and military actions in the South China Sea, its first such sanctions against Beijing over the disputed strategic waterway.
The risk of actions against more Chinese companies is only growing ahead of the U.S election in November, bankers said, noting President Donald Trump has made national security and his hardline stance against China a key part of his campaign.
Two senior bankers at European lenders said they were taking stock of their banks' exposure to Chinese technology firms. 
In particular, they were looking at clients involved in hardware and semiconductors with business interests in the United States, and were trying to assess the risk of those firms being blacklisted.
Fresh lending to Chinese companies, already under pressure due to worries about the business impact of the coronavirus pandemic, has also slowed.
""Last year, it used to take a few days to do due diligence and write a check to these companies in China. Now it takes weeks,"" said a banker at one of the European banks.
""The actions against the Chinese companies will be a big threat from the balance sheet management perspective until the election.""
The foreign bank with the biggest exposure to Chinese companies is  HSBC Holdings  (L:HSBA), followed by  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN). HSBC is 8th in the mandated arranger loan league table for companies whose ultimate parents are Chinese, while StanChart ranks 11th, according to Refinitiv data.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",Emerging market funds close due to shrinking demand,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Dozens of emerging market funds have closed this year as turmoil unleashed by the coronavirus has damaged investor sentiment towards the asset class, where returns lag those of developed economies.
A weaker U.S. dollar, which would typically have boosted emerging markets, has failed to lift investor sentiment, and cash has been slow to return after large outflows triggered by the pandemic.
While many emerging market funds were struggling before the pandemic, closures may be gathering pace, with 51 emerging equity funds liquidated in the first eight months of the year, data from Morningstar showed, up from 44 a year earlier.
The data also showed that 23 emerging currency fixed income funds were liquidated so far this year. Across fixed income and equities, 93 funds were closed or merged this year, compared with 106 in the previous year.
(GRAPHIC: Emerging markets funds liquidated - https://graphics.reuters.com/EMERGING-FUNDS/jznpnxaaopl/chart.png)
A disappointing run of returns and thin liquidity at some funds is heaping on the pressure, said Mathieu Caquineau, associate director of Morningstar.
""There are also growing concerns on the macro outlook for some EM countries as the COVID-19 crisis unfolds. Higher fund closures are likely a reflection of the asset managers responding to investors' lack of demand,"" said Caquineau.
Asset managers are divided on the outlook for emerging markets and whether they will stem the underperformance. This week, the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute downgraded emerging local currency debt to underweight, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said emerging hard currency bonds will see double-digit returns.
Investors withdrew almost $24 billion from cash funds in the past week to switch into emerging markets, BofA analysts said on Friday, citing EPFR data for the week to Sept. 9,
PIMCO will close its Emerging Market Currency and Short-Term Investments Fund, the Financial Times reported last month, citing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing and noting that the fund had shrunk. PIMCO declined to comment.
Meanwhile, Jupiter said in June it would close its unconstrained emerging equity fund, saying it did not see ""sufficient inflows from existing or new investors to make it sustainable going forward.""
The asset manager's move follows last year Pictet pulling the plug on an investment-grade local emerging debt fund and  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors' closure of an emerging markets local currency bond fund, Morningstar data shows.
The latest closures come as the MSCI's emerging equity index continues its long-term underperformance of the broader global index; emerging stocks are up 15% in the past six months, compared with gains of 20% among global peers. 
(GRAPHIC: Emerging market stocks underperform - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqybokvx/Capture.PNG)
Emerging debt returns also trail German and U.S. government bonds and have done since the end of March. And the average local currency debt yield has fallen below that on less risky emerging dollar debt. 
This all conspires to dim the appeal of the sector, especially as many emerging currencies have struggled. Turkey's lira has plummeted to record lows and Russia's rouble has been rocked by oil prices and the threat of more sanctions.
Aside from China, which has bounced back from the virus shock, a recovery in India, South Africa and much of Latin America is at an early stage, Goldman Sachs told clients.
Many funds also struggle with scale. 
Just under half of the roughly 600 Europe-based emerging equity funds tracked by Morningstar have less than 100 million euros ($119 million) of assets under management, said Caquineau.
""The economic equation just doesn't work for a lot of these funds and a lot are being closed as probably they're not profitable or asset managers don't see a reversal of flows,"" he said.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Citigroup's next CEO has Herculean task: turning the bank around for real,"By Imani Moise and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Jane Fraser takes the helm of  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) in February, she will have some big tasks ahead of her.
Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. lender, has struggled for years to convince Wall Street that management's vision of a global bank with a hodgepodge of profitable, if unrelated, businesses will work.
Profit targets set years ago by CEO Mike Corbat proved hard to reach even after revisions and major cost cuts. And although Citigroup is a much different bank than the one that required a $45 billion bailout to survive the 2007-2009 financial crisis, it still carries a stigma from failures that led it there.
Citigroup's legal battles with hedge funds after mistakenly sending them $900 million of its own funds suggests that it has ongoing technology issues, analysts, investors and insiders said. Those problems have been a sticking point with regulators, which have pushed Citi to fix them in order to pass annual stress tests.
Although Fraser's promotion was celebrated on Thursday as a sign that women can get ahead on Wall Street, analysts and investors said the halo will last only as long as she can deliver results.
""The job of this woman is to get new business, solve the problem with the government on the technology - and get new business,"" said Dick Bove, a longtime bank analyst with Odeon Capital Group. ""That's her job, and I think if anybody can do it, she can.""
Bove and others put Fraser's challenges into three buckets: growing revenue, addressing costly operational issues and truly repairing Citi's brand, which has been tarnished for over a decade.
Fraser, 53, has a reputation as a ""fix-it"" executive, and many expressed faith in her abilities.
A former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) investment banker and McKinsey consultant, Fraser cleaned up Citigroup's toxic mortgage book after the financial crisis, then its Latin America business after scandals erupted in Mexico, and has been leading its global consumer bank - which Citi is trying to grow - since October.
Although Fraser had been seen as a front-runner to succeed Corbat for awhile, many analysts found the change to be abrupt. Most expected a longer-term transition that might take a year or two, with some questioning why Citigroup made the announcement on a seemingly random Thursday in September.
Some investors had hoped Citigroup would appoint an outsider with a fresh perspective as its next CEO, KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a note predicting an underwhelming share reaction to the news.
Citigroup shares fell 0.9% on Thursday, compared with a 1.8% decline in the S&P 500 index.
The 43% total return shareholders have gotten since the beginning of Corbat's tenure in 2012 through Wednesday's close pales in comparison to the 137% return for JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) shares and 169% for Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) shares during the same time frame, according to Refinitiv data.
Out of the top six U.S. Wall Street banks, Citigroup's total return is higher only than that of  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), which has been plagued by various scandals since 2016.
A Citigroup executive who spoke to Reuters said staffers were happy with Fraser's appointment. The person, who was not authorized to speak to the press, said she is seen as someone who understands Citigroup's key businesses and can repair ties with investors and the government.
The person noted Fraser's success with regulators who scrutinized Citigroup's woes in Mexico, which ranged from bad underwriting in mortgages to oil loans that were later found to be fraudulent.
One major investor said Fraser may be the CEO who can turn Citigroup around. The person described her as someone who has shown she can cut costs and invest in businesses appropriately, and comes across as truly caring about Citigroup's welfare. But it will not be a cakewalk for Fraser to get the bank to perform in line with peers again.

""She will start in 'prove-it' mode,"" the person said, ""and there is a lot to prove.""

1684,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 07:12AM ET</span>",Stocks Edge Highee as Goldman Turns Optimistic; Dow Futures up 200 Pts,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Friday, rebounding after recent losses, shrugging off both recent economic data that has pointed to a slowing recovery and the receding likelihood of additional fiscal stimulus.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT),S&P 500 Futures traded 30 points, or 0.9%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 212 points, or 0.8%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 101 points, or 0.9%. 
On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, or 370 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2%. The three major indexes have dropped in four of the last five sessions, with the DJIA and the S&P set to post their weakest week since June and the Nasdaq since March.
The steep tech selloff has cast doubt on whether stretched valuations can be sustained, at a time when joblessness is still high and the coronavirus is still threatening economic activity. Applications for state unemployment benefits failed to decline as expected last week, calling into question the strength of the economic recovery.
At the same time, the Senate failed to pass a bill that would have provided around $300 billion in new coronavirus aid. Time is running out ahead of the congressional and presidential elections for the two main parties to find some form of compromise.
That said, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is optimistic, saying the tech-led Nasdaq correction ""has primarily been a reversal of the summer rally."" 
The influential investment bank upgraded its global equity allocations to ‘overweight’ for the next three months, citing an inflection in earnings growth and catch-up moves by cyclical stocks, which had lagged the summer rally.
The inflation figures for August are due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and are expected to show core CPI rising 0.2% month-on-month and 1.6% on a year-over-year basis, below the 2% level the Federal Reserve has set as its average target.
“PPI data yesterday was already slightly higher than expected and our economist expects also inflation to continue rebounding in August, reflecting lagged effects of supply constraints relating to Covid containment measures amidst the re-opening of the economy,” said analysts at ING, in a note. But “this won’t last given a 10% smaller economy and 12 million fewer people in work.” 
In corporate news, grocery chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) is expected to publish quarterly earnings Friday, but focus is likely to be on the dominant tech sector.
Oil prices were calm Friday, consolidating after Thursday's losses after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported late Thursday a surprise build of 2 millions in crude inventories, raising concerns about faltering demand from the commodity’s biggest consumer.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $37.39 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $40.03. Both major benchmarks are down around 6.5% for the week and headed for a second week of declines.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,956.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.1859.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Britain secured its first big post-Brexit trade deal on Friday, an agreement with Japan which it hailed as ""historic"" as it struggles to agree on trade with its closest trading partners in the European Union.
Since formally leaving the EU in January, Britain has focused on negotiating new trade deals with countries around the world although experts say they are unlikely to replace exports lost to the EU if a deal cannot be reached with Brussels.
""This is a historic moment for the UK and Japan as our first major post-Brexit trade deal,"" British trade minister Liz Truss said.
""The agreement we have negotiated - in record time and in challenging circumstances - goes far beyond the existing EU deal, as it secures new wins for British businesses in our great manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries.""
The deal had been widely seen as one the easiest within reach for London, based largely on the EU-Japan agreement which covers Britain until the end of December, when a Brexit transition period ends.
Other negotiations, especially with the United States, have progressed more slowly.
Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said the talks had been difficult ""but we managed to reach an agreement in principle with extraordinary speed, in just three months"". 
He said Japan was aiming for the deal - which would help Japanese manufacturers of train equipment and car components - to come into force on Jan. 1.
Japan has used Britain as a pro-business gateway into the rest of the EU but some Japanese politicians have expressed concerns that a so-called no-deal Brexit might affect this.
Britain said the deal meant 99% of its exports to Japan would be tariff-free, and that it could increase trade by 15.2 billion pounds ($19.4 billion) in the long run, compared with 2018.
""IMPORTANT STEP""
Total trade between Britain and Japan was worth around 29.5 billion pounds in 2018, eclipsed by nearly 700 billion pounds of exports and imports between Britain and the EU.
Britain said digital and data provisions in the agreement would help British fintech firms operating in Japan.
Financial services firms, coat-makers and food producers would benefit from the agreement, and it represented an ""important step"" towards Britain joining the Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in the Asia-Pacific region, it said.
Big Japanese investors in Britain such as auto makers Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) would benefit from reduced tariffs on parts, it added. 
The deal removes Britain's tariffs on Japanese cars in stages to zero in 2026, which is the same as in the Japan-EU trade agreement. The issue of automobiles was one of Japan's main interests.
British business groups welcomed the deal, but underlined the need for a trade deal with the EU.
""We hope the spirit of both ambition and compromise will help land further continuity deals such as with Turkey and Canada, as well as an agreement with the EU, which is of utmost importance to ... members,"" said Allie Renison, Head of Europe and Trade Policy at the Institute of Directors.
The EU has demanded that Britain scrap a plan to break the divorce treaty signed by both sides in January, but British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has refused. The EU says this could sink four years of Brexit talks.

Japan wanted to reach broad consensus with Britain on trade this week before a change in government in Tokyo, which could have caused the negotiations to drift.

1686,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Vingroup weighs selling school, health units, sources say, as Vietnam's biggest firm refocuses","By Phuong Nguyen and James Pearson
HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's Vingroup (HM:VIC) is considering selling controlling stakes in its medical and education units, two sources with direct knowledge said, although the company said it had made no such plans.
Vietnam's largest listed firm could look for buyers for Vinschool, a private school business, and Vinmec, a chain of private hospitals, the sources told Reuters.
The conglomerate has not appointed any advisers for the stake sales so far, but in its informal talks two buyers have shown interest in the two businesses, the sources said.
A third source aware of the matter said Vingroup has received preliminary interest, and the controlling stakes could fetch roughly $1.5 billion. The source said the interest was rejected.
It is also planning to raise as much as $1.1 billion in debt before the year-end for refinancing existing debt, one of the sources said.
The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media. In a statement, a Vingroup spokesman said the company had no plans to sell stakes in Vinschool or Vinmec, which it said play ""important roles in the Vingroup Eco System"". 
""We commit to develop Vinmec and VinSchool to bring much more better services here in Vietnam,"" said the spokesman, who added that Vingroup was evaluating international bond markets.
Vinschool runs 27 educational facilities and Vinmec operates seven hospitals in Vietnam. 
If finalised, the plans would be part of moves by Vingroup, which has a market value of $13 billion and posted half-year revenue of $1.7 billion, to stem losses in some of its units that have been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Founded by Vietnam's richest man, billionaire Pham Nhat Vuong, Vingroup is omnipresent in the Southeast Asian country.
Just a year ago, one could be born in a Vinmec hospital, go to Vinschool, live in a Vinhomes apartment and drive to Vinmart in a Vinfast car. 
But the group sold Vinmart last year, and with the potential stake sales of Vinschool and Vinmec, Vingroup is quickly scaling back its ambitions.
Expansion over the years has pushed up Vingroup's debt, and losses at some of the ventures have squeezed its cash flow. 
S&P Global and Fitch cut their ratings outlook on Vingroup to negative from stable last year, citing concerns about its over-reliance on cash-rich property unit Vinhomes to fund its new ventures.
Vingroup's first-half net profit tumbled 60% to 1.35 trillion dong ($58.26 million). Its shares on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange have underperformed this year, falling 21% compared to the benchmark index's (VNI) 7.6% drop.
Its interest coverage ratio, which indicates the company's ability to pay off debt, dropped to 3.8 times in the first half of this year from 5.0 in 2019, according to a copy of an earnings presentation prepared by Vingroup for potential investors that was seen by Reuters.
AUTOMOBILE GAMBLE
Vingroup scrapped plans to launch Vietnam's sixth airline, ""Vinpearl Air"" in January. 
Late last year, the group also abandoned moves to form a new unit from its sports, entertainment and hospitality business due to ""profitability concerns"" of some of the assets, a source with direct knowledge of the plans told Reuters.
It has made real estate, technology and automobiles its key growth focus, but it remains to be seen how the plan shapes up, especially its big bet on cars.
In 2017, Vingroup earmarked $3.5 billion to create its Vinfast car unit with plans to produce around 250,000 cars annually within the next five years, a period when it does not expect the venture to be profitable.
Last year, Vinfast sold 19,400 cars and 50,000 e-scooters, according to company data. Its net loss ballooned to 6.6 trillion dong in the first half of 2020 from 1.6 trillion dong in the year-ago period. 
Vinfast's latest offering, a gold-trimmed limited edition luxury SUV only available in Vietnam and billed as ""the most powerful commercial vehicle in the world"" is, at over $160,000, priced out of reach of most Vietnamese car owners. And its entry-level ""Fadil"" model is around 13% more expensive than competing models from Kia and Hyundai.
Vinfast equipment, real estate and inventory have all been put up as security for loans with international banks, as have 20 million shares that the company received from Vinhomes, according to its 2019 draft earnings report seen by Reuters.

1688,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>",China’s Credit Growth Jumps in August in Boost for Recovery,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s credit growth rebounded to the highest since March, as a surge in government bond issuance and other easing policies continues to take effect and support the recovery.
Aggregate financing was 3.58 trillion yuan ($524 billion) in August, the People’s Bank of China said Friday. That compares to 1.7 trillion yuan in July and the median estimate of 2.59 trillion yuan. August usually sees an increase in credit compared to July.
China’s economy has been recovering and the domestic Covid-19 outbreak is under control. The central bank has been trying to keep liquidity sufficient and the local government bonds sales to finance fiscal stimulus should continue to boost headline credit growth and the economy.
“Aggregate financing will most likely remain strong in September and October due to a large mandate for issuing government bonds,”  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. Chief China Economist Lu Ting wrote after the data was released. “The strong August credit readings mean that the concerns of a PBOC tightening is overdone, that a rise in bond yields in the past couple of months is a reflection of high funding demand instead of a PBOC tightening.”
Financial institutions offered 1.28 trillion yuan of new loans in the month, slightly higher than estimates of 1.25 trillion yuan. New medium and long-term lending to households and non-financial companies continued to be strong, but overall lending growth was undercut by a fall in short-term bill financing to companies.
That was probably due to central bank efforts to reduce speculation and arbitrage.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
Aggregate financing saw a strong reading and funding conditions eased, as seen in companies accessing more credit via loans and bonds. This takes some pressure off the People’s Bank of China to loosen policy -- but not enough to shift its stance from an incremental easing tilt.

1689,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 05:49AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Rio Tinto - No Country for Old Shareholders,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The ESG juggernaut has claimed arguably its highest-profile victim yet.
Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques has been forced out after weeks of pressure from institutional shareholders in the wake of Rio’s destruction of a unique complex of prehistoric caves in the Pilbara region of western Australia.
Two other senior executives, iron ore head Chris Salisbury and corporate relations chief Simone Niven, will also leave, creating an awkward vacuum at the top of the division that makes most of Rio’s money. Rio shares, which have held up well enough throughout the furore, rose another 1.2% by mid-morning on Friday.
It’s a staggering fall from grace for the French-born Briton, who had made Rio one of the best-performing mining stocks in the world over the last three years, and a salutary lesson to any modern-day CEO who dares to under-estimate the importance of non-financial performance in today’s business.
ESG-themed investing (Environmental, Social and Governance) is a growing force in the developed world, reflecting the increased importance that (comfortably well-off) investors now put on issues of sustainability. 
In Europe in particular, inflows into ESG-themed funds have surged as a new generation of investors has flocked to the asset class. They accounted for a third of all European fund sales in the second quarter, according to Morningstar. The trend has been one of the factors behind the spectacular outperformance of renewable energy stocks vis-à-vis Big Oil this year.
Indeed, in a world where actively-managed funds are constantly losing market share to algorithm-driven ETFs, ESG-themed funds are one of the few remaining selling points for asset managers, a rare area where they still have a persuasive argument for their higher management fees.
Typically, it’s companies’ performance on the E (for Environmental) element that has garnered the most attention from investors so far. Indeed, part of the reason that Rio finds itself in many ESG portfolios is Jacques’ decision to sell off the company’s thermal coal assets due to coal’s role in driving climate change.
Unfortunately, though, the company took its eye off the S (for Social) part. The Juukan Gorge caves were a site of extraordinary archaeological interest, showing evidence of continued human habitation over 45,000 years ago (before the last Ice Age). By comparison, even sites such as Stonehenge look about as old as a Dubai skyscraper.
That alone ought to have been enough to stop Rio dynamiting them as part of its plans to expand a major iron ore mine.
What made it worse was that the direct descendants of those cave-dwellers – the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aborigines - still live in the region and had lobbied intensively for the caves’ preservation.  The controversy was thus sharpened many times over by the controversial politics of Australia’s relations with its First Nations. To paraphrase Tommy Lee Jones’s sheriff in No Country for Old Men, if it ain’t a mess, it’ll do until the mess gets here.
The company’s protestations that they had acquired all the necessary legal approvals for the step are factually correct, but morally hollow. Big Mining’s power over such processes has been documented too many times for that excuse to hold much weight.
For better or worse, past generations of shareholders have accepted that reality for decades. Today’s generation, through the intermediation of asset managers desperate not to lose ESG mandates, is made of different stuff.  "

LONDON (Reuters) - Deloitte announced on Friday that its UK audit operations will have a standalone board from January to meet new regulatory requirements aimed at improving industry standards after a string of company failures.
Deloitte, one of the world's ""Big Four"" accounting firms along with KPMG, PwC and EY, have all been told by their regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), to submit plans by October 23 to ring fence their UK audit arms.
The aim of ""operational separation"" at Big Four accountants in Britain is to make them focus better on their work, be more challenging towards clients, and avoid conflicts of interest with consultancy work.
The FRC set out principles for underpinning ring fencing earlier this year, including the creation of an independent audit governance board (AGB).
The collapse of UK builder Carillion and retailer BHS led to a welter of proposed reforms aimed at improving book checking standards, including replacing the FRC with a stronger watchdog.
""The AGB is central to Deloitte’s new governance framework and a key step in the operational separation of our audit business from our wider firm,"" Richard Houston, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte UK, said in a statement.
""We continue liaising with the FRC on the best ways to implement further changes to our governance and reporting structures.""
The FRC said on Friday that it encourages all the Big Four auditors to implement its principles for operational separation as soon as practicable.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (AX:RIO) parted ways with its chief executive and two deputies on Friday, bowing to a shareholder outcry over the destruction of two significant Aboriginal rockshelters and what was seen as the miner's inadequate initial response.
The departures are the highest profile examples yet of the increasing muscle of institutional investors to hold companies to account for actions that fall short in areas such as human rights obligations and expected community standards. 
They also come amid heightened sensitivity in Australia to its treatment of Aboriginal people, who are over represented in the country's prisons and suffer poorer health and shorter average life spans.
Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, who has led Rio since 2016, will step down by March 31 next year, while iron ore boss, Chris Salisbury, and Simone Niven, head of corporate relations, the unit responsible for dealing with indigenous communities, will also depart.
The executive changes ""should be a wake up call for the Australian iron ore sector and mining companies worldwide on their relationships with First Nations people,"" said Brynn O'Brien, executive director of activist investor the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility.
Activists and investors said Rio had fallen short in an earlier board-led review into how the miner legally detonated rockshelters showing 46,000 years of human habitation at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia against the wishes of traditional owners. The review had recommended cutting short-term bonuses for some executives.
Australia's largest pension fund, AustralianSuper said it was satisfied that ""appropriate responsibility"" had now been taken by Rio Tinto executives, although it added that nothing could undo the destruction of the culturally significant sites.
Others suggested further action was likely.
""(This) is the right outcome and raises the question about what happens next at the board level,"" said analyst Peter O'Connor of broker Shaw and Partners. ""I don't think it's over yet."" 
Jacques last month apologised at an Australian Senate enquiry into the destruction of the caves, saying there was no doubt the company could have made better decisions.
The blasts, which enabled Rio to access $135 million of high-grade iron ore, drew international condemnation and damaged the miner's reputation for dealing with indigenous groups in its worldwide operations.
""What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,"" Rio chairman Simon Thompson said on Friday.
The traditional owners of the land, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people said they had no comment on the executive changes, but would continue to work with Rio Tinto.
""We cannot and will not allow this type of devastation to occur ever again,"" the PKKP said in a statement.
MINE CHANGES
Rio said a search was already underway to replace Jacques. The board praised his leadership and pointed to his sale of the group's coal assets, development of a climate change strategy and strong shareholder returns under his tenure.
Rio shares drifted down 0.7 percent in Australian trade, in line with a softer broader market.
The controversy, meanwhile, has spilled over to the rest of the sector, with BHP Group (AX:BHP) and  Fortescue Metals  Group (AX:FMG) both pledging to review mine plans that could threaten sacred sites as they step up talks with traditional owners.
Submissions to the Senate inquiry, which has been pushed out to December due to coronavirus induced travel bans, have shone a light on the power imbalances between miners and traditional owners in their agreements.
The inquiry will consider legislative changes required to prevent such incidents from recurring. Western Australian state laws that approved the destruction are also being revised.
Representing traditional owners, The National Native Title Council (NNTC) welcomed the move but called for further law reform. 
""Traditional owners are not anti-economic development. They just want to be able to protect their most significant cultural heritage sites.""

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - European shares struggled for momentum on Friday as doubts about extra monetary stimulus and overnight falls in U.S. big tech shares kept investors on edge.
Elevated fears over a messy hard Brexit added to the bearish sentiment, putting sterling on track for its worst-week since March after the European Union told Britain it should urgently scrap a plan to break their divorce treaty.
In other political wrangling, the U.S. Senate on Thursday killed a Republican bill that would have provided around $300 billion in new coronavirus aid, as Democrats seeking far more funding prevented it from advancing.
That followed European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde earlier in the day appearing to rule out measures to weaken the euro. 
""Investors were disappointed,"" said Milan Cutkovic, market analyst at AxiCorp. ""They were hoping that the central bank will boost the stock market rally by paving the way for further stimulus measures and talking down the euro.
""But ECB President Christine Lagarde sounded less dovish, and her remarks about the strong euro left markets unimpressed.""
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) opened lower before gaining 0.2%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) added 0.4%, moving away from a one-month trough touched earlier this week. Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose after Tokyo dropped its coronavirus alert by one notch from the highest level as COVID-19 cases trend down.
U.S. futures were higher, pointing to a recovery on Wall Street after losses on Thursday put the S&P 500 (SPX) and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) on course for a second straight week of losses. On Friday, Nasdaq 100 futures (NQc1) were up 1.3% and S&P 500 futures (ESc1) 0.9% firmer.
The NYSE Fang+ index of big 10 tech companies .NYFANG has lost 5.4% so far this week -- its biggest weekly loss since the market turmoil in March if sustained by the end of Friday.
Still, the index is more than double its March trough and investors have gathered that their high valuations are justifiable in light of near zero interest rates in much of the developed world and massive liquidity the world's central banks have created.
Many investors have said the selloff was a healthy correction.
Yet, with the world's stocks still trading near the most expensive levels relative to profit outlook since the 2000 tech bubble, some analysts called for caution.
""Global shares had rallied on expectations of economic recovery from lockdowns. But as the autumn begins (in the northern hemisphere), people wonder if the coronavirus infections could worsen,"" said Kozo Koide, chief economist at Asset Management One.
""You never know if vaccine deployment is that easy nor if banks need to aside more provisions for struggling firms in hospitality sector. Considering all that, investors are likely to question the current valuations can be justified,"" he said.
In currency markets, the British pound advanced 0.3% to 1.2840  but stayed flat versus the euro (EURGBP=D3) after one of the heaviest selloffs this year sent the pound falling nearly 2% against the euro on Thursday. (FRX)
The European Union is ramping up preparations for a tumultuous end to the four-year Brexit saga after Britain explicitly said this week that it plans to break international law by breaching parts of the Withdrawal Agreement treaty that is signed in January.
After crashing by a record 20% in the second quarter, Britain's economy grew by 6.6% in July, slower than June's monthly rate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
The euro rose slightly on Friday and was last trading up 0.2% at $1.1841 (EUR=EBS) after Thursday's ECB press conference. But any move higher may be curtailed, however, by ECB chief economist Philip Lane's warning on Friday that a strong euro will further dampen price pressures.
The U.S. dollar was set for a second week of gains, an index which tracks it against major currencies showed (=USD). It gained overnight as U.S. equity market jitters had investors sticking to safer assets.
Government bond yields across the euro area fell after Lane's comments that inflation will be persistently low in the coming years.
Oil prices were under pressure from a surprise rise in U.S. stockpiles and weak demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Brent crude (LCOc) was down 0.4% at $39.91 a barrel after falling nearly 2% on Thursday. U.S. crude (CLc1) dropped 0.2% to $37.23 a barrel, having fallen 2% in the previous session. [O/R]

BofA analysts, citing data for the week to Sept. 9 from financial flow tracking firm EPFR, said they saw a ""laggard rotation"" with year-to-date underperformers, such as emerging market stocks, attracting $3.4 billion, the largest in nine weeks.
The United States, Europe and Japan meanwhile all saw moderate outflows with Wall Street's growth stocks being dumped the most with $4.1 billion in outflows.
Wall Street's tech- and stimulus-led rally came to a screeching halt last week as investors booked profits after a run that boosted the tech-heavy Nasdaq index about 70% from its pandemic lows.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) - together known as ""FAATMAN"" - collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization between Sept. 2 and Sept. 8.
BofA said this month's fragility in stock markets was in part caused by a high concentration of tech stocks and the rising influence of retail investors, who grabbed the spotlight in recent months as markets have rallied in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 50% of the 7.2% return on the S&P 500 index in August was from just 10 tech stocks.
BofA however said it doesn't see a bear market coming, with the U.S. central bank ""so easy"" and Wall Street ""flush with cash"".
The bank suggests selling if the S&P 500 crosses 3,600 points. The index scaled 3,588 on Sept. 2 and has since lost nearly 7%.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.1% at 0835 GMT and was on track to end the week about 1.7% higher. The index has been in a holding pattern since June as economic growth lost momentum due to a stronger euro, increasing the cost of European exports. 
Meanwhile, the EU is ramping up preparations for a tumultuous end to the four-year Brexit saga as top officials prepared to brief its 27 members on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to break the divorce treaty.
""At this stage one would assume that the most logical resolution would be for the UK to back down: however, there appears absolutely no sign at all that this is going to happen,"" said Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank.
Most of the major sector indexes were lower, a day after the ECB held interest rates steady and said it was closely watching the euro.

A district court in Munich ruled that mobile communications technology used in Daimler vehicles violates a patent owned by Sharp, the Japanese electronics company said.
A source familiar with the matter said Sharp can enforce a sales ban against Daimler if it posts 5.5 million euros ($6.5 million) as a guarantee to cover any damages in the event the ban is overturned on appeal.
Daimler has filed a nullity action against the patent in a separate lawsuit before Germany's federal patent court in Munich.
Nokia (HE:NOKIA) won backing from a German court in a similar patent infringement lawsuit against Daimler over mobile communications technology in August.
Sharp, a unit of Taiwan's Foxconn (TW:2317), has also sued the Japanese unit of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), seeking an injunction to halt imports of some electric vehicles (EV) to Japan.

1696,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 04:08AM ET</span>",European Stocks Edge Lower; ECB's Lane Cautions on Recovery,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets largely weakened Friday, weighed by European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane cautioning over the region’s recovery.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France dropped 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.1%.
Writing in a blog post a day after the European Central Bank left its policy unchanged and lifted its forecasts on growth and inflation, Lane warned that the deflationary impact of the Covid-inspired recession has not been banished.
""Inflation remains far below the aim and there has been only partial progress in combating the negative impact of the pandemic on projected inflation dynamics,"" Lane said in a blog post.
""It should be abundantly clear that there is no room for complacency.”
Nordea still expects the ECB to add further stimulus at the December meeting. “The economic recovery is far from guaranteed, inflation and inflation expectations will rise slowly and the ECB may need to do more to secure easy financial conditions,” analysts at the Scandanavian bank said, in a research note. 
At the same time, relations between the European Union and Britain are souring, with the United Kingdom planning on drafting a law to break the divorce treaty between the two bodies, a move that would probably sink four years of Brexit talks. 
Data Friday showed Britain's economy expanded by 6.6% in July from June, roughly as expected, for its third month of growth as the country recovers from its coronavirus lockdown crash.
In corporate news, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock rose 0.3% after announcing that chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, who has led the mining giant since 2016, will step down after the company destroyed an Aboriginal heritage site in Australia while developing a new mine.
Swiss frozen baked goods maker Aryzta (SIX:ARYN) jumped 11% after it said it was in advanced talks with private equity firm Elliott Advisors over a takeover deal. French telecoms company  Altice NV  (AS:ATCA) surged 26% as its founder Patrick Drahi moved to take it private after an alarming stock slump this year.
Oil prices weakened Friday, hit by a surprise rise in U.S. crude inventories which raises concerns about faltering demand from the commodity’s biggest consumer.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported late Thursday a build of 2 millions in crude inventories for last week against expectations of a 1.335 million-barrel draw.  EIA's figures follow the American Petroleum Institute's report earlier in the week of a 2.970 million-barrel build.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $37.27 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.3% to $39.96. Both major benchmarks are down around 6.5% for the week and headed for a second week of declines.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,951.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1845.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",Rio Tinto loses execs after breaching social license: governance groups,"By Paulina Duran and Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO)'s decision to part ways with its CEO and two senior executives reflects heightened investor concern over social issues and the loss of ""social license"" to operate, governance groups and investors said.
The global miner said on Friday chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other executives would step down following an outcry over its decision to detonate part of an ancient gorge that showed 46,000 years of human habitation.
The move comes as investors are demanding increased transparency in how companies manage environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, said Danielle Welsh-Rose, Aberdeen Standard Investments ESG Investment Director, Asia Pacific.
""The leadership changes at Rio Tinto today are significant in many ways, including showing that investors and other stakeholders will hold companies to account on their ESG performance,"" she said.
Rio had been slow to recognise the importance of ESG issues following recent banking scandals in Australia, said Vas Kolesnikoff, Australian head of governance adviser ISS.
""This is the social license to operate. If you don't adhere to appropriate conduct and standards you're going to fall foul of investors,"" he said.
Ben Cleary, a partner at Tribeca Investment Partners said the Rio departures were a big moment for the mining industry.
""For the CEO and a couple of senior management to go over an ESG issue, it's just going to reverberate through board rooms throughout the resource sector,"" he said, adding that it could slow down the sector.
Rio's detonations, which allowed it to access higher grade ore, also came amid a wider movement in Australia focused on the treatment of Aboriginal groups, who fall behind the general population on markers ranging from child mortality to literacy.
Land rights barrister Greg McIntyre said it was too early to say whether Rio's move signalled a turning point in relation to dealings with Aboriginal groups.
""What it does indicate is that this issue is being taken seriously, which is a positive development, but it's not a solution to the problem.""

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>","Tesla plans to export China-made Model 3s to Asia and Europe, say sources","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla (O:TSLA) is planning to export Model 3 vehicles made in China to Asian and European markets, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. 
The U.S. automaker, which started delivering Model 3 electric sedans from its Shanghai factory in December, also plans from next year to sell China-made Model 3 vehicles to Japan and Hong Kong, one of the sources said.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The U.S. firm is expanding its manufacturing capacity in China to make Model Y sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) and adding lines to make more battery packs, electric motors and motor controllers.
Tesla, which aims to build 150,000 Shanghai-made Model 3 vehicles this year, sold about 11,800 vehicles in China last month.
The sources declined to be named as they are not allowed to speak to media. Bloomberg reported the plan earlier on Friday.

1699,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 03:27AM ET</span>",Tesla Plans to Start Shipping Out Cars Made at Shanghai Gigafactory,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. plans to ship cars made at its Shanghai Gigafactory to other markets in Asia and Europe, according to people familiar with the matter.
China-built Tesla Model 3s intended for delivery outside the country will likely start mass production in the fourth quarter, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. They said the markets targeted include Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, as well as Europe, where customers currently have to wait for a Tesla to be delivered from the U.S. Shipments could start as soon as the end of this year, or early 2021, according to the people.
The world’s biggest maker of electric vehicles is stepping up production as competition in the space intensifies, with traditional automakers starting to make EVs, especially for the China market, where local rivals like BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF). already have a strong footing. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). said this week it will take a $2 billion equity stake in electric truck maker Nikola Corp.
A representative for Tesla in China declined to comment.
Tesla’s main factory is in Fremont, California, where it assembles the Model S, Model X, Model Y and Model 3. That’s also where the vast majority of the vehicles’ components are made. The company is also building a factory in Berlin, its first in Europe. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is pursuing an ambitious timetable, targeting mid-2021 for that plant to start production.
Demand for EVs globally is rising, bolstered by tighter emissions regulations in Europe and an increasing awareness of climate change and the negative impact fossil-fueled cars have on the environment. While the coronavirus pandemic has dented sales of all vehicles -- global passenger EV sales were down 15% in the second quarter -- the market for EVs is forecast to expand about 7% this year.
Europe has led the growth in 2020, with EV sales in the continent’s main auto markets more than doubling in January to July compared with the same period in 2019, according to BloombergNEF.  Renault  (PA:RENA) SA’s Zoe has dominated, and Tesla is also facing competition from Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and BMW AG’s new electric models.
Singapore, Australia and New Zealand have trailed Europe and China in EV adoption and could present a bigger challenge for Tesla and its rivals. Tesla may also need to make changes to its assembly set-up in Shanghai to target those right-hand drive countries.
In China, Tesla delivers around 11,000 cars a month, all for the domestic market. Upstart NIO Inc. has been averaging around 3,500 recently, by comparison.
Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG described Tesla’s export plans as positive for the company, noting that China-made Model 3s have a lower cost than those built in the U.S. They added however that any move to export may signal that demand in China is below capacity.
Around 80% of the parts that Tesla uses at its Chinese plant will be sourced locally by the end of the year, Musk said during an earnings call in July. In December, before the outbreak of Covid-19, Song Gang, the manufacturing director at the Shanghai facility, said Tesla wanted to source 100% of its parts locally by the end of the year.
Tesla has been slashing its prices in China as part of a push to increase sales in the world’s largest EV market. Musk has said that making Tesla cars more affordable is a key target, and local sourcing helps with lowering expenses. Cars equipped with lithium iron phosphate batteries are also expected to launch in the market soon.
