ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's largest carrier Aegean Airlines (AT:AGNr) signed a $5 billion deal with Airbus (PA:AIR) for up to 42 aircraft to renew its fleet of single-aisle planes, stay competitive and add capacity for future expansion.
It is the largest order by a Greek carrier and third time Aegean has invested in new aircraft since launching operations 19 years ago.
Seeking to reduce maintenance and fuel costs, Aegean, a member of the Star Alliance airline group, had been considering the Airbus A320neo or Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX. It picked Airbus in late March.
""I believe it is a good day for Greece with the news coming out of Brussels, but certainly a very good day for Aegean and Airbus,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said at a signing ceremony at Aegean's technical base at Athens airport.
Earlier on Friday Greece reached an agreement with euro zone finance ministers, securing debt relief to smooth out its return to market financing after eight years of living mainly on loans from euro zone states.
""We begin a new cycle of growth while reducing our operating cost, necessary in a globalised and competitive market,"" said Dimitris Gerogiannis, Aegean's CEO, adding the order was for up to 42 planes, including 10 A321s.
Aegean, which flies domestic and international routes, also owns former flag carrier Olympic Airlines, which was privatized in 2013. Most of its current leases need to be replaced between 2019 and 2023. 
Last year, Aegean grew full-year net earnings by 87 percent on an improved load factor and higher sales, riding a strong tourism year. In 2017 it flew a total of 13.2 million passengers.
While the new aircraft will offer 15 percent fuel savings, they are just the hardware, CEO Gerogiannis said. ""It is the quality, culture and efficiency of our people that gives us our competitive advantage,"" he said.

Aegean executives said the carrier will also invest 30 million euros ($35 million) to build a new 12,000 square meter facility in Athens for flight and cabin crew training.

One important variable will be the resilience of each country’s stock market, given the potential for mayhem from a melting market. So it’s worth asking which one is more likely to stand its ground.
There are several considerations, most prominently quality, free float and valuation. Let’s see how they stack up for each country.
Quality
Higher-quality assets tend to hold up better in a crisis.
The MSCI China IMI (LON:IMI) Index — a collection of large-, mid- and small-cap companies — posted a higher profit margin than the MSCI USA IMI Index in each of the last nine years, the longest period for which numbers are available for both indexes. And not by a little. The China index had an average profit margin of 11.3 percent from 2009 to 2017, compared with 7.4 percent for the USA index. The China index’s return on equity was also higher every year except 2016.
Those results can’t be attributed to leverage despite widespread fears that Chinese companies are drowning in debt. The China index’s debt-to-equity ratio averaged 121 percent from 2009 to 2017, compared with 114 percent for the USA index. Even when adjusted for modestly more debt, China’s companies have been far more profitable.
Chinese companies have also enjoyed more stable earnings growth. The standard deviation — a common measure of volatility — of year-over-year earnings growth for the China index was 12.8 percent from 2010 to 2017, compared with 13.3 percent for the USA index.
Edge: China 
Free Float
A certain percentage of companies’ shares are held by promoters or insiders or, notably in the case of China, the government. As a practical matter, those shares are not available for trading, which is a problem in China. The average free float percentage for stocks in the USA index is 89 percent, compared with 50 percent for the China index.
The reason it matters is that less float translates into more volatility. That’s evident when comparing the price movement of each index in its local currency. The standard deviation of the USA index was 14.8 percent from June 1994 through May, compared with 32.7 percent for the China index, or more than double the volatility.
It implies that Chinese stocks react more harshly to bad news, and that’s been true since the tariffs were announced. The China index is down 3.2 percent over the last four trading days through Wednesday, while the USA index is down just 0.3 percent.
The fact that the Chinese government has a stake in the stock market isn’t likely to help. As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Shuli Ren pointed out on Thursday, the government tried and failed to lift stock prices three years ago. Its current attempt is failing, too.
Edge: U.S. 
Valuation
By nearly any measure, China’s stock market is much cheaper. The USA index’s price-to-earnings ratio is 46 percent more expensive than that of the China index. Its price-to-book ratio is 75 percent higher. And its dividend yield is 0.3 percentage points lower. 
A lower valuation doesn’t necessarily mean that China’s market will hold up better in the weeks or even months ahead because there’s no meaningful correlation between valuation and short-term market movements. But it does mean that China’s market has less room to fall, which could dampen the severity of a sustained downturn.
It’s worth noting that both markets are home to a comparable proportion of large companies, which are more likely than smaller ones to export their goods and services and therefore suffer the effects of the tariffs. Roughly 25 percent of the stocks in the China index have a market capitalization greater than $10 billion, compared with 22 percent in the USA index.
Edge: China 
So what does all this mean? In the near term, thin trading in China’s stock market would most likely result in more drastic declines than in the U.S. But China’s cheaper and higher-quality market appears to be better positioned to weather a sustained conflict.

Eurowings has come under fire in Germany recently for delays and cancellations, partly caused by its rapid expansion as it tries to move into the gap left by Air Berlin.
""Thanks to the successive introduction of further planes, we again expect a reliable flight operation,"" Eurowings CEO Thorsten Dirks wrote in a message to customers.
However, like other carriers such as Ryanair (I:RYA) and IAG (L:ICAG) group airline Vueling, Eurowings and also Lufthansa has also had to cancel flights due to air traffic control strikes and staff shortages and weather.

Lufthansa has also written to frequent flyers apologizing for the delays. The group's core brand has canceled around 2,800 flights so far this year, more than in the whole of last year.

CANNES, France (Reuters) - Former WPP (L:WPP) boss Martin Sorrell denied on Friday that he had visited a prostitute and paid using company money when pressed on a stage in front of hundreds of people about why he had left the advertising giant he founded.
Sorrell, speaking on the main stage at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, was asked by the New Yorker journalist Ken Auletta about reports in the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times that a colleague had reported him to WPP management for using a prostitute.
Sorrell initially referred to a denial made by his spokesman but when pressed to go further, he said: ""It's not true."" 
The 73-year-old quit WPP in April after the company said it had investigated an allegation of personal misconduct but neither Sorrell nor the company have given any details about the nature of the complaint.
The departure of the world's most famous advertising executive and one of Britain's leading businessman has prompted much speculation over why he stood down, including a lengthy report in the Financial Times which also said he had acted aggressively toward staff.
Asked about how he treated staff, Sorrell said he demanded high standards but did not think the newspaper description was fair and that he had received numerous messages of support from former colleagues.
He said he quit because he thought it was the right thing to do for the company he founded more than three decades ago and which now has 200,000 employees.
NEW VENTURE
He was on stage at the annual advertising conference -- where for years he held court -- to interview Auletta about his new book on the industry, Frenemies. 
After discussing the rapid change in the advertising world, Auletta said he needed to address the ""elephant in the room"" -- the reasons why Sorrell had felt compelled to leave WPP.
Asked whether he had visited a prostitute, Sorrell said: ""We've dealt with that by strenuously denying it.""
""So it's not true?"" Auletta asked.
""It's not true,"" Sorrell replied. 
""I felt the situation had become untenable and I felt it was in the best interests of the share owners, the clients, the people inside the company,"" he added, explaining why he left. 
Sorrell's exit sparked an investor backlash at the recent WPP annual meeting after it emerged he had left with share awards potentially worth up to 20 million pounds ($26.6 million) and without a non-complete cause.
He has already started a new venture after buying into a listed shell company and raised 150 million pounds from external investors to make acquisitions.
Sorrell was later asked at a press briefing in Cannes whether the nature of the allegations would deter those new investors. 

""We'll see in time,"" he said three times, when pushed by a journalist.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in British satellite operator  Inmarsat  (L:ISA) leapt on Friday after its U.S. suitor EchoStar (O:SATS) disclosed stakes in the London-listed company's equity and debt.
Inmarsat stock jumped by as much as 11 percent after EchoStar said that it had a near 3 percent shareholding in the British company, as well as a 10.4 percent position in its convertible bonds.
The disclosure, which was made in a stock exchange filing, comes after Inmarsat announced earlier this month that it had rejected a takeover approach from EchoStar because it ""very significantly undervalued"" its business. Inmarsat did not disclose the terms of the bid. 
The Colorado-based company now has until July 6 to make a firm offer or walk away from the FTSE 250 group, under rules set by Britain’s Takeover Panel.
Founded in 1979, London-based Inmarsat was set up by the International Maritime Organization as a way for ships to stay in communication with shore and make emergency calls. 
Since then, the group has become a private company, providing communications for aircraft and governments as well as shipping. 
The EchoStar approach has sent Inmarsat share price surging, swelling its market value to almost 2.8 billion pounds ($3.72 billion) amid speculation that a bidding war could erupt for the British company. Analysts have identified  ViaSat  (O:VSAT) and Eutelsat Communications (PA:ETL) as possible counterbidders.
At Inmarsat's current share price, EchoStar's equity stake is worth about 82 million pounds ($108.9 million). 
Its position in the convertible bonds represents a principal amount of $67.4 million, according to the filing. The bonds, which are eligible to convert into shares, are due to mature in September 2023 and were issued in August 2016.
EchoStar's stakebuilding in Inmarsat predates its bid approach, according to a person familiar with the matter, who added that the U.S. company first took a position in the British firm's shares in 2015. 
Under UK rules, EchoStar was required to disclose its position by today, the person added. 
Inmarsat shares were up 8.9 percent at 597 pence in afternoon trade in London.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest credit ratings agency S&P Global expects to move around 30-40 of its analysts out of London as a result of Brexit, the firm's president and chief executive has told Reuters.
S&P employs around 1,500 analysts globally but needs to meet demands from European Union markets regulator, ESMA, that rating firms have ""sufficient"" numbers of senior staff in the bloc when Britain officially leaves next year.
It already has sizeable offices in Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid and Milan and plans to open a new office in Dublin which staff could also move to, S&P's head Douglas L Peterson said during a trip to London. 
""It won't be many, (staff that have to move),"" he said. ""It will be in the tens, maybe 30 to 40"".
He added it could include a small number sovereign analysts though the larger share was likely to be in the firm's structured finance division that made 10 percent of rating revenues last year. 
A company spokesman couldn't immediately specify how many analysts it employs in London.
But with its other EU offices in major European cities Peterson added that he did not expect to have difficulty convincing staff to move. ""We have already had some people put their hand up,"" he said.
The departures from London will barely put a dent in S&P's overall presence in Europe's main financial center. But Peterson warned Britain needed to provide clarity on key post-Brexit regulatory arrangements to ensure there isn't more upheaval.
Britain and the EU have agreed in principle on a transition period lasting from Brexit Day next March to the end of 2020, but it has yet to be formally ratified.
The Financial Conduct Authority will take over supervision of ratings agencies in Britain, but ESMA was unable to say if it will continue to supervise UK-based ratings agencies during the transition period.
Without a bespoke trade deal after transition, ratings agencies in Britain would have to obtain ""endorsement"" from ESMA to continue serving EU customers. However, the sheer size of agencies like S&P could force them to base such services in the bloc.
S&P has an EU market share of 46 percent, the latest ESMA data shows, well ahead of nearest rival Moody's on 31 percent.

PARIS (Reuters) - French supermarket chain  Casino  (PA:CASP) and cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) are launching new beauty stores in Paris this weekend, the latest effort by brick and mortar retailers to retain customers in the face of online competition.
The two companies said on Friday that the new stores -- dubbed ""le drugstore parisien"" -- will offer beauty products and healthcare goods, as well as over-the-counter medicines.
For Casino, the tie-up with L'Oreal marks its latest move away from grocery stores, as France's traditional retailers seek new ways to appeal to shoppers.
The first two outlets will open this weekend in the chic 9th and 6th districts of Paris, attracting shoppers with hairdresser and drycleaning services, shoe-shining machines and mobile phone charging points.
For L'Oreal, the stores will give its products greater exposure. Unlike large pharmacy chains such as CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Duane Reade in the United States or Boots in Britain, French pharmacies stock only medicines and a limited range of personal products and often have restricted opening hours.
The ""drugstore"" outlets' longer opening hours are aimed at reflecting changing, modern lifestyles. 
A spokeswoman for Casino said a third ""drugstore"" could open in Paris if the first two did well, and that Casino and L'Oreal might expand the concept abroad. 
The companies did not give any financial details or targets for the ""drugstores"".
Department stores in the French capital are also seeking to give consumers a more interesting shopping experience to lure them away from buying goods online.
In January, Le Printemps opened a food hall on the 7th and 8th floors of its Haussmann building dedicated to men's fashion and luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH) opened a second upmarket La Grande Epicerie store in Paris's posh 16th district last year.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 05:33AM ET</span>",Volkswagen hands over regional responsibility to brands,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) on Friday said it is handing responsibility for managing regions to its different brands as part of a broader strategic overhaul to decentralize power at the Wolfsburg-based car and truck maker.
Chief Executive Herbert Diess, who took over in April, has embarked on a shake-up of the corporate structure at Europe's largest carmaker to slim down the company and boost its brands.
""We are spreading responsibility across several shoulders, we are making Volkswagen faster, leaner and more efficient,"" Diess said in a statement on Friday.
Its core Volkswagen passenger car brand will take over responsibility for North America, South America and the Sub-Saharan region, while Audi (DE:NSUG) will manage the Middle East and Asia.
Seat will handle the market in North Africa and Skoda will be responsible for Russia and India. China will remain under the remit of the Volkswagen group, the carmaker said.

In April, VW gave responsibility for group sales to Audi and production to the head of the Porsche brand. It has also bundled its luxury brands into a ""super premium"" cars division.

32,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 05:04AM ET</span>","European shares bounce, but eye worst week since March on trade tremors","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Strong financials stocks and better-than-expected euro zone economic data helped drive a bounce in European shares at the end of a tumultuous week marred by trade war worries. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) and its euro zone counterpart (STOXXE) were set for their biggest weekly loss in three months as the realities of rising global protectionism sank in, particularly for the autos sector.
The STOXX climbed 0.5 percent by 0830 GMT, while Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) rose 0.3 percent. 
Euro zone private business growth recovered in June and grew faster than expected, but manufacturing growth was the weakest in 18 months on trade worries, a PMI survey showed.
The better euro area data added to stronger figures from Germany and France to boost European benchmarks. 
Banks drove the lion's share of gains after the 35 largest U.S. banks cleared the first stage of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test.
U.S. subsidiaries of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and UBS (S:UBSG) easily met all the minimum capital requirements.
The European banks index (SX7P) climbed 1.2 percent, with UBS, Credit Suisse, Santander (MC:SAN) and HSBC (L:HSBA) among the biggest boosts. Deutsche Bank topped the DAX with a 1.4 percent gain. 
""Despite the recent negative press headlines concerning Deutsche Bank's U.S. operations, the U.S. IHC reported post-stress ratios well ahead of the minimums and a stress deterioration broadly in line with peers,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts. 
There remained signs of trade war anxiety, however. 
Autos stocks (SXAP) extended their losses, down 0.4 percent and the worst-performing sector. They sank on Thursday after  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) warned profits would be hit by Chinese tariffs on cars imported from the United States.
The autos sector index was headed for its worst week since the sell-off at the start of January 2016.
In single-stock moves, BPER Banca (MI:EMII) led the STOXX, jumping 6.4 percent after  Unipol  (MI:UNPI) raised its stake in the Italian regional lender.
""Within the context of high local political uncertainty which has weighed on government bonds and in turn on bank shares, this transaction could provide downside protection for BPER shares in the short term, notably as Unipol could still acquire another 5 percent of BPER,"" said GS analysts. 
It helped the Italian banking sector (FTIT8300) recover some of Thursday's losses as heavyweights Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) also rose. 
Overall, concern over a weaker economic picture and Italian politics has driven previously enthusiastic investors out of the European equity market, with tens of billions of outflows over the past three months. 
""We are noticing revisions for earnings and GDP in Europe which are pretty negative, as opposed to the more positive revisions from the U.S., based on earnings growth but also clearly on tech stocks,"" said Eleanor Taylor Jolidon, co-head of global and Swiss equities at UBP in Geneva. 

Europe's lack of ""Big Tech"" stocks to match Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has held it back and hampered its relative earnings growth.

33,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 04:58AM ET</span>",Stocks set for worst week in three months on trade war worries,"By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares rose on Friday but were set to end a second week lower amid intensifying worries over the fallout of a trade dispute resulting from U.S. tariffs, while oil prices were higher ahead of an OPEC meeting later in the day.
The MSCI All-Country World index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was up 0.2 percent in the European morning but down 1.3 percent on the week, its worst weekly showing since mid-March.
Investor anxiety over a possible full-blown trade war has deepened this week over increasingly sharp rhetoric between the United States and China, and growing evidence of the economic damage such a conflict could produce.
German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) cut its earnings forecast earlier this week, saying tariffs on cars exported from the United States to China would hurt Mercedes-Benz sales. 
India joined the European Union and China in retaliating against U.S. President Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium, raising import duties on U.S. almonds by 20 percent.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday the United States needed to make it harder for its trading partners to have high trade barriers in order to achieve Trump's ultimate goal of lower tariffs and a level playing field.
Chinese state media said on Friday that U.S. protectionism was self-defeating and a ""symptom of paranoid delusions"" that must not distract China from its path to modernisation.
""With no negotiations in sight at the moment, our base case (scenario) is shifting to a further escalation of the trade conflict between the two countries,"" wrote analysts at Danske Bank in a note to clients.
There is a risk of a further deterioration in relations on June 30, when Washington is due to announce a plan to restrict Chinese investments into the United States and limit exports of U.S. tech products to China, they added.
Strong financial stocks and better-than-expected euro zone purchasing managers index for services helped drive a timid relief bounce in European shares. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) and its euro zone counterpart (STOXXE) were set for their biggest weekly loss in three months as the consequences of rising protectionism sank in, notably for the autos sector.
The strong PMIs also boosted the euro (EUR=D4). It was last up half a percent on the day and was set to end the week higher by half a percent. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was 0.2 percent lower. 
Against the yen, the greenback was little changed. It was modestly higher at 110.14 yen , below a one-week high of 110.76 scaled the previous day amid lingering concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute.
""The potential for all-out trade war, European political risks and emerging market volatility remain potent factors that should contain dollar/yen within the current range, though the lack of downside over the last week or so suggests stronger underlying demand,"" wrote Robert Rennie, head of market strategy at Westpac.
The European PMIs also showed manufacturing growth was the weakest in 18 months on trade worries.
Elsewhere in Europe, Greece's borrowing costs fell to four-week lows on Friday after Athens won debt relief from the euro zone. 
Sterling was half a percent higher against the dollar  on Friday, extending gains made the previous day after the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane unexpectedly joined the minority of policymakers calling for a UK interest rate hike, citing concerns about growing wage pressure.
Oil prices rose on uncertainty ahead of a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers including Russia starting in Vienna later in the day. 
Saudi Arabia and Russia are in favour of raising output. Other OPEC-members, including Iran, have opposed this, resulting in a flurry of backdoor diplomacy ahead of the meeting.
Brent crude (LCOc1) traded at $74.00 a barrel, up 1.3 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude  rose 1.1 percent to $66.27 per barrel. 
Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) dropped as much as 0.35 percent at one point to touch its weakest since early December, before erasing losses to be up 0.15 percent. Still it was 2.3 percent off for the week.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) plumbed six-month lows, having lost 3.9 percent so far this week. South Korea's KOSPI (KS11) hit nine-month lows and in mainland China, the CSI300 index (CSI300) lost almost 5 percent this week to one-year lows.

Japan's Nikkei (N225) gave up 0.8 percent for a weekly loss of 1.7 percent.

37,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2018 03:51AM ET</span>",Japan watchdog orders improvements at cryptocurrency exchanges,"By Thomas Wilson
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's financial regulator said on Friday it has ordered cryptocurrency exchanges including Inc., one of the country's biggest, to make improvements to lax measures on money laundering.
The Financial Services Agency (FSA) slapped six exchanges with business improvement orders after it found flaws in their anti-money laundering systems and controls during on-site inspections.
BitFlyer said in a statement it would voluntarily halt the creation of new customer accounts as it makes efforts to shore up its systems. Others targeted by the FSA included well-known exchanges Quione and Bitbank Inc. 
The FSA has cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges since the $530 million theft of digital money from Coincheck, one of Japan's biggest, earlier this year. The heist underscored worries over the security of trading cryptocurrencies. 
Since the daring heist, the FSA has rejected applications to run exchanges, and ordered others to cease or improve business over weaknesses in customer protection. 

Due to chair the G20 in 2020, Japan hopes to take a global lead on the combating money laundering at cryptocurrency exchanges, and is pushing for adoption of new binding rules by 2019.

42,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>",China Stocks Poised for Bear Market on Trade and Growth Jitters,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index is headed for bear market territory as concern over a slowing economy and trade tension with the U.S. shows no sign of abating.
The Shanghai gauge fell 1.2 percent as of 9:34 a.m. local time Friday, taking its loss since its January peak to almost 20 percent. The index is at its lowest point since June 2016 and is one of the world’s worst performers this year. The descent toward a bear market has coincided with Beijing stepping up its deleveraging campaign. Losses accelerated this month after May economic data trailed economists’ forecasts and as the trade dispute with Washington became increasingly heated.
Some $1.6 trillion has been wiped from Chinese stocks since Jan. 24.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expects the CSI 300 Index, which is down 19 percent since a January peak, to enter a bear market that could last a year, weighed by slowing momentum in China’s economy and liquidity tightness. If U.S. President Donald Trump goes through with a threat to put tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese imports, it could cut as much as half a percentage point from the nation’s economic growth, according to economists.
Chinese policy makers have tried to soothe investor concern. People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang pledged on June 19 to use monetary policy comprehensively to keep liquidity appropriate and stable, a view echoed in a subsequent cabinet meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang.
At 2,847 points, the Shanghai gauge is trading below levels that previously were seen to trigger state support. The generally accepted definition of a bear market is a correction of 20 percent or more from the most recent peak.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers on Friday extended maturities and deferred interest of a major part of their loans to Greece along with a big cash injection to ensure Athens can stand on its own feet after it exits its bailout in August.
Greece has been living primarily on money borrowed from euro zone governments in three bailouts since 2010, when it lost market access because of a ballooning budget deficit, huge public debt and an inefficient economy and welfare system. 
With hundreds of reforms requested by its creditors already completed, Greece has made significant progress, but to lend to it again, investors need to know it will not collapse under the weight of servicing a debt of 180 percent of GDP.
""After eight long years, Greece will finally be graduating from its financial assistance,"" the chairman of euro zone finance ministers Mario Centeno told a news conference in the small hours of Friday after hours of negotiations of the deal.
""Further debt relief was needed to make Greek debt sustainable in the future,"" he said.
Finance Ministers Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters the deal made Greek debt viable again and paved the way for a return to market financing.
""The Greek government is happy with this deal,"" he said.
The key element of the debt relief is an extension of maturities and grace periods on 96.9 billion euros of loans granted to Greece under the second bailout by 10 years to smooth out any sharp debt servicing peaks for decades ahead. 
Greece will also get a 15 billion euro new loan, which will take the total cash buffer with which it will leave the bailout on Aug 20 to 24.1 billion. This will give it independence form market borrowing for some 22 months, euro zone ministers said in a statement. 
Athens faces bond repayments of around 7 percent of its output next year, the first after its third bailout ends in August. For more details of Greece's outstanding debt, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2JYhBYS.
The extension of maturities and deferral of interest and amortization payments are to reassure investors that Greece can handle servicing its debt long into the future -- a confidence booster needed all the more amid growing market concerns over looming trade wars and rising eurosceptism. 
""The problem of the Greek debt is behind us now,"" France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters.
To provide an incentive for future governments in Athens not to reverse the hard won reforms implemented under the bailouts, euro zone ministers agreed to offer Greece cash payments of 600 million euros every six months until 2022 if the country sticks to the economic course agreed with creditors.
The money will come from profits made by euro zone central banks on their holdings of Greek bonds that will gradually mature over the next four years.
The International Monetary Fund welcomed the deal saying it would improve Greek debt sustainability in the medium term.
But IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said the Fund maintained some reservations about it in the very long term, when assessed until 2060 and therefore welcomed the readiness of the euro zone to do more if an adverse economic scenario were to materialize over the coming decades.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi also noted the deal improved Greek debt sustainability over the medium-term and welcomed the option of further relief should it be needed.

Unlike the first two Greek bailouts, the IMF did not join the latest Greek program with it its own loans, but will continue to monitor Greece's performance alongside the euro zone.

45,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 08:19PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Tesla to close a dozen solar facilities in nine states - documents,"By Nichola Groom, Salvador Rodriguez and Kristina Cooke
LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's move last week to cut 9 percent of its workforce will sharply downsize the residential solar business it bought two years ago in a controversial $2.6 billion deal, according to three internal company documents and seven current and former Tesla solar employees.
The latest cuts to the division that was once SolarCity - a sales and installation company founded by two cousins of Tesla CEO Elon Musk - include closing about a dozen installation facilities, according to internal company documents, and ending a retail partnership with  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) that the current and former employees said generated about half of its sales.
About 60 installation facilities remain open, according to an internal company list reviewed by Reuters. An internal company email named 14 facilities slated for closure, but the other list included only 13 of those locations.
Tesla declined to comment on which sites it planned to shut down, how many employees would lose their jobs or what percentage of the solar workforce they represent.
The company said that cuts to its overall energy team - including batteries to store power - were in line with the broader 9 percent staff cut.
""We continue to expect that Tesla's solar and battery business will be the same size as automotive over the long term,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.
The operational closures, which have not been previously reported, raise new questions about the viability of cash-strapped Tesla's solar business and Musk's rationale for a merger he once called a ""no brainer"" - but some investors have panned as a bailout of an affiliated firm at the expense of Tesla shareholders. Before the merger, Musk had served as chairman of SolarCity's board of directors.
The installation offices that the internal email said were targeted for closure were located in California, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, New York, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Arizona and Delaware.
The company also fired dozens of solar customer service staffers at call centers in Nevada and Utah, according to the former Tesla employees, some of whom were terminated in last week's cuts. Those employees spoke on condition of anonymity because making public comments could violate the terms of their severance packages.
""It's been a difficult few days - no one can deny this,"" a Tesla manager wrote in a seperate internal email, sent to customer service employees shortly after the cuts were announced.
Tesla has been burning through cash as it tries to hit a target of producing 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans per week after production delays. The company faces investor pressure to turn a profit without having to tap Wall Street for additional capital.
The total number of cuts to the solar workforce remained unclear. Some personnel at facilities closing down were being transferred to other sites, the current and former employees said. SolarCity employed about 15,000 people at the end of 2015 but has since cut thousands of workers.
Ending the Home Depot partnership, which allowed for solar sales in about 800 stores, is part of Tesla's larger effort to absorb SolarCity into its high-end brand and sell through 90 of its 109 U.S. retail stores and its website, the company said.
""Tesla stores have some of the highest foot traffic of any retail space in the country,"" Tesla said.
Analysts questioned Tesla's plans for the solar business in light of the latest cuts to staff and retail operations.
""In effect they seem to be saying, ‘We have no strategy for selling solar,’"" said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research, adding that the SolarCity purchase ""looks pretty awful right now.""
FALLING SALES
In the first quarter of this year, Tesla installed 76 megawatts of solar systems - down from SolarCity’s more than 200 MW a quarter in early 2016, when it was the leading player in the industry. In announcing quarterly results in February, Tesla said growth in solar deployments would resume later this year.
Tesla's falling solar sales also could jeopardize the future of a joint venture with Panasonic, announced as Tesla moved to acquire SolarCity in 2016, to produce solar modules at a new factory in Buffalo, New York.
Tesla has an agreement with New York state requiring the company to spend $5 billion within 10 years. If Tesla fails to meet that obligation and others, the company may be required to pay tens of millions of dollars in penalties at various milestones, could lose its lease, or be forced to write down the assets, the company told investors in a May filing.
In response to questions from Reuters, Tesla said it is meeting its hiring and spending commitments for the factory.
In March, a Delaware judge ruled against a Tesla motion to dismiss a lawsuit by the company's shareholders over the SolarCity deal. The lawsuit alleged Tesla's board of directors breached its duties to shareholders by approving the merger.
SolarCity founder Lyndon Rive, who is Musk’s first cousin and left Tesla last year, did not respond to a request for comment.
HIGH MARKETING COSTS 
The move to end the longstanding Home Depot partnership blindsided many staffers because Tesla had announced an expansion of the arrangement as recently as February.
GTM Research analyst Austin Perea estimated the partnership has recently accounted for about half of sales, in part because of previous Tesla moves to cut back on other sales and marketing costs.
Such third-party retail partnerships are among the most expensive means of generating solar sales, according to the clean energy research firm, in part because retailers take a cut of each sale.
The cost of winning a customer through a store like Home Depot can be up to $7,000 per system, according to GTM Research, compared with a national average of $4,000 per installation.
Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes said the retailer's relationship with Tesla would last through the end of the year, adding that Home Depot would continue a partnership with Tesla competitor Sunrun in an undisclosed number of stores.
Over the past year, Tesla has stepped up efforts to sell solar and batteries for energy storage in its retail stores, something Musk said last year was ""a much more efficient channel for demand generation."" 
At the same time, Tesla stopped door-to-door sales, once among SolarCity's most successful means of reaching new customers, and salespeople were no longer allowed to hold local events or buy online leads, the former employees said.
Such tactics are standard practice across most of the competitive residential solar industry. 
The Home Depot partnership was costly but also integral to Tesla's solar panel sales, a former employee told Reuters. 

""It's an expensive account,"" the former employee said, ""but it does bring in all the revenue.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.-based money market funds posted $51 billion of net outflows for the week ended Wednesday, the largest cash withdrawal since 2011 and the seventh largest ever, according to Lipper data on Thursday.
The drawdown in money fund assets, which companies use as alternatives to bank accounts to manage their cash, likely stemmed from two factors: corporate tax receipts and investor payment on Treasury supply, said Pat Keon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters Lipper.
Last week, corporations were sending cash to the government ahead of a quarterly tax deadline. On June 15, the Treasury said it received $26.0 billion in corporate taxes, compared with $42.2 billion a year earlier.
Moreover, the Treasury raised about $43 billion in new cash as investors settled on what they bought at last week's Treasury auctions, which included $68 billion worth of three-year, 10-year and 30-year debt.
Meanwhile, U.S.-based equity funds posted $1.27 billion of net outflows in the week ended Wednesday, marking the third consecutive week of cash withdrawals, Lipper said.
The majority of those outflows came from U.S.-based equity exchange-traded funds, which posted net outflows of $5.8 billion. Conversely, U.S.-based equity mutual funds attracted $4.6 billion of net new cash for the same period, according to Lipper.

Emerging-market funds saw another volatile week. Investors pulled $4.36 billion of net cash from U.S.-based emerging market equity funds and $452 million from U.S.-based emerging market debt funds, according to Lipper data.

47,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 07:49PM ET</span>",Conservative U.S. commentator Charles Krauthammer dies,"By Bill Trott
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pulitzer Prize winner Charles Krauthammer, who gave up a psychiatric career to become one of the leading conservative political commentators in the U.S. media, died on Thursday at the age of 68, the Washington Post and Fox News said.
Krauthammer was a fixture on the Fox News Channel as well as on editorial pages of the Washington Post and other U.S. newspapers.
His work had been curtailed since having an abdominal tumor removed last August and in an open letter on June 8 he said doctors told him that he had only a few weeks to live due to a recurrence of the cancer. ""This is the final verdict,"" he wrote. ""My fight is over.""
Less than a month earlier, Krauthammer had told a Fox colleague that the worst appeared to be behind him.
The cause of death was cancer of the small intestine, his son, Daniel Krauthammer, told the Post.
Krauthammer, who in 1972 was left paralyzed from the neck down after a swimming pool accident while attending Harvard Medical School, was known for a dour expression, wry humor and sharp intellect.
He was a regular on Fox's weeknight show ""Special Report,"" and also wrote a column that was syndicated to hundreds of newspapers.
""We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and friend ... A gifted doctor and brilliant political commentator, Charles was a guiding voice throughout his time with Fox News and we were incredibly fortunate to showcase his extraordinary talent on our programs,"" Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News, said in a statement. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would sorely miss Krauthammer's ""friendship and his wise counsel.""
""His pen functioned like a lighthouse, helping all of us see more clearly and reason more thoroughly through the most important issues that our nation faced,"" McConnell said in a statement.
Krauthammer gave mixed reviews to President Donald Trump, questioning his ""loud and bombastic"" approach to the job and calling him a charlatan while praising actions such as withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.
He had been a leading critic of President Barack Obama and what Krauthammer perceived as his ""social democratic agenda,"" while supporting George W. Bush's intervention in the Middle East. He also liked President Ronald Reagan's stand against communism and popularized the term ""Reagan Doctrine"" to describe it.
Krauthammer was born in New York City on March 13, 1950, and grew up there and in Montreal, Canada. During his 14-month recovery from the diving accident, Krauthammer kept up his studies from his hospital bed and graduated on schedule from medical school in 1975. He then worked as a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital, also studying manic depression.
In 1978, Krauthammer moved to Washington to work in psychiatric research for the administration of Jimmy Carter, who he later would call a failed president, and drifted away from psychiatry. He became a speechwriter for Carter's vice president, Walter Mondale, before writing opinion pieces for The New Republic and Time magazine.
He joined the Washington Post and won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1987. In 2006, the Financial Times named him the most influential commentator in the United States.
""I leave this life with no regrets,"" Krauthammer wrote in his farewell statement. ""It was a wonderful life ... I am sad to leave but I leave with the knowledge that I lived the life that I intended.""
In a Fox News special about his life, Krauthammer said he never dwelled on the day he hit the bottom of a swimming pool with his head, severing his spinal cord.
""I made one promise to myself on day one - I was not going to allow it to alter my life,"" he said. ""On the big things in life, the direction of my life, what I was going to do, that wouldn't change at all.""

Besides his son, Krauthammer is survived by his wife, Robyn, who he met while studying at Oxford before medical school.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 07:48PM ET</span>",Peace plays: How foreign companies have lost a bundle in North Korea,"By Ju-min Park and Jane Chung
SEOUL (Reuters) - Months before the first summit between leaders of two Koreas in 2000, South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics Inc (KS:005930) invested $730,000 in Pyongyang's top computer lab. North Korean programmers there would develop online chess games and food recipes for Samsung to sell outside the North. 
Samsung quit the business as inter-Korea relations later deteriorated and the lab - Korea Computer Centre - was blacklisted last year for its alleged contribution to the North's weapons program.
As companies from South Korea to Russia and China again look to cash in on easing tensions with Pyongyang, Samsung's now defunct businesses in Pyongyang and hundreds of similar failed joint ventures underline North Korea's status as one of the world's highest-risk investment destinations.
Yet days before the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, a conference in Seoul to explore investment opportunities in North Korea drew about 600 attendees.
Samsung C&T Corp <028060.KS>, the construction arm of South Korea's largest conglomerate, set up a task force in May to review potential projects such as building railroads, a company official told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference.
""We are not clear yet on how to move in there, and want to know now how much risks we can take,"" the official said, asking not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media.
Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP) and state-run Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) (KS:036460) have held talks over the past two months to discuss a possible construction of gas pipelines passing through North Korea, a KOGAS spokesman said.
Other South Korean companies including retail giant Lotte and telecom company KT Corp (KS:030200) have also launched teams in recent weeks to study the resumption of stalled North Korea projects, officials said.
With vast mineral resources, poor transport networks, infrastructure and power facilities ripe for major upgrades and a population of nearly 26 million, North Korea is a potentially compelling investment opportunity once economic sanctions against it are lifted.
But risks range from political uncertainty to poor infrastructure, as well as the complexity of international sanctions that will continue to limit business even if they are gradually lifted, say several South Korean officials who have done business with North Korea.
In the case of Samsung, it could not expand its business in North Korea, partly due to U.S. sanctions that limit production of ""dual use"" items that can be used for weapons programmes, said Dong Yong-sueng, who advised the conglomerate on its North Korean business strategy.
""Samsung could not make even microwave ovens there. Why? The technology used in microwaves is the basis of missile guidance systems,"" Dong said.
(For graphic on North Korean joint ventures, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2MKfyWq)
HIGH RISK, LOW RETURN
By 2010, Samsung had cut all business ties in North Korea, including computer software, televisions and other consumer electronics and apparel manufacturing, following the sinking of a South Korean warship in waters near the border. Seoul blamed its neighbor for the sinking, a charge the North has denied.
Other setbacks had nothing to do with politics.
Between 1999 and 2004, South Korean TV parts makers built components for Samsung and LG Electronics (KS:066570) in Pyongyang to take advantage of cheap labor there.
Park Byung-chan, a businessman who represented the South Korean electronic components makers, said production was suspended after his North Korean partners were sacked over a corruption case.
Even before then, they were grappling with high transportation costs because there was only one shipping route through the peninsula's west coast. 
""There was a multi-faceted dimension of risks we couldn't control by ourselves,"" Park told Reuters.
A U.S. CIA open source document reviewed by Reuters lists more than 350 joint ventures with North Korea between 2004 and 2011, ranging from a piano factory with Austria, to a chicken and beer joint and a clothing factory in Pyongyang with South Korean investment.
Most of those businesses, three-quarters of which had Chinese partners, had been shut down even before last September, when the U.N. Security Council banned all joint ventures following North Korea's sixth nuclear test earlier that month.
One of the best-known enterprises is Koryolink, the joint venture between Egypt's Orascom Telecom, now Global Telecom (CA:GTHE), and North Korea's Post and Telecommunication Company.
Orascom said it officially ""lost control"" of its 75 percent stake in Koryolink in 2015. Despite the mobile network's rapid rise, the Egyptian firm has struggled for years to repatriate its cash from Pyongyang, filings reviewed by Reuters show.
A further 120 South Korean companies used to operate at the Kaesong joint industrial park north of the border before it was closed in 2016 after a long-range North Korean rocket launch.
NO BIG MACS SOON?
Often there is a race between large consumer companies to be the first to enter a newly opening economy.
McDonald's was the first American food chain to enter Russia in 1990 and KFC became the first Western food company in China in 1987. 
But Cho Nam-chan, who was the manager of South Korea's first McDonald's store in 1988, said poor roads and lack of supply chains would make it difficult for the hamburger giant to open its first outlet in North Korea. 
""McDonald's has to make money there and make sure that it is politically stable, and has stable local supplies, such as patties, freezing systems for ingredients and enough electricity to run the whole thing,"" Cho said.
McDonald's did not respond to Reuters inquiries regarding this story, but referred to recent comments from its chief executive that North Korea was not part of their discussions.
More attractive might be infrastructure projects such as building new railroads, funding for which could come from an international body or a consortium of governments to help underdeveloped countries, advisory firm Samjong KPMG, which co-hosted the Seoul conference told the participants.
Conference attendees were told to consider partnering with Chinese or Russians, North Korea's allies, to ease political threats while sharing costs and risks.
In April, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korea's Kim agreed to modernize railways and roads in North Korea, boosting shares in South Korean construction firms, train and steel manufacturers since. 
Expectations of trade with North Korea have also revived property prices in border towns in China and South Korea.
But the speed of economic cooperation won't be ""as fast as we have expected"" because of sanctions, Shin Hye-seong, a director at South Korea's Unification Ministry, told Reuters.
Past cooperation with North Korea has also exposed ""several problems"" and Seoul will offer ""systemic guarantees"" to cure those problems, Shin said, without elaborating.
TRUST ISSUES
For Rieh Chong-hun, a former chief executive at state-run utility Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) (KS:015760) the current discussions sound eerily familiar.
KEPCO was a prime contractor for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, which was created in 1995 to help build two nuclear power plants in North Korea in exchange for it eliminating nuclear programmes. 
With only a third of construction complete, the $4.6 billion project was suspended in 2006 after North Korea resumed weapons development, leaving South Korea unable to recoup its $1.1 billion contribution.

""The same story as today, a big promise was made then that North Korea would abandon nuclear weapons and we all agreed to build reactors in return,"" Rieh said. ""We trusted North Korea back then too.""

49,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 07:40PM ET</span>",Favorable U.S. tax ruling gives limited boost to big-box retailers,"By Nandita Bose
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Complying with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Thursday that forces online retailers to collect sales tax just like their brick-and-mortar counterparts will be a heavy burden for smaller e-commerce businesses.
But the ruling may not be a big blow to Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) , which already collects sales tax on items it sells directly to consumers, nor will it bring much advantage to large chains like Walmart Inc (N:WMT),  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and other retailers with brick and mortar stores.
The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed states to make online retailers collect sales tax, siding against e-commerce companies like  Wayfair Inc  (N:W) and  Overstock.com  Inc (O:OSTK) in their high-profile fight with South Dakota. 
Before the ruling only retailers with stores had to collect sales tax while e-commerce retailers could skip collecting them, which helped them lower prices. 
Thursday's ruling comes after President Donald Trump's criticism of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on issues including taxes.
The judgment levels the playing field between online and physical retailers and offers relief for U.S. states looking for additional revenue. 
Some tax experts said the ruling could turn out to be almost as significant for American businesses as the recent rewrite of the U.S. federal tax code. 
But for large retail chains that operate stores, the benefits are likely to be limited, according to tax and retail consultants. 
""I don't see brick and mortar stores seeing a big benefit from this ruling vis-a-vis their key online competitors,"" said Brian Kirkell, a principal at RSM that offers audit, tax and consultancy services to businesses including retailers.
""Large online retailers who compete with the likes of Walmart and Target have already been collecting and remitting sales tax for some time now because they saw the writing on the wall."" 
For example, Amazon collect sales tax on sales from its own inventory and on a portion of sales by third-party merchants who use its platform. 
The point is further reinforced by analysts like the ones from Baird Equity Research who said they expected a ""limited impact on Amazon"" from the ruling which means less upside for its rivals. 
Even the likes of Wayfair said it collects and remit sales tax on approximately 80 percent of its orders in the United States while Overstock.com said the decision will have no appreciable impact on its business. 
Deborah White, the general counsel of the Retail Industry Leader's Association, which led the fight on behalf of big retailers for a level playing field, said the ""decision is not going to be a panacea for how retail operates,"" but expects it to put an end to the competitive disadvantage suffered by retail stores when consumers visit them but opt to buy online. Consultants like Mark Grinis, partner, global real estate at EY, said he did not expect a surge in demand for stores even if prices ticked up for online businesses. 
""Online retailers still have a lot of pricing power because their overhead costs are low and that would make it hard for those with stores to benefit substantially."" 
What would further complicate outsized gains from the ruling is a growing culture of convenience that comes with online shopping, traders and investors said. 
""If this had come out 10 years ago, it would be a bigger factor than it is today,"" said Mark Kepner, an equity trader at Themis Trading. ""The internet is ingrained as part of commerce today. It's not changing any time soon."" 
IMPACT ON SMALLER ONLINE SELLERS 
While the decision does not significantly change the fortunes of big chains or e-commerce retailers, the impact from the decision is likely to be felt by smaller online businesses. These small retailers will be less impacted by an uptick in prices as they will be able to pass that on to the consumer. 
But the cost increase for them will come in the form of a heavy compliance burden trying to navigate the more than 10,000 tax jurisdictions in the U.S. as 45 of the 50 states impose sales taxes on purchases that range between 4.5 percent to 10 percent. 
They will have to examine and retrofit operations to determine where they have to collect tax, whether their goods are taxable, and how they will handle tax computation, filing, and remittance, consultants said. 
""We are talking about middle-market businesses that have a CFO and maybe no tax department and that rely on an accounting firm to be their tax department,"" RSM's Kirkell said.
The chief executive of a medium-sized sporting goods company based in San Diego, who did not wish to be identified to avoid making his company a target for state tax collectors, said it was unreasonable to expect small and medium sized businesses to deal with thousands of jurisdictions.

""I think the bigger worry though for businesses here is if these states will come back for back taxes,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in New York ruled on Thursday that the structure of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unconstitutional, forbidding the agency from suing a company that advances money to people awaiting settlement payouts.
The decision by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska is at odds with a February ruling by the federal appeals court in Washington that upheld the CFPB's structure.
Preska said the office of New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, which joined the CFPB in suing New Jersey-based RD Legal Funding LLC, could continue pursuing the case. 
""We will continue to vigorously pursue our case against RD Legal for as many victims as possible,"" said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General's office.
If another appeals court upholds Preska's ruling, it could make it more likely that the issue will go to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The CFPB declined to comment.
The CFPB was created as part of the Democrat-backed 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law to combat abusive lending. It has been the subject of political and legal battles since U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, took office. 
Under the leadership of Mick Mulvaney, appointed as the agency's temporary head in November, the CFPB has shelved new regulations and dropped cases against payday lenders.
""We are pleased that court correctly found that the CFPB is unconstitutional as structured, and this underscores that the CFPB never should have brought this action in the first place,"" said David Willingham, a lawyer for RD Legal Funding, in a statement.
Preska said she agreed with a dissenting judge in the Washington case, who found it unconstitutional that the agency was headed by a single director who served a five-year term and could be fired by the president only for cause.
The White House announced earlier this month that Trump would appoint Kathy Kraninger, an Office of Management and Budget official, to succeed Mulvaney as head of the CFPB.
In their lawsuit, filed in February 2017, the CFPB and attorney general claimed RD Legal Funding and related entities used deceptive tactics to scam borrowers, including first responders to the Sept. 11th attacks and National Football League retirees with brain injuries. They said borrowers often ended up paying back twice as much or more than what they received upfront.
Preska ruled Thursday that the attorney general had made plausible claims that RD Legal Funding violated federal and New York law, denying the company's motion to dismiss the case.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>",Intel CEO resigns after probe of relationship with employee,"By Munsif Vengattil and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) Chief Executive Brian Krzanich resigned on Thursday after an investigation found he had a consensual relationship with an employee in breach of company policy.
The head of the largest U.S. chipmaker is the latest in a line of men in business and politics to lose their jobs or resign over relationships viewed as inappropriate, a phenomenon highlighted by the #MeToo social media movement.
Krzanich led Intel as rival chipmakers ate away at its dominance in the technology over several decades and he also presided over a series of high-level executive departures. 
The change in leadership comes as Intel expands beyond personal computers and servers into areas such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, where smaller competitors including  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) are strong.  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) leads in the mobile chip market.
The board named Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan as interim CEO and said it has begun a search for a permanent CEO, including internal and external candidates.
""An ongoing investigation by internal and external counsel has confirmed a violation of Intel's non-fraternization policy, which applies to all managers,"" Intel said in a statement, declining to give any further information about the probe. Its shares fell 2.4 percent.
The company's board was informed a week ago that Krzanich had a mutual relationship with an employee in his chain of command in the past, according to a source familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. The relationship began before Krzanich became CEO in 2013 and ended several years ago, the person said.
'BK' OUT
Krzanich, who did not have an employment contract, is entitled to a $38 million ""walk-away"" payment in the event of a voluntary termination, according to Intel's regulatory filings. 
Of that, $31 million is in the form of accelerated stock awards and $4.1 million in the form of deferred compensation, based on Intel's share price on Dec. 29.
An Intel spokesman declined to say whether the walk-away payment applied to Krzanich's resignation, but said the investigation into Krzanich's conduct continued and that the board reserved the right to take further action. 
Corporations are under increasing pressure to ""walk the walk"" on executive behavior with the rise of the #MeToo movement, said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners.
In the last few months Martin Sorrell, founder of advertising giant WPP Plc (L:WPP), and casino mogul Steve Wynn of  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN) resigned after accusations of impropriety. Wynn has denied the accusations and Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing.
Krzanich, 58, an engineer and Intel veteran known at the company as ""BK,"" was appointed CEO in May 2013. Intel shares more than doubled during his tenure as the company expanded into new markets. 
He was recently credited with containing the fallout from the discovery of security flaws in the company's chips that could allow hackers to steal data from computers, although his sale of much of his Intel stock before the flaws were disclosed to investors attracted some criticism. 
TIME FOR AN OUTSIDER?
His temporary replacement, Robert Swan, has been Intel's CFO since October 2016 and previously spent nine years as CFO of eBay Inc (O:EBAY). Given his short tenure and lack of experience in manufacturing, he is not likely to be named permanent CEO, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay said.
While Intel dominates in processors for servers and data centers, global competitors are catching up with its manufacturing technology, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.
""BK will go down in history as the CEO that let Intel's process leadership advantage slip away,"" he said, adding that a change at the top could bring in fresh ideas.
Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel, said that Intel would take the change in stride.
""Although we respect Krzanich's efforts in redirecting Intel's strategy from a computer-centric to a data-centric company, we view Intel as a process-driven company with a deep bench of CEO candidates that can continue to drive the corporate strategy,"" he said.
In its 50-year history, Intel has never appointed a permanent CEO who did not come up through the company's ranks.
But those ranks are thinner than they used to be, with prominent Intel executives such as former CFO and manufacturing chief Stacy Smith, former president Renee James, ex-architecture chief Dadi Perlmutter and Dianne Bryant, who headed the data center group, leaving in recent years.
Instead, Krzanich's replacement could end up being one of the outsiders he brought into the company's executive ranks, a sort of ""insider outsider"" such as Murthy Renduchintala, Intel's chief engineering officer who joined Intel in 2015 after helping lead Qualcomm's chip business.
""They've got some very good people they've brought in,"" said Dan Hutcheson, CEO of VLSI Research Inc, who ""know the company, know the new direction. It's not a turnaround story.""
UBS analyst Tim Arcuri wrote to clients that ""the door is open to hire from the outside."" 
Intel on Thursday raised its second-quarter revenue and profit forecast, saying it expects quarterly revenue of about $16.9 billion and adjusted profit of about 99 cents per share, up from a previous forecast of $16.3 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of 85 cents.
Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $16.29 billion and adjusted profit of 85 cents per share.

""There are no new payments as part of his departure,"" a source familiar with the company told Reuters.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",How a powerful inquiry upended one of Australia's grandest companies,"By Jonathan Barrett and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - One of Australia's oldest financial institutions, AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), spent years building the country's largest network of financial advisers to recommend its products, and well over a century polishing its brand.
But in a bruising few months, some investors say two crucial elements to AMP's success - its good name and model of licensing external advisers to distribute products - have been devastated. 
AMP, already under pressure from various government reforms, has been put under the microscope at the country's powerful inquiry into financial services industry misconduct.
Regulators have unpicked the most controversial parts of the distribution model used by AMP, with companies no longer allowed to pay commissions to advisers for recommending new products.
Investors are now also pricing in potential restrictions flowing from the Royal Commission such as forcing the separation of the development of financial products from the selling of them.
""About a week or two into the Royal Commission we sold out our position, mainly because we couldn't price the potential downside,"" said Atlas Funds Management founder Hugh Dive, who crystallized a 5 percent loss on the trade.
""This is a major Australian financial services company, but they've lost a chunk of their board, their chairman and their CEO, and it's been the worst hit.""
Seven senior officials have now left the 169-year-old company since the inquiry heard the company had charged thousands of customers for financial advice it never gave, then doctored a supposedly independent report to the corporate regulator about it, which could lead to criminal charges.
AMP's interim executive chairman Mike Wilkins said the company was working on earning back community trust by improving its systems and remediating clients who have lost out. 
""Our strategy remains unchanged for now and our underlying business is strong,"" Wilkins said in a statement to Reuters. 
""We are confident in the strength of our products, investments and the value of financial advice, which remains a cornerstone of AMP.""
AMP shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-April, when poor practices at the asset manager started to be revealed at the inquiry. Shares in the country's four largest banks have fallen by about 8 percent over the same period, while the broader financial sector <.AXFJA> is little changed. 
The inquiry findings have sparked several class action lawsuits on behalf of investors who argue AMP didn't meet its market disclosure obligations. AMP, which demutalised and listed in 1998, has said it would ""vigorously defend"" the claims.
WHAT'S IN A NAME?
The share sell down has caused immediate pain to investors, but some analysts argue that might be just the beginning.
The research arms of  Macquarie Group  (AX:MQG) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have started to factor in significant client outflows - investors taking money out of the fund manager's products - into their forecasts, cutting AMP's fee-earning potential. 
Macquarie expects the brand damage alone could result in outflows equivalent to 27 percent of assets under management (AUM) in its wealth management division over the next few years.
Morgan Stanley analysts are more optimistic and say AMP's strong brand and advisory network may prove resilient.
But the investment bank also factors in a ""bear"" case scenario where the scandal could cause A$15 billion in outflows - or 15 percent of AUM - by fiscal 2021. 
Jason Beddow, managing director at Argo Investments, a top 20 shareholder of AMP, said the company's new management would need to adapt quickly to any regulatory changes flowing out of the Royal Commission.
""We are still a shareholder but clearly the organization needs to change,"" said Beddow. ""It's a matter of how much they can change and over what time frame."" 
DISTRIBUTION UPHEAVAL
Australia's big banks and wealth managers spent the early 2000s jostling to build the biggest internal financial planning businesses, while also licensing external advisers to distribute their investment and insurance products. 
This was usually done through incentives or controlled lists of products an adviser is licensed to recommend, dominated by the license-holder's own offerings.
AMP built the biggest network of advisers in the country with more than 2,600 advisers working for its planning business and AMP-licenced practices by 2018, according to researcher Adviser Ratings.
Along with building the largest advisory network, AMP is also the third largest fund manager in the country after Macquarie and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia-owned Colonial First State. All up, it manages and administers over A$257 billion in assets, according to its annual report. 
But the close ties between its advice and asset management arms are now under existential threat.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts say separating the units would not only threaten AMP's wealth advisory revenues but given the division is a distributor of the company's insurance, banking and investment products, it would impact the other businesses.
The inquiry is expected to start making legislative recommendations to the government later this year.
AMP's Wilkins said he had been working closely with the company's corporate clients to reassure them about the future of the business. 
""We experienced an increase in customer call center inquiries and withdrawal requests after the Royal Commission hearings, although this has eased,"" Wilkins said.
While Australia's big banks are facing the same pressure on their distribution models, they have more diversified income streams than a product-focused fund manager.
The banks have also reformed their models and reduced their reliance on advisers. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) is shedding around 700 of its aligned advisers through the sale of its wealth management business to IOOF Holdings (AX:IFL).
Adviser Ratings forecasts massive upheaval in the advice sector, expecting more than 14,000 advisers - half the industry - to exit over the next five years.
Adviser Ratings chief executive of wealth, Mark Hoven, said this would be fueled in part by new education standards prompting many advisers to retire or leave the industry, and Royal Commission-led changes to the sector.

""The fast ones are realizing it's a new game, the slow ones are just doing what they've always done,"" Hoven said.

Disney in a regulatory filing said it was willing to divest the assets, potentially including regional sports networks. The media conglomerate had previously planned to divest Fox assets that generated $500 million in EBITDA.
Fox has been in the middle of a bidding war between Disney and Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA), with Disney on Wednesday raising its bid for the bulk of Fox's film and television assets to $71.3 billion. Comcast is likely to further raise its offer.
Disney and Comcast want to add to their own entertainment businesses with Fox's well-known TV shows and movie franchises, like the ""X-Men"" superheroes and ""The Simpsons,"" to better compete with fast-growing digital rivals Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).

Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, who has been working with regulators around the world for the past six months, has downplayed antitrust concerns related to the deal.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit accusing  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG of withholding up to $300 million of compensation from U.S.-based brokers when it closed their private banking unit in 2015.
U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco ruled that the plaintiff Christopher Laver was bound by an agreement to arbitrate employment-related disputes, and could not pursue his proposed class action on behalf of roughly 200 brokers.
The judge also said any arbitration details should be worked out in New York, where Credit Suisse thought the case belonged.
A lawyer for Laver did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Credit Suisse said it was pleased with the decision.
Laver had sued on behalf of brokers who refused or claimed they were unable to move to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, which was given exclusive recruiting rights when Credit Suisse shut the 275-broker private banking unit. 
He said Credit Suisse's decision to enter a ""recruiting agreement"" with Wells Fargo, rather than formally sell the unit and trigger payouts, enabled the Swiss bank to stiff brokers by claiming they had all voluntarily resigned.
Credit Suisse has said it was standard industry practice for brokerages such as Wells Fargo to pay the deferred compensation at issue to new hires.
""Plaintiffs cannot be paid the same money twice,"" Credit Suisse spokeswoman Karina Byrne said.
Laver, who lived near San Francisco, joined UBS AG after ending his 13-year stint at Credit Suisse. He has worked in financial services since 1981.
Wells Fargo was not a defendant and was not accused of wrongdoing.

The case is Laver v Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-00828.

55,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 06:16PM ET</span>","SEC judge appointments unconstitutional, U.S. high court says","By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court gave presidents more control over key jobs in federal agencies on Thursday, ruling that the way the Securities and Exchange Commission selected in-house judges who enforce investor protection laws violated the U.S. Constitution.
The justices agreed with President Donald Trump's administration that the SEC, in having low-level staff install administrative law judges, infringed upon powers given to the president in the U.S. Constitution's ""appointments clause"" regarding the filling of certain federal posts.
The ruling could reverberate through the federal government, which has nearly 2,000 administrative law judges who decide matters as varied as unfair trade practices, veterans benefits and patent infringement.
The court's 7-2 decision backed Raymond Lucia, a California-based former radio host and investment adviser who was banned by an SEC administrative law judge from investment-related work and fined $300,000 for making misleading claims in his ""Buckets of Money"" retirement wealth strategy. 
The ruling marked a victory for the Republican president, who has sought to limit the power of certain federal agencies. Trump's administration sided with Lucia, reversing the government's previous stance supporting the SEC taken by the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.
The Justice Department said it was pleased with the decision.
The ruling, authored by liberal Justice Elena Kagan, could also make it easier for these in-house judges to be fired by a president's political appointees in agencies rather than being protected from such action, as is currently the case. 
The justices overturned a lower court ruling that had endorsed the SEC's hiring practice for the judges. The agency's commissioners, who are presidentially appointed, should have named them, not SEC staff, the justices said. 
Six justices found the hiring process unconstitutional while Justice Stephen Breyer said it violated only federal administrative law. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.
Lucia must now be given a new hearing in front of a properly appointed administrative judge, or the commission itself, the justices said. 
'CONSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY'
""We are thrilled with the result, which is a victory for the rule of law, constitutional accountability and liberty,"" Lucia's attorney Mark Perry said. 
An SEC spokesman said the agency is reviewing the decision.
The SEC had argued that its judges were merely employees in part because their decisions are not final and still subject to review by the commission.
It marked the latest case in which the Supreme Court limited the SEC's powers. The justices last year scaled back the agency's ability to recover ill-gotten profits from defendants' misconduct, and on Monday accepted a case that could narrow the scope of defendants' liability for securities fraud.
With Thursday's decision, ""the Supreme Court continues its growing streak of rebukes to the SEC,"" said Nick Morgan, a lawyer at the firm Paul Hastings who previously worked in the agency's enforcement division. 
Kagan said administrative judges wield powers extensive enough to qualify under the Constitution as ""inferior officers"" subject to appointment by the president, a federal department head or a court. Just ""as armies can often enforce their will through conventional weapons, so too can administrative judges,"" Kagan said. 
The SEC charged Lucia with securities fraud in 2012. SEC Administrative Law Judge Cameron Elliot found him liable, barring him from the industry and ordering him to pay $300,000 in fines. 
Corporate rights groups had complained that as the SEC's enforcement powers expanded, it sent more cases to its own judges rather than federal district courts, giving the agency an unfair ""home court"" advantage.

The ruling could affect dozens of cases pending before the SEC and other cases in federal appeals courts. Perry, Lucia's lawyer, said there are about 150 administrative judges across 25 agencies who might fall under the officer designation.

""For London, for Great Britain, this is about survival. You shouldn't believe that there is always fair play over there,"" Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) boss Theodor Weimer told a financial conference.
Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital that is also home to the European Central Bank, is seeking to pick up business and lure bankers from London ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union in early 2019.
Deutsche Boerse is, in particular, seeking to win a piece of the lucrative market for clearing financial contracts denominated in euros that is now dominated by LCH Clearnet, a unit of the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE).
Weimer also said: ""The British will do everything to preserve London's standing as a financial centre - by fair or perhaps even foul means: tax cuts, incentives and the like.""
The tough talk follows the Brexit-induced collapse of a merger between Deutsche Boerse and the LSE that was followed by the exit of the German company's CEO, Carsten Kengeter, amid an insider trading scandal.

Weimer, appointed to replace Kengeter, said after starting the job earlier this year that he wants to win a quarter of euro clearing from London as Britain leaves the EU.

61,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 05:23PM ET</span>",Supreme Court lets states force online retailers to collect sales tax,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - States may force online retailers to collect potentially billions of dollars in sales taxes, the U.S. Supreme Court said in a major ruling on Thursday that undercut an advantage many e-commerce companies have enjoyed over brick-and-mortar rivals.
In a 5-4 ruling reviving a South Dakota law challenged by Wayfair Inc,  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK) Inc and Newegg Inc, the justices overturned a 1992 high court precedent that had barred states from requiring businesses with no ""physical presence"" there, like out-of-state online retailers, to collect sales taxes.
Shares of online retailers fell following the ruling, which opened the door to a new revenue stream to fill state coffers - up to $13 billion annually, according to a federal report.
""Big Supreme Court win on internet sales tax - about time!"" President Donald Trump, who has bashed online retail powerhouse Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and whose administration backed South Dakota, said on Twitter. ""Big victory for fairness and for our country. Great victory for consumers and retailers.""
The ruling likely will result in many consumers paying more for online purchases. Because many e-commerce companies do not collect state sales taxes on purchases, they have had an advantage over brick-and-mortar businesses that do collect it. 
South Dakota's law, enacted in 2016, focused on larger out-of-state e-commerce companies, requiring them to collect sales tax if they amass $100,000 in sales or 200 separate transactions. Other states are now expected to pursue sales tax on out-of-state online purchases, with more legal fights likely. Forty-five of the 50 states have sales taxes.
Overstock closed down 7.2 percent and Wayfair dropped 1.6 percent, though both said the ruling would have no major impact on their businesses. Amazon shares closed down 1.1 percent.
Amazon, which was not involved in the Supreme Court case, collects sales taxes on direct purchases from its site but does not typically collect taxes for merchandise sold on its platform by third-party vendors, representing about half of total sales. The ruling means states may now seek to tax more of those sales, Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said.
Trump has blasted Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper that the Republican president has disparaged for its coverage of him. 
Liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined four conservative justices in the majority in the ruling authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, while conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's three other liberals in dissent.
""Rejecting the physical presence rule is necessary to ensure that artificial competitive advantages are not created by this court's precedents,"" Kennedy said.
In the digital era, the costs of complying with different tax regimes ""are largely unrelated to whether a company happens to have a physical presence in a state,"" Kennedy wrote.
'DEFEND MAIN STREET'
""This is a great day for South Dakota. We have long fought the battle to defend Main Street businesses and now with today's ruling, all businesses will compete on a level playing field,"" South Dakota Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard said.
Roberts, in dissent, said e-commerce has exploded in the United States in part because there have been uniform rules.
""Any alteration of those rules with the potential to disrupt the development of such a critical segment of the economy should be undertaken by Congress,"" Roberts added.
Democratic U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota was on the losing side in 1992 when she was that state's tax commissioner in the ruling that was overturned on Thursday. Heitkamp suggested that states follow South Dakota's lead and enact laws tailored not to target small businesses.
""It's important that you look at what the court said about it not being a blank check for the states. That should be a message to the states,"" Heitkamp told Reuters.
Shares of eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Etsy Inc, which both provide platforms for small retailers to sell their wares, were off 3.2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively.
Shares of major retailers that have a sizeable presence online as well operating brick-and-mortar stores responded positively.  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) closed up 1 percent and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc was up 0.7 percent.
The South Dakota law and others like it could yet face legal challenges on other grounds. Congress could also intervene to set a nationwide standard.
""You will certainly see, absent congressional action, significant litigation, as states try to push the envelope on this,"" said Mike Dabbs, senior director of government relations at eBay, which had backed Wayfair.
Jeffrey LeSage, Americas vice chairman for tax at accounting firm KPMG, said the ruling ""could turn out to be almost as significant for American businesses as the recent rewrite of the U.S. federal tax code.""
The win was welcomed by groups representing brick-and-mortar retailers and decried by e-commerce advocates.
The ruling puts an end to a legal regime that ""distorts free markets and puts local brick and mortar stores at a competitive disadvantage with their online-only counterparts,"" said Deborah White, general counsel of the Retail Industry Leaders' Association.

On the other hand, small internet businesses will lose out because of the increased compliance costs, said Chris Cox, a lawyer for e-commerce industry group NetChoice.

62,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 04:47PM ET</span>",The Ballmers are upping the game of giving away money,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)
What is a fitting follow-up to Steve Ballmer’s career at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), where he was one of the tech giant's first employees and longtime CEO? How about becoming co-owner of basketball’s Los Angeles Clippers franchise with his wife four years ago and also trying to figure out one of the trickiest puzzles in philanthropy.
Steve and Connie Ballmer are attempting to tackle economic mobility, or how to give low-income, disadvantaged kids a legitimate shot at the American Dream.
For the latest in Reuters’ “Life Lessons” series, the Ballmers spoke about their own winding life journeys.
Q: How did your early years influence where you are now?
Steve: My dad was an immigrant from Switzerland who went to work for GM and then Ford for 30 years and he spoke with pride of working for those great American companies. He had an expression he used all the time: ‘If you do a job, do a job.’ It sounds silly but I gotta say it has rung in my head my whole career. It meant if you’re not going to really work at something, then you shouldn’t even start.
Connie: I grew up in Oregon’s Willamette Valley, on a farm surrounded by turkeys and cows. It gave me a real appreciation for smaller rural communities. We didn’t have great wealth so it was a real juxtaposition to where I am now. It was a nice grounding place to start.
Q: Once you hit it big by being one of Microsoft’s first employees, how did you handle that success?
Steve: I dropped out of business school to be a bookkeeper for a little 30-person company so I wasn’t actually sure I made the right decision. But I didn’t really need to think about investments until the company went public. In my early days, my broker was just a guy I had gone to college (Harvard) with – someone by the name of Jim Cramer, who you might know from “Mad Money.” I knew him because we worked on the school paper together. He was the editor and I handled ad sales.
Q: How are you directing your philanthropic dollars these days?
Connie: We are particularly interested in the social-services sector, like kids and families at risk. The difficulty about philanthropy in this area is that organizations can be pretty small, unlike hospitals or universities. So we are trying to build non-profits up and explore how we can have the most impact – and how to make it all happen faster.
Steve: If you look at the numbers, kids from birth don’t have a lot of opportunity to aspire to much more than their parents had. That is a problem of economic mobility and it seems like a fundamental issue of fairness to us. Every kid deserves a shot.
Q: You bought the L.A. Clippers – a very different operation from Microsoft - so what has that experience taught you?
Steve: For me it has been a ton of fun. We have some great experts like Lawrence Frank and Doc Rivers and Jerry West who help us think through things like coaching and putting together the right roster. The business side has some interesting stuff, too, as we look towards a new arena. I love the enthusiasm and juice I get out of it.
Q: Just as the players learn from you, do you learn from the players?
Steve: Our guys have an unbelievable work ethic. Look at the calmness under pressure of a guy like Lou Williams. One thing I’ve learned from watching basketball: Whether you hit or miss your shot, you have to let go of the outcome and move on.
Q: You have three kids, so have you advised them on how to handle wealth down the line?
Steve: At some point they may get some money from us. But right now they are out there making it on their own. So I tell them, make sure you have a good budget! We also talk to them about avoiding visible affluence because it really changes the way people perceive you.
Q: What life lessons do you try to pass along to them?

63,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",PayPal to acquire fraud prevention company Simility for $120 million,"By Anna Irrera
(Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) has agreed to acquire fraud prevention technology company Simility for $120 million in cash, it said on Thursday.
Palo Alto, California-based Simility sells machine-learning-based technology to help online merchants spot fraudsters and improve risk management. 
PayPal plans to make Simility's services available to its merchants following the close of the transaction, which is expected by the end of the third quarter, it said. 
The acquisition underscores PayPal's broader ambition to offer small online merchants the same capabilities of bigger e-commerce providers, Bill Ready, the company's chief operating officer said in an interview.
""We are buying a company that provides great tools that merchants can use on their own,"" Ready said. 
For example, merchants will be able to use Simility's technology to adjust their fraud controls based on what kind of products they sell. 
The acquisition is the fourth deal announced by PayPal in little over a month, as it continues to aggressively expand its business beyond just online payment processing. 
Since separating from online marketplace eBay (O:EBAY) in 2015, PayPal in San Jose, California, has sought to transform itself via partnerships and acquisitions from mostly processing online transactions for its parent company to offering a suite of digital financial services.
These range from lending to small businesses to facilitating money transfers between merchants and customers.
In May it said it had agreed to acquire Swedish payments company iZettle for $2.2 billion, in its largest ever acquisition. [nL3N1SO5IE.]
This week it announced an agreement to acquire Hyperwallet Systems Inc, a company that helps online individual and small business sellers accept payments, while earlier this month it revealed plans to buy prediction platform Jetlore.
The Simility deal comes as the threat of fraud for e-commerce companies continues to grow, as more business moves online and fraudsters refine their techniques. 
The rate of e-commerce fraud in the United States grew more than 30 percent in 2017 from a year earlier, according to a study by credit bureau Experian Plc (L:EXPN). 
Simility's services will benefit from the ability to draw upon PayPal's extensive data set on fraud, he added. 

""We have one of the largest data sets about how online fraud happens,"" Ready said.

65,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 04:27PM ET</span>",The Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Services, Manufacturing Data
An update on both the U.S. manufacturing and services sector rounds off the week of top-tier economic data.
The  Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 9:45AM ET is forecast to show a preliminary reading of 56.3 for June, while the Services PMI is expected to show a reading of 56.4.
Economic data so far this week has largely taken a backseat amid escalating trade war concerns as both the U.S. and China were embroiled in a tit-for-tat tariff spat.
The U.S. tariff on $50 billion in Chinese imports is slated for July 6, but risk assets have shown just a modicum of concern, and remain optimistic, according to BNY Mellon.
""Whether or not the impending deadline of July 6 increases the odds of an economically destabilizing escalation remains to be seen, although we sense that the markets remain cautiously optimistic to those prospects,"" BNY Mellon said in an email to clients.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower for the eighth day in a row.
2. Selloff in Online Retailers Overdone?
Shares of online retailers including Amazon declined after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Quill ruling, paving the way for states and local governments to start collecting sales taxes from internet retailers that don't currently charge tax to their customers.
Yet, the impact on e-commerce companies including Amazon, will be limited, according to JPMorgan.
Amazon already collects sales taxes on direct sales and can easily do the same on third party sales, the bank said.
JPMorgan warned, however, that the tech sector has become overbought, so negative headlined risk is as good a reason as any to book profits.
Shares of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Overstockcom Inc (NASDAQ:OSTK) closed lower.
3. OPEC Decision, US Rig Count Data Eyed
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production but will likely be overshadowed by developments at the OPEC meeting.
Ahead of the OPEC announcement on a possible crude output hike, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and non-OPEC members were close to reaching a deal to lift oil production.
The oil-cartel's attempts to reach a consensus on a crude output hike has been plagued by other OPEC members including Iran who have appeared unwilling to compromise.
Crude prices fell on Thursday heading into settlement as traders appeared to take profits on gains ahead of the OPEC decision.

69,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",U.S. states set to gain billions in sales taxes after court ruling,"By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. states could reap billions in online sales tax revenue and buttress their budgets after the nation's top court ruled on Thursday that e-commerce companies could be forced to collect the money, even if they have no physical presence in a state. 
The Supreme Court's ruling in favor of South Dakota and against Wayfair Inc and two other online retailers was a victory for state governments, and a boost for brick-and-mortar stores. 
The effect is expected to be positive and widespread because 45 states impose sales taxes and until now were barred from requiring those companies to collect remote sales taxes. 
That meant state and local governments lost as much as $13 billion of revenue in 2017, according to a federal report. 
Now, states can push ahead with legislation requiring companies to collect and remit sales taxes for goods bought online elsewhere.
States that rely more heavily on sales tax - as opposed to personal income tax, for instance - ""are the big winners here and could see real budget gains if they follow South Dakota's example,"" said Fitch Ratings analyst Stephen Walsh. 
As many as 24 states and their local governments could see tax revenue gains of at least 1 percent, according to Fitch's research.
For a large state like Texas, the combined state and local revenue growth could be as high as $1.2 billion per year and will likely grow over time, Walsh said.
Washington, Florida, South Dakota, Nevada and Tennessee get more than half of their total revenues from sales taxes, meaning big gains could be in store.
An analysis by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) found that Louisiana would get an estimated 3 percent bump in total tax receipts if it begins forcing out-of-state online retailers to collect sales taxes. Oklahoma could also see a sizeable 2.7 percent gain, Barclays found.
But the party does not extend to places that do not charge sales taxes: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon.
""New Hampshire's lack of a sales tax is a competitive advantage for our state, and this decision will unfairly punish small businesses that are the backbone of our economy,"" U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan said in a statement. 
STATE MOVES NOT CERTAIN
The decision ""will remake the landscape for state tax collection in the U.S.,"" said Harley Duncan of the auditing firm KPMG. 
However, the path is not clear. The court left room for future legal challenges, so state legislation could still face delays and backlash from the e-commerce industry.
The ruling ""definitely goes out of its way to suggest there may have to be future litigation to decide ultimately where things will shake out,"" said lawyer Paul Clement, who filed a brief backing Wayfair.
""You will certainly see, absent congressional action, significant litigation as states try to push the envelope on this,"" said Mike Dabbs, eBay's senior director of government relations.
Even so, most states may look to pass bills similar to Washington state's, said Max Behlke of the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Its law was effective even before the court ruling, Behlke said, by expanding sales tax collections to third-party marketplaces - a category that in most places has so far gone untaxed.
That led Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to start collecting taxes on its entire platform, including third-party merchants, in Washington starting in January.
Amazon then added Pennsylvania to that list after a similar law there went into effect April 1.
Even before that change, Pennsylvania got $202 million of online sales tax revenue in 2017 - 2-1/2 times as much as it did in 2014, when it received just $81.2 million, according to information the Pennsylvania Treasury provided to Reuters. 
Minnesota and Rhode Island passed similar ""marketplace laws"" last year.
Ahead of the court ruling, Illinois enacted a budget that counts on $150 million in new tax revenue - to come from out-of-state internet retailers - for fiscal 2019, which begins July 1. 
A new Connecticut law goes into effect at the end of this year to collect taxes from some online retailers. Now the legislature should consider going back into session to broaden that law and ""eliminate the disadvantage retailers with physical locations in Connecticut have long struggled to overcome,"" said Senate Republican President Pro Tempore Len Fasano.
In total, 38 states have considered and 15 enacted, measures aimed at collecting remote sales taxes since 2016.

""There has been pushback against these new laws but the new ruling gives states more support for these positions,"" said Fitch's Walsh. ""I expect we will see both new legislation and additional legal challenges over the next few years.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eight passengers have sued Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) over a catastrophic engine blowout in April that killed a passenger and injured several others. 
The plaintiffs, eight passengers from Flight 1380 on April 17 and one passenger's husband, filed suit on Tuesday in the Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York.
Passengers Cindy Candy Arenas, Jaky Alyssa Arena, Jiny Alexa Arenas, Elhadji Cisse, Donald Kirkland, Beverly Kirkland, Connor Brown, and Cassandra Adams, and Cindy Arenas' husband, Joe Leos Arenas, allege that Southwest acted negligently in its responsibilities to maintain and repair its aircraft and aircraft components. 
""A passenger was sucked into the open window, and the other passengers, including Plaintiffs, were confronted with their greatest fear, the overwhelming horror of being trapped in a plane about to crash,"" the suit alleges. 
Another passenger, Lilia Chavez, filed suit against the airline in April.
The incident occurred when a CFM56-7B engine on one of Southwest's Boeing 737-700 jets blew apart in midair, shattering a plane window, flinging shrapnel and killing passenger Jennifer Riordan, one of 149 people aboard. The flight was headed from New York to Dallas.
The episode was the first fatality on a U.S. commercial passenger airline since 2009.
Also named in the lawsuit are  Boeing Co  (N:BA), France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) S.A.,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Aviation and CFM International, the manufacturers behind the engine that broke apart. CFM is a transatlantic joint-venture co-owned by GE and Safran.
Southwest has faced extreme scrutiny in the months since the accident, and federal regulators are probing the events that led to the engine explosion. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of similar engines.
Southwest and Boeing declined to comment. GE could not immediately be reached for comment.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - T-Systems, the lossmaking IT services arm of Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), plans to cut 10,000 jobs in a three-year drive to return to profitability, CEO Adel Al-Saleh told staff on Thursday.

The proposed job cuts, first reported by the Handelsblatt daily, drew a furious response from the Verdi labor union that represents service industry workers in Germany.
""Instead of setting out on a new, future-proof course, we are instead getting a savings program without ideas, a mass-clearing of office locations, and destruction of jobs,"" Verdi's federal IT services chief Michael Jaekel said in a statement.
T-Systems is still locked in pay talks with staff demanding a 5.5 percent pay rise for 11,000 staff covered by their collective bargaining deal.
TWO-YEAR TURNAROUND
Al-Saleh has given himself up to two years to turn around the 7 billion euro ($8.1 billion) company, whose top line is shrinking and margins are under pressure, and which is leaking cash.
The New Yorker has held town halls and narrated video blogs in an attempt to pump up staff demoralized by the decline of T-Systems' IT outsourcing operation that caused a billion euro-plus writedown at Deutsche Telekom last year.
He told staff he was seeking savings of 600 million euros, according to talking points for the meeting seen by Reuters. ""We will invest the cash that is saved in making T-Systems profitable again,"" Al-Saleh said, according to Handelsblatt.
The company wants to cut 2,000 jobs a year in Germany, in the first year in overhead and management positions; in the second in offshoring; and finally in delivery positions as it ramps up automation.
The number of management layers will be cut from eight to between three and five in different business areas. T-Systems will cut its presence across Germany to 20 locations from more than 200 now.
A company spokesman declined to say whether compulsory redundancies would be necessary as part of the cost-cutting drive. He did say, however, that net job losses could be fewer than the 10,000 announced as staff are reassigned to new roles.
""As a result of successful execution, we will make T-Systems an economically stronger company by 2021 that offers over 30,000 jobs globally,"" Al-Saleh said in his talking points.
Deutsche Telekom's shares closed down 0.6 percent. They touched multi-year lows in the first quarter before being buoyed by news that its U.S. unit T-Mobile (O:TMUS) had agreed to buy Sprint Corp (N:S) in a $26 billion deal.

81,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 12:42PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Canada could make it harder for U.S. to win fighter bid - sources,"By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is discussing changes to a multibillion-dollar fighter jet procurement process that could make it harder for a U.S. company to win the order as trade relations between the neighbors sour, two sources with direct knowledge of the discussions said.
Canada is considering whether to penalize companies from countries that have caused it economic damage, the sources said on Wednesday. While a final decision is not expected before next year and the threat could be posturing, the move shows how the Trump administration's trade disputes are spilling over into other areas.
A spokeswoman for federal Procurement Minister Carla Qualtrough - who has overall responsibility for major purchases of military equipment - declined to comment. Sources declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential.
Boeing Co's (N:BA) F-18 Super Hornet and  Lockheed Martin  Corp's (N:LMT) F-35 fighter were among the favorites to capture the contract to supply 88 planes, worth between C$15 billion ($11.3 billion) and C$19 billion.
Defense sources have long said the Canadian air force would prefer an American-built jet, citing the importance of operating easily with U.S. armed forces.
But a change in procurement terms would give more of a chance to European suppliers: Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which makes the Eurofighter; Saab AB (ST:SAABb), which makes the Gripen; and Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), which makes the Rafale.
Defense sources, however, say the European jets are likely to become obsolete by around 2040, at which point they could no longer incorporate the latest technologies.
Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for almost a decade to buy replacements for its aging F-18 fighters, some of which are 40 years old. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35 jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews.
Ottawa has already said bids will be evaluated in part by examining whether firms competing for the order have caused any past economic damage to Canada. Officials said at the time this was aimed at Boeing, which last year launched a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb).
Government officials are now discussing whether Canada should also consider economic damage caused by governments, a clear reference to worsening relations with Washington, said the sources.
""Politically it's hard to spend billions of dollars on contracts with a country that's hurting you,"" said one of the sources, who asked to remain anonymous given the extreme sensitivity of the situation.
However, the sources emphasized that the discussions are at an early stage and Ottawa could eventually decide to drop the proposed language.
Canada - which is due to release the exact specifications for the jets next year - has not yet finished work on the clause referring to economic damage caused by a single firm. 
U.S. President Donald Trump last month slapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, prompting Canada to announce its own retaliatory measures. Trump has also threatened tariffs on Canadian autos, which could badly hurt the economy.
Ottawa froze talks with Boeing about the fighter jet contest but after the company's trade challenge against Bombardier failed, Canadian officials made clear the firm would not be discriminated against if it chose to bid.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 12:05PM ET</span>","First new all-electric mine dumps diesel; cuts costs, pollution","By Susan Taylor and Barbara Lewis
CHAPLEAU, Ontario/LONDON (Reuters) - Hundreds of feet below thick boreal forest blanketing the Canadian Shield, a squad of near-silent, battery-powered machines are tunneling toward gold in a multimillion-dollar mining experiment to ditch diesel.
 Goldcorp  Inc (TO:G) (N:GG) is building the world's first new all-electric mine, a high-stakes gambit to replace noisy, fume-belching equipment being closely watched by a diesel-dependent industry.
A rough-hewn tunnel, some 800 feet underground, seems an incongruous setting for revolutionary technology, but front-line workers call it a game changer.
""It would be a challenge to go back,"" said jumbo drill operator Adam Ladouceur, noting the air quality and lack of noise at the Borden project, northwest of Toronto, is ""amazing"" compared to the 23 mines where he previously worked.
Stung by a multi-year slump in commodity prices that began recovering in 2016, miners remain desperate to keep operating costs down. Going electric could slash energy expenses, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Borden will save about $9 million annually on diesel, propane and electricity. Productivity gains are also possible, from equipment that can keep working while gas from dynamite blasting clears, for example.
Electric equipment should help keep mine workers healthier. Studies show an elevated cancer risk for underground miners exposed to diesel exhaust, classified as carcinogenic by the World Health Organization. 
Health issues are ""a big problem"" and particularly acute in long-running underground mines with older equipment, said IndustriALL Global Union director Brian Kohler. 
Beyond Borden's battery-powered scoops and vehicles, underground workers will wear tags linked to a ventilation-on-demand system, moving air only where needed.
Going electric carries a 25-30 percent premium on equipment, but could halve the cost of energy-hungry ventilation, which ""is like trying to have air conditioning in an enormous old house with leaks,"" said Goldcorp vice-president John Mullally.
When commercial production on the 100,000-ounce-per-year mine starts in the second half of 2019, further savings could come from lower maintenance costs, said project manager Luc Joncas, noting diesel machines typically have 1,000 more parts than electric.
""STONE-AGE TECHNOLOGIES NOT SEXY""
Borden is set up so that it could someday be remotely controlled, joining a handful of automated mines around the world. 
Automation is taking off in mining, but electrification is lagging, said Patrick Murphy, a president at  Sandvik  AB (ST:SAND), supplying electric mining equipment to Borden. That is because old mines can be retrofit to add automated elements, like robots, quite efficiently, while full payback from all-electric operations requires customization of new-builds. 
Still, it has not been easy planning around Borden's challenges, including a long, steep road that will extend 4 kilometers (2.5 mile) into the mine.
To help power its 40-ton electric trucks, which cannot run a full shift hauling ore out of the mine without recharging, Sandvik is developing a fast-charge system, expected in 2020.
Goldcorp still needs to truck material to its processing plant, two hours away, and is studying alternatives to diesel vehicles.
Today, a trickle of fully electric mines are planned. 
Diesel still makes economic sense at big open pit operations, where there is no ventilation savings and vehicles need big batteries that eat into haulage space.
As the world's near-surface mines are depleted, production is moving deeper underground, where high temperatures and ventilation costs make diesel impractical.
Early this year, global miners  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and Vale (SA:VALE3) approved projects more than 5,000 feet below ground in Sudbury's nickel belt. Nouveau Monde Graphite (V:NOU) aims to build the first all-electric surface mine in Quebec.
Mining companies may find that going electric appeals to the millennials needed to replace an aging workforce, said Michel Serres, a vice president at mine supplier ABB Ltd (S:ABBN).

""Mining needs a revolution to avoid retention or employment issues,"" said Serres. ""Working with stone-age technologies is not sexy for technicians or engineers coming out of school.""

Reuters revealed this week that Airbus is considering adding endurance to the longest-range flying version of its single aisle A321 jet in a potential new variant dubbed A321XLR. 
The A321XLR would carry extra fuel and extend the range of the A321LR aircraft, which recently claimed a long-distance record for single-aisle jets in testing.
Asked at the Paris Air Forum if an A321XLR was of interest, CEO Bjorn Kjos replied: ""Definitely, yes. An A321 with a long range is an extremely interesting plane."" 
U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) is studying plans for what industry sources describe as a hybrid jet combining a wide cabin and a restricted cargo space, shaped to fly efficiently in a space between the industry's single-aisle jets and wide-body long-haul aircraft.

Kjos said it was ""a very interesting concept"".

103,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 11:15AM ET</span>",Activist investor Land & Buildings resumes criticism of Hudson's Bay,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Activist investor Land & Buildings on Thursday resumed its criticism of department store owner Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC), urging it to correct its underperformance and extract value from its substantial real estate holdings. 
The hedge fund, which has been agitating for change at HBC, agreed in December to cease public statements about the company until its annual shareholder meeting on June 12. That was in exchange for concessions from the company in a deal with Rhone Capital that the fund said gave the private equity firm preferential treatment.
Now, Land & Buildings founder Jonathan Litt is again pushing HBC to boost its share price, which is significantly below the value of its assets following a run of earnings disappointments, and to monetize its prime property assets. 
The fund held a stake of nearly 5 percent in the company last July and has not provided an updated figure for its holding.
Hudson's Bay declined to comment.
""It has become clear that the familiar refrain blaming the challenges of the macro retail environment no longer rings true,"" Litt said in a letter to shareholders, comparing the company's share performance with its peers'.
Hudson's Bay shares are up 4.4 percent this year, compared with a 40 percent gain in the S&P 500 department store index <..SPLRCRET>, used as a benchmark because of the store's big presence in the United States. On Thursday, shares were little changed at C$11.78 at 10:52 a.m. in Toronto trading.
Hudson's Bay's real estate is worth C$31 a share, Litt said. 
The company has taken some steps to turn its performance around. In December, it sold its flagship Lord & Taylor building in Manhattan and received a $500 million investment from Rhone as part of that deal. It said this month that it would close that store and up to nine others and had agreed to sell its unprofitable online banner Gilt.
HBC also has signed a conditional agreement to sell its eponymous flagship store property in Vancouver, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters in May.
Chief Executive Officer Helena Foulkes, who took over in February, also has said all options are on the table in its quest to improve profitability.
Litt also flagged concerns over Executive Chairman Richard Baker's $54.8 million pay package, which was approved by shareholders but opposed by investors including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

Asia had been mixed, too, with Japan's Nikkei (N225) adding 0.6 percent and Australia's main index (AXJO) enjoying another strong day before the end of its financial year next week.
China however finished more than 1 percent lower and at 2 year closing lows due to the trade strains (CSI300) (SZSC) (SSEC) (SS). MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares (MIAPJ0000PUS) ended down too have been 0.5 percent higher at one point.
Gyrations were compounded by the dollar's surge to an 11-month high [FRX/]. That raises inflation outside the U.S. and puts pressure on any country or company that has gorged itself on dollar-denominated debt. 
The mere absence of new trade threats from U.S President Donald Trump on tariffs was nevertheless enough to keep hopes alive that all the bluster was a ploy which would stop short of an outright trade war. 
Markets had also been encouraged by the People's Bank of China's move to set firm fixings for its yuan, along with the addition of extra liquidity, though the spot yuan rate  did hit a fresh five-month low.
There was also much speculation the central bank would cut bank reserve requirements, thus boosting lending power in the economy.
Wall Street was clearly still harboring worries about trade as it opened. The 30-member Dow Jones which includes  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and Boeing (N:BA) both with big Chinese revenues, will rack up an eighth straight session of losses if it ends in the red.
And even though there was nothing directly from Trump, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross did give a CNBC interview. 
""What we have to do is create an environment where it's more painful for these parties that have these huge trade barriers,"" Ross said.
POUND REBOUND
The dollar's swings made for a busy day for currency markets. It hopped between 110.76 and 110.20 yen , hit an 11-month high against a basket of top currencies before losing steam and briefly sent the euro (EUR=) below $1.15 again.
Sterling  had hit a seven-month low only to jump back up to $1.32 after the Bank of England's chief economist unexpectedly joined a minority of the Bank's policymakers calling for an interest rate hike at its latest meeting. 
It wasn't enough to stop the BoE keeping everything on hold but it did revive talk of an August rate rise.
While the European Central Bank has signaled an end to bond-buying, it has pledged to keep euro zone rates low past next summer, and the Bank of Japan shows no sign of unwinding its stimulus.
Switzerland's central bank kept its rates deep in negative territory on Thursday and warned that risks to the economy were rising amid all the trade war noise.
""It feels like the yellow warning lights are flashing for the global economic system,"" noted analysts at Citi. 
""However, with the ECB and BoJ still pumping in liquidity and keeping rates lower for longer, the chances of a systemic event are low.""
That low-risk market mood nudged gold to a six-month low. 
Oil was also on the slide ahead of Friday's meeting of producers in Vienna, where Saudi Arabia is trying to convince fellow OPEC members of the need to pump more oil, according to sources familiar with the talks. 
""We need to release supply to the market,"" Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters. Iran on Thursday also signaled it could be won over to a small rise in output, potentially paving the way for a deal.
Benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) fell $1.56 a barrel to a low of $73.18 before recovering slightly to $73.34, down $1.40, by 0850 GMT. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was $1.00 lower at $64.71.

""It would seem that an aggregate increase in production for OPEC+ of between 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) and 1 million bpd is the range that is being considered,"" said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of oil strategy at French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).

SocGen said on Thursday it had ended the contracts in line with earlier declarations it made in 2016 and 2017. Newspaper Le Monde earlier reported the bank had wound down some 60 offshore vehicles linked to the Panamanian firm.
""Societe Generale Private Banking works exclusively with jurisdictions operating to the highest standards in terms of fiscal transparency,"" SocGen said in a statement.
The so-called Panama Papers, which consist of millions of documents stolen from Mossack Fonseca and leaked to the media in April 2016, provoked global outrage after they showed how the rich and powerful used offshore corporations to evade taxes.
In March, Mossack Fonseca announced it would be shutting down due to the economic and reputational damage inflicted by the scandal.

112,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 09:52AM ET</span>",Bank investors await U.S. stress test results for capital returns,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investors expect banks and other financial institutions to announce large returns of capital to shareholders after the Federal Reserve publishes the first set of results from its annual “stress test” late Thursday.
Even so, gains in financial shares may be muted. Many of the 38 financial companies undergoing the test are expected to boost dividends and share buybacks as a result of higher profits on the back of tax cuts and rising net interest income. 
Banks will be able to unveil capital return plans for the coming year next week after the Fed issues its second set of results that determine how much of a capital buffer the banks need. 
The Fed examines the health of the balance sheets of the biggest financial companies every year to ensure that they have enough capital to withstand a shock to the system like the ones that brought down a number of banks during the 2007-09 financial crisis. 
""General headlines will be constructive with the vast majority of banks increasing their dividends and buying back more stock,"" said Jason Goldberg, a bank analyst at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Goldberg estimates that the 22 banks he covers should be able to announce returns of 103 percent of earnings compared with an estimated 86 percent for the year that ends in June.
Celebrations may be somewhat overshadowed, however, by loan growth data and a flattening yield curve, according to Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist at  Wells Fargo  Investment Institute in St. Louis. 
""(Stress test results) could be a catalyst for a day or two but it'll still come back to the main driver, which is going to be the yield curve and loan growth, which has been OK but nothing to write home about,"" said Samana.
Bank profits are boosted by a steepening yield curve, when the gap widens between short-dated Treasury yields and long-dated Treasury yields. Banks profit from the difference between short-term rates, which determine their borrowing costs, and long-term rates, which affect how much they can charge for loans such as mortgages. 
The spread between U.S. Treasuries 2-year and 10-year yields  has not been this narrow since 2005.
On June 29 last year, after banks released their capital plans following the stress test, the S&P 500 bank index <.SPXBK> ended the day 1.8 percent higher.
Last year's approval marked the first time since the financial crisis the industry was given the go ahead to pay out as much as it reports in annual profits. 
The largest U.S. banks have notably underperformed their smaller, regional rivals so far in 2018. (Graphic: https://reut.rs/2K4QtUj)
The S&P 500 bank index was last showing a year-to-date decline of 2.4 percent after gaining 20 percent in 2017. In comparison the KBW Regional Bank index (KRX) is up 8.4 percent for the year after falling 0.3 percent last year. 
For this year's returns, Keefe Bruyette & Woods analysts in research reports cut their payout assumptions for the median bank to 102 percent of earnings compared with a previous expectation for 120 percent as the stress test was tougher than they had originally expected. 
KBW analysts said they were optimistic about payouts from banks including  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), Wells Fargo & Co (N:WFC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), Huntington Bancshares Inc (O:HBAN),  Comerica Inc  (N:CMA),  Citizens Financial Group Inc  (N:CFG),  Zions Bancorp  (O:ZION) and asset manager  Northern Trust  Corp (O:NTRS). 
The firm has cautious views on capital payouts by companies including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), Fifth Third Bancorp (O:FITB), KeyCorp (N:KEY), Regions Financial Corp (N:RF), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT), SunTrust Banks Inc (N:STI), Ally Financial Inc (N:ALLY),  American Express  Co (N:AXP),  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF), Discover Financial Services (N:DFS) and M&T Bank Corp (N:MTB).
The U.S. operations of  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) (N:DB) could face a challenging stress test. Standard & Poor's recently downgraded the company's credit rating after reports the Fed designated one of its U.S. businesses as ""troubled"" last year.
It could be difficult for a bank with a subsidiary on the ""troubled"" list to pass the scenarios, a person familiar with the tests who was not authorized to speak publicly told Reuters.
Bernstein analyst John McDonald in a report said he expects capital return dollars to grow but added he does not think everybody will increase payout dollars as ""firms are up against a harsher test and many have lower starting capital positions.""
Payout levels and market reactions will vary from bank to bank, according to Mike Mattioli, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. 

""I don't think it'll be a major catalyst. The thing people will be looking for is if anybody failed,"" said Mattioli. ""There'll be some surprises on the upside or the downside, but it shouldn't move stocks in double-digit percentage changes.""

113,By Business Insider,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Global markets are flashing a new ominous signal that investors are bracing for the worst,"As the prospect of a trade war threatens to divide the world, a unified front is forming in global markets. It's just not the type any risk-seeking investor wants to see.
A Morgan Stanley gauge that monitors the correlation between asset classes and geographic regions has spiked to its highest level since 2016. This implies that financial assets around the world are trading more in lockstep than at any other point in recent memory.
Perhaps more important for those seeking market signals, it also means investors are shifting into risk-off mode — one that could be setting in for the long term. And it's a definite warning signal for the risk-hungry traders still scouring the landscape for yield.
Tim Emmott, the executive director at Olivetree Financial, takes it a step further by suggesting that cautious investors are bracing for the possibility of a market meltdown.
""The fact that this index is trending higher currently could well be the true signal for market players to realize that current multi-asset moves toward risk aversion may be more than short-term,"" he wrote in a note reviewed by Bloomberg. ""The move in correlation here may be the canary in the coalmine for the medium-term trajectory of real systemic risk to markets.""
To fully appreciate what's at stake as global cross-asset correlations surge, consider that tandem moves in stocks and bonds can throw portfolios out of whack by exacerbating volatility. This is particularly true for the models used by risk-parity and balanced mutual funds, which are designed to de-lever when price swings spike, according to Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
As if that's not worrisome enough, Binky Chadha, the chief global strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), recently pointed out that lockstep moves in major asset classes could portend contagion-driven weakness.
""The tight correlation in the moves across the major asset classes (oil up, dollar down, equities and bond yields up) suggests a pullback in one for idiosyncratic reasons would likely spill over to the others,"" he wrote in a client note earlier this year.
To Keith Parker, the chief US equity strategist at UBS, rising cross-asset correlations can be a sign that an economic expansion has entered its final stage. He told Business Insider back in March that he was closely watching the relationship between US stocks and bonds for recessionary signals.
In the end, if today's expansion is trudging through its final innings, it would seem to be a prudent decision for investors to start leaning toward risk-off positions.
But is it really time to pack it in and flee to safety? Any investor you ask is likely to suggest a different timeline for derisking. Some might urge you to seek shelter immediately, while others would be incredulous at the prospect of missing another leg of strength.
Regardless of where on the spectrum you fall, you'd be best advised to keep an eye on all these disparate elements. The signal you're looking for is probably there somewhere — and half the battle is knowing where to look."

For the first quarter, Kroger said it earned an adjusted $0.73 per share where analysts had expected $0.63, according to Bloomberg. Revenue of $37.53 billion topped the $37.33 billion consensus.
The company's ""Restock Kroger"" program, a plan it announced in late 2017 to invest in technology and store-brands, appears to be paying off. Digital sales climbed 66% compared to the previous quarter, the company said, as Kroger and other traditional chains face increasing competition from the likes of Amazon. The company also  purchased meal-kit company Home Chef for $200 million in late May, three days before the end of the quarter. 
""Everything we do supports our customers engaging seamlessly with Kroger,"" said Rodney McMullen, chief executive of the company, in a press release. ""Kroger is creating the future of retail by innovating our core business and adding exciting partnerships like Ocado (LON:OCDO) and our planned merger with Home Chef. We are on track to generate the free cash flow and incremental FIFO operating profit that we committed to in Restock Kroger. We are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans for the year and our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift.""
The company also raised its earnings-per-share forecast to between $2 and $2.15 for 2018, where it had previously been expecting $1.95 to $2.15.
""Since  the  beginning  of  2017,  there  has  been  plenty  of  change  in  food  retail,"" Michael Lasser, an analyst at UBS, said ahead of the earnings call.
""On the value side of the equation, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has aggressively invested in price while the hard  discounters  continue  to  add  to  their  footprints.  At  the  other  end  of  the spectrum,  Amazon  became  a  much  larger  player  in  the  space  after  purchasing Whole  Foods.  In  this  new  environment, Kroger has recognized  the  need to differentiate, and has taken prudent steps to position itself for long term success.""

Kroger has been closing underperforming stores and shifting away from areas where it does not have a strong presence. It has also been expanding home delivery, curbside pickup and self-checkout services under its turnaround program ""Restock Kroger"" to compete with Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).

119,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Investor Odey says Sky could be worth as much as 50 billion pounds,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Top-20 Sky (L:SKYB) investor Crispin Odey said he expects the bidding war for the media company to carry on over the summer and that the European broadcaster could be worth as much as 50 billion pounds ($65.5 billion).
The pay-TV operator is the subject of rival bids from U.S. peer Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) and Rupert Murdoch-majority owned Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA), which currently owns a 39 percent stake in Sky but wants to buy it outright.
Fox's long standing 10.75 pounds per share offer was trumped by a 12.50 pound per share bid from Comcast in April, valuing Sky at $31 billion.
Meanwhile, Comcast and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) are going head-to-head in the United States to buy most of Fox's TV and movie assets, looking to fight the threat of programming-rich rivals Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Disney upped its bid for Fox's assets on Wednesday, outstripping Comcast's offer.
The move has raised speculation Fox will in turn raise its bid for Sky, to top Comcast's bid.
Odey, the founder of hedge fund Odey Asset Management, told Reuters the Disney bid pushed Sky's valuation to around 13.50 pounds a share, but his assessment of Sky's free cashflow suggested that the rival bidders could send that figure much higher.
Sky shares jumped more than 3 percent on Wednesday's news and on Thursday rose a further 1 percent to 13.94 pounds by 1135 GMT.
""We've done the numbers and the point is debt is so easy to serve and so cheap, that they could easily be paying 18 pounds for Sky,"" he said, adding that was at the lower end of expectations.
The key for a company valuation of around 50 billion pounds hinged on the potential for free cashflow to jump from 1.6 billion pounds to around 2.5 billion pounds over the next year as sunk programming costs feed through to improved sales, Odey said.
""My point is if your free cashflow looks like it's going to come through at 2.5 billion, which it should do within a year, what are you willing to pay for that? Well, you're willing to pay 50 billion pounds,"" Odey said, or around 26 pounds a share.
The other factor to consider, Odey said, was how each of the rival bidders valued their existing customers, with Sky's valuation of its customers just a third of theirs.
Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker however, said the room for further upside may be limited.
""We do not think it will be bid more than 10 percent above Comcast's bid, implying 1375p, which is where the shares are now,"" he said.

CANNES, France (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell, the founder of WPP (L:WPP), used his first major public appearance since quitting as chief executive in April to hit out at the advertising giant over the treatment he received from the board.
The 73-year-old left the world's biggest advertising company over an allegation of personal misconduct which he has denied. However neither Sorrell nor the company have given any details about the nature of the complaint.
Speaking at a packed event in Cannes organized by The Drum advertising publisher, Sorrell said he had asked the company to conduct an investigation over how news about the allegation had leaked to the Wall Street Journal. 
""The most damaging thing that happened during the course of those events... was the leak over the Easter weekend at the very top of the company, and which to my knowledge there has been no investigation whatsoever,"" he said.
Sorrell noted that the company has since said that all employees are treated equally.
""I would disagree violently with that premise, not all employees have been treated equally. 
""There has been no investigation to my knowledge of how, why and what the leak consisted of and I think that is a fundamental flaw,"" he said, adding that he had requested one. 
The departure of Sorrell, the world’s most famous advertising executive, has prompted speculation as to why he left, including reports in the Financial Times that he could be aggressive toward staff. 
He called the speculation ""scurrilous and salacious"".
AFTER SORRELL
""Am I the easiest person in the world to get along with, you know very well that sometimes I can be difficult, but I would always say difficult with justification,"" he said, looking relatively relaxed, in a t-shirt and jacket. 
""If it is a fault to demand or expect superior performance or for things to go well, mea culpa.""
In his absence, the company has appointed Mark Read and Andrew Scott to run the company. As a 2 percent shareholder, Sorrell said he thought the two should be permanent CEOs. 
""I’m not saying two individuals because nobody could replace me individually, but those two individuals have complementary skills,"" he said, to laughter. ""One on their own would not be sufficient in my view but two together can be a very powerful and potent combination.""
WPP has since had to defend its handling of the departure after it emerged that Sorrell had left with share awards worth potentially 20 million pounds and without a non-compete clause. 
He has since set up a new venture, S4 Capital with a pool of 150 million pounds from outside investors to make acquisitions. 
His move to acquire a listed shell company repeats his formula from the 1980s when he used a then little-known shell company called Wire and Plastics Products to buy some of the biggest ad agencies in the world, such as JWT, Ogilvy and others. 
Sorrell said he expected to work for the next seven years and then assess whether he wants to go on with a new cycle. 
The appearance of one of Britain's most famous businessmen had been hotly awaited, with the small Irish pub on the waterfront packed to the rafters with ad executives and journalists. 

Sorrell described his new venture as a peanut. He noted that some people have allergies to peanuts.

James Bond's car brand of choice is undergoing a turnaround plan designed to boost its model line-up, quadruple volumes and produce its first sport utility vehicle at a new plant in Wales.
The firm, which sponsors the Red Bull Formula One team, said its Silverstone site would open in October and employ 60 people.
Many Formula One teams have been based close to Silverstone in central England, leading the area to become known as motor sport valley. Silverstone hosted the first Formula One championship race in 1950.
""The company is now investing for growth across the Aston Martin and Lagonda brands,"" said Chief Executive Andy Palmer in a statement, also announcing the opening of a central London office.
Aston said the new locations would help increase the firm's total workforce by over half to 5,000 by the end of 2022.

After six years of losses, Aston Martin swung to a pretax profit in 2017 and the company has said it is considering a stock market flotation which sources have told Reuters could come as soon as this year.

132,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 07:21AM ET</span>",Twenty U.S. states target protections for pre-existing health conditions,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - (The writer is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)
Most Americans do not want to go back to the bad old days when health insurance companies could charge sick people more for coverage or turn them away altogether. But a lawsuit by 20 U.S. states seeking to invalidate protections against those practices contained in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) could allow just that - and older people will be hit hardest.
The lawsuit, Texas v. Azar, was brought in February by Texas and 19 other Republican-led states. It builds on the recent repeal, as part of last year's tax reform law, of the ACA's individual mandate which had required that people carry insurance. The plaintiffs argue that since the mandate was an essential part of the ACA, the entire law should be invalidated.
""With no remaining legitimate basis for the law, it is time that Americans are finally free from the stranglehold of Obamacare, once and for all,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said when the lawsuit was filed.
More recently, the U.S. Department of Justice delivered a gut punch to supporters of the ACA last week, stating in a court filing that the Trump administration would not defend the law in the Texas litigation. 
That marked a remarkable abandonment of the department’s traditional role of defending laws passed by Congress.
Public support for pre-existing condition protections is very strong. Polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation earlier this year found that 84 percent of Democrats support it, as do 68 percent of independents and 59 percent of Republicans. Amicus briefs supporting the protections have been filed by a wide array of healthcare stakeholders: groups representing doctors, hospitals, advocacy groups, public health scholars, health economists, the insurance industry, labor and small business.
Timothy S. Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law, thinks the lawsuit is on shaky legal ground, but adds that the case will be heard by a judge with a track record of opposing the ACA in other cases. 
A ruling is not expected until late summer, and appeals will take at least a year, according to Jost, who discussed the case during a webinar this week. Moreover, 23 states have some level of protection for people with pre-existing conditions.
But if Texas prevails, 52 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could lose coverage, face higher premiums or find themselves locked into their current coverage, Jost said. So would women and older people. “It’s a very dangerous lawsuit,” he said. 
RETURN TO A DYSFUNCTIONAL MARKET?
Ending protections for people with pre-existing conditions would hit older Americans disproportionately for a simple reason: they are not as healthy as younger people. A 2016 survey by the Commonwealth Fund found that 66 percent of people aged 55 to 60 say their health is fair or poor, or that they have a chronic condition, as did 67 percent of respondents aged 60 to 65. By contrast, just 35 percent of people aged 35 to 40 described their health in those terms.
Before the ACA, health insurance options for older people were very limited. Medicaid was available only for children, pregnant woman and very low-income parents. That meant that anyone without employer-based insurance had to go into the individual market.
In most states, insurance rules allowed insurers to charge premiums based on health, gender and age, and insurers could deny coverage due to pre-existing conditions, or exclude certain conditions from plans.
In 2010, 42 percent of adults aged 50 to 64 who tried to buy insurance in the individual markets were turned down, charged higher premiums or had a condition excluded, according to the Commonwealth Fund. “People had a really difficult time buying plans - the market was completely dysfunctional,” said Sara Collins, Commonwealth’s vice president of healthcare coverage and access.
Under the ACA, insurers can charge older people up to three times what they charge a younger customer. But older adults only pay a fixed share of their income toward premiums, with tax credits making up the difference. That has resulted in a huge jump in coverage. In 2016, 71 percent of adults aged 50 to 64 were able to buy a plan, up from 38 percent in 2010, according to Commonwealth. 
The repeal of the individual mandate already is hurting the Medicare program. The Medicare trustee report issued earlier this month showed that the hospital insurance trust fund will be depleted in 2026, three years earlier than previously forecast. One cause: hospitals are expected to have more uninsured patients, and Medicare pays for that uncompensated care.
Medicare costs likely would rise further if pre-existing condition protections are scrapped. Research published in 2009 in the Annals of Internal Medicine (https:// found that Medicare spending was significantly higher for people who were uninsured before enrolling in the program. The biggest difference was for hospital stays by patients with cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Not surprisingly, the researchers found that uninsured people delayed getting needed care until they became eligible for Medicare.
""People in that older age group were entering the program in poorer health,"" Collins said. “They needed to get caught up.”

The long-awaited strategy dubbed ""Vision 2020+"" foresees scaling back the number of industrial units to three from five and giving the new divisions higher margin targets, spurred by a goal to loosen central control to enable operations to thrive, the monthly magazine reported on its website, citing company sources.
Part of the plan is to merge the so-called Digital Factory unit with operations designed to automate process industries, and to combine overland high-voltage networks with the power plant business, the magazine said, adding the restructuring is to be implemented from Oct. 1.
Other steps involve breaking up energy management and to bring together power distribution networks with building technologies, according to Manager Magazin.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) on Thursday accused EU competition regulators of over-reaching their powers and acting as a supranational tax authority for the bloc when they ruled against its tax deal with Luxembourg three years ago.
The Italian carmaker was hit with a tax bill of up to 30 million euros ($35 million) in 2015 after the European Commission said Luxembourg's 2012 tax ruling cut the company's taxes considerably, giving it an unfair advantage.
The EU antitrust regulator said the taxable profits for Fiat's Luxembourg unit could have been 20 times higher under normal market conditions. Fiat and Luxembourg are challenging the ruling at the General Court, Europe's second-highest.
Fiat complied with all the rules and was transparent in its dealings with the Luxembourg tax authority and yet it was punished, its lawyer Juan Rodriguez told a panel of five judges.
""Fiat feels like it's been penalized by the Commission. Let there be no doubt, the Commission is trying to make new law in this case,"" Rodriguez said.
""The Commission acted as a supranational tax authority even as a supernatural tax authority,"" he said, adding the EU executive did not have the remit to do so. 
Luxembourg, which on Wednesday was ordered to recover 120 million euros in back taxes from French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE), marking the third case against the Grand Duchy, said the Commission was over-reaching its regulatory power.
""This strikes at the heart of member states' sovereignty,"" its lawyer Denis Waelbroeck told the court.
""We are here to put a stop to the arbitrary nature of this. We need to avoid the Commission merely imposing its ideas on the case that comes along without having the legal basis,"" he said.
Ireland, told to claw back a record 13 billion euros from iPhone maker Apple (O:AAPL), also took to the stand to criticize the EU regulator.
""The Commission has made the same erroneous arguments in the Apple case,"" its lawyer Paul Gallagher told the court. 
He said the EU executive was trying to use state aid laws to harmonize the patchwork of national tax regimes across the bloc and extend its competence in an impermissible way.
Commission lawyer Bruno Stromsky said it was clear that Fiat enjoyed an unfair tax advantage.
""There is a flagrant discrimination of equality in taxation, to the detriment of other companies that pay taxes in Luxembourg,"" he said. 
""The Commission has not meddled, has not intruded on the tax system in place determined by national sovereigns,"" Stromsky said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) said on Thursday it expected to transfer some jets from its SilkAir regional airline to budget carrier Scoot, allowing it to compete more effectively against low-cost rivals like AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA) and Lion Group.
The plan comes after the carrier announced last month it would absorb underperforming SilkAir into the parent brand after 2020 when a program to upgrade cabins at a cost of more than S$100 million ($73.5 million) gets under way.
Singapore Airlines has been undertaking a three-year transformation program designed to cut costs and boost revenue amid competition from Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals and low-cost carriers.
Scoot recently began listing job ads for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 jet pilots despite operating a narrowbody fleet of rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A320s.
Singapore Airlines said in a statement on Thursday that it expected to transfer some of SilkAir's 737s to Scoot to help optimize the overall group's network, but it declined to provide further details such as the number of planes involved.
As part of the transformation program, it has already transferred routes to five destinations in Southeast Asia from SilkAir to Scoot.
Brendan Sobie, chief analyst at the CAPA Centre for Aviation, an independent aviation research firm, said those destinations, which include Kuching and Langkawi in Malaysia, had a relatively low proportion of traffic transferring through the Singapore hub relative to other routes.
Part of the reason Singapore Airlines is absorbing SilkAir is to better align the brands for travelers from long-haul destinations like Europe and North America using Singapore as a connecting hub, the airline said last month.
Sobie said several Indonesian routes could be transferred from SilkAir to Scoot, as well as others like Chang Mai in Thailand and Da Nang in Vietnam.
SilkAir has 32 737s on order. Sobie said it would have been more attractive for Scoot to add A320s for growth to keep its short-haul fleet all one type, but that would not have solved the problem of the looming 737 deliveries.
""Ultimately it is clear that Scoot needs additional capacity to take over more SilkAir routes and the transfer of the 737s was the best solution for the Singapore Airlines Group,"" he said. 
""The route transfers should improve the group's profitability and long-term position, outweighing the additional costs associated with Scoot operating two narrowbody families.""
Sobie said he expected the first jets would be transferred in late 2018 or early 2019, giving the airline time to remove business class seats from SilkAir jets and to hire pilots.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T) will launch two new unlimited wireless plans next week that will be bundled with a new video streaming service called WatchTV, in the company's first move to pair entertainment with phone service after closing its $85 billion acquisition of media company  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX).
The No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier is putting to use Time Warner's stable of content, including TV channels like TBS and CNN, to drive sales of the wireless plans at a time when carriers have struggled to find growth. 
""This is the first step to transforming how content is created, distributed and consumed,"" David Christopher, president of AT&T mobility and entertainment, said in an interview.
WatchTV, which will have over 30 live channels but no sports or local news channels, will be free for customers of the new wireless plans. It will cost $15 per month as a standalone product. Customers who sign up for the higher-priced wireless plan can also get HBO for free, the premium TV channel with the hit show ""Game of Thrones"" that AT&T acquired as part of the Time Warner deal.
A federal judge earlier this month approved the merger of AT&T and Time Warner, handing AT&T a win after the U.S. Department of Justice sued to stop the deal, saying a merger would give AT&T unfair leverage over rival pay-TV providers.
AT&T, like other pay-TV providers, has been losing linear TV subscribers as viewers ""cut the cord"" on satellite TV packages in favor of cheaper streaming options. In the first quarter, AT&T shed 187,000 linear video subscribers. 
The company also lost 22,000 wireless customers who pay a monthly bill during the first quarter, and while it was an improvement from the 348,000 customers it lost the previous year, continued losses have pressured AT&T to find ways to grow the valuable wireless business.
WatchTV as a standalone product will compete with other low-cost video streaming options, including Dish Network's (O:DISH) Sling TV, which costs $20 for the base package, and Philo, which costs $16. 
WatchTV's channel lineup, which includes AMC, HGTV and TNT, could appeal to viewers who do not have a large cable package or are looking to further ""trim the cord,"" Christopher said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) cut its 2018 profit forecast and BMW (DE:BMWG) said it was looking at ""strategic options"" because of a trade war between China and the United States, sparking fears of a wave of earnings downgrades in the auto industry. 
Daimler said late on Wednesday that import tariffs on cars exported from the United States to China would hurt sales of its Mercedes-Benz cars, resulting in slightly lower earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) this year.
The luxury automaker, one of the biggest global companies to cut its guidance and blame trade tensions, previously saw 2018 EBIT rising slightly.
""We do not believe Daimler will be the only OEM (original equipment manufacturer) to reduce guidance. Other OEMs are also exposed to similar trends that Daimler cites in various degrees,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said. 
German rival BMW, which also exports sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) from the United States to China and Europe, reaffirmed its profit forecasts for this year, but said these depended on worldwide political conditions remaining largely unchanged.
""Within the context of the current discussion concerning additional tariffs on international trade, the company is evaluating various scenarios and possible strategic options,"" it said in a statement on Thursday, without elaborating.
Slower sales of SUVs from the Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama to China will result in a hit of around 250 million euros ($289 million), Evercore ISI analysts said. 
At 1000 GMT, Daimler shares were down 4.5 percent at 57.76 euros, the biggest fall by a European blue-chip stock, while shares in BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were down 2.6 and 3.1 percent, respectively.
Daimler's profit warning comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is proposing to impose tariffs on imported vehicles on the grounds that trade imbalances on many products threaten U.S. national security. 
He is separately threatening to impose tariffs on up to $200 billion of Chinese goods. China has warned it will retaliate with levies on U.S. products, potentially including the Mercedes-Benz SUVs shipped to China from Alabama.
Stocks in a wide range of companies have see-sawed in recent weeks as investors tried to assess the risk to corporate profits from the Trump administration's trade policy.
While the United States and China have not yet imposed new tariffs, Daimler said it expected them, and would not be able to recover the costs from customers.
""Fewer-than-expected SUV sales and higher-than-expected costs, not completely passed on to the customers, must be assumed because of increased import tariffs for U.S. vehicles into the Chinese market,"" it said in a regulatory filing.
Daimler's revised forecast came on the same day as reports that German automakers had backed a proposal that the European Union drop tariffs on vehicles to defuse trade tensions.
Beijing's proposed 25 percent tax on U.S. car factory exports will hit nearly 270,000 vehicles, with German carmakers accounting for $7 billion of the $11 billion total.
BMW, the largest vehicle exporter from the United States by value, has its largest factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina and faces a $965 million impact from tariffs, with Daimler exposed to a $765 million hit, Evercore ISI analysts have said.
Around 18 percent of all BMWs sold in China were exported from the United States last year, and the carmaker has warned a further escalation of the trade row ""would be harmful for all stakeholders"".
BMW this year stopped exporting the X3 from the United States to China amid escalating trade tensions, moving production to a plant in Rosslyn, South Africa and another in Shenyang, China.
LOWER EMISSIONS, PROFIT 
Daimler also said a new vehicle certification process based on stricter fuel efficiency test procedures would hit sales in the second half of the year, and warned earnings at Mercedes-Benz Vans unit would suffer because of a vehicle recall for diesel-engined models.
Several carmakers including Volkswagen have said they face challenges adapting their vehicle fleets to meet the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), which is based on real-driving data rather than theoretical scenarios.
Because the new regime gives higher carbon dioxide readings than the old system, it will force some carmakers to delay road certification and sales, or push vehicles into a higher tax bracket.
""The elephant in the room at the moment is the response of national governments – and manufacturers – to the new WLTP emissions and fuel economy testing procedure, which has the potential to cause significant tax increases in countries which have taxation regimes based on CO2 emissions,"" analysts at LMC said this month.
Daimler now sees EBIT at Mercedes-Benz Cars slightly below a year earlier, compared with previous guidance for a slight rise.
It sees earnings at the vans division dropping significantly after German regulator KBA last month ordered the recall of Mercedes-Benz Vito vans fitted with 1.6 liter diesel engines, saying they breached emissions rules.
Daimler, which has said it will appeal KBA's decision, previously expected earnings at the vans business to decline only slightly.
Overall, Daimler's EBIT will take a hit of about 763 million euros once costs of the recall, the impact of WLTP certification and lower sales in Latin America are factored in to results, Evercore ISI analysts said.
TRADING HIT
Shares in South Korean automakers fell in Asian trade, while Japanese peers also came under pressure.
Japanese and South Korean automakers for the most part do not ship vehicles made in the United States to China. Most of the vehicles sold in China are made locally through their Chinese joint ventures, along with imports from Asia. 
But analysts said the U.S. trade spat with China raised concerns about knock-on effects on other countries, like potential U.S. auto tariffs on all vehicle imports.
""South Koreans have higher portions of vehicle imports in the U.S. than peers, making them vulnerable to U.S. potential tariffs,"" Kwon Soon-woo, an analyst at SK Securities, said.
Kia Motors (KS:000270) shares fell 2.2 percent, while Hyundai Motors (KS:005380) dropped 1.9 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - Autos stocks slammed the brakes on a relief bounce in European shares on Thursday, sinking after German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) warned profit would be hit by higher tariffs.
The autos sector fell 2.3 percent to a nine-month low while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) eased down 0.2 percent as no new salvos were exchanged in an ongoing U.S.-China trade spat.
Equity markets have been relatively resilient in the face of mounting trade concerns but fell broadly this week as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Daimler became one of the biggest global companies to cut its guidance on trade tensions, warning profits would be hit in part by Chinese tariffs on car imports from the United States.
Daimler (DE:DAIGn) shares fell 4.4 percent to their lowest in nearly two years. 
Some analysts were skeptical of Daimler's timing, saying the profit warning may be more driven by internal pressures than the external trade environment. 
But UBS analysts said they expected consensus earnings estimate downgrades of 5 to 7 percent for the carmaker. 
BMW (DE:BMWG) fell 3 percent and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) fell 2.3 percent. Tyre maker Continental (DE:CONG) declined 1.6 percent. 
France's  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) fell 1.3 percent, while auto supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) declined 0.5 percent. Italy's Fiat Chrysler  lost 1.8 percent. 
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) underperformed peers down 0.5 percent due to the carmakers' losses. 
Financials stocks were the biggest weight on the STOXX after two leading eurosceptics from the far-right League were named to head Italian parliamentary finance committees.
Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) fell 1.3 percent, underperforming European peers as bank stocks (FTIT8300) tumbled, while Italian bond yields rose as the appointments reignited investors' fears around Italy's new populist government.
University professor Alberto Bagnai, who was named head of the Finance Committee in the Senate, published “Il tramonto dell’euro” (“The sunset of the euro”) in 2012.
Despite Daimler's comments, some investors saw trade war fears as a chance to buy stocks at slightly cheaper prices.
""We're actually looking at it as an opportunity to add some risk back into portfolios and use some of the cash that we built up,"" said Rory McPherson, investment director at Psigma Investment Management. 
""It's really been consumer discretionary and autos in particular that have been hit so far by concerns about trade wars but actually the underlying drivers of the market - tech, energy, healthcare, have been really strong,"" he added. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had a record high close on Wall Street on Wednesday.
Healthcare stocks were the top boost to European indices as  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) jumped 4.4 percent to the top of the STOXX after the pharma company announced PIONEER-4 and PIONEER-7 trial results for its experimental diabetes pill. 
""Both trials delivered in terms of glucose control as well as weight loss regardless of the statistical analysis,"" said UBS analysts. 
Consumer staples stocks such as  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS),  Unilever  (L:ULVR), ABInBev (BR:ABI) and Nestle (S:NESN) also provided support. The dollar earners have benefited from the recent strength in the dollar.

152,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>","Double whammy: U.S. pork, fruit producers brace for second wave of Chinese tariffs","By Dominique Patton and Tom Polansek
BEIJING/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. producers of pork, already saddled with duties enacted in an earlier round of the escalating trade dispute with China, are bracing for further pain after Beijing hit the products with additional tariffs due to come into effect next month.
China implemented a 25 percent duty on most U.S. pork items on April 2, and a 15 percent tariff on a range of fruits and nuts, in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum products.
Last week it included both categories in a second round of tariffs to be imposed on July 6. No other products have been listed twice.
Pork now faces cumulative import duties of 71 percent, not including value added tax, according to a formula published on the website of China's finance ministry last week. Cumulative duties on fruit amount to 50 percent. 
""The additional tariff will put us out of business,"" said Zhong Zheng, founder of China-based Heartland Brothers, which sells U.S.-produced Berkshire pork to Chinese supermarkets and restaurants.
The United States shipped $489 million worth of pork to China last year, and had the biggest share of import volumes in the first quarter of 2018, at about 117,000 tonnes, according to Chinese customs.
But shipments have since ground to a near halt following the 25 percent tariffs implemented in April, said U.S. meat analyst Brett Stuart, president of Global AgriTrends.
""They've pretty much stopped our pork,"" he said.
Total duties on U.S. pork will reach 88 percent from next month, after factoring in the 10 percent value added tax, according to one industry expert's calculation.
That comes as margins at some of the biggest U.S. pork processors reach their lowest level in three years, dragged down by surging hog prices and mounting worries over trade with China and Mexico.
With the new duties on U.S. pork, Chinese buyers will turn to other suppliers in Europe and Brazil, said Pan Chenjun, senior analyst at Rabobank.
UNCERTAINTY AND CONFUSION
Compounding the pain, most in the industry were still unsure about how to calculate the new tariffs, leaving them unprepared for the impact.
""We're trying to get confirmation of how the duties will be implemented and we have not been able to,"" said Joe Schuele, spokesman at the U.S. Meat Export Federation on Wednesday.
The industry association represents firms like  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN), JBS USA [JBS.UL] and WH Group Ltd's (HK:0288) Smithfield Foods.
Smithfield and Tyson declined to comment. JBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The North American Meat Institute, an industry group that represents  Hormel Foods Corp  (N:HRL) and others, is also still waiting to learn the size of the tariff from the American embassy in Beijing or trade officials, said a spokeswoman. Uncertainty about the size of the tariff makes it harder for meat packers to plan how much pork to process, said Bill Westman, senior vice president of international affairs for the institute. ""When you're planning your production process, you need some lead time and you need some certainty in the market to do it,"" he said.
""That's why there's some hesitation here. Do we produce for the Chinese market when the tariffs may go up significantly July 6?""
Mark Powers, president of the Northwest Horticultural Council, who handles trade issues for apples, pears and cherries from farms in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, is also seeking confirmation from the U.S. government about how the tariffs will be applied.
Chinese customers had informed him on Wednesday that the latest tariff would replace the earlier one, he added.
A Shanghai-based produce company manager, who declined to be identified, said he believed the new tariffs would not be compounded on existing tariffs, and their inclusion on the latest list was a bureaucratic ""oversight"".
However, he added that ""the document itself is a bit vague so we can't rule out this possibility, if the trade situation further deteriorates"".
Imposition of both duties would cause Chinese purchases to fall sharply, he said, and air-freighted cargoes of cherries currently on their way to China would be canceled.
China is the third-largest export market for U.S. fresh cherries, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. U.S. exporters shipped $119 million of fresh cherries to China, just under a third of total shipments worth $605 million in 2017.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and pear shipments would be even harder hit when the season starts this autumn as they face more competition from other markets, said Powers.

""These tariffs amount to some serious money and it makes it difficult to compete,"" he added.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>",Ex-Airbus boss urges UK-French defense industry ties after Brexit,"PARIS (Reuters) - A leading French industrialist has urged France and Britain to preserve co-operation in the defense industry despite Britain's departure from the European Union next year.
Fabrice Bregier, former head of the MBDA missiles company and later planemaking boss and chief operating officer of aerospace group Airbus, said experience had shown western Europe’s leading military powers could have close co-operation.
The comments come amid growing signs of a rift between Britain and the rest of Europe in defense and security as Britain is excluded from work on the Galileo satellite program and France and Germany start work alone on a new combat jet.
Bregier is the former CEO of Matra BAE Dynamics, a 50/50 venture formed in 1996 between British and French interests that led development of Europe's Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile.
With the addition of Italian participation, this later evolved into MBDA, the world’s second largest missiles manufacturer which Bregier ran from 2001 to 2003.
Although 50/50 ventures are seen as tricky to maintain in highly political arenas such as defense, Bregier said the sensitive UK-French missiles co-operation had worked smoothly.
""This company was a dynamic success and demonstrated that the French and British can co-operate even in a 50-50 partnership,"" Bregier said late on Wednesday.
""I think the lesson that can be drawn is that we must continue co-operation with Britain – Brexit or no Brexit,"" he added. 
""It is a great country, and an important country in both defense and business, and we have the possibility to continue to develop big projects and large-scale co-operation and joint ventures with the British side.""
Bregier was speaking after receiving an award in Paris, in his first public appearance since stepping down from Airbus in February following a succession row at the aerospace group.

French media have linked Bregier with several jobs including the vacant leadership of Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), but allies say he is not interested in running the strike-prone airline.

""Since publication of the last Financial Stability Report, the two Swiss big banks have further improved their compliance,"" the central bank said in its 2018 financial stability report. ""However, progress is still necessary, particularly as regards resolution planning.""
The banks have until the end of next year to prepare so-called resolution plans that would prevent taxpayers from having to bail them out in the event of a crisis.
Both banks are on track to meet updated too-big-to-fail (TBTF) capital requirements, the SNB said, but must improve their leverage ratios, or the ratio of core capital to total assets.
Under the new rules, UBS and Credit Suisse will need to hold core capital representing 5 percent of total assets, known as the leverage ratio. At least 3.5 percent of that should be high-quality common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital.
They will also need to meet a high-quality common equity tier 1 ratio of 10 percent. 
Credit Suisse had a CET1 ratio of 12.9 percent and a CET1 leverage ratio of 3.8 percent in the first-quarter, compared to a CET1 ratio of 13.1 percent and a CET1 leverage ratio of 3.76 percent at UBS. 

Both banks saw their CET1 ratios drop in the first quarter due to regulatory adjustments in the calculation of risk-weighted assets.

China’s commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said on Thursday that the U.S. were being temperamental over bilateral trade issues, and that the U.S. government is being unpredictable. “Beijing has had to respond in a strong way,” Gao said, adding that U.S. unilateralism would ultimately damage the interest of its own workers and farmers as China is “fully prepared” to respond to any new list of U.S. tariffs.

The tariffs will be imposed on imports of U.S. coal, paper, walnuts/almonds, tobacco, unprocessed rice, whisky, automobiles, cosmetics, machinery equipment and petrochemical products.
""The total tariff burden today being imposed by Turkey on the U.S. is commensurate with the additional costs Turkey faces due to the tariffs imposed on it by the U.S.,"" Zeybekci said in a statement.
""They are proportional, measured and designed to protect Turkey's interests, while encouraging dialogue.""
U.S. President Donald Trump decided in March to impose import duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, drawing criticism from other countries for heightening the risk of a global trade war.
The U.S. tariffs have been imposed on Europe, Canada and Mexico, some of its biggest trade partners since June 1, after their temporary exemptions expired.
The United States is the fifth largest country where Turkey exports its goods and trade volume amounted to $20.6 billion in 2017, official data showed.

Turkey remained committed to active, robust and reciprocal trade relations with the United States, Zeybekci said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average rose on Thursday morning as investor jitters over trade issues that hit markets early this week appeared to recede, while technology stocks rallied on the Nasdaq strong performance overnight.
The Nikkei index (N225) rose 0.8 percent to 22,734.28 at the midday break.
""The market has calmed down a little bit as most investors think that trade tension would not escalate further from there... U.S. and China would be both hurt if they keep going like that,"" said Toru Ibayashi, executive director at wealth management at UBS Securities.
Market participants focused on the Topic's recent underperformance against the Nikkei which they attributed to weakness in banks, which have large weighting on the Topix.
The broader Topix (TOPX) lagged the Nikkei, rising only 0.3 percent, spiking the so-called NT ratio <.NTIDX> to 12.94, its highest level since 1999.
The banking sector <.IBNKS.T>, which dropped 1.3 percent and was the second worst sectoral performer on Thursday, has shed 15 percent since the beginning of the year as the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy has undermined lending.
Moreover, the sector was hurt by a report in the Nikkei newspaper stating that mega banks' cash advances to card holders at annual interest rates of 2-14 percent are piling up irrecoverable debt.
The Nikkei said that bad debt tied to such cash advances climbed 13 percent to a six-year high of roughly 140 billion yen ($1.27 billion) in fiscal 2017.
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group (T:8316) dropped 1.8 percent, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (T:8316) fell 1.3 percent and Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411) shed 0.7 percent.

CBA reached the settlement with the regulator in May, in which it admitted that it engaged in ""unconscionable conduct"" in the course of trading on the BBSW market in Australia on five occasions from February through June 2012.
The regulator filed a lawsuit in 2016 alleging three of Australia's biggest lenders had rigged the BBSW for profit from 2010 through 2012, and in January this year started legal proceedings against CBA over the allegations.
The bank agreed to pay a A$5 million ($3.7 million) penalty, A$15 million to a financial consumer protection fund and A$5 million towards the regulator's costs.
On Wednesday, CBA said the federal court approved a settlement of civil proceedings related to money laundering charges.

165,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>",Spotlight on Australia as Banks Fuel Rally to Highest in Decade,"(Bloomberg) -- The past few days have been tumultuous for global equities, but Australia turned out to be one of the rare bright spots.
Investors in the market have witnessed some of the world’s biggest stock gains over the past four days, with the S&P/ASX 200 Index surging to its highest level since January 2008 on Wednesday. Financial firms, which account for about a third of the benchmark gauge, fueled the rally, rebounding 5.2 percent from a 1 1/2-year low after a Federal Reserve rate hike and a decision by the European Central Bank to phase out asset buying.
Here’s where the market stands:
While everybody keeps a close eye on the trade discussions between the U.S. and China, here is what market watchers are saying about Australia:
Rude Health
“There’s been a few shots on the trade side, but nothing has fully broken out,” said Dermot Ryan, a fund co-manager at AMP Capital in Sydney. “Ultimately, the stock market looks at the valuation and health of the sectors. The resources sector is in rude health at the moment.”
Not as Sensitive
“Australia sometimes acts as an EM by proxy, but with one key difference: it’s not as sensitive to the potential negative impact from increasing tariffs on Chinese and U.S. goods,” said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in Melbourne. “We’re not as crucial in the supply chain as many north Asian economies. While there would be some impact on the materials sector if Chinese growth was expected to take a hit and metals demand fell, it’s more than likely that China would respond by increased infrastructure spend to keep the ship steady.”
Pretty Cheap
“The banks look pretty cheap,” for a longer-term investor, said Don Hamson, managing director at Plato Investment Management in Sydney. “It’s been a bad 18 months, but maybe we’re coming toward the end of it.”

That’s the view of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists, who’ve just slashed their 12-month target for the Hang Seng Index by about 10 percent to 27,200 points. The new forecast implies a slump of 18 percent from the benchmark’s January peak, nearing a correction typically denoting a bear market. The gauge closed at 29,696 points Wednesday.
Rising interest rates, a weaker yuan and worsening U.S.-China trade relations are combining to threaten Asia’s economic growth and corporate profits, according to Morgan Stanley. While the strategists cut their targets on six other gauges in the region, Hong Kong looks especially vulnerable due to links with U.S. monetary policy and its companies’ reliance on China for earnings.
“We think the Hang Seng index is at risk of a further sharp drawdown near term,” strategists led by Jonathan Garner wrote in a note Wednesday. “Investors should focus in particular on this juncture at reducing exposure” to the city’s equities.
The Hang Seng Index rose 0.8 percent Wednesday, its first advance in five sessions, marking a brief respite from a selloff that has erased all its gains for the year. The yuan also snapped its steepest two-day loss since 2015 after policymakers set the daily fixing at a much stronger level than expected.

168,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 08:36PM ET</span>",Volvo Cars CEO says auto tariffs threaten jobs at new U.S. plant,"By Harriet McLeod
BERKELEY COUNTY, South Carolina (Reuters - Chinese-owned Volvo Cars opened a new auto factory in South Carolina on Wednesday as company executives warned that the U.S.-China trade dispute could undermine plans to create up to 4,000 more auto jobs in the heavily Republican state.
""If you have trade barriers and restrictions, we cannot create as many jobs as we are planning to,"" Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters on the sidelines of an event celebrating the new facility.
The auto factory is the latest addition to several large-scale manufacturing operations in South Carolina, including a  Boeing Co  (N:BA) aircraft plant and a BMW AG (DE:BMWG) auto assembly plant, that rely heavily on export sales to support jobs.
""We want to export and if suddenly China and Europe have very high barriers, it would be impossible,"" Samuelsson said. ""Then you have to build the cars there. And then all cars will be more expensive, you have to invest more tooling and have every model in every country. That's against all the logic of modern economies that trade with each other.""
Volvo Cars and its new U.S. factory illustrate the conflicts created by President Donald Trump's proposals to impose tariffs of as much as 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts as a way to encourage more U.S. manufacturing and press trading partners to drop tariffs on American goods. 
Volvo currently imports all the vehicles it sells in the United States. Rising demand for those imported vehicles helped convince the company, owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL], to expand its investment in South Carolina to $1.1 billion and make plans to hire about 4,000 workers by the time the new factory reaches full manufacturing capacity. 
Initially, the Volvo South Carolina plant will build S60 sedans, which currently are imported from Europe or China. Some of the U.S.-built cars will be exported to markets outside the United States, Volvo executives said.
The company has no immediate plans to build another model at the plant, company officials said. But if a decision is made to launch Lynk & Co vehicles in the United States, building them in South Carolina would be an option, Samuelsson said. The Lynk brand is co-owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd and its two carmakers, Volvo and Geely Auto.
Volvo has hired about 900 workers at the plant. It will need about 1,500 as production ramps up in the fall, said Anders Gustafsson, Volvo's senior vice president for the Americas. ""We need to speed up."" 

If the U.S. imposes tariffs on foreign cars, and trading partners retaliate, that could could chill Volvo Cars' plans to add jobs, Samuelsson said.

""Restoring the Export-Import Bank to full strength with a Board quorum is the best thing Washington can do right now to grow our economy through exports, shrink our trade deficits, and level the playing field so American workers can win,"" Tim Keating, Boeing's executive vice president of government operations, said in a statement.
The White House nominated Reed to be president of EXIM earlier on Wednesday. 
Confirmation by the full U.S. Senate of at least three board members will allow EXIM to resume approval of loans and guarantees above $10 million, returning the United States to export financing for major projects such as commercial aircraft and power turbines for the first time since June 2015.
Restoring the bank's lending powers would be seen as a victory for American manufacturers like Boeing and  General Electric  Co (N:GE), which have overseas customers that use the agency's government-backed loans to purchase their products.
EXIM has a $42 billion backlog of deals in its pipeline awaiting approval.

The White House withdrew its earlier nomination for Reed to serve as EXIM's first vice president. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee approved Reed for that job last December, along with three other nominees. The White House did not say who it would nominate to fill the first vice president job.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers will decide on Thursday how much cash and debt relief to give Greece in return for compliance with economic reforms, to ensure Athens can finance itself after it exits its bailout in August. 
Greece has been living primarily on money borrowed from euro zone governments in three bailouts since 2010, when it lost market access because of a ballooning budget deficit, huge public debt and an inefficient economy and welfare system. 
With hundreds of reforms requested by its creditors already completed, Greece has made significant progress, but to lend to it again, investors need to know that the country will not collapse under the weight of servicing its debt of 180 percent of GDP.
Euro zone governments, now Greece's main creditors, plan to look at its debt servicing costs over coming decades to smooth out any sharp peaks.
""I am confident that we will be able to reach a deal that sends a positive signal to markets and to public opinion,"" European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici said. 
""We need a balanced compromise between all actors, ensuring growth and sustainable debt for the future. That means agreeing upfront measures to meaningfully lighten Greece’s debt burden, which must be put on a sustainable path.""
While loan write-offs are not under consideration, euro zone ministers will consider extending maturities and grace periods by up to 15 years on the 130 billion euros extended to Greece under its second bailout.
They are also considering the return to Athens of profits made by euro zone central banks on their Greek bond holdings, buying out more expensive loans from the International Monetary Fund and Greek debt held by the Eurosystem of central banks.
To make sure Greece can choose the best moment to tap markets again, the euro zone also wants to provide Athens with a cash buffer of around 20 billion euros that would keep it independent of market borrowing for 18 to 24 months.
But wary that future Greek governments might yield to pressure to reverse some of the unpopular reforms implemented under the bailouts, the euro zone will also seek to link some measures to compliance with agreed policies.

The euro zone will review the Greek economy every quarter to monitor if the agreement is upheld. Should Athens backtrack on commitments, the euro zone is considering a clause that would make the whole debt relief arrangement null and void.

171,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Toyota, pressed to innovate, is cutting marketing costs to fuel research","By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota has begun slashing costs, starting with sales and marketing, and shifting resources into research that will help it keep up with new competitors, four people familiar with the matter said.
One of the company's first moves was to cancel contracts with the China unit of its long-term communication and advertising agency, Dentsu Inc, the sources said.
Chief executive Akio Toyoda and chief financial and risk officer Koji Kobayashi want to follow the example of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Google and Tencent - all of which rely heavily on cheaper, often more innovative non-traditional marketing.
They say the savings should be plowed into investment in emerging technology such as autonomous vehicles. 
""We may be posting record profits, but we don't think we are keeping up with their pace of investments,"" one of the sources, a senior Toyota official, told Reuters.
To do that, Kobayashi wants to tap into money once earmarked for automotive marketing and general expenses, which for the year that ended in March totaled 2.72 trillion yen ($24.66 billion). 
The company reported 2.4 trillion yen ($21.68 billion) in operating income in the same period, making Toyota one of the world's most profitable automakers. 
The company's profit margin is about 9 percent. But companies like Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - now competing directly with Toyota in automotive technology - boast numbers several times larger.
Toyoda and Kobayashi see a sharp contrast between Toyota's hyper-efficient factory side and its more wasteful sales operation, the sources said.
Barring Beijing Dentsu from new business with the automaker next year, and scaling back work already approved, shows the effort to cut spending is serious, the sources said. 
Although the company may bid for Toyota contracts again in 2020, it will be a hard sell, they said. Beijing Dentsu had been doing about $50 million worth of business for Toyota annually.
None of the four wished to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about the issue. 
Toyota was frustrated with the cost of at least two events Dentsu organized in China: a ride-and-drive for Toyota’s premium Lexus brand in March and the Beijing auto show display stand for Toyota in April. 
A review by the automaker showed ""out-of-control extravagance in how it executed those events - not over-billing,"" another one of the sources said. Beijing Dentsu declined to comment.
It was not the first time Toyota had clashed with Dentsu; in 2016, the marketing company admitted to billing for services it did not perform.
'MARUNAGE'
Toyota's cost-cutting effort takes aim at wholesale outsourcing, known in Japan as ""marunage,"" according to two of the sources. It can encompass items such as media buys, promotional events, and consumer and market research.
The sources added that Toyoda and Kobayashi see marunage as flab weighing on the efficiency of Toyota's non-factory operations, and hurting the company's ability to research and produce better vehicles. 
At Toyota factories, engineers make a point of knowing everything they can about each component and process, all the way down to what each part costs. Even if they outsource production, they would produce it on their own first to understand its cost structure, the sources said.
Toyoda and Kobayashi want to instil more discipline in Toyota's sales and marketing teams, and to move in-house some of the jobs routinely outsourced today, the four sources said. 
That, the executives hope, will help give the company more financial firepower to keep up with Silicon Valley, which is pouring money into future automotive technology.
For instance, a lawsuit Waymo filed against Uber over trade secrets revealed that Google's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), spent $1.1 billion developing self-driving tech from 2009 to 2015. That's about what Toyota set aside to fund a research institute it launched in 2016.
On June 13, Toyota invested $1 billion in the Southeast Asian ride-hailing app Grab, giving it access to trip data that could help it develop next-generation services.
Other established automakers are also taking steps to reshape their marketing operations. Ford has tried to ""drive greater marketing efficiency"" by using new tools and technology rather than investing in traditional methods, the company said in a response to questions. The effort, however, doesn't include Ford's China unit or Lincoln brand.
STEEL PIPE CHAIRS
Toyota's current cost-cutting drive began in January, propelled by Kobayashi. 
Kobayashi and Toyoda focused first on Beijing Dentsu in part because of the outsized Lexus event in March in the southern China city of Shenzhen, which Toyoda attended, the sources said. Both men declined to be interviewed for this story. 
What infuriated Toyoda and Kobayashi most, according the four sources, was what they described as the unnecessary extravagance of the event.
Toyota in late March then began a last-minute cost-cutting effort on the display Dentsu had designed for the Beijing auto show in April.
At a visit to the display during the event, it was clear where expenses had been trimmed: some rooms did not have ceilings, and downgraded VIP areas originally outfitted with upscale tables and seating now had steel-pipe chairs and other simple furniture.  
Generally, a stand such as the one Dentsu assembled would cost one billion yen ($10 million) or more. Toyota was only able to slightly reduce that cost.

""Why spend this much money when we use an auto show stand once?"" said one of the knowledgeable individuals. ""It's this kind of out-of-control expense we had rein in.""

(Reuters) - Micron Technology Inc's (O:MU) third-quarter profit and current-quarter forecasts beat Street's expectations, as the chipmaker benefited from a strong demand for its memory chips used in computers and smartphones amid tight supply.
The company has been selling more memory chips at higher prices as customers look to store data and apps in smartphones and companies shift to cloud.
Micron said it expects fourth-quarter revenue in the range of $8.0 billion and $8.4 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $8.07 billion.
""Based on a share count of about 1.23 billion shares, these results should drive EPS of $3.30, plus or minus $0.07"", Micron's Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said on a conference call with analysts. 
The company has 1.16 billion outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Analysts on average expect the company to post a profit of $3.22 per share in the fourth quarter.
Shares of the company rose nearly 3 percent to $60.6 after the bell.
""Micron continues to have near-hurricane force winds at its back blowing the firm forward,"" Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of private equity firm Patriarch said. 
Revenue from dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips used in computers and servers surged 56 percent in the third quarter, accounting for over 71 percent of its net sales.
The Boise, Idaho-based company's gross margins rose 81 percent to $4.72 billion in the quarter. 
""Gross margins also widened and was near our view, as we continue to see benefits from higher volume, cost-per-bit reductions and an improving mix of specialty DRAM and higher-end NAND chips,"" Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA said.
Net income attributable to the chipmaker rose to $3.82 billion, or $3.10 per share, in the quarter ended May 31, from $1.65 billion, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding certain items, Micron earned $3.15 per share, one cent above the analysts' average estimate.

Net sales rose 40 percent to 7.80 billion, beating estimates of $7.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing may have sent tremors across the U.S. stock market but short-sellers are taking the opportunity to boost bearish bets against U.S. companies exposed to a full-blown trade war.
Planemaker Boeing (N:BA), automaker General Motors (N:GM), casino operator  Las Vegas Sands  (N:LVS), package delivery company FedEx Corp (N:FDX) and agricultural trader  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) - companies that could feel the pain from growing trade tensions with China - have drawn a noticeable pickup in shorting activity this month, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
""I think the change in short interest is directly related to the increase in trade tensions,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York.
Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares with the hope of buying them back later at a lower price.
On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was pushing ahead with hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing immediately vowed to respond in kind.
Tensions escalated further on Monday, after Trump threatened to hit $200 billion of Chinese imports with 10 percent tariffs if Beijing retaliated.
Multinationals that rely on China for large parts of their business are seen as particularly at risk from a potential trade war.
Boeing, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, saw a 3 percent increase in short interest in June, while short interest for General Motors jumped by 12 percent, according to the S3 data.
Short interest at FedEx, which is often considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy, and whose shares have come under pressure due to the growing threat of a trade war, grew by 8 percent this month, the data showed.
Toughened glass and optical fiber maker  Corning Inc  (N:GLW) also logged a 4 percent increase in short interest.
Las Vegas Sands, which generates a large chunk of its revenue from the Chinese special administrative region of Macau, saw a 20 percent increase in short interest this month.

Chipmakers, who as a group tend to rely on China for a large part of their revenue, were also in short-sellers' crosshairs. Nvidia (O:NVDA) and Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) are among stocks that have seen the largest increase in short interest since Friday.

Crippled by a hyperinflationary economic crisis, the cash-strapped Venezuelan government and state oil company PDVSA are in default on most of their $60 billion in outstanding bonds. 
Including debt owed to other governments and official lenders, the OPEC member's foreign debt is estimated to stand at $140 billion, with China owed $20-25 billion and Paris Club creditors $5.8 billion, the source said.
However, any restructuring is all but impossible for now because of U.S. sanctions under which that could be seen as illegal financing by Washington.
""Everybody, whether it be the IMF, the private creditors or the official creditors, is preparing for the day after, when it comes, when things become possible,"" the source said.
""We can't do anything now because of the American sanctions,"" the source added speaking after Paris Club and private creditors met on Wednesday in the French capital to discuss a range of issues, including Venezuela's debt.
Any future restructuring is complicated by the fact that some Venezuelan sovereign bonds and no PDVSA bonds are covered by so-called collective action clauses, meaning a minority of bondholders could have scope to hold out in a restructuring deal.
""The complexity of a Venezuelan debt restructuring is an issue, the day that it happens. It will be very, very complicated,"" the source said.

176,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 04:52PM ET</span>","Trump, U.S. lawmakers meet to discuss 'problematic' measure on China's ZTE","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and a group of Republicans from the Senate and House of Representatives met at the White House on Wednesday to discuss their disagreement over how to penalize Chinese telecommunications company ZTE Corp (HK:0763).
The Trump administration moved to lift a ban on the company doing business with U.S. suppliers, but the Republican-led U.S. Senate on Monday included an amendment to kill the settlement as part of a defense policy bill it approved.
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters had said the meeting would focus on the ""problematic"" amendment to the defense bill, but the gathering ended up largely addressing an ongoing furor about the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S. border.
After the meeting, a spokeswoman for Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who attended and is a lead sponsor of the amendment, said ZTE was discussed, but offered no further details. 
""He will continue to work with his colleagues to find a solution that protects our national security and Americans' privacy from Chinese telecom companies,"" spokeswoman Caroline Tabler said via email.
Republicans and Democrats have expressed national security concerns about ZTE and another major China-based telecommunications company, Huawei Technologies Ltd [HWT.UL]. But their ire against ZTE rose after it broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea.
ZTE has agreed to pay a $1 billion penalty and put $400 million in an escrow account in a U.S. bank as part of the settlement reached on June 7 to allow it to do business again with U.S. suppliers.

Shares of the Chinese telecommunications firm and its U.S. business partners fell after the Senate vote, although the measure could still be killed when Senate and House lawmakers meet in the coming weeks to forge a compromise version of the National Defense Authorization Act.

The company said its profit will also be hurt by a new vehicle certification process, recall of some diesel vehicles and declining demand for its buses in Latin America.

178,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Hedge fund Tourbillon hires Berman as president,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Tourbillon Capital Partners, which has made headlines with negative returns lately, hired former hedge fund manager Ross Berman as its president and chief strategy officer, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
The New York-based firm is run by Jason Karp, who previously worked for Carlson Capital and Steven A. Cohen's SAC Capital before founding his own firm in 2012.
Berman twice ran his own hedge fund and has spent time consulting in the $3 trillion industry over the last two years. He cofounded BAM Capital Management which operated from 2002 to 2010 and later ran Green Owl Capital from 2012 to 2016.
Amy Zipper had been president and chief operating officer at the firm, having joined at the start in 2012. 
The move to hire Berman comes at a time when many hedge funds have struggled with returns and raising new capital, prompting some to tap senior executives to focus on business matters and free up the founders and portfolio managers to concentrate on making investments.
Tourbillon dazzled with double-digit returns early in its lifetime but has fallen on tougher times recently when two years of back-to-back losses prompted some investors to ask for money back. The fund now manages roughly $2 billion, down from $3.4 billion at the end of February. Through May, it has lost 1.4 percent, following a 14 percent loss in 2017 and a 9 percent loss in 2016. In 2013, the firm posted its best returns ever with a 21 percent gain.
In the first five months of 2018, the average hedge fund returned 1.5 percent, data from Hedge Fund Research shows.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Former Puma Biotech executive gets U.S. prison term for insider trading,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A former Puma Biotechnology Inc (O:PBYI) executive was sentenced on Wednesday to 2-1/4 years in prison for trading on inside information ahead of announcements by the biopharmaceutical company about a breast cancer drug it was developing.
Robert Gadimian, 48, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge William Young in Boston after pleading guilty in November to seven counts of securities fraud for carrying out illicit trades that prosecutors said allowed him to earn about $1 million.
The judge also ordered him to pay a $25,000 fine, which is on top of the $1.16 million he previously agreed to forfeit to the government. In court, Gadimian apologized for his conduct and promised not to break the law again.
""I knew what I was doing was not only illegal but morally wrong,"" he said. ""There is simply no excuse for my actions.""
According to court papers, from 2011 to 2014, Gadimian worked as the Los Angeles-based company's senior director of regulatory affairs as Puma was developing a breast cancer drug called ""neratinib.""
Prosecutors said that from 2013 to 2014, Gadimian twice secretly traded Puma stock and options based on information he learned about positive developments regarding clinical trials involving neratinib before the company announced the news.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2017 approved the drug, which is marketed under the name Nerlynx.
Prosecutors said Gadimian made more than $1.1 million through the insider trading scheme, which they said he carried out despite a lack of any financial circumstance that compelled him to commit the crime.
They noted that Gadimian owns a $2.7-million home in Burbank, California, and a 2013 Jaguar FX. Even after losing his job at Puma, he exercised employee stock options worth more than $5 million, prosecutors said in a court filing.
Prior to being charged, Gadimian had lived an upstanding life and had gained the trust of people around him, Young said at Wednesday's court hearing.
""And yet, you recognize that you threw that all away for greed,"" Young said. ""Nothing more. For greed.""
Christopher Bruno, Gadimian's lawyer, acknowledged his client had committed a ""brazen"" fraud. But he said his client had since first coming under scrutiny in 2014 sought to take responsibility for his actions.
""I think that's commendable, and I think that speaks to his true level of remorse,"" Bruno said.
The case is U.S. v. Gadimian, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 16-cr-10285.

(Reuters) - Four of the five so-called FAANG stocks – Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix – surged to all-time highs on Wednesday, with only Apple spoiling a perfect scorecard.
The five heavyweight stocks also powered the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) to a record high and helped the broader S&P 500 (SPX) shrug off concerns over tariffs between the United States and China.
Trade war worries have limited the benchmark S&P 500's gain to about 3.5 percent this year, but the FAANG group, whose businesses are largely immune to trade and tariffs, has surged 10 times in this period.
""We're seeing a big question mark over global trade ... and whenever you see the market get in trouble, it's always important to look for leadership and isolate strength,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments in New York.
""Right now FAANG stocks are leading and acting very well.""
The NYSE Fang+ Index <.NYFANG>, which includes the five core FAANG stocks, also hit a record high on Wednesday.
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) jumped as much as 3.1 percent to a record high of $203.55, topping $200 for the first time ever.
Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) rose 1.9 percent to $1,201.49, taking out its previous record of $1,198 hit on Jan. 29.
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) rose 1.6 percent to $1,762.93, hitting an all-time high for the third session in row and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) climbed 3.5 percent to $419.17, a day after topping $400 for first time ever.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) hit a session high of $187.20, still 3.7 percent shy of its record of $194.20 hit on June 7.
Even among the group, there were clear winners.
Netflix has surged about 120 percent in 2018, more than double the roughly 50 percent increase in Amazon, the next best stock.
A distant third is Facebook, now up about 14 percent for the year after recovering from a slide in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Just behind it is Alphabet, with a 11.5 percent gain.
Lagging the group with an increase of about 7 percent is Apple. Its stock this year has been weighed down by persistent fears over slowing demand for its new iPhones.

Nonetheless, the FAANG group, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) poll, was the most ""crowded"" trade by investors for the fifth month in a row in May.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 02:48PM ET</span>",U.S. court revives Dr Pepper challenge to Coca-Cola 'zero' drinks,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday revived  Dr Pepper Snapple  Group Inc's (N:DPS) challenge to Coca-Cola Co's (N:KO) effort to register trademarks for soft drinks and sports drinks whose names contain the word ""zero.""
By a 3-0 vote, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. threw out a May 2016 dismissal of much of Dr Pepper's decade-old case, saying a trademark review board failed to properly analyze whether ""zero"" was too generic to be trademarked.
Multiple companies sell beverages with the ""zero"" name, which often denotes an absence of calories or carbohydrates.
The ability to market products effectively is important to beverage makers trying to counteract declines in U.S. sales of carbonated soft drinks since their mid-2000s peak.
Coca-Cola and its lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Dr Pepper welcomed the decision. ""We do not believe that any company should have the ability to claim exclusive trademark rights to a term like 'zero' in connection with zero-calorie beverages,"" spokesman Chris Barnes said in a statement.
Coca-Cola has used the ""zero"" name on such products as Cherry Coke Zero, Sprite Zero, Powerade Zero, and more recently Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.
The Atlanta-based company's effort to register U.S. rights to 17 drinks with the word ""zero"" prompted a 2007 challenge by Dr Pepper, whose products include Diet Rite Pure Zero. Coca-Cola argued that such names could confuse consumers.
In 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board said ""zero"" had ""acquired distinctiveness"" when used to sell Coca-Cola soft drinks.
The board cited a 2008 survey offered by Coca-Cola in which 61 percent of consumers associated the word ""zero"" with one company, as opposed to 6 percent for the word ""diet.""
But the board also said Plano, Texas-based Dr Pepper could trademark Diet Rite Pure Zero because only full brand names, not the word ""zero"" by itself, were ""inherently distinctive.""
Dr Pepper's appeal sought to force Coca-Cola to ""disclaim"" the word ""zero,"" broadly freeing rivals to use it.
In Wednesday's decision, Circuit Judge Kathleen O'Malley said the trademark board used the wrong legal approach to assess whether consumers thought ""zero"" generically described low-calorie or low-carbohydrate drinks.
She also said Coca-Cola failed to counteract Dr Pepper's evidence about how companies used the word, and that the passage of time made the 2008 survey's usefulness ""questionable.""
The case was returned to the trademark board for further proceedings.

The case is Royal Crown Co et al v  Coca-Cola Co , U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 2016-2375.

LONDON (Reuters) - A London court on Wednesday described as ""troubling"" a case brought by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) against a former junior UBS (S:UBSG) trader for alleged Libor interest rate rigging.
The Upper Tribunal, a court that hears challenges against FCA decisions, dismissed an appeal against a ban from financial services by former UBS derivatives trader Arif Hussein. 
But judge Timothy Herrington said there were ""troubling aspects"" to the case in which a relatively junior trader had been singled out.
""This was against a background of widespread manipulation of Libor within UBS for which senior managers bear ultimate responsibility and which ... was widely condoned,"" he said.
He said an explanation by FCA lawyer Benjamin Strong about why senior UBS staff had not been brought to account was concerning. Strong said ""not everybody is in the jurisdiction"" and ""the senior people somehow manage to keep their fingerprints off the relevant documents sometimes"".
Hussein had challenged a 2016 FCA proposal to bar him for alleged recklessness because he had tried to influence the bank's Libor (London interbank offered rates) to boost his trading positions in 2009.
Libor is used to price trillions of dollars of financial transactions. It is an average interest rate calculated through an ""honor system"", where a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing from each other to an administrator.
Judge Herrington said he believed the former trader had not personally sought to manipulate Libor and that he had not acted dishonestly or without integrity while at the Swiss bank.
But in what he called ""a tragedy"" for Hussein, he said the trader had made a ""serious error of judgment"" by not being candid with the FCA and when under oath, possibly because he was frightened at the prospect of a large financial penalty.
The FCA said it had examined the available evidence. 
""The extent of the evidence, the responsibilities of the individual, where they were based, the action of other agencies and whether they were FCA approved persons were all factors in the nature and timing of any action taken,"" it said.
UBS, which was fined $1.5 billion by British, U.S. and Swiss authorities over its Libor conduct in 2012, declined to comment.
Hussein, who resigned from UBS in 2009 after a 15-year career to open a burger restaurant in London, said he regretted not coming forward with a full explanation for his actions.
""The FCA wanted to impose an enormous financial penalty on me, which would have put me under dire financial pressure and most likely resulted in my young family losing their home,"" he said in a statement. 

""This financial penalty was to be imposed for conduct - which the judge agreed - I did not commit.""

PARIS (Reuters) - The head of Boeing (N:BA) jetliner sales said on Wednesday he was confident a possible new mid-market jet with the potential to carve out new routes would be ready to enter service in 2025, but stressed the planemaker would not be rushed into a decision.
Boeing is studying plans for what industry sources describe as a hybrid jet combining a wide cabin and a restricted cargo space, moulded to fly efficiently in a space between the industry's single-aisle jets and wide-body long-haul aircraft.
But it has been taking longer than expected to resolve questions about how to build the jet at a low enough cost to fit the market niche, prompting some suppliers to urge a decision soon to avoid slipping past a desired 2025 debut date.
Ihssane Mounir, senior vice-president for commercial sales and marketing at Boeing, told French journalists Boeing would ""protect"" the targeted 2025 date for entry into service, which some analysts see as ideally suited to planned replacement cycles.
He declined to say when Boeing could make a decision on the possible twin-aisle plane, which has been the source of speculation among airlines and investors for around two years.
""We will take the time to do this right...but we will protect the date of introduction for the aircraft,"" Mounir told the AJPAE French aerospace journalists' association.
""Based on where we are today, we are very comfortable with the fact we can do it by 2025, but we haven't made a decision.""
Experts say the call on whether to launch the plane is one of the most significant decisions Boeing will make in coming years, because it will prepare ground for the next generation of smaller single-aisle jets by pioneering new production methods.
PRODUCTION 'REVOLUTION'
The search for cheaper new ways of building planes at high volume to meet growing demand is fast emerging as a strategic battleground between Boeing and European arch-rival Airbus, which unveiled more robots and automation last week.
Mounir deflected a question about future successors to the single-aisle 737, saying Boeing was comfortable with its record order book for the current model.
But he said the new mid-market plane would focus on what he described as a ""revolutionary production system"" incorporating new digital technology.
""It's not a plane that will be technologically much more advanced than what we have today. What will be very advanced is the production system,"" Mounir said.
Mounir said ""conservative"" estimates showed global demand for 4,000 to 5,000 middle-of-the market jets over 20 years.
Airbus disagrees with the forecast.
Mounir dismissed reported plans by Airbus to enhance its best-selling A321 single-aisle jet, saying it would not cover the same range or operate as economically as Boeing's proposal.
Reuters reported this week that Airbus is considering adding extra endurance to the longest-range version of its A321 jet in a potential new variant dubbed A321XLR. 

Mounir said talks with Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3) over a possible commercial aerospace venture were ""advanced"". Boeing insists it is not a ""must-do"" deal, however.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has sued a former employee claiming that he hacked the electric carmaker's trade secrets and transferred large amounts of company data to third parties, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court in Nevada on Wednesday. 
In its lawsuit Tesla claimed that Martin Tripp, who formerly worked at the Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada, had admitted to writing software that hacked the carmaker's manufacturing operating system, transferring several gigabytes of its data to third parties and making false claims to the media.
Tripp was not immediately available for comment. His hacking software was operating on three separate computer systems of other individuals at Tesla so that the data would be exported even after he left the company and falsely implicate those individuals, according to the lawsuit. 
""Within a few months of Tripp joining Tesla, his managers identified Tripp as having problems with job performance and at times being disruptive and combative with his colleagues,"" the lawsuit said. 
""As a result of these and other issues, on or about May 17, 2018, Tripp was assigned to a new role. Tripp expressed anger that he was reassigned.""
Earlier this week, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk told employees in an email that an unnamed Tesla employee had conducted “extensive and damaging sabotage” to the company’s operations.
“The full extent of his actions are not yet clear, but what he has admitted to so far is pretty bad,” Musk wrote without specifying who he was referring to. 
A Tesla spokesperson had no additional comment.

Tesla stock was trading up slightly on Wednesday, just below $355.

217,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>","Teradata sues Germany's SAP, alleging it stole trade secrets","By Douglas Busvine
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - SAP SE (DE:SAPG), Europe's most valuable technology company, was sued on Wednesday by U.S. company  Teradata  (N:TDC), which accused it of stealing trade secrets, copyright infringement and anti-trust violations.
The case, filed at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Germany-based SAP entered a joint venture with Teradata in 2008 with the aim of gaining access to its intellectual property and creating a competing database product that it then tried to ""coerce"" its customers to use.
SAP said it was surprised by the Teradata complaint. It may issue a statement once it has reviewed the lawsuit, which seeks an injunction, unspecified damages and other legal relief available under the law.
The case comes weeks after SAP, long a provider of business software that runs back-office functions such as finance or supply-chain management, announced a push into the $66 billion market for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) - jargon for sales and marketing.
SAP, which has a market value of more than $140 billion, is shifting customers increasingly to integrated cloud-based services. The Teradata suit relates to its earlier generation of HANA database products, hosted on company premises, that are still widely in use.
The 35-page filing https://assets.teradata.com/News/2018/2018-06-19-Complaint.pdf draws on allegations by a whistleblower - identified as former internal SAP auditor Thomas Waldbaum - that were first reported by Germany's Spiegel magazine http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/sap-ehemaliger-mitarbeiter-erhebt-schwere-vorwuerfe-gegen-sap-a-1051499-druck.html in Sept. 2015. At the time, SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner slammed the claims as ""monstrous and laughable"" https://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen/it/sap-aufsichtsratschef-hasso-plattner-weist-vorwurf-des-ideenklaus-zurueck/12328998.html.
SAP shut down an internal probe into the concerns raised by Waldbaum in May 2013, the suit alleges.
In an email to the supervisory board in Jan. 2014, Waldbaum alleged that SAP had improperly used the intellectual property of a number of competitors, including Teradata, to create HANA, the suit says.
Waldbaum was fired the following month.
Teradata alleges that SAP's theft of intellectual property enabled it to speed the release of HANA. The lawsuit also notes that HANA sales reached $2 billion in 2016 and generated hundreds of millions of dollars in further licensing sales.
It was not immediately clear what prospects of success the Teradata suit had. Shares in SAP gained 1 percent in European trading.
Shares in Teradata, which was spun out from NCR (N:NCR) in 2007 and is valued at just over $5 billion, were slightly down on the Nasdaq exchange. The company's stock has nearly halved in price since peaking in 2012.

In an earlier legal battle with U.S. competitor Oracle (N:ORCL), SAP agreed in 2014 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oracle-sap-se-settlement/oracle-sap-settle-long-running-tomorrownow-lawsuit-idUSKCN0IX2RJ20141113 to pay a $357 million settlement over the improper download of Oracle files.

Violations, that took place between 2007 and 2013, include efforts to improperly coordinate trading activity through online chat rooms, sharing confidential customer information, trading aggressively to rig prices, and misleading customers.
The litigation followed worldwide probes into currency manipulation that resulted in about $10 billion in fines for several large banks.
Under the consent order announced today https://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1806201.htm, Deutsche Bank will take steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring again by improving senior management oversight of the company’s compliance with the State laws and regulations relating to the company’s foreign exchange trading business.
""The settlement is fully covered by existing provisions,"" said a Deutsche bank spokesman.

Other banks that had settled similar charges in the past are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Royal Bank of Canada,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and UBS.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 12:04PM ET</span>",Cboe VIX logs orderly June settlement,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street's so-called ""fear gauge,"" logged an orderly monthly settlement on Wednesday, which is likely to help allay concerns that the index is manipulated on settlement days.
The VIX futures June settlement, calculated using a subset of S&P 500 (SPX) options, was 12.27, according to Cboe data. The VIX opened during regular trading hours at 12.47.
""Today's SPX auction, which determines VIX settlement values, went very well,"" Cboe President Chris Concannon said in an emailed statement. ""Similar to the auction in May, liquidity formation was robust and supported a smooth settlement process,"" he said.
The settlement price sets the value of billions of dollars in expiring in VIX derivatives. In recent years there have been increasing instances of big deviations between the VIX settlement price and VIX values right after the market open. 
Since a volatility shock in February, the Cboe has been dogged by accusations that its VIX settlement process is prone to manipulation.
Market participants worry that unscrupulous traders may be deliberately moving the settlement price for illicit gains. Allegations of manipulation of the settlement price got a boost in April when the monthly settlement price deviated by a record margin of nearly 2 points from the VIX index open price.
The Cboe denies those allegations and has said it has taken steps to make the settlement auctions more liquid, including upgrading the technology behind the process.
Wednesday's settlement process marks the second monthly settlement after the exchange made these changes and is the second straight monthly settlement that market participants have deemed orderly.

(Reuters) - A jump in technology and media stocks lifted the S&P 500 on Wednesday and pushed the Nasdaq to a record high, but the Dow remained under pressure from an escalation in the U.S.-China trade spat that has slammed global markets.
Twenty-First Century Fox gained 7.1 percent after Walt Disney sweetened its offer for some of the company's assets to $71.3 billion, looking to topple Comcast's bid.
The S&P 500 media index rose 1.1 percent with all its 14 members in positive territory. Viacom gained 2.4 percent, while  DISH Network  (NASDAQ:DISH) and Discovery were up about a percent.
The so-called FAANG stocks - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - were also higher.
""You've got a little bit of a shift away from the macro concerns which will continue to be a headwind for this market until we get some answers on trade. Right now the focus is on M&A,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York.
Markets skidded on Tuesday after President Donald Trump's latest tariff threats against Chinese goods intensified worries over an intensifying China-U.S. trade spat. 
The United States is also under fire from other countries for its protectionist measures. The European Union will start charging import duties of 25 percent on a range of U.S. products from Friday after Washington imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum at the start of June.
At 11:24 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 32.92 points, or 0.13 percent, at 24,667.29. The S&P 500 was up 6.94 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,769.53 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 58.11 points, or 0.75 percent, at 7,783.69.
Of the 11 main S&P index sectors, five were higher.
The blue-chip Dow index erased early gains and turned negative, looking to add to its six-day losing streak.
Declines in industrials, including 3M's 0.8 percent decline and Caterpillar's 0.8 percent fall, weighed the most.
""Considering the magnitude of headwinds that we face in trade, it appears as though it has been relatively 'extra Dow' and that's because Dow companies are more heavily impacted due to strong dollar and trade talks,"" Hogan said. 
Shares in  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, the last remaining original member of the 30-stock Dow, fell 1.1 percent after losing its position in the index. 
Walgreens, which will replace GE, gained 1.1 percent.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) slipped 8.5 percent after the world's largest coffee chain's quarterly sales growth forecast missed analysts' estimates.
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) dropped 0 percent after the software maker's current-quarter profit forecast fell short of analysts' expectations.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.71-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.19-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 21 new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 158 new highs and 24 new lows.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 11:42AM ET</span>","Starbucks' shares slump on China, U.S. growth concerns","(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) shares fell more than 8 percent on Wednesday after a disappointing sales forecast from the U.S. coffee chain prompted Wall Street analysts to question the sustainability of its growth at home and in its next biggest market, China.
Several analysts downgraded their ratings and cut their 12-month targets on Starbucks' stock, after the company on Tuesday forecast sales growth at established restaurants of just 1 percent in the third quarter, below Wall Street's expectations of 3 percent.
Starbucks also said it expects no growth of same-store sales in China in the three months ending June.
""We've got to be much more disciplined in setting our priorities,"" Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.
""Clearly the performance we've delivered has not met my expectations ... It hasn't met our shareholder expectations."" 
With Wednesday's decline, Starbucks' shares were on track to enter negative territory for 2018 - a year in which co-founder Howard Schultz stepped down as executive chairman and the company found itself at the center of an embarrassing racial profiling incident.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst John Glass, who downgraded the stock to ""equal-weight"" from ""overweight,"" expressed surprise at Starbucks' expectations for China, and said the overall forecast raised questions about the sustainability of Starbucks' growth back home. Just three quarters ago, same-restaurant sales in China had risen 8 percent, Glass said.
Other analysts echoed Glass' surprise, noting that the Seattle-based company had been upbeat about growth in China just a few weeks ago at its investor day event, saying it was highly focused on that market.
On Tuesday, Starbucks also announced plans to close some 150 U.S. cafes, triple the number it typically shuts in a year, and open many fewer locations in its 2019 fiscal year, beginning in October, a result of intensifying competition that has seen new coffee chains, convenience stores and fast-food chains improve quality and cut prices aggressively.
Analysts also pointed to lower-than-expected same-restaurant sales in five of the previous six quarters at Starbucks' Americas business, which is dominated by its roughly 8,000 U.S. cafes.
Some analysts said a sharper focus on digital initiatives - promoting Starbucks' mobile app and online ordering - could make up for some of the slowdown in the company's key markets.
""In reaction to what is now a clearer pattern of slower U.S. sales, more product and digital innovation is in the works, but it's hard to see how much that impacts sales,"" Morgan Stanley's Glass said.
Morgan Stanley's downgrade on Starbucks' shares brings the total number of ""hold"" or equivalent ratings on the stock to 15. Still, 16 analysts maintain a ""buy"" or higher rating.

The average Wall Street price target on Starbucks shares was $62.08. In late morning trade on Wednesday, the company's shares changed hands at $52.58, down 8.4 percent.

230,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Audi's detained CEO questioned by prosecutors over emissions scandal: source,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Munich prosecutors questioned Audi's arrested Chief Executive Rupert Stadler about a global diesel-cheating scandal on Wednesday, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Stadler, who was arrested on Monday and is being held at a prison in the southern German city of Augsburg, spoke with investigators in the presence of his lawyer, the source added. 
Prosecutors and Stadler's lawyer did not comment on the nature of their discussion. Stadler himself was not reachable for comment.
Audi (DE:NSUG), the premium brand of carmaker Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p), has said Stadler should be presumed innocent until proven otherwise.
Munich prosecutors are investigating him for suspected fraud and false advertising in connection with emissions test cheating by Audi - part of the broader ""dieselgate"" scandal that has engulfed Volkswagen (VW) since 2015. 
They remanded Stadler in custody on Monday to prevent him from obstructing their probe.
Stadler on Tuesday temporarily stepped down from his position as CEO of Audi and as a member of VW's management board. Audi named Abraham Schot as interim CEO.
Stadler has been under fire ever since Audi admitted to using cheating software in November 2015 - two months after VW - but has enjoyed backing from members of the Porsche and Piech families who control VW and Audi.
The technique of using software to detect a pollution test procedure, and to increase the effectiveness of emissions filters to mask pollution levels during tests, was first developed at Audi.
""In designing the defeat device, VW engineers borrowed the original concept of the dual-mode, emissions cycle-beating software from Audi,"" VW said in its plea agreement with U.S. authorities in January 2017, in which the company agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine to reach a settlement with U.S. regulators.
VW has insisted the development of illegal software, also known as ""defeat devices"", was the work of low-level employees, and that no management board members were involved.

U.S. prosecutors have challenged this by indicting VW's former CEO Martin Winterkorn. Investigations in Germany are continuing.

LONDON (Reuters) - The majority of hedge funds are passing on charges for investment research to investors under new European Union rules, despite years of poor average performance and as many large traditional asset managers absorb the cost themselves.
Billing clients, however, could prove increasingly untenable for underperforming hedge funds as investors have become used to receiving research services for free elsewhere.
Hedge funds took in $36.2 billion between January and April, data from Eurekahedge showed, continuing a recovery begun in 2017, when investors put in $113.5 billion. They took out $20.1 billion in 2016.
The EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, dubbed MiFID II, which took effect six months ago, states investment research must be priced separately from other broker services to ensure transparency and better value for money. 
Given the choice of paying the bill themselves or passing it on, industry tracker HFM Insights said 63 percent of 113 hedge fund managers surveyed were billing the cost to clients.
That contrasts with traditional asset managers, who are mostly paying for it themselves, partly due to the operational complexity of charging and to avoid having to justify higher fees than rivals during a period of intense fee pressure.
Bill Muysken, chief investment officer, alternatives at leading pension consultant and investor Mercer, said the funds his clients were invested in were broadly split between the two payment models.
Many of those passing the cost on said they were doing so because they were small businesses, had not budgeted for the costs and were therefore unwilling to pay, he said.
""It's sustainable as long as you're earning good returns. The better your performance, the more you can sustain that. Conversely, the more disappointing your performance, the less you can,"" he said.
At the end of April, the average hedge fund was up 0.2 percent year-to-date, industry tracker Eurekahedge showed, with one in 10 managers posting gains of over 5 percent. By contrast, the Standard & Poors 500 index was up nearly 5 percent.
Hedge fund investments are typically only available to professional investors and are famed for charging much more for their services than their retail-friendly traditional peers, in exchange for hopefully better and more sustainable returns.
With stock markets in countries such as the United States trading at relatively high valuations and global monetary policy increasingly divergent, many investors have increased their allocations to hedge funds, despite having to pay for research.
Typically run as much smaller companies, many hedge funds employ fewer analysts than traditional firms and may rely more on buying external research to bolster their investment ideas.

The hedge fund industry in Europe has just over $724 billion assets under management, with the average fund just $320 million, according to industry tracker Preqin.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 10:48AM ET</span>",Looking for another Nasdaq? Try Europe's aerospace and defense stocks,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - Fat order books covering several years of sales have made European aerospace and defense firms a winning bet as a slowing economy and political instability have clouded prospects for the region's equity market.
The sector's stock prices have been hitting record highs, even as investors become more wary of European economic growth falling from its peak and as fears of a global trade war put other big multinational industrial stocks in the crosshairs.
For many investment funds, the aerospace and defense sector is more insulated from the economic cycle as it works through a huge backlog of orders and fractious geopolitics spur demand for military equipment. 
""Order books are currently very large (and this) gives visibility and makes the group somewhat more resilient from the general economic cycle,"" said Sandrine Perret, strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), International Wealth Management, in Zurich.
""It gives the aerospace sector a comparative advantage relative to others that are more sensitive to short-term business fluctuations,"" Perret added.
On top of that, while U.S. President Donald Trump's trade protectionism raises uncertainty about future U.S. demand, that could be more than offset for European firms from countries seeking to reorientate trade away from Washington.
The European aerospace and defense index <.SXPARO> is up 15 percent so far this year, just below the all-time peak touched last week when the European Central Bank cut its growth forecasts following four months of largely weaker-than-expected economic data <.CESIEUR>. 
That has put the sector ahead of others not only in Europe, but also in the United States. The record-breaking Nasdaq (NDX), for example, is lagging with a 13 percent year-to-date gain.
A number of stocks in the sector, from plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR) to French defense electronics group  Thales  (PA:TCFP) and German engine firm MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn), have been surging from one record to another.
""Investors are very happy and companies are delivering,"" said Celine Fornaro, head of European Industrials equity research at UBS in London. ""The sector is long-cycle, less exposed to the volatility of the quarters."" 
Airbus's commercial order book of more than 7,100 jetliners currently represents a record eight years of anticipated production. 
And defense companies have once again begun selling more than they deliver, in a sign growth is returning to the sector amid tensions between the West and Russia.

WHAT COULD STOP THE CYCLE? 
Europe-based companies are also getting a lift from the stronger dollar, which is being underpinned by the U.S. economy's outperformance versus Europe and prospects for more interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Credit Suisse's Perret said European manufacturers sell aircraft and retail parts in dollars, while their production costs are largely in euros.
This helps explain why the European aero-defense stocks are on track to outperform their U.S. peers this year, although she said the currency tailwind may be short-lived.
""We foresee the euro rebounding against the dollar over the next three months."" said Perret. 
Nevertheless, Europe's aero-defense index is on track to beat its U.S. equivalent <.SPLRCAERO> for the first time since 2015. The U.S. index, which tracks companies such as Airbus rival Boeing (N:BA) and security firm  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT), is up 3 percent so far in 2018, one fifth of the European rise.
Overall, analysts and investors remain upbeat about prospects for the industry and broker sentiment over stocks such as Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and  Cobham  (L:COB), which have lagged the sector, has improved.
Several analysts lifted their share price targets for Rolls-Royce on Monday after the UK engineer, which has been in turnaround mode since 2015, announced new mid-term goals.
Cobham shares shot up on the same day after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) upgraded the stock, citing the company's turnaround and the start of ""multi-year upcycles ... in core defense and aerospace markets"". 
According to research firm Forecast International, European defense spending is seen rising by more than 3 percent a year to $277 billion in 2022, as NATO countries in Europe are under pressure from Washington to increase spending. 
Trade body IATA, meanwhile, sees air passenger numbers doubling to 7.8 billion in 2036. 
UBS's Fornaro sums up the mood. 
""We're very upbeat because more people fly and in more countries. Nothing is really new in this industry but it's hard to say what could stop the cycle,"" she said.
""Past cycles were brought to an end by unpredictable events: the 9/11 attacks and the SARS outbreak in 2008,"" she added.

(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, facing a wave of lawsuits blaming it for helping fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic, said on Wednesday it had laid off about 350 employees this week including the remainder of its already-downsized sales force.
The Stamford, Connecticut-based pharmaceutical manufacturer said about half of the affected employees were part of its sales force, which had already seen cuts announced in February when Purdue said it would stop promoting opioids to physicians.
At the time, Purdue said its remaining 200 sales representatives would focus on promoting on non-opioid products. The layoffs, adding to 380 employees who left the company earlier this year, will leave Purdue with about 550 employees as the company says it is shifting to focus on pursuing new drugs. 
""Purdue Pharma is taking significant steps to transform and diversify beyond our historic focus of pain medications,"" Purdue said in a statement. 
Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in the United States in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Privately-held Purdue and other opioid manufacturers have been fighting hundreds of lawsuits by states, counties and cities accusing the companies of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing. 
The lawsuits have generally accused Purdue of deceiving doctors and patients by misrepresenting the risks of addiction and death associated with the prolonged use of its prescription opioids. The company denies the allegations.
While Purdue has engaged in settlement talks with a group of state attorneys general conducting an investigation into it and other opioid manufacturers, a growing number of states have chosen to instead take the company to court.
In total, Purdue faces lawsuits by 24 states and the territory of Puerto Rico.
Most recently, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey on June 12 sued Purdue and 16 current or former Purdue executives and board members, including members of the wealthy Sackler family, which owns the company.
Purdue and three executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal charges related to the misbranding of OxyContin and agreed to pay a total of $634.5 million in penalties.
Sales of OxyContin have been declining in recent years. OxyContin generated $1.74 billion in sales in 2017, down from $2.6 billion five years earlier, according to data compiled by Symphony Health Solutions.
Purdue continues to sell opioids. It has been directing doctors with opioid-related questions to its medical affairs department.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom needs to urgently clarify how trade with the European Union will work after Brexit, and the world's fifth-largest economy should remain in the customs union unless there is a proper alternative, the boss of Siemens UK said.
With only nine months left until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU, little is yet clear about how trade will flow as Prime Minister Theresa May, who is grappling with a rebellion in her party, is still trying to strike a deal with the bloc.
""My biggest worry about Brexit is that I don't know what we are planning for,"" Juergen Maier, 54, the UK CEO of German engineering giant Siemens told Reuters in an interview.
""We need to put something in place quickly that works and if that is not possible, and until that point, then we have to just default to staying in the customs union,"" Maier said.
May has ruled out staying in the EU customs union, which clubs the 28 EU members in a duty-free area where there is a common import tariff for non-EU goods.
But the nature of the future trading relationship with the world’s biggest trading bloc has split May’s government and Conservative Party.
Under the current timetable, both London and Brussels are working toward a final Brexit deal in October to give enough time to ratify it by Brexit day in March 2019.
Maier said: ""We ship thousands of goods daily across the borders that help keep power stations running, that help keep trains running, that help keep British manufacturing running - are those parts going to be able to pass pretty frictionlessly over the border?"" 
""Or are we going to be in a situation where we have supply chains that are struggling to deliver to us and where we are struggling to export from the UK?""
The views of the Siemens boss highlight the growing sense of nervousness among business leaders about the prospect of Britain crashing out of the bloc without a deal or with a deal that would silt up the arteries of trade.
The UK is Siemens' fourth-largest market after the United States, Germany and China. It employs 15,000 people in the UK and 56,000 UK jobs depend on it.
""If the Brexit we end up having provides significant friction, provides significant cost then of course that will be an argument against making investments here in the UK,"" he said.
BREXIT TRADE 
Maier, who was born in Germany and moved to the UK when he was 10, said he was not seeking to stop Brexit but wanted Britain to seek a ""soft and reasonable"" departure.
Around 52 percent of the UK's total $1.1 trillion trade in goods last year was with the EU so May wants to sign a free trade agreement and negotiate an as yet relatively undefined customs arrangement to ensure as frictionless trade as possible.
The options discussed so far, though, offer nothing close to the current ease of trade, according to Maier.
""I would like to stay in the customs union until we see a workable alternative and I haven't seen one yet,"" he said.
Maier said that adding just two minutes onto every lorry's customs procedure passing through the southern English port of Dover would produce a 14-mile tailback on either side of the Channel after one day.
Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for the UK's $2.9 trillion economy but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration.
Many CEOs, though, fear that a disorderly Brexit will disrupt supply chains across Europe and cripple the economy for at least a decade by deterring investment.
Maier said planning for Brexit was tough.
""The fact is - it is very difficult because we don't know exactly what we are planning for. Contingency planning is very difficult when the options are so varied."" 
""We have got contingency plans that we can implement depending on various scenarios and one of those scenarios is a no deal - but let me tell you that scenario doesn't look very good,"" he said.
So how much has all that Brexit worry cost Siemens so far?

""We haven't put a figure on what Brexit has cost us so far. But it is relatively small to what a Brexit is likely to cost, especially in a no deal scenario.""

258,By Business Insider,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 10:03AM ET</span>",JPMorgan identifies a 'catch-all trade' that will profit from the biggest issues confronting investors — including a trade war,"The  Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday wiped its 2018 gains on  trade-war jitters, but the same couldn't be said of the  Russell 2000.
This difference between the two indexes — of major companies and small-cap stocks — shows that smaller companies are benefitting more from the biggest issues on investors' minds, including trade, regulation, and inflation. The Russell 2000 has outperformed both the Dow and the S&P 500 to gain nearly 10% this year.
Foreseeing this, JPMorgan's equity strategists advised clients late last year to tilt portfolios toward companies that do much of their business in the US. By being overweight small-caps, the bank said, investors were poised to benefit from favorable growth policies in the US and stronger growth. After the  US announced its latest plan to escalate tariffs on Chinese goods, JPMorgan doubled down on its counsel.
""We continue to recommend small-caps as a 'catch-all trade' for its higher cyclical, reflation, and tax policy exposures, as well as lower sensitivity to ongoing risk,"" said Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's head of US equity strategy, in a note on Tuesday.
""Importantly, domestic companies are more insulated from trade headlines and USD volatility.""
Lakos-Bujas' recommendation for smaller domestic companies is pegged to the belief that stronger economic growth would benefit them more, even if it causes the inflation that some investors dread. Multinationals, he said, are exposed to negative economic revisions in the euro area and in emerging markets.
This year's tax cuts are another tailwind behind small-caps. Their effective tax rate fell to 22% from 32% in the first quarter, Lakos-Bujas said. That's almost double the benefit for large caps, where the effective rate is expected to fall to 21% from 27%, he said.
But small-cap companies don't have the all clear. From a technical standpoint, Lakos-Bujas said, the Russell 2000's outperformance over the S&P 500 is likely to slow down.
Also, sustained wage growth would hurt many of these smaller, labor-intensive companies, as would waning support for the Trump administration's economic agenda.
As it relates to trade, small-cap companies that import goods subject to tariffs could be hurt by rising costs, said Rich Sega, the global chief investment strategist at Conning, which has $122 billion in assets under management.
A trade war would also hurt companies that export products subject to Chinese import taxes.
""We'd rather not have it,"" Sega said. ""But it's not enough to offset the very strong current and, I think, potential future benefits of tax reform, regulatory reform, and fiscal stimulus."""

According to the  press release, the terms of the deal are similar to Disney's previous offer except that the new deal would allow 21st Century Fox shareholders to elect to receive cash or stock, subject to a 50/50 proration. Shareholders would receive the number of shares equating to a $38 price so long as Disney's stock is trading between $93.53 and $114.32 at the deal's close.
The increased offer comes one week after Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) crashed Disney's attempt to buy the assets with a  $65 billion bid, following the US Justice Department's approval of AT&T (NYSE:T)'s merger with Time Warner. Disney originally bid  $28 a share back in December.
""We are extremely proud of the businesses we have built at 21st Century Fox, and firmly believe that this combination with Disney will unlock even more value for shareholders as the new Disney continues to set the pace at a dynamic time for our industry,"" 21st Century Fox's executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, said in the  press release.
""We remain convinced that the combination of 21CF's iconic assets, brands and franchises with Disney's will create one of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world.""
The bidding war, however, may not be over just yet.
""Based on our merger models, we think bids from CMCSA or DIS could reach as high as $80 billion,"" John Janedis, an analyst at Jefferies, told clients in a recent note.

CANNES, France (Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) needs radical change to stay ahead of the digital revolution reshaping the industry and its clients, the man now steering the world's largest advertising group said. 
The once glamorous world of Madison Avenue has been forced to confront reality in recent years as the rapid growth of digital platforms opened the industry to new competition at a time when clients are questioning everything they spend. 
As the biggest holding company in the sector, WPP has been particularly hard hit, losing major contracts, almost 30 percent of its market value and in April, its founder and chief executive Martin Sorrell over a personal misconduct allegation.
Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing and the company has not divulged the nature of the complaint against him. 
The softly-spoken Mark Read, WPP's former digital boss, has been appointed to run the company of 200,000 employees as a joint chief operating officer in the short term, charged with reviewing its structure while keeping staff and clients onside.
""In five years time the business should look radically different but we can evolve ourselves there,"" he told Reuters at the annual Cannes Lions advertising festival where ad and tech companies go to meet the world's biggest marketing spenders.
The exit of the 73-year-old Sorrell came at a momentous time for the industry, as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) threaten to cut out middlemen ad agencies and as new challengers like consultants battle to win high-margin strategic and advisory work. 
Read says the world's biggest companies are not questioning the value of spending on their brand or message, rather they are changing how they target consumers in a world of mass, but fragmented, content.
""Just like us, clients realized that they needed to more radically examine their costs,"" he said. ""They're not demonstrating a lack of commitment in marketing or marketing spend, they're shifting it from what they used to do to what they want to do in the future. 
""In the same way, we need to position WPP to capture the spend of the future."" 
CHANGE IN THE AIR
Major clients have made clear they no longer want to work with multiple people across multiple agencies to secure market research, data analytics and public relations services, plus ads on multiple platforms. 
WPP's rivals Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP), IPG (N:IPG) and Dentsu have been less affected so far than the British-based company which owns more than 400 agencies, traditionally set up to compete with each other. 
Read, long seen as a successor to Sorrell after he wrote to him asking for a job in 1989, said he had spent recent weeks talking to colleagues and clients and said WPP would do better at incentivising one-time competitors to work together.
The scale of the challenge is huge, however. After ploughing billions of dollars into online advertising, major brands are now demanding more transparency on how their money is spent, and evidence on how it leads to a transaction. 
Clients, under pressure from the digital forces weighing on their own operations, are demanding greater efficiency, particularly consumer goods groups like  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and P&G that are served by WPP. 
""If you look at the production of content, clients don't want a 5 percent reduction in the cost, they want an 80 percent reduction,"" he said. 
""So it's about redirecting resources and sometimes that requires a more radical examination of your cost to take the legacy cost out and redirect it to the future.""
Read admits the company, present in 112 countries, is in a transition phase. He is working with fellow COO Andrew Scott to review the structure, but WPP is unlikely to embark on a major new strategy until the next CEO is in place.
Much of the talk at the annual industry event has been dominated by the travails at WPP and who should take over, with P&G's marketing boss Marc Pritchard and Verizon's Tim Armstrong also seen as candidates. 
The unexpected departure of Sorrell, the world's most famous advertising man who was rarely out of the headlines, has catapulted the 51-year-old father of two, Read, into the spotlight. 
He describes the last 10 weeks as ""eventful"" and says WPP now needs leadership.
Less showy than his former boss, Read thought for some seconds before saying he was enjoying the job, and that he didn't accept the view that traditional advertising was doomed. 

""It's a challenge,"" he said, on the terrace of one of the major hotels that look over the seafront, wearing shorts and a t-shirt. ""Running a company like WPP, to some extent you need to lead from the front, and I'm happy to lead.""

261,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 09:47AM ET</span>","Walt Disney raises bid for Fox assets to $71.3 billion, adds cash","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co raised its bid for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc assets to $71.3 billion on Wednesday, sweetening its offer with cash as it looks to scuttle Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's $65 billion offer last week.
The new cash-or-stock offer is also an incentive for Fox's largest shareholder, Rupert Murdoch, who owns 17 percent voting shares along with his family and would have been hit with a large capital gains tax bill under Comcast's all-cash offer. Disney's previous offer was all stock.
Disney's latest move raises the hurdle for Comcast, which now has to decide whether it is feasible to come back with a higher bid.
Disney and Comcast are battling to win Fox's movie and television studios at a time when legacy media and distribution companies are looking to expand to better compete with newer media firms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) that sell their content directly to viewers. 
Fox's international assets such as Star India appeal to both Disney and Comcast, which want to expand their global presence.
Disney's revised offer of $38 a share, which would be split 50-50 in cash and stock, is $10 higher than Disney's first bid in December 2017. Comcast's last bid was for $35 a share in cash. 
Disney will also take on about $13.8 billion of Fox's net debt, implying a total transaction value of about $85.1 billion.
Disney's latest offer is ""superior"" to the proposal made by Comcast, Fox said in a statement. Comcast declined to comment.
Fox shares jumped 6.3 percent to $47.52 in early trading, while Comcast was up 1 percent at $33.24. Shares of Disney rose 1.2 percent to $107.36.
Fox said it will postpone its special shareholders meeting in order to provide stockholders with an opportunity to evaluate Disney's amended offer.
Following the deal, Fox shareholders would own about 19 percent of the combined company, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said on a conference call.

Disney no longer expects to complete the $20 billion share repurchase it announced in December, McCarthy said.

263,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>","Equity Office embraces flexible workspace, adopts EQ Office name","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone's Equity Office, a large U.S. owner of office space, said on Wednesday it will offer flexible leasing and workspace in a deal with co-working operator Industrious that promises further ties if a joint effort in Los Angeles proves successful.
Chicago-based Equity Office also said it was adopting the name EQ Office as it embraces the growing popularity of flex workspace at the six-building Howard Hughes Center in West Los Angeles, which is under renovation.
Commercial real estate needs to respond to the consumer of a lease and not solely a company's leaders, EQ President and Chief Executive Lisa Picard told Reuters. 
""We are marketing to the talent,"" Picard said, referring to the industry belief that a better work site and amenities will attract the best personnel. Flexible workspace size and lease term are other important features.
""Not giving a tenant flexibility is costing us more money, so a tenant knows that,"" she said about traditional leasing. ""If they can get rid of flexibility, they can get a really inexpensive deal. If they want flexibility it costs them more.""
The deal highlights the growing acceptance of flexible workspace and represents a major change for EQ, a portfolio of 86 properties with more than 42 million square feet of Class A office space that is owned by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) real estate funds. 
The properties are new since Blackstone bought Equity Office for $39 billion in 2007 from real estate magnate Sam Zell.
The deal with Industrious was the result of a request for proposals that began soon after Picard took over EQ a year ago. Closely held Hines, another large property owner, also has sought a partner to gain experience in flexible workspace.
Picard's vision is different than other industry leaders, said Jamie Hodari, CEO and co-founder of Industrious, which operates more than 40 sites in 28 U.S. cities.
Commercial real estate is being forced to improve a tenant's experience within a broader trend of office space shrinking to well under 100 square feet per person, said Jesse Keenan, a professor at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design.
Increasing the user's experience is part of preventing workplaces from feeling like sardine cans, he said. 
""Technology is as much about remote working as it is about on-site experience. Companies increasingly utilize technology to optimize a balance between a core office, home office and satellite office,"" he said.

But don’t let your guard down, says Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel Nicolaus.
The S&P 500 will slide to 2,635 in the third quarter as analysts slash earnings estimates on trade tension escalation, a stronger dollar and speculation of faster monetary tightening, Bannister wrote in a note to clients released late Tuesday. That’s the level that last served as support in early May and represents roughly a 5 percent decline from the last close.
While the strategist expects the index to rebound in the final months to finish the year at 2,800, he reiterates his view that the nine-year bull market is at “a very late stage."" With valuations looking “bubbly” and bond yields going higher, the impetus to buy stocks will dissipate, and a bear market is likely less than two years away, he said.
“A decade of buy-the-dip is running out of gas,” Bannister said. “Psychological conditioning of investors implies a rapid S&P 500 decline when it arrives.”
Bannister is the latest Wall Street strategist sounding alarms on the market. Earlier this week,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) urged investors to go defensive while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) flagged a potential bubble in growth stocks.
Despite these caveats, stocks have barely budged since the February rout. Poised for its third monthly gain, the S&P 50O is up more than 3 percent this year.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - U.S. electric carmaker Tesla (O:TSLA) favors Germany as the location for its first European Gigafactory, its chief executive said, in what would be the latest move by an outside firm into the European battery market. 
Industry experts expect a green car revolution to boost Europe's battery market to around 250 billion euros ($290 billion) by 2025. Asian companies including CATL <300750.SZ> and Samsung (KS:006400) have already signed up companies or set up their own European operations, prompting European politicians and business leaders to call for more home-grown investment. 
""Germany is a leading choice for Europe. Perhaps on the German-French border makes sense, near the Benelux countries,"" Tesla's billionaire boss Elon Musk said on Twitter https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1009014824280342529on Tuesday, responding to a public tweet. 
Tesla already has operations in Pruem, Germany, which is only 30 kilometers from Belgium, and about 100 kilometers from the French border. 
Pruem is the headquarters for Tesla's Grohmann Engineering division, which specialises in automated manufacturing systems for battery making plants. Grohmann recently built a production line for Tesla's U.S. battery factory in Reno, Nevada, to speed up production for its Model 3 electric sedan.
In a sign of the strength of Asia's position in the market, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) - Europe's biggest carmaker - recently picked LG Chem (KS:051910), Samsung and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) to deliver $25 billion of batteries.
CATL is also considering an investment in Germany, the economics ministry of the local state of Thuringia told Reuters. “We are negotiating with Chinese battery manufacturer CATL about localizing production in Thuringia. As far as we know several locations across Europe are being considered for such an investment,” a spokesman for Thuringia said.
Germany's TerraE and Sweden's Northvolt have plans for large lithium-ion battery factories in Europe, but face a battle against companies like Tesla and CATL that have established technical expertise and supply chains. 
Northvolt, founded by a former Tesla executive, recently said it would tap the European Investment Bank for a loan to fund the first leg of construction and also cut the estimated cost of building its Tesla-style factory.
Tesla has previously said it plans to build three more Gigafactories to accompany its first in Nevada, United States. That plant is jointly owned by Panasonic, which is exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla's mass-market Model 3 sedan.
It was not immediately clear if Tesla would build the European plant with Panasonic.
Reuters did not immediately get a response from Tesla's German media team seeking further comment on Musk's tweet.

Tesla has faced challenges ramping up Model 3 production, forcing it in recent days to announce plans to cut several thousand jobs to help reduce costs.

267,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 08:38AM ET</span>","After surrendering CSeries, Bombardier pushes regional plane revival","By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - As Bombardier (TO:BBDb) surrenders hopes of securing a top spot in commercial aviation with the sale of its money-losing CSeries jet program to Airbus (PA:AIR), the Canadian company is now drawing up plans to breathe new life into its older regional planes.
Bombardier is shoring up its loss-making regional jets and turboprops with a mixture of hard-sell, cost-cutting and outsourcing. It is also growing its line of business jets after a cash squeeze and production delays forced it to cede a majority stake in its high-tech CSeries which aims to break into the market for mainline jets dominated by Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA). 
The company will now ""sharpen the focus"" on its remaining commercial planes, with Bombardier Commercial Aircraft President Fred Cromer recently expanding the leadership team for the division which has combined orders in hand for just for over 100 planes, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
Bombardier also plans to showcase its CRJ regional jets, which recently had a cabin upgrade with more overhead bin space to appeal to business travelers, at the industry's flagship Farnborough Air Show in July, an event it previously used to market the CSeries, two sources familiar with the company's thinking said. 
The company's regional jet initiative won a boost from Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), which on Wednesday announced orders for 20 CRJ 900s with the new interiors, valued at around $961 million by list prices, as it and other U.S. carriers replace aging 50 and 70-seat planes with new regional jets. 
According to the memo and sources familiar with the situation, the company is now moving forward with a plan to lower its regional Q400 turboprop's costs by outsourcing its wings and cockpit from Toronto to lower cost countries, although specific locations were not named. 
In 2016, Bombardier expected to move the cockpit to China and the wings to Mexico with the union's agreement, but Bombardier failed to carry it out because the program's volumes were previously too low, both sources said.
Bombardier said in the memo it also aims to reap more profits by promoting aftermarket services for its over 2,000 regional planes already in the air, which is part of a broader strategy the company is using for its business jets. 
In a sign that Bombardier will push harder on servicing existing planes, the company plans to hire a separate executive to head customer service for its regional planes, a position currently filled by the same person who heads the Q400 program, the second source said.
All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Bombardier's private strategies.
HEADWINDS
For Bombardier, the challenge is to erase losses and generating $1.5 billion in revenues by 2020. But the turnaround strategy faces headwinds.
Bombardier's efforts to revive regional plane sales, which it sees as a $240 billion market between 2017 and 2036, come as some forecasters are expecting limited near-term sector growth.
""Demand for regional aircraft will remain weak relative to large commercial aircraft,"" said Moody's in a recent note. It predicted that regional aircraft deliveries, including the CSeries, would grow by over 4 percent in 12-to-18 months, compared with an 8-to-10 percent rise in larger aircraft. The 110-130-seat CSeries overlap regional and mainline passenger jet markets.
Bombardier is also tasked with winning orders for its regional Q400 turboprop, which sources say the company considered selling. The plane holds barely a quarter of a market that is dominated by ATR, a prop-making joint venture between Airbus and Italian group Leonardo. 
Such a disparity in sales can turn into a nightmare for the losing planemaker as its adversary benefits from higher volumes to bring down unit costs, which in turn help it sell more.
Bombardier's Cromer has appointed an executive to pursue its plan to outsource the Q400's cockpit and wings from Toronto, which would make the prop more competitive with lower-cost ATR, the memo said. 
""We've got a backlog now so that allows us to evaluate all the outsourcing possibilities,"" the source said.
The Q400 will continue to be produced at a plant in Canada's largest city Toronto, which was recently sold by Bombardier but remains under lease for 3 to 5 years, until a new site can be located.
Bombardier said in a statement that is ""constantly looking at strategic options for all our businesses.""
The company will also step up marketing campaigns in India and Africa, aiming to persuade airlines to pick the longer-range Q400s to connect cities with secondary destinations which either do not have service or are served by jets that have higher operating costs. 
India has emerged as a fast-growing market for turboprops, benefiting both ATR and Bombardier, which won its largest single order to date for the planes last year from Indian low cost carrier SpiceJet.
Promoting the Q400 for underserved markets in Africa also helped win a recent order from Ethiopian Airlines..
But the African market also has risks, with Angola's president recently telling Euronews that a domestic airline startup was a ""fictitious company,"" casting doubt on its order of 6 Q400s.

Delta Air Lines will be the first major airline to use Bombardier's revamped CRJ planes with cabins that have bigger overhead storage bins, wider aisles and mood lighting. 
The Montreal-based planemaker has been investing in its CRJ planes, after it acknowledged that the line had been neglected as it focused more on its C-Series program. 
Late last year, Bombardier agreed to sell Airbus a 50.01 percent stake in its C-Series flagship commercial jet for a token fee of one Canadian dollar, after sluggish sales and low production rates pushed the program well over budget.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks steadied near three-week lows on Wednesday and Chinese markets bounced after recent sharp falls as expectations grew that policy stimulus by Beijing could temper some of the impact from an escalating Sino-U.S. trade conflict.
The dollar too eased off 11-month highs against a currency basket (DXY), Wall Street looked set for a stronger opening and MSCI's all-country equity index snapped a five-day run of losses, rising 0.3 percent (MIWD00000PUS).
Its rebound was fueled by a bounce of almost 1 percent in MSCI's non-Japan Asian shares off 6-1/2-month lows (MIAPJ0000PUS), following gains in Hong Kong, Seoul and mainland Chinese indexes (HSI) (KS11) (CSI300). 
Assets perceived to be safe, such as the yen, Swiss franc and government bonds of Germany and the United States, took a step back after hefty recent rallies. 
""I suspect safe-havens such as Bunds and Treasuries could be put to the test as risk sentiment shows signs of stabilizing,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Rainer Guntermann said. 
One catalyst was the expectation, fueled by a Chinese central bank paper, of cuts to banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) to boost market liquidity and loosen monetary conditions. China's cabinet on Wednesday pledged to use ""targeted RRR cuts"", with cuts now seen as a matter of time.
After lending financial institutions 200 billion yuan ($31 billion) on Tuesday, it soothed markets further by fixing the yuan rate higher against the dollar, after the currency posted its biggest daily fall in 1-1/2 years .
But worries about a fully fledged trade war between the two biggest world economies remain. Washington is threatening tariffs on $200 billion more of Chinese goods and a White House trade adviser said Beijing was underestimating President Donald Trump's resolve to impose more tariffs.
Tit-for-tat tariffs would hit world growth, company profits and price stability at a time when several big central banks, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve, are in policy tightening mode.
The Asian gains encouraged European bourses to open higher, with a pan-European index up 0.6 percent after slumping on Tuesday to two-month lows (STOXX). European auto shares, a sector highly vulnerable to U.S. tariffs, also rose 0.2 percent (SXAP) though it has lost 2 percent this week.
Equity futures for New York's S&P500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones indexes rose as much as half a percent (ESc1) (NQc1) . 
""At the end of the day, all these circumstances, including trade wars, have been in play for a while, and the market reacts sharply from time to time,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
But Savary cautioned against pushing the equity rally too far: ""The framework is set: there is monetary policy tightening, less liquidity, more geopolitical uncertainty and an economic situation which in Europe at least we need to be more cautious about.""
SIGHTS ON CENTRAL BANKS
The slightly improved mood lifted yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) above 2.9022 percent, just off 2-1/2-week lows around 2.88 percent. German yields also inched marginally higher (DE10YT=RR).
Euro zone yields were pushed lower this week on the back of trade tensions, as well as slowing growth momentum across the bloc and a central bank that has pushed back the timing of its first interest rate rise in this cycle by several months.
That has also hit the euro, which slipped 0.25 percent to the dollar, staying near two-week lows of $1.1528 hit after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi called for a patient approach to monetary policy (EUR=EBS).
Draghi spoke at a banking forum in Sintra, Portugal, where he is due to appear again on Wednesday alongside Fed chair Jerome Powell, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe.
Britain's pound struggled near a seven-month low of $1.3151  ahead of a crucial vote in parliament over the country's European Union withdrawal process. 
As the dollar's rally stalled, emerging currencies such as the Mexican peso  and South African rand  won some reprieve. But ING analysts told clients that ""with the risk to trade firmly in place, we don't look for a material and long lasting rebound in higher beta and emerging market currencies"".
An early rebound in crude and copper also faded, though Brent futures managed to stay above $75 a barrel before a meeting of the OPEC producers group. OPEC member Iran has said a deal to raise oil output is unlikely.
While most metals prices bounced, copper slipped back to three-week lows after data showed supply remained abundant. U.S. soybean futures managed only a 0.3 percent rise from decade-lows hit on fears of Chinese import tariffs .

277,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",Banco BPM ready to sell debt recovery business: CEO says,"ROME (Reuters) - Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) is ready to sell its debt collection business if potential buyers are willing to take on almost all of its remaining bad loans, its chief executive said on Wednesday.
Italy's third largest bank, created last year from the merger of  Banco Popolare  and Banca Popolare di Milano, has lagged bigger rivals in reducing its bad debts. But expectations of a faster clean-up lifted its shares this week.
Banco BPM is selling a last batch of 3.5 billion euros in bad loans earmarked for sale, but has the option of shedding a much bigger amount and cushion the hit on its capital with the sale of its debt collection business.
Speaking on the sidelines of banking meeting in Rome, CEO Giuseppe Castagna said it would make little sense for the bank to hold onto its debt collection business if it could offload almost all of its remaining bad loans, worth around 10 billion euros.
Banco BPM has invited bids for 3.5-10 billion euros in bad loans and, potentially, the collection business. Castagna said preliminary expressions of interest were due in early July but added it would be a lengthy process.
Sources have told Reuters the business has attracted a lot of interest as such assets are rare, with one source saying bids would likely be towards the top of the range.
On Tuesday, Banco BPM approved selling the riskier notes in a 5 billion euro bad loan securitization to U.S. fund Christofferson Robb & Company, reducing its gross soured loans to 16.6 percent of total lending from 20.5 percent.
Castagna, referring to Tuesday's deal, said the price could have been even better if Italy had not experienced a bout of market turbulence driven by concerns over its new government.
Making use of a state guarantee scheme which helps banks sell bad debts at higher prices, Banco BPM offloaded the 5 billion euros in bad loans via the securitization at 34.3 percent of their nominal value, a much higher price than a market average of around 20 percent.
The bank said on Tuesday it was one of the highest prices achieved in Italy for this kind of deal, but Castagna added that it could have been as high as 35 percent before the recent market turmoil.
Italy's borrowing costs have been driven higher by concerns that the new government could boost public spending. Rising bond yields increasing financing costs for investors, raising concerns of a slowdown in bad loan sales which are crucial for banks and the wider economy.
Investors in bad debts have said there is still a lot of interest in Italy's problem bank loans, but buyers are watchful of the government's policy moves and could use the market turmoil as an argument to try to talk down prices.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union regulators on Wednesday ordered Luxembourg to recover 120 million euros ($138.8 million) from French utility Engie, the latest move in an EU crackdown on tax deals which give some firms an unfair advantage.
This is the European Commission's third ruling against Luxembourg's tax deals with multinationals, and the sixth against European Union countries also including Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Reuters reported on June 14 that the EU antitrust enforcer would rule against the Engie tax arrangement, consisting of a complex financial structure that treated the same transaction both as debt, which can be deducted from a tax bill, and equity, which is not subject to tax.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the arrangement artificially reduced Engie's tax burden.
""As a result, Engie paid an effective corporate tax rate of 0.3 percent on certain profits in Luxembourg for about a decade. This selective tax treatment is illegal,"" she said in a statement.
The Commission said the Luxembourg tax rulings enabled Engie to avoid paying any tax on 99 percent of the profits generated by two Luxembourg-based entities, Engie LNG Supply and Engie Treasury Management.
Engie declined to comment. Luxembourg said it had cooperated fully with the Commission, shared its objective of fighting harmful tax avoidance and had taken initiatives designed to prevent situations such as those mentioned by the Commission.
Luxembourg said Engie had been taxed in accordance with tax rules applicable at the relevant time, without selective treatment, which it said meant Engie had not received illegal state aid.
Critics say the Commission is over-reaching its power by using state aid rules against deals agreed according to international tax rules.
The EU tax avoidance clampdown has resulted in a record demand for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to pay back taxes of up to 13 billion euros to Ireland, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 250 million euros to Luxembourg, Fiat 20-30 million euros to Luxembourg and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) the same amount to the Netherlands.
Thirty-five multinationals including AB InBev and BASF have also been told to pay back a total of 700 million euros to Belgium.
Vestager's decision comes ahead of a Thursday hearing at Europe's second-highest court where Fiat and Luxembourg will challenge her findings. This kicks off a series of appeals by the targeted companies and countries in the coming months. The Starbucks hearing is scheduled for July 2.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","Major Chinese lenders made illegal loans, Beijing's audit office says","BEIJING (Reuters) - Three of China's largest lenders have made illegal loans to polluting industries and the property sector, and have exacerbated local government debt through loans to local financing vehicles, the National Audit Office said on Wednesday.
Violations by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (HK:1398) (SS:601398), Agricultural Bank of China Ltd (AgBank) (HK:1288) (SS:601288), and China CITIC Group Co., Ltd included providing loans, discounted bills and gold leases to unqualified companies, the audit authority said in a statement posted on its website.
They were also found to invest funds from their wealth management products into banks' non-public issuance of preferred shares through the use of trust and other channels, among other illegal shadow banking activities, it said.
Based on the authority's statement, the banks themselves apparently were not punished. More than 1,500 people at the lenders were fined or received administrative punishment that could include demotions and pay cuts, it said.
The lenders have corrected most of their problems, the audit office added.
The authority said it carried out an audit between July and September 2017 of the lenders' 2016 assets and liabilities.
The office said it found the three lenders lacked accurate asset classification in credit risk management, and excessively lent to certain industries. Some loans or investment projects by those banks were at credit risk, but the office did not give details.
Lenders also inflated their size of deposits and reported ""incorrect"" loan figures to small and medium-sized companies, it added.
China is in its third year of a financial crackdown on shadow banking, looking to close loopholes in its financial system as debt risks mounted.

In a separate statement on Wednesday, the audit office said that it had uncovered illegal fund raising by five local and three regional governments, but it maintained debt risks were being effectively controlled.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said on Wednesday he plans to devote the bulk of his time to hunt for technology investments around the world, as part of a major shift in focus at the Japanese tech and telecoms conglomerate.
""I have spent 97 percent of my time on managing the telecoms business and only 3 percent on investing,"" Son said. Reversing that balance will allow SoftBank to grow faster, he said. 
The comments, made to investors at the group's annual general meeting, came as shareholders approved the appointment of three executive vice-presidents - SoftBank unit Sprint Corp's former chief executive, Marcelo Claure, and former bankers Katsunori Sago and Rajeev Misra. 
Son's comments fit with a transformation underway at SoftBank from a domestic telecoms firm to ""unicorn hunter"" - as Son termed it - focusing on late-stage startups around the world.
SoftBank and its investment vehicle Vision Fund, which raised over $93 billion last year, have stormed the world of dealmaking, buying up stakes in disruptive tech companies such as shared-office space firm WeWork and ride-hailing rivals Uber Technologies Inc, Didi Chuxing, Ola and Grab.
Bolivian-born billionaire Claure was appointed SoftBank's chief operating officer in May, tasked with driving cooperation between the group's portfolio companies. Former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive Sago became chief strategy officer on Wednesday and will focus on group investment. Misra runs the Vision Fund.
Son also bemoaned the so-called conglomerate discount weighing on SoftBank's shares. He said when the market value of stakes the firm holds in companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) are taken into account, SoftBank's shares should be trading above 14,000 yen, rather than around 8,000 yen currently.
The perceived undervaluation has led the businessman to consider a management buyout in the past, Son said. The planned listing of SoftBank's domestic telecoms unit should help clarify the value of the group's component parts, he said.
There were few signs of shareholder scepticism at the meeting, with questions fielded by Son including a request to shake his hand and whether he had thought of becoming prime minister.
SoftBank's shares have fallen around 7 percent this year. Thomson Reuters data showed 14 of 15 had ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" recommendations on the stock.
A note of caution came from outside director and chief executive of Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co Ltd Tadashi Yanai.
""I'm always watching with butterflies in my stomach,"" he said, before urging shareholders to ""not feel at ease"".

""Butterflies in the stomach are part of the joys of youth,"" Son quipped back.

Linde and Praxair are pursuing talks to sell their European business lines to Japan's Taiyo Nippon Sanso for about $4.4 billion and have chosen Carlyle for the divestiture in the United States, potentially worth about $3.3 billion, the sources said.
They asked not to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The sources added that both deals are not yet final and could still fall apart. Those who were outbid have been given the opportunity to improve their offers in case talks with Carlyle and Taiyo collapse, two sources said.
Price is not the only discussion point.
As Reuters reported earlier this month, the sellers specifically sought strategic buyers for Praxair's European operations to help win approval by antitrust regulators.
The European Commission, which decides on antitrust approval, typically prefers peer-to-peer mergers that create more globally competitive businesses.

A combined Linde and Praxair would have the size to overtake France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) in the supply of gases such as oxygen and helium to industries worldwide.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>","Chinese investment in U.S. falls amid asset sales, tighter scrutiny: Rhodium","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Investment from China in the United States slumped in the first five months of the year as Washington intensified its scrutiny of Chinese projects and Beijing pressured big-spending firms to sell assets as part of its campaign to reduce debt risks.
According to data compiled by the New York-based Rhodium Group, Chinese net direct investment into the United States was negative by some $7.8 billion as of the end of May.
Chinese companies invested only $1.8 billion in greenfield projects and acquisitions in the United States between January and May, a drop of 92 percent from the same period in 2017, the Rhodium Group said on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Chinese investors in America completed $9.6 billion worth of divestitures, with another $4 billion of sales pending, it said.
The drop in investment so far this year follows a steep fall last year as the Chinese government cracked down on bubbly outbound investment and Washington cranked up its scrutiny of Chinese acquisitions while adopting a more confrontational stance toward China.
Many of the Chinese companies that led a boom in investment in 2015-2016 - including HNA, Dalian Wanda and Anbang - ""are now being forced to divest their overseas holdings by a broader financial tightening in China that is limiting the rollover of debt financing as well as specific regulatory action to reduce the leverage of systemically important private conglomerates.""
HNA sold off several of its U.S. assets, including office buildings in New York and San Francisco and its stake in Hilton Worldwide.
A number of transactions, including Ant Financial's proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of Moneygram and HNA's $200 million investment in Skybridge Capital, were killed by the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, in the first half of the year.
Rhodium also noted in the report upcoming new legislation that will enhance the scope of CFIUS scrutiny would raise hurdles for other types of investments such as venture capital.
The outlook for Chinese foreign direct investment in the United States was bleak, but there could be a silver lining in the brewing trade war between the two countries, it said.
""The volume and value of newly announced transactions suggest that Chinese investment levels in the U.S. will remain low in coming months,"" Rhodium said, adding that the pipeline was thin.

While U.S. policies could present ""substantial headwinds"", it said greenfield FDI could accelerate ""if new tariffs incentivize Chinese manufacturers to localize production in the U.S. to 'hop the tariff wall'.""

290,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",Toyota captures data goldmine in $1 billion Grab bet,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Aradhana Aravindan
TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - By pumping $1 billion into ride-hailing firm Grab, Toyota Motor Corp stands to gain a passenger-side view of tens of thousands of cars across Southeast Asia, tracking how fast they drive, how far they travel and the time they spend stuck in traffic.
The Japanese automaker said it aims to install its TransLog driving recorder devices into Grab's fleet of lease cars to access the data on driving patterns that will be crucial to its push into the nascent mobility-as-a-service industry.
""Only ride-hailing companies have good, extensive data on usage, so automakers want to be connected with that,"" said Egil Juliussen, director of research for automotive infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems at IHS Markit.
Grab already monitors driving behavior through its app to increase ride safety, sending emails about speed and braking, for instance, to its drivers, such as Singapore's Rennu Mahajan.
""With this system, it keeps me in check,"" said Mahajan, 57.
It will get even more vehicle data with Toyota, which has been harvesting data through TransLog since 2016 in sales and trials with taxi firms and car-hailing operators including Grab. The data gives Toyota insight into fleet management as it develops services including futuristic concepts such as pay-per-use mobile restaurants.
The latest deal, announced last week, gives Toyota access to a single pool of vehicles which potentially eclipses all others. That will allow it to capture a volume of data that would be difficult to collect from private cars which are only used for under 5 percent of any given day, often on routine commutes.
In return, Grab will be able to expand services such as food delivery and digital payments using Toyota's $1 billion investment - the biggest by a traditional automaker in a ride-sharing app maker.
The deal reflects how automakers are clamoring for access to ride-hailing firms' extensive user bases through a spate of partnerships, as they compete with technology companies to develop autonomous cars and next-generation transport services.
Toyota's vision of such services includes convoys of shuttle bus-sized, self-driving multi-purpose vehicles used, for instance, as pay-per-use mobile restaurants and hotels, which the automaker plans to develop and customize for retail customers.
""There's data about the car, and then there's also data about the service - how many customers drivers have, what's the average mileage, where the rides are concentrated,"" said Juliussen. ""Having that picture in all the major (Southeast Asian) cities, that becomes very valuable.""
Toyota and Grab will be able to use the data for possible collaboration on data-driven services such as vehicle diagnostics and customized insurance plans based on driver usage.
The data will also help Grab maintain efficiency in fleet maintenance as it expands deeper into Southeast Asia where it operates in over 200 cities. It has said it wants build the region's largest car rental fleet by the fourth quarter of 2018.
""Vehicle maintenance costs, insurance costs, these are bread-and-butter issues for ride-hailing drivers,"" said Chua Kee Lock, chief executive of Vertex Venture Holdings in Singapore, an early Grab investor.
Industry experts said Toyota could expand its data service to more mobility firms such as Didi Chuxing, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with which it has separate partnerships.

""This partnership with Toyota will keep Grab's platform 'sticky' and give drivers less incentive to switch to competitors,"" said Chua. ""This is Grab's edge over the long-run.""

291,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 04:59AM ET</span>",Fox to craft script for M&A summer blockbuster,"By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (O:FOXA) board is set to decide on Wednesday whether to entertain Comcast Corp's (O:CMCSA) $65 billion cash bid for the New York-based media company or stick with its roughly $52 billion all-stock offer from Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), people familiar with the matter said. 
Disney and Comcast are battling to win Fox's movie and television studios at a time when legacy media and distribution companies are looking to expand to better compete with younger media firms like Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) that sell their content directly to viewers. Fox’s international assets such as Star India appeal to both Disney and Comcast, which want to expand their global presence.
While Fox's board has yet to make a decision, analysts and industry dealmakers widely expect Fox to say that Comcast's bid could potentially lead to a better deal for its shareholders. If it does, Fox would then be allowed to negotiate with Comcast and take a closer look at its offer. This would be the time for Fox to learn more about Comcast's commitments when it comes to regulatory approval, for example. 
""Let the ping-pong tournament begin, as Comcast won’t let Fox brush off its all-cash premium offer without a fight,"" Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said in a research note last week.
Once Fox engages in talks with Comcast, it will then have to determine if the offer is definitively a superior deal for Fox shareholders, compared with its agreement with Disney. This will be the first step that could lead to a bidding war as Disney will then have five business days to put a revised offer on the table, according to its merger agreement. 
Disney could sweeten its all-stock bid with cash, given its strong balance sheet and the potential boost to earnings per share, according to the people familiar with the matter. 
Technically, Fox could also rebuff Comcast's bid on Wednesday, but that is unlikely, said Morningstar analyst Allan Nichols. 
""Because of the liabilities of the board I don't think they can outright say no to Comcast's offer. You at least need to do some kind of review process,"" he said. 
TAX, ANTITRUST CONCERNS
In its review, Fox will need to decide whether Comcast's richer, all-cash offer is enough to offset the antitrust risk and potentially higher tax liabilities for some of its shareholders, analysts said. 
A U.S. court's recent approval of AT&T Inc's (N:T) merger with  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX)  raised the likelihood that Comcast's similar proposed deal with Fox would get the green light from regulators, they said. 
However, there are still concerns that some aspects of the proposed deal could complicate an antitrust review, they added. 
Craig Moffett, an analyst at Moffett Nathanson, said that the Justice Department never addressed the question of whether internet providers such as Comcast could give an advantage to its own content at the expense of competitors. 
For example, Comcast could give its internet subscribers easier or faster access to content from Hulu, which it would gain control over by buying Fox, than that of other media streaming services, the analysts said. 
If an all-cash bid does eventually beat a stock offer, it could have a bigger tax hit on Rupert Murdoch, Fox's largest shareholder, who controls 17 percent of the company's voting shares along with his family.
Reuters previously reported before the details of Comcast's offer were made public that the financial impact on Murdoch would be big enough for him to prefer an all-stock transaction, which would be nontaxable for all Fox shareholders.
That potentially puts Murdoch, who remains the most powerful voice inside the company, at odds with some Fox shareholders who would be open to abandoning the Disney deal if Comcast's cash offer was high enough.

298,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2018 03:21AM ET</span>",Pets At Home bets on vets to break curse of British retail,"By Alasdair Pal
LONDON (Reuters) - Toys R Us. Maplin. Mothercare.  Carpetright . House of Fraser. Poundworld.
The list of casualties on the British high street seems to grow by the week, forcing survivors to seek new strategies to weather the onslaught from online rivals like Amazon (O:AMZN).
For Pets At Home (L:PETSP), struggling in its traditional business of selling dog and cat food, the game plan is an increasing drive into the higher-margin area of veterinary practices. 
The company reported falling profits in late May, sinking its shares to an all-time low, but its in-store vet business was a rare bright spot, with revenues rising 16 percent. 
It is now placing its bets on vets. 
It told Reuters it plans to double the number of practices it operates – mainly 50-50 joint venture partnerships with vets – to 1,000 over the next decade. 
The company will invest 20 million pounds ($26 million) next year alone in its vets business, which has a core profit margin of about 34 percent compared with its retail division's 14 percent.
Pets At Home is not one of the bigger British retail players, with a market value of about 830 million pounds. Yet its toils and tactics tell a wider story about how companies across the sector are being forced to rethink business models to plot courses out of the gloom. 
Its push also reflects a global boom in high-margin pet services such as vets, grooming and premium accessories like toys and bedding. U.S. consumer spending on such services is growing at double-digit percentage rates, driving a surge in deal-making in the area. 
Consumer giant Mars's pet-care division is now larger than its traditional confectionary business, for example, after a string of acquisitions including two announced in the last week, for British firm Linnaeus and European chain AniCura. 
COLLAPSE AND CALAMITY
Britain's high-street retailers have had a torrid 2018. 
As well as online competition, they have been hit by weak consumer sentiment and currency swings due to the Brexit vote. Maplin and Toys R Us collapsed in February, while Poundworld went into administration last week and Mothercare (L:MTC), Carpetright (L:CPRC) and House of Fraser are shutting stores in restructuring plans.
Pets At Home is looking to elude such a fate, yet its vet expansion plans carry significant risks. 
The company's revenue from the vets practices - which make up about a third of group operating profit - comes entirely from the franchise fee it charges its joint venture partners, calculated as 17-18 percent of sales. However many of the practices are struggling to turn a profit - suggesting the model could be unsustainable unless business picks up.
A Reuters review of the accounts of more than 200 of the joint ventures found three-quarters them are loss-making. 
Pets At Home declined to comment on the size of the losses of the underlying joint ventures, but said the group expected each practice to break even after four to five years of trading.
""It takes time for a veterinary practice to develop and reach maturity. We have a lot of young practices, more than half are under four years old,"" a spokeswoman said, adding that 87 of its 461 practices were profitable and debt-free. 
To view a graphic on Many Pets At Home vet joint ventures still lossmaking, click: https://reut.rs/2y4LfGF
The company also faces increasing competition from chains include private equity-backed Independent Vetcare and CVS (L:CVSG), as well as a shortage of vets and veterinary nurses in Britain that could hamper the expansion plans.
""There are a lot of questions out there in terms of the sheer number of practices,"" said Mark Hedberg, a vet and joint venture partner in the southern England town of St Neots. ""In the last three to four years it has increased massively. It is hard to find veterinary staff to staff all these expansions."" 
Two other joint venture partners told Reuters they were also finding it difficult to staff their businesses. 
""It is very competitive, especially because the other corporates are in the market,"" said Laszlo Novak, a joint venture partner in Linlithgow, near Edinburgh. ""There is a huge pressure.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average rose in volatile trade on Wednesday, helped by late short-covering following an earlier selloff and a broader recovery in regional sentiment as Chinese shares recovered from a rout in the previous session.
Like other markets, Tokyo-listed stocks were knocked heavily on Tuesday as the tit-for-tat trade dispute between China and the United States escalated, with Japanese firms reliant on Chinese demand hit particularly hard.
The Nikkei (N225) ended 1.2 percent higher at 22,555.43 after dipping into negative territory earlier in the day, while the broader Topix (TOPX) advanced 0.5 percent to 1,752.75.
The Nikkei's outperformance led the ratio of Nikkei versus Topix, the so-called NT ratio, <.NTIDX> to 12.87, the highest level since August 2016.
The intensifying U.S.-China trade dispute has kept investors risk-averse after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on another $200 billion of Chinese goods and Beijing warned it would retaliate.
However, in late trade in Asia, China's blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) gained 0.6 percent, and the Shenzhen Composite Index (SZSC) rose 1.4 percent, which triggered short-covering in Japanese shares.
Analysts said investors had been monitoring Chinese market moves, and were relieved that China stocks seemed to be taking global trade tensions in their stride, if only temporarily.
""Investors confirmed Chinese markets' resilience, and covered their short positions by buying futures,"" said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.
Large cap stocks such as Fast Retailing (T:9983) and SoftBank (T:9984) soared 3.5 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively.
Selling in machine tool makers, which rely on China's capital expenditure, ran its course, and ended higher after investors bought back. 
Okuma Corp (T:6103) rose 2.4 percent after dropping to a nine-month low in early trade, DMG Mori (T:6141) gained 1.3 percent after hitting the lowest since February 2017.
Shipping stocks <.ISHIP.T> stumbled 1.0 percent and were the second-worst sectoral performer after weaker metal prices stoked concerns for falling demand.
Mitsui OSK Lines (T:9104) fell 2.1 percent, while Kawasaki Kisen (T:9107) shed 0.4 percent.
Meanwhile, soy sauce maker Kikkoman (T:2801) soared 3.1 percent after soybeans came under pressure.
Other food processors and beverage drinkmakers also bucked the weaker trend, with Ajinomoto (T:2802) advancing 1.4 percent and Kirin Holdings (T:2503) soaring 3.3 percent.

Drugmakers attracted buyers, with Daiichi Sankyo (T:4568) surging 5.2 percent and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma (T:4506) gaining 2.3 percent.

Dmitri Wiederschain, head of Sanofi's immuno-oncology research, acknowledged the company had failed to capitalize on the takeoff of immunotherapy - drugs that activate the body's immune system to attack tumor cells - in the early 2010s. 
But he said the group could now gain an edge in the next waves of immunotherapy treatments, which include combining different drugs to better target cancer.
""It is of course a very competitive space but we now have 'foundation assets' to form a better rationale for combinations,"" he told Reuters in an interview, citing immunotherapy approaches known as PD-1, TGFBeta and the antibody CD38. 
""If you look across the biopharmaceutical landscape, Sanofi is the only company which has all three assets in its own pipeline or partnered with Regeneron,"" Wiederschain said. Sanofi teamed with U.S firm Regeneron in 2007 to increase its presence in biotech medicine. 
Immunotherapy is the fastest-growing part of the cancer drug segment, with sales expected to top $25 billion-a-year by 2021, according to analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters.
Frederic Ponchon, a manager at Sycomore Asset Management which holds 6.7 million Sanofi shares, said the French company was unlikely to rival cancer leaders like Switzerland's Roche and U.S. firm Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co soon.
""They could enjoy occasional breakthroughs but it won't carry a lot of weight in their overall sales,"" he said. 
""We can see that Sanofi takes cancer seriously but you must remember R&D cycles are very long. So I would say Sanofi won't be a great player in oncology but it may have some successes from time to time."" 
Sanofi's main business areas include drugs for diabetes, heart diseases and vaccines, with cancer treatments making up only about 4 percent of sales. Its cancer drug sales totaled $1.7 billion last year, compared with Roche's $25.9 billion.
CROWDED MARKET
Sanofi has not always been behind the curve in oncology; in the 1990s, it produced top-selling cancer drugs such as Taxotere and Eloxatin. 
However it has been seven years since the company launched its last one, Zaltrap, which targets metastatic colorectal cancer and had sales of 75 million euros ($87 million) last year.
In the meantime, companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co have developed their immunotherapy blockbusters. New treatments, if successful, can fetch more than $100,000 a year.
In Sanofi's current cancer pipeline, only one has made it to regulatory review in the United States and the European Union: immunotherapy agent cemiplimab to treat cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Regeneron is its partner on the project. 
The company expects to submit for U.S. regulatory review another of its cancer candidates, isatuximab, to treat multiple myeloma later this year or in early 2019. 
With over 2,000 drugs in the cancer immunotherapy space, the competitive landscape has never been more crowded as each firm seeks its own proprietary version of often similar drugs.
""There is clearly huge market potential but also a very large number of players, it is the toughest issue here,"" Nicolas Baudouin, a director at ratings agency Standard & Poor's said of immunotherapy.
Many of the immunotherapy drugs work in only a minority of patients, which companies hope to improve by combining drugs that target tumors in different ways.
This area, where Sanofi says it can be successful, has proven a challenge for drugmakers so far. Earlier this year, a study showed an experimental drug developed by U.S Incyte had failed to bolster the effectiveness of Merck's blockbuster Keytruda to treat skin cancer patients.
Roche also failed a key combination trial last month in colorectal cancer.
ACQUISITIONS
Wiederschain said molecular oncology, which targets a tumor based on its genetic makeup, would also be a future differentiator.
""It is about understanding better what drives the growth of cancer tissues, how the cells works and proliferation in the body.""
This has led Sanofi to launch early-stage trials in breast cancer using molecular oncology technology.
Newly appointed research chief Reed will start the job on July 1, when industry veteran Elias Zerhouni retires. 
Under Zerhouni's leadership, Sanofi has tried to improve research and development productivity but still struggled to find enough new products to offset the impact of weak diabetes drug sales. 
It has also been looking to acquisitions to fill its pipeline. 

It struck two big deals in January, agreeing to buy U.S haemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and Belgium's Ablynx, which is developing an experimental drug for a rare blood disorder, for 3.9 billion euros.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares of China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) rose as much as 18 percent in Hong Kong on Wednesday as the impact of a U.S. Senate bill that threatens to restore penalties on the company became clearer.
In clarification announcements during the noon trading break, ZTE said a National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed by the U.S. Senate on Monday would restore penalties on the company, but the bill would only become law if it could be reconciled with a different version passed by the House of Representatives and signed by U.S. President Trump.
That echoed what the White House and Senate backers of the bill had said overnight.
In a rare departure from White House policy, the Republican-led Senate passed the NDAA on Monday that included two provisions that prevent any federal official from removing penalties on ZTE.
That sets up a battle with the White House over whether a supplier ban on the Chinese company could be lifted as part of a $1.4 billion settlement agreement ZTE reached with the U.S. Commerce Department on June 7.
Hong Kong-listed shares of ZTE rose to as high as HK$11.62 ($1.48) on Wednesday, after declining 25 percent in the previous trading day.
In catch-up with the Hong Kong shares that have more than halved in price since trading resumed last Wednesday, ZTE's Shenzhen-listed shares declined by the maximum daily allowed 10 percent for the fifth consecutive day.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) expulsion from the elite Dow Jones Industrial Average may be a bitter pill to swallow for shareholders, but it could be little more than a publicity blow for investors in the 126-year-old struggling U.S. conglomerate.
While the Dow index of 30 top-shelf U.S. corporations is arguably more well known, professional investors bet much more money on what happens to the S&P 500, an index in which the one-time leading U.S. company has only a tiny influence. GE's drop from the Dow will thus likely not pose a risk of wide selling pressure by indexed investment funds.
""There's only a small group of investors who actually target their investing to the Dow Jones Industrial Average,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""All in all, I don't think it's meaningful to investors.""
Indeed, investors in GE might look on the move as the least of their worries. Struggling with weak profits and facing calls to be broken up, GE shares have already dropped 15 percent this year.
GE reached its peak share price in late August 2000, about a year before longtime Chief Executive Jack Welch turned over the reins to Jeffrey Immelt. The stock has fallen more than 75 percent since.
Not even its rich dividend has cushioned the dismal performance: Including reinvested dividends, GE has delivered total losses of 61 percent during that time, while the Dow has offered up gains of 240 percent on the same basis.
In the latest blow, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Tuesday that GE, an original member of the Dow when it was formed by Charles Dow in 1896 and a continuous member since 1907, will be replaced in the 30-component stock average by drug store chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) prior to the start of trading on June 26.
GE fell 1 percent in extended trade following the announcement, while Walgreens jumped 3 percent. 
While negative sentiment caused by the elimination of the company from the Dow could lead to more selling of its shares on Wednesday, investors predicted that GE's removal would prompt little reaction from major investment funds.
""Symbolically, this indignity marks GE's fall from grace,"" said analysts at RBC. ""However, given that the DJIA is a price-weighted index, GE now represents less than one-half of a percent of the overall index with its current stock price sitting below $13.""
GE is now the sixth smallest member of the Dow by market value, and it sports the index's lowest stock price, making it the least influential component of the price-weighted average.
About $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds tied to the Dow, the vast majority in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (SI:SPDR) ETF Trust (P:DIA), according to Lipper data. 
By comparison, ETFs that track the S&P 500 have assets of around $380 billion. That means GE's exit from the Dow next week will trigger a relatively small amount of selling by passively managed funds reconfiguring their holdings.
Underscoring the greater heft of the S&P 500,  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) surged 5 percent to a record high on June 5 after it was announced that the social media network would join that index.
The largest U.S. corporation by stock market value during most of the 1990s and until it was overtaken by  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) in 2005, GE's market capitalization now stands at $118 billion, less than 15 percent of Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) size.

GE is now tied with 3M Co (N:MMM) as the Dow components that are least favored by stock analysts, according to Thomson Reuters data. Following GE's recent warning that it might not be able to pay its 2019 dividend, just five analysts recommend buying shares in GE, compared with three who recommend selling and eight with neutral ratings.

The proceedings were initiated by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre in August 2017, and alleged breaches of money laundering and terror financing laws on 53,750 occasions, which Australia's biggest bank then admitted to.
The penalty was the biggest in Australian corporate history and was almost double the amount CBA had set aside, signaling the tougher regulatory framework Australian banks face following revelations of widespread misconduct.
The bank will book a A$700 million provision in its fiscal 2018 results, to be released in August, it said in a statement.
Shares of the bank were up 2 percent in a positive market (AXJO).

This is the first time Goldman Sachs has hired a China partner from outside the firm. 
Cai was formerly a partner at venture capital firm Fountainvest, and prior to that was co-head of China investment banking at UBS (S:UBSG) . 
Fountainvest is a Chinese private equity firm founded by a group of former Temasek executives in 2007. 
In his new role, Cai will work alongside Hong Ning, chairman of Goldman's greater China investment banking division, and Zhu Hansong, co-head of its China investment banking division, according to the memo.

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) will pump $500 million into companies led, founded or owned by women, as it steps up efforts to close the gender investing gap, the Wall Street bank said on Tuesday.
The program, Goldman Sachs' second geared toward female entrepreneurs, will also help clients invest directly in private, late-stage companies or provide seed capital for women starting their own funds.
""The bottom line is this makes sense for our business – because investing and helping companies grow is our business,"" Stephanie Cohen, Goldman Sachs' chief strategy officer, said in a statement. ""We also hope it makes a difference for women who have big ideas but find themselves cut out of the funding ecosystem.""
Cohen cited statistics showing that only 2 percent of U.S. venture capital in 2017 went to companies run entirely by women and just 12 percent went to teams with at least one woman. Less than 2 percent of U.S. private equity firms are women-owned, she said.
The program, called ""Launch With GS,"" follows Goldman Sachs' ""10,000 Women"" which debuted in 2008 to provide female entrepreneurs in developing economies with business education and access to capital. An online education component was added in May.
Goldman Sachs aims to have women make up half of its global workforce, starting with new analysts by 2021.
Only five of the 31 executives listed on the bank's management committee are women, one of whom is retiring. The bank also reported a wide gender pay gap in Britain for its international business earlier this year.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Australia's Westpac to forgo all conflicted product commissions,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's second-biggest lender, Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), said on Wednesday it would stop paying its staff commission for selling its own products, a practice at risk of being banned following a banking inquiry. 
Laws introduced in July 2013 let banks reward their financial advisers with commission for recommending their own investment and insurance products, provided the clients hired the adviser before that date.
But an independent inquiry has revealed banks have relied heavily on the so-called grandfathered provision to charge ongoing fees to clients, thousands of whom have not received the advisory services they paid for.
Lawyers running the quasi-judicial Royal Commission inquiry have suggested the country's largest banks put an end to the practice, a sign they may make a formal recommendation to ban it when the inquiry reports to the government in early 2019.
On Wednesday, Westpac said more than 140,000 customer accounts were exposed to the conflicted commissions and that it would stop the payments from Oct. 1.
""We have considered this position from both a customer and a stakeholder perspective and decided that it is the right time to draw a line under these past arrangements and eliminate them as far as we are contractually able,"" Westpac said in a statement.
The lender said it would honor existing arrangements to pay commission to external financial advisers who recommend Westpac and BT products relying on the legacy rule.
The move comes ahead of significant reforms expected to be recommended by the powerful misconduct inquiry into Australia's A$100 billion financial services in February. 
The inquiry has already exposed widespread misconduct in the advice and wealth management units of the largest banks and financial services companies such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), which also rely on rolling product commissions.
Westpac announced the change less than a week after the corporate regulator filed a lawsuit against it for a financial planner who gave poor advice to customers or charged them fees without giving any advice, while employed by the bank. 
In a submission to the inquiry, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) argued against the removal of the provisions allowing legacy product commission.
The bank, which has sold the bulk of its advisory network to IOOF (AX:IFL), said in May it would stop paying bonuses to financial planners for selling its products in response to the widespread misconduct in the sector unmasked by the inquiry.

310,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",Chinese Stocks Extend Slump as Authorities Appeal for Calm,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks fell, extending Tuesday’s plunge, despite efforts by the government to soothe nerves rattled by the threat of additional tariffs.
The Shanghai Composite Index slid as much as 0.9 percent to a two-year low. The gauge sank almost 4 percent yesterday, while 1,023 stocks listed on Chinese exchanges tumbled by the daily 10 percent limit -- or more than one in four. With Washington and Beijing threatening tit-for-tat moves over import tariffs, investors are worried a trade war will hurt earnings and act as a brake on China’s economy.
People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said on Tuesday policy makers are prepared for outside shocks and that investors should take a rational view, while official media also projected a positive image. The China Securities Journal said in a front page article that the quality and resilience of Chinese economic development will be better than expected. The Shanghai Securities News said good economic prospects and stable liquidity would support the market.
Tuesday’s rout came after President Donald Trump threatened duties on $200 billion in Chinese imports, and another $200 billion after that if Beijing retaliates. The tariffs dealt a blow to a market that’s yet to recover from a $5 trillion collapse that began almost exactly three years ago. The Shanghai Composite is among the world’s worst performing benchmarks this year -- only a handful of emerging markets have fared as bad. Almost 80 percent of the Chinese index’s stocks closed at fresh four-week lows on Tuesday.
The slump is prompting Chinese investors to cut leveraged positions at the fastest pace since January 2017. The balance of margin debt on the Shanghai Stock Exchange fell 2.4 percent to 567.9 billion yuan ($88 million) on Tuesday.

311,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 09:50PM ET</span>",Noble Group Paves Way for Debt Deal as Goldilocks Backs Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- Embattled commodity trader Noble Group Ltd. reached a deal with dissident shareholder Goldilocks Investment Co. over its planned $3.5 billion debt restructuring, agreeing to boost the holding in the new company that stock investors stand to get. The shares surged.
Existing shareholders will now receive 20 percent of the revised company, up from 15 percent, according to an exchange statement on Wednesday. In addition, the two parties will drop all claims against one another, with Noble Group paying Goldilocks as much as $5 million to its cover legal costs.
The deal marks a breakthrough after months of increasingly bitter public sparring between Noble Group and Goldilocks, and it paves the way for a restructuring that’ll see control handed to senior creditors. Goldilocks has given its irrevocable support to the revised agreement, which already has the backing of founder Richard Elman. Noble and Goldilocks will form a partnership to explore opportunities in the Middle East, according to the statement.
“This absolutely clears the biggest hurdle to the debt restructuring,” Stan Manoukian, founder of California-based Independent Credit Research LLC, said by phone. “The threat of liquidation is no longer on the agenda. If Goldilocks had not played ball, the value of equity would be zero in a liquidation scenario. We expect the bonds to be worth more than where they are trading now.”
To get the deal over the line, Brough needs approvals from shareholders as well as creditors, of which about 85 percent are backing the plan. The company is working on a circular to send to stock holders, before a special general meeting that’s yet to be scheduled.
Getting Sweeter
The restructuring agreement has been altered before. Earlier this year, Noble Group sweetened the deal for shareholders by revising the original plan, offering them the 15 percent holding, up from 10 percent. Under the latest deal, Goldilocks will get to nominate a director to the board.
Noble Group’s shares, which had been suspended ahead of the announcement, surged. The stock rallied as much as 57 percent to 8.5 Singapore cents and traded at 8 cents at 9:29 a.m. in Singapore. The shares remain 60 percent lower this year.
“By reaching agreement with Goldilocks, the company is now able to move into the final stages of its restructuring,” Chairman Paul Brough said. “The strategic partnership agreement announced today will create real opportunities for New Noble in the Middle East.”
Years of Crisis
The remaining equity in the new company is being split between senior creditors and management. Under the latest deal, senior creditors stand to receive 70 percent of the trader, while management’s share will be 10 percent.
Noble Group has been in crisis for years after billions in losses, defaulting on its debt, and allegations of improper accounting, which it has rejected. After a string of asset sales, the company has been reduced to a rump business focused on Asia, plus a handful of other assets including an alumina refinery.
“Obstacles to the completion of the restructuring are probably getting removed,” said Neel Gopalakrishnan, senior credit strategist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. “But the key question is still whether, post restructuring, the company will be able to turn around operations for creditors to recover value.”

In 2017, Ackman waged and lost a bitter proxy contest at ADP but more recently the stock has helped the hedge fund deliver positive returns for its investors.
Welch's departure comes only months after Ackman told investors that he was shrinking the firm, cutting mainly back-office staff. Over the last years a number of investment staff members including Paul Hilal and William Doyle have left Ackman.
More broadly, at a time where many funds have struggled to deliver strong investment returns, the payout for the staff members have been in question, prompting a number of people to leave prominent hedge funds.
William Ackman's fund has gained more than 9 percent this year while his publicly traded fund is up double digits, marking a dramatic reversal for the billionaire investor after three years of losses.
Pershing Square said its investment in ADP will continue to be overseen by Ackman along with two other analysts after Welch's departure.
Pershing Square bought ADP shares for an average price of $105 in 2017. On Tuesday the shares closed trading at $138.60.
The company said its stake in ADP has generated a total shareholder return of about 35 percent and that it will continue to manage the size of its position in these funds.
""While we have and will continue to manage the size of the position in these funds by selling stock and options in light of its increased size, we expect to continue to be a large, long-term and engaged shareholder (in ADP),"" Ackman said in a statement.

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) forecast on Tuesday slower sales growth than Wall Street expected this quarter and plans to close about 150 U.S. cafes next fiscal year to boost performance, sending its shares down 2 percent after hours.
The world's largest coffee chain is facing competition both from upscale coffee houses and lower-priced fast-food chains like McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and Dunkin' Donuts (O:DNKN).
It has missed analysts' estimates for same-store sales in the U.S.-dominated Americas region in five of the last six quarters.
The company anticipates lower net new store growth in the United States for fiscal 2019 and said it would address rapidly changing consumer preferences by introducing new cold drinks like a mango dragon fruit beverage and focusing on growing health and wellness trends.
Starbucks' Executive Chairman and co-founder Howard Schultz said earlier this month that he is stepping away from the company on June 26, ending an era. In April, Schultz worked closely alongside Chief Executive Kevin Johnson to help limit damage to the company's image after a racial profiling incident involving the arrest of two black men in a Philadelphia store. [nL1N1RV266]
""It seems fairly clear that the low-hanging fruit on causing everybody to get addicted to their (Starbucks) fantastic products is kind of in the rear-view mirror,"" said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management. 
""At least in the Starbucks heavy markets, the people that are going to drink coffee are already drinking it.""
Starbucks said it expects global comparable store sales to rise 1 percent in the third quarter, below the 3 percent increase estimated by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""While certain demand headwinds are transitory, and some of our cost increases are appropriate investments for the future, our recent performance does not reflect the potential of our exceptional brand and is not acceptable,"" Johnson said in a statement.
Historically, the Seattle-based company closes roughly 50 stores a year. 
Starbucks said it would look to open more stores in under penetrated markets and explore strategic options to license company-operated stores. China is the company's biggest growth driver with same-store sales rising 4 percent in the last reported quarter. 
The company also said it would look to cut general and administrative expenses with plans to partner with an external consultant to speed up the process.

In early May, Swiss-based Nestle (S:NESN) said it would pay Starbucks $7.15 billion for exclusive rights to sell Starbucks coffees and teas. That alliance frees Starbucks to focus on improving its mainstay U.S. cafe business, where traffic growth had stalled.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co has lost its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after over a century in the blue chip stock index, a new blow to a company that once towered over the American business landscape but is now struggling to retain its standing as an industrial powerhouse.
S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Tuesday that GE (N:GE), an original member of the Dow when it was formed by Charles Dow in 1896 and a continuous member since 1907, will be replaced in the 30-component stock average by drug store chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) prior to the start of trading on June 26. GE’s stock slipped 1.5 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement while Walgreens jumped 3 percent.
A decade and a half ago GE was the world’s most valuable public company. But it foundered in several key industrial markets in recent years, and a diversion into financial services steered it into the eye of the global financial crisis in 2008. 
It now ranks as the sixth smallest member of the Dow by market value and carries the index’s lowest stock price, making it the least influential component of the price-weighted average. 
Faced with weak profits and calls to be broken up, the 126-year-old company is aggressively cutting costs, selling businesses and trying to strengthen its balance sheet under new managers and a new board. 
Its stock has fallen nearly 80 percent from highs in 2000. Last month, Chief Executive John Flannery warned that GE may not be able to pay its 2019 dividend.
""It was at one time perhaps one of the quintessential U.S. companies, and like others that have been taken out of the Dow, it's a reflection that they're no longer seen in that light,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
WALGREENS HELPS REFLECT U.S. ECONOMY
The shifting sands of the Dow are testament to the various companies that were unassailable household names for decades before becoming the victims of an evolving economy. Some simply disappeared, while others found new life even if they did not reclaim their prior economic influence. They include Eastman Kodak, Sears Roebuck, International Paper, Goodyear, Bethlehem Steel, Westinghouse, General Motors Co (N:GM) and Chrysler.
Co-founded by inventor Thomas Edison, GE was the largest U.S. company by stock market value starting in 1993, with brief interruptions from Microsoft Inc (O:MSFT) until  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) overtook it in 2005. 
With the addition of Walgreens, the Dow will better reflect the role of consumers and healthcare in the U.S. economy, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement.
While analysts had anticipated GE's exit from the Dow because of its falling share price, it is a blow to the company to lose its status as the only original member of the iconic index. GE did leave the Dow after the index was founded in 1896 but rejoined in 1907 and has been a constant member since then, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
In a statement, GE said: ""We are focused on executing against the plan we've laid out to improve GE's performance. Today's announcement does nothing to change those commitments or our focus in creating in a stronger, simpler GE.""
Some index watchers had expected GE's troubles to lead to its removal from the elite index. 
Not all companies that have lost their place in the Dow have gone to their graves. Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) has outperformed the Dow by 46 percentage points since it was removed in 2013. 
GE had fallen on hard times even as former Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt sought to jettison ailing businesses and focus on the company's industrial roots in power plants, jet engines, locomotives and other large equipment. Its industrial software business did not perform as expected, forcing GE to scale in its ambitions last year.
Immelt also built up GE's exposure to manufacturing and servicing coal and gas-fired electricity plants, only to see demand for such plants fall dramatically in recent years as sales of suddenly cost-competitive renewable wind and solar systems increased.
Aiming to generate cash and restore profitability, CEO John Flannery, who took over from Immelt last August, is exiting $20 billion in additional GE assets, including the locomotive business and a unit that makes small power-plant engines. 

Changes to the Dow are made on an as-needed basis and selection is not governed by quantitative rules, according to published methodology for the index.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Lapses at many levels of bank led to India's huge PNB fraud, internal report shows","By Abhirup Roy, Aditya Kalra and Euan Rocha
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A $2 billion fraud at India's  Punjab National Bank  (PNB) may have been orchestrated by a few rogue employees, but it escaped detection because of widespread risk-control and monitoring lapses in many areas of the bank, the bank's own internal probe has found.
PNB (NS:PNBK), India's second-biggest state-controlled lender, has previously alleged that a handful of staff at a single Mumbai branch issued fake bank guarantees over several years to help two jewelry groups - controlled by Indian diamond magnate Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi - raise billions of dollars in foreign credit and commit India's biggest-ever bank fraud.
The bank's CEO Sunil Mehta told Reuters in April he had suspended 21 officials and ""will not spare"" others found involved in lapses, but he also described the fraud as a ""small turmoil"".
However, a 162-page internal report, produced by PNB officials tasked with probing the fraud, lays bare lapses that go far beyond a few branch officers. The report, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, lays out how failings by 54 PNB officials - ranging from clerks to foreign exchange managers, and auditors to heads of regional offices, allowed the fraud to be perpetrated. Eight of the 54 are among those who have been charged by the federal police for their roles in the scandal.
The report, which the PNB officials presented to the bank's fraud risk management arm on April 5, along with dozens of pages of annexed bank records and internal e-mails, is also part of the evidence submitted by the federal police in its court case against those allegedly involved in the fraud. The report's findings have not previously been made public.
DAMNING CONCLUSIONS
The unearthing of the fraud in January has not only exposed shortcomings in the management of PNB, but has also undermined confidence in India's state-run banking sector, which controls over two-thirds of the nation's bank assets.
The damning conclusions of the report stand in contrast to the lack of regulatory action taken by the authorities since the fraud was reported.
No penalty has been imposed on PNB as a result of the fraud and there has been no senior management shake-up. 
A PNB spokesman told Reuters the bank ""cannot share details on a sub-judice case"". He added: ""We must reiterate that we will not spare anybody who is found guilty irrespective of the level or position in the bank,"" he said.
PNB did not respond to a question about what action was taken against the ""erring"" officials mentioned in the report.
The Reserve Bank of India, the nation's central bank, and the Indian government's federal banking secretary, Rajiv Kumar, didn't respond to requests for comment.
The report does not say whether the PNB investigators believe those involved in the monitoring failures were aware of the fraud.
Significantly, they said one of the reasons the fraud went undetected for years was because of lapses within some of the bank's critical areas at its New Delhi headquarters, such as its credit review and international banking units.
""There was enough evidence to suggest failures,"" the team of four senior PNB investigators said in its report. ""It was observed that blatant system violations/unethical practices/dereliction of responsibilities led bank to such a catastrophe.""
FRAUD AT BRADY HOUSE
The epicenter of the fraud was PNB's Brady House branch, housed in a building with an imposing colonial facade in downtown Mumbai. From there, deputy manager Gokulnath Shetty for years issued fraudulent credit guarantees over the SWIFT interbank messaging network, the bank and prosecutors have alleged.
Using those guarantees, companies controlled by Nirav Modi, whose jewelry creations were once adorned by global celebrities, and Choksi, received credit from banks overseas to fraudulently fund their businesses, PNB alleges.
Modi and Choksi, both of whom left India before PNB filed its first police complaint on Jan 29, have denied any wrongdoing.
Shetty's lawyer has said his client is not guilty.
All face charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating, as well as allegations under India's prevention of corruption law.
A police source told Reuters on Monday the federal investigating agency last week asked the international police agency Interpol to help locate Modi and Choksi.
Calls and text messages to lawyers for Modi and Choksi went unanswered.
LACK OF INTEGRATION
Shetty escaped detection because he did not log his SWIFT transactions on the bank's internal software - something he was supposed to do because the two systems were not integrated.
PNB investigators said the bank's international banking department and the IT division had delayed the integration work. They had also not complied with central bank advisories in 2016 calling for a comprehensive audit of SWIFT systems in use.
But more simply, the fraud could have been detected if the branch did the basic daily SWIFT reconciliation that, according to internal rules, required logs of transactions on the global payments network to be manually checked against the bank's internal system, the investigators said.
""Only one activity would have nailed the whole act at the incipient stage,"" said the report.
The lapses, however, extended beyond the branch.
As per protocol, the daily reconciliation reports should travel up the chain to PNB's headquarters in New Delhi. Along the way, they would be signed off by the Brady House branch head and sent each month to a Mumbai city regional office that would issue all-clear certificates for the branches it controls.
But despite receiving just two of the 12 monthly reports from the Brady House branch last year, the regional office signed off on a ""false"" compliance certificate, signaling a clean bill of health for the branch, the report said.
Moreover, despite a massive missing paper trail, none of the senior inspection officers, who conducted 10 visits between 2010 and 2017 to the branch, reported anything ""adverse"", PNB's report stated.
MISSED MAJOR RED FLAG
The Mumbai city regional office also missed another vital red flag - the Brady House branch was a star performer, largely because of its dealings with Modi firms, the PNB report said.
Its import and export transactions in the 12 months to March 2017 stood at $3.3 billion, 50 percent higher than recorded two years prior. ""The exceptional growth should have been noticed,"" the report said.
A former PNB internal audit official who declined to be identified but reviewed the growth numbers mentioned in the report for Reuters, said: ""This was sufficient to raise a cause of concern and the reasons thereof should have been investigated.""
Signs that audit practices at Brady House were weak were also flagged by the branch itself, according to two internal PNB documents reviewed by Reuters.
In March 2012, the branch said in an internal memo that an almost 50 percent of the observations flagged in its annual inspection report – mainly auditor queries - remained ""un-replied/unattended to by respective concerned officers"", calling it a ""critical situation"".
Four years later, in 2016, the branch's assistant general manager issued an internal memo saying around 18 observations -- five described as zero-tolerance level issues -- were pending. The memo was signed by 10 bank officers, including Shetty.
LATE-NIGHT EMAILS
Shetty joined the forex division at Brady House in April 2010. In March 2011, the branch issued the first fake credit guarantees of $15.5 million to Modi's firms through SWIFT messages, bypassing the internal banking system, the PNB investigators said.
Over the coming years, Shetty authorized more than 1200 fraudulent credit guarantees, the report said.
As a mid-level employee, Shetty should only have been able to approve transactions of up to 2.5 million rupees ($37,000) without sign-off from more senior officials. But he had been given unlimited approval powers, the investigators said without explaining how this happened.
In the few weeks before his retirement in May last year, Shetty used his personal Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) e-mail address to send 22 e-mails -- 18 at around midnight -- to reconcile large forex transactions involving the Modi group. The use of personal e-mail was ""overlooked"" by the bank's treasury department, the report said.
Under PNB policy, no officer should remain in the same office for more than three years, but Shetty retired after serving in Brady House for seven years. Three transfer orders were issued for him during his tenure, but he was never moved, the investigators found.

The report said that it is ""incomprehensible"" that branch staff did not notice the fraud being committed.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 07:48PM ET</span>",FedEx profit tops Wall Street estimates amid trade war worries,"By Lisa Baertlein and Lewis Krauskopf
LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - FedEx Corp (N:FDX) reported fourth-quarter profit that beat Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, as revenues and operating margins increased in each of the company's operating units.
Shares of the Memphis-based package delivery company extended losses in after-hours trading, following their worst regular session sell-off in two months on worries over the U.S.-China trade war.
FedEx is often considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy, along with its main rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS). FedEx and companies in the industrial sector faced the brunt of trade tensions on Tuesday after China vowed to retaliate against U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
""I have never been so optimistic and so sure of our strategy and our ability to deliver an exciting future,"" FedEx Chief Executive Frederick Smith said on a conference call.
He spoke after the company reported a fourth-quarter profit, excluding items, of $5.91 per share - 20 cents per share better than analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue matched Wall Street's target, rising 10.2 percent to $17.3 billion.
Analysts said the latest quarter's results were buoyed by rate increases, higher package volume, more efficient operations, tax benefits and share buybacks. 
""We do remain concerned, however, about threats that manage the free flow of goods among countries. Trade is a two-way street, and FedEx supports lowering trade barriers for our customers, not raising them,"" Smith said, echoing comments he made on Friday.
Some analysts and investors are taking a wait-and-see stance.
""At this point we believe it's more bark than bite,"" Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk, said, noting that Trump appeared to be employing a preferred negotiating tactic.
FedEx has been ahead of UPS in making massive network investments to handle the growing number of deliveries for online purchases and other packages, and investors have been eager to see returns. 
Those investments paid off in FedEx's fourth quarter, said Trip Miller, managing director at Memphis-based hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners, who also personally holds FedEx shares. 
""We expect that to accelerate over the next three years,"" barring a trade war or economic downturn, Miller said. 
Shares of both FedEx and UPS closed down about 2 percent on Tuesday. FedEx fell another 0.8 percent to $256.39 in extended trading. 
FedEx forecast fiscal 2019 revenue growth of about 9 percent, while analysts were expecting about 6 percent growth.

The company said it expects fiscal 2019 earnings per share of $17.00 to $17.60, excluding some items. The midpoint of that range came in below than analysts' average estimate of $17.47 a share.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co executives on Tuesday said the automaker will renovate and revamp Michigan Central Station, Detroit's infamous blighted landmark, turning it into offices for up to 5,000 tech workers and software engineers focused on self-driving vehicles and ancillary technologies and services.
Speaking to a large crowd outside the grand, yet dilapidated 18-story Michigan Central Station, Ford family scion and the automaker's executive chairman, Bill Ford, recalled how the railway station, opened in 1914, brought countless thousands of immigrants to Detroit during its heyday, before closing in 1988 and falling into disrepair.
""This became a place where hope left, it became a symbol of the city's hard times"" Ford told a crowd gathered in front of the looming structure. ""We have big plans for this building.""
Company officials did not disclose details of the planned investment but said the project will be completed using some of the money previously allocated to an overhaul of Ford's headquarter campus in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.
That project has been estimated at $1.2 billion. The automaker will also receive unspecified tax incentives and benefits from Detroit and the state of Michigan.
Speaking to reporters inside the station building, Bill Ford said that the investment here in Corktown, Detroit's oldest neighborhood, would be good for the automaker's brand, create jobs, facilitate the testing of self-driving cars and attract bright young software engineers. 
""A lot of the tech companies have really wonderful campuses, but none of them have anything like this,"" he said. ""I think this will be a great magnet for talent.""
Detroit experienced a meteoric rise in the first half of the 20th century to become America's fourth-largest city, its name synonymous with U.S. manufacturing prowess. 
But riots in the 1960s and the oil shocks of the 1970s heralded decades of decline. By mid-2017, Detroit's population had fallen to 673,104, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, from a peak of 1.8 million in 1950. 
In 2009 the city council voted to tear the railway station building down, but it survived.
Bill Ford said he hopes suppliers will relocate to the building to team up with Ford.
""Capital is dear, it's not unlimited,"" he said. ""We are very aware of that as is everybody else in this space, so we're looking to partner wherever and with whomever we can.""

319,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 06:43PM ET</span>","Oracle's forecast miss overshadows cloud growth, shares fall","By Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Oracle Corp's (N:ORCL) forecast for current-quarter profit missed analysts' expectations on Tuesday, hurt by a strengthening U.S. dollar, dampening its fourth-quarter earnings beat that was powered by growth in its cloud business.
Shares of the business software maker, which rose as much as 3.7 percent after the results, fell nearly 5 percent to $44.10 in extended trade after the company's dismal forecast.
Oracle sees first-quarter adjusted earnings per share to be between 68 cents and 70 cents, below analysts' average estimate of 72 cents.
""In regard to Q1 guidance, exchange rates have moved from a 3 percent revenue tailwind to now being a 1 percent headwind from the last time I gave guidance,"" Oracle's head of investor relations Ken Bond said on the conference call. 
Unlike previous quarters, the company did not give a break up of revenue from its cloud segments, which analysts say could have affected the company's stock price.
""Oracle's move to change its reporting structure, which masks the performance of its cloud infrastructure and applications segments, overshadowed the Q4 beat,"" Daniel Morgan Senior Portfolio Manager Synovus Trust Company said.
Morgan said all metrics in the fourth quarter were strong, but due to the disclosure change ""investors are wondering if Oracle is trying to hide something in its total cloud revenue"".
Oracle, which has cloud deals with AT&T (N:T) and Bank of America (N:BAC), is a late entrant to the cloud business and has been trying to catch up with rivals such as Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Salesforce.com (N:CRM).
Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said some of the company's largest customers have now begun the process of moving their on-premise Oracle databases to the Oracle Cloud.
AT&T is moving thousands of databases and tens of thousands of terabytes of data into the Oracle Cloud, Ellison said.
Revenue from its cloud services and licenses support rose 8.2 percent to $6.77 billion, as more companies shift to cloud computing from the traditional on-premise model to cut costs. 
The company's net income rose to $3.41 billion, or 82 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended May 31, from $3.23 billion, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue rose 3.3 percent to $11.25 billion.
Excluding items, the company earned 99 cents per share. 

Analysts were expecting a profit of 94 cents per share and a revenue of $11.19 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as a sharp escalation in the trade dispute between the United States and China rattled markets and put the Dow Jones Industrial Average back in negative territory for the year.
President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, and Beijing warned it would retaliate.
Trump said his move followed China's decision to raise tariffs on $50 billion in U.S. goods, which came after the White House announced similar tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday.
""Investors are waking up to the idea that all the rhetoric on trade could be more than just a negotiating tactic,"" said Emily Roland, head of capital markets research at John Hancock Investments in Boston.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 287.26 points, or 1.15 percent, to 24,700.21, the S&P 500 lost 11.18 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,762.57 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.44 points, or 0.28 percent, to 7,725.59.
The three major indexes pared losses from earlier in the session. The Dow briefly dropped below its 100-day moving average but rebounded, though the index ended the session below its 50-day moving average.
Given the escalating rhetoric on trade, some investors said the slide in U.S. stocks was relatively small.
""The U.S. market has acted much stronger than the global equity markets,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""It's a sedate reaction.""
The CBOE Volatility Index, commonly known as Wall Street's fear gauge, hit nearly a three-week high of 14.68 points, before easing to 13.35.
The small-cap Russell 2000 index, whose components are more domestically focused than large-cap companies, edged up 0.1 percent.
Sectors seen as bond proxies due to their high dividend yields, such as utilities, telecoms and consumer staples, advanced.
Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA), which has been a proxy for trade-war tensions with China, fell 3.8 percent, weighing the most on the Dow. Construction equipment maker  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) closely followed with a 3.6 percent drop.
The declines weighed on the S&P industrials index, which fell 2.1 percent, its biggest one-day percentage drop in nearly two months.
Shares of chipmakers, which depend on China for a large portion of their revenue, slipped. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 1.2 percent.
Tariff worries dragged FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) down 2.0 percent. The logistics company's shares were the biggest weight on the Dow Transports, which fell 1.7 percent. FedEx is scheduled to issue its quarterly report after the bell on Tuesday. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 135 new highs and 48 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.12 billion shares, compared to the 6.95 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1. Existing Home Sales, Trade War Turmoil in Focus
While potential developments on the trade war front will likely dominate trading direction, further evidence supporting the narrative of a strong U.S. economy could lift investor sentiment.
Existing Home Sales due 10:00AM ET is expected to show a rise of 1.5% for May to 5.55 million units from 5.46 million units the prior month.
The ongoing exchange of trade salvos between the U.S. and China prompted traders to flee risk assets in favour safe-haven but JPMorgan said it's unlikely President Trump's latest tariffs would see daylight as it would hurt U.S. businesses.
Trump's $400 billion tariff threat is unlikely to be imposed as it could hurt US companies as a significant portion of China's exports are Western products manufactured locally, JPMorgan said.
Traders were said to be in wait-and-see mode to assess whether China would retaliate with fresh tariffs, raising the prospect of an all-out trade war between the world's two largest economies.
The dollar hit nearly one-year high against its rivals on Tuesday.
2. U.S. Crude Oil Stockpiles in Focus, 
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday at 10.30 a.m. ET is expected to show crude supplies fell for a second straight week.
Yet, U.S. inventory data could play second fiddle to any OPEC and non-OPEC jawboning on potential crude output hikes ahead of the OPEC meeting later this week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 1.898 million barrels in the week ended June 15.
Crude oil futures settled 1.2% lower at $65.07 on Tuesday on fears of an aggressive output hike amid comments from Russia's energy minister.
3. Investors Cool on Starbucks as Shares Tumble 
Shares of Starbucks fell sharply in after-hours trade as the coffee chain slashed its third-quarter fiscal 2018 same-store sales growth from a previous estimate in April.
The coffee chain cut its forecast for third-quarter same-store sales to 1% from a previous estimate of between 3% and 5%, undershooting Wall Street estimates for same-store sales growth of 2.9%.
Starbucks also said it would scale back its U.S. retail footprint at a more rapid pace in 2019 as it seeks to ramp up the number of company-operated stores in under-penetrated markets.
""In FY19, this will result in a slightly lower growth rate in net new company-operated stores,"" Starbucks said.
Shares of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) fell 3% in after-hours trade."

332,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>","BofA's Merrill admits misleading customers, to pay $42 million SEC fine","By Lisa Lambert and Jonathan Stempel
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's (N:BAC) Merrill Lynch unit admitted to misleading brokerage customers about which firms processed their trades and agreed to pay a $42 million fine under a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Tuesday.
The settlement follows a similar agreement with the New York attorney general in a related probe nearly three months ago, under which Merrill Lynch also admitted to wrongdoing and agreed to pay a $42 million fine.
Merrill ""fell far short of the standards expected of broker-dealers in our markets,"" preventing customers from making informed decisions about their orders and broker-dealer relationships, Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC enforcement division, said in a statement.
The SEC said Merrill engaged in a scheme known as ""masking,"" including the alteration of trade confirmations, to deceive customers into thinking it was processing their trades in-house, making its trading services appear more active and sophisticated and reducing fees it would pay to exchanges.
Merrill was also accused of concealing from customers the possibility that high-frequency traders who traded in its dark pool, known as Instinct X, might be counterparties.
Dark pools are private trading venues designed to let people quietly trade shares, often to get large orders done with minimal price movement.
The SEC said the masking ran from May 2008 to May 2013, and that Merrill kept it hidden after it ended. It said Merrill falsely told customers that more than 15.8 million orders worth over $141 billion had occurred in-house.
Bank of America referred to a statement in made on March 23 about the New York settlement, when it said: ""At all times we met our obligation to deliver the best prices to clients. About five years ago, we addressed the issues concerning communicating to clients about where their trades were executed.""

Merrill was acquired by Bank of America in January 2009.

333,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",From the Aussie to soybeans and cars: what's at risk in a trade war?,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Aussie dollar takes a thumping, soybean prices swing and German carmaker shares are stuck in reverse.
Financial markets have been roiled by fears of an all-out trade war between the United States and China, prompting investors to dump assets at risk from rising tariffs and seek safety in havens such as Japan's yen and U.S. Treasury bonds.
U.S. President Donald Trump's promised this week to slap tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, drawing swift threats of retaliation from China.
Below are some of the currencies, stocks and commodities seen most vulnerable to an escalating trade conflict:
(For graphic on trade war fears dent global growth bellwethers, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2MFsHzN)
CURRENCIES
Countries with open economies reliant on global trade are most at risk when disputes over international commerce hit.
The Australian dollar ticks those boxes. Australia counts China as its biggest trading partner and its currency is heavily correlated to global growth. Many investors see the currency, known as the Aussie, as a better global trade bellwether than the Canadian dollar, which has been buffeted by negotiations over NAFTA, the North American trade pact.
This week, the Aussie fell to its lowest level in 13 months, and the positioning of options signal more weakness ahead.
Another candidate is Sweden's crown, given the Nordic nation's open economy and big exporting industries. The currency has weakened about 2.5 percent in the last three days to a six-week low against the euro. 
""Currencies which are heavily exposed to global growth are going to feel the pressure from any escalation in the trade dispute,"" said James Binny, global head of currency at State Street Global Advisors based in London.
Asian currencies such as the Korean won as well as the Singapore and Hong Kong dollars have also weakened this week for similar reasons.

EQUITIES 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's European fund manager survey in June found a record drop in allocations to auto stocks, indicating that investors are jittery about the sector due to Trump's threat of imposing U.S. tariffs on German carmakers.
European automakers send around $50 billion worth of cars to the United States each year. BMW is the most exposed with up to one fifth of its global sales heading to the U.S. market.
Retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. cars would also hurt European firms as many export to China from their U.S. plants. 
As a result, shares in Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW and Daimler have fallen sharply, taking Europe's autos index to a seven-month low. 
(For graphic on escalating trade war hits Europe's autos stocks, click https://reut.rs/2JYj0KW)
The aircraft industry, including Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus, is another barometer as it relies heavily on an open global supply chain.
Boeing is the single largest U.S. exporter to China, and its shares, along with those of its European counterpart, have fluctuated as trade tensions have risen. 
(For graphic on planemakers and trade, click https://reut.rs/2LYMHfu)
Steel and aluminum are regular targets in international trade disputes. U.S. tariffs on imported steel have hit shares in European steelmaking exporters such as Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG), Salzgitter and Voestalpine.
Europe-based manufacturers that import steel for U.S. factories may also become entangled in the conflict. 
There could be some winners, if European manufacturers such as ABB and Siemens win market share in China at the expense of U.S. rivals such as Honeywell. 
But higher trade barriers are likely to hurt most economies, leaving even the winners with a smaller market to work with.
COMMODITIES
China buys about a third of its soybeans from the United States so Beijing's move to slap 25 percent duties on U.S. soybean imports has made the commodity a key battlefield. 
It will raise the cost of soymeal, which is used in China to feed pigs and poultry. China's most active soymeal futures rose 4.2 percent on Tuesday. 
Soybean prices tend to be affected more by weather than economic factors, but tit-for-tat tariffs might shift trade flows. U.S. CBOT soy futures have tumbled to multi-year lows as U.S. suppliers may now lose a chunk of China's market to Latin American rivals.
Finally, prices for copper, a metal widely used in the construction and power industries, have fallen to their lowest since May 31. Copper prices can be expected to tumble further if world growth slides.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets tumbled with U.S. bond yields and agricultural commodities on Tuesday, while the dollar rose and investors flocked to safety in the face of a rapidly escalating U.S.-China trade conflict.
Soybeans were among the hardest hit after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, a threat that China's commerce ministry described as ""blackmailing,"" vowing to retaliate.
Government bonds and the Japanese yen  rallied as investors sought protection. Oil futures pulled back, with U.S. crude seeing the deepest declines. 
Wall Street's three major indexes were lower, though the S&P 500's decline of less than 1 percent was much more measured than that of overseas markets. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) slumped nearly 5 percent at one point.
A preference for more domestically-exposed U.S. sectors such as utilities and telecommunications showed investors were trying to insulate themselves from a trade war, according to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth in Chicago.
""Investors recognize that China sells us about four times the amount of products we sell them so any diminishment in trade is going to hurt them that much more,"" said Ablin. ""If they were really concerned we were spiraling down the drain they'd sell (defensive) sectors including consumer staples. I don't think (equity) investors believe this is the end of the world.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 346.91 points, or 1.39 percent, to 24,640.56, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 20.39 points, or 0.74 percent, to 2,753.36 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 65.09 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,681.94.
But investors in U.S. agricultural commodities appeared to be far more worried. Ablin said Trump may be willing to suffer near-term pain in commodities in a spat that is ""less about soybeans and more about intellectual property."" 
Chicago Board of Trade soybeans <0#S:> fell as much as 6 percent, while wheat slumped <0#W:> more than 4 percent. Corn <0#C:>, cotton <0#CT:> and ethanol <0#ZE:> futures notched life-of-contract lows. 
Among livestock, Chicago Mercantile Exchange lean hog contacts <1LHN8> for July delivery shed more than 2 percent of their value.
""When you get in a fight with your biggest buyer of agriculture, and the world's largest soybean buyer (China), even if (it) were to buy 20 percent less, it's a big deal,"" said Dan Basse, president of Chicago-based consultancy AgResource Co.
In U.S. treasuries, U.S. 10-year and 30-year yields fell to three-week lows on the news, while those on two-year notes slid to two-week troughs.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last rose 13/32 in price to yield 2.8803 percent, from 2.926 percent late on Monday.
The 30-year bond (US30YT=RR) last rose 27/32 in price to yield 3.0126 percent, from 3.055 percent late on Monday.
In currencies the dollar, yen and Swiss franc rose as investors favored currencies that are perceived less risky.
The dollar index (DXY) rose 0.31 percent, with the euro (EUR=) down 0.46 percent to $1.1569, though the euro trimmed some losses as France's and Germany's leaders agreed on a euro zone budget.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.57 percent versus the greenback at 109.92 per dollar. The Swiss franc increased 0.4 percent against the euro at 1.1520 franc (EURCHF=) and was marginally higher versus the greenback  at 0.9955 franc.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) lost 0.7 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) shed 0.95 percent. (EU)
Emerging market stocks lost 2 percent while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) closed 2.3 percent lower.
GREAT FALL OF CHINA
The Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) ended 3.8 percent lower after slumping nearly 5 percent at one point to its lowest level since mid-2016.
A skid by China's yuan  to a five-month low, meanwhile, was its biggest fall in roughly a year and a half.

340,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Facebook expands offerings for video creators to cash in on views,"By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) launched a matchmaking system Tuesday to cultivate partnerships between advertisers and video creators as the world's largest social media company tries to quickly parallel the variety of commercial opportunities offered by its video rival YouTube.
Some advertisers have tested the Brand Collabs Manager, which identifies video makers that may be good fits for product placement or endorsement deals. 
Facebook also said it was allowing more content creators to run ad breaks in longer videos, and offer subscriptions for $4.99 a month to fans. Subscribers receive perks, such as exclusive behind-the-scenes footage.
Facebook is not keeping a cut of partnerships or subscriptions during testing, and it is uncertain about eventual fees, company Vice President Fidji Simo told Reuters in an interview last week. 
The company has long been wary of polluting newer experiences, such as video, with ads and paid options. But it has deployed the moneymaking features in recent months after a year in which many videomakers saw their YouTube earnings clipped. 
YouTube, part of Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, tightened revenue-sharing policies last year after advertisers including Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) expressed concern about automated ad-buying tools that had turned them into sponsors of unflattering content.
Both Facebook and YouTube are racing to attract high-quality content, which would help them win over the $200 billion spent annually on TV advertising globally.
Facebook's appeal to video makers has been limited by the few opportunities they have had to turn viewership on the service into revenue. For instance, YouTube added a partnership match tool in 2016 via acquisition. 
YouTube plans to update its commercialization options later this week as 30,000 members of the online video industry, including fans, gather for the VidCon festival in Anaheim, California beginning Wednesday. 
Simo acknowledged that video makers want even more alternatives. Facebook already is testing how to promote new videos as ""live events"" that could become big destinations for advertising, she said. 
Many creators have asked for a tool to sell merchandise they develop to fans, Simo said. For now, Simo said the company plans to do a ""small test"" this year of selling third-party products featured in videos.

Separately, Facebook unveiled on Tuesday polling and quizzing features for anyone to produce game shows. The tools follow the success of startup Intermedia Labs Inc, whose HQ trivia app regularly attracts 1 million contestants to daily shows.

The prosecution had asked for 2.7 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in damages from the U.S. investment bank, but in a ruling published last week, the Court of Accounts said it did not have the jurisdiction to take the case.

Morgan Stanley has denied any wrongdoing and its lawyers have argued that a civil court should have jurisdiction over proceedings.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 12:42PM ET</span>",Escalating tariff war hits Europe's autos stocks and multinationals,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares extended a sell-off on Tuesday as a trade war between the United States and China escalated, with autos, mining and technology stocks taking the brunt.
Europe's main equity benchmark, the STOXX 600, fell for the third straight session, down 0.7 percent, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods, following Beijing's decision to raise tariffs on $50 billion in U.S. goods.
""For now we are talking about the U.S. and China, not Europe directly, but certainly overall it's a de-risking because global trade integrates everything,"" said Britta Weidenbach, head of European equities at DWS.
The STOXX 600 (STOXX) recovered slightly after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed on a euro zone budget, which traders said was a helpful show of unity.
Italian banks (FTIT8300), up 1 percent, were further supported after the European Central Bank's top supervisor said the central bank could adopt a softer approach in pressing banks to reduce bad loans, confirming an earlier Reuters report. 
Germany's DAX (GDAXI), home to some of the carmakers that Trump has explicitly targeted in his tariffs rhetoric, fell the most, down 1.2 percent. BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) dropped 0.8 to 2.4 percent. The STOXX 600 autos sector (SXAP) hit a seven-month low.
""The automotive sector is one of the main sectors that could potentially be impacted by import tariffs,"" said Weidenbach, adding that the impact on different German carmakers may depend on how much of their production is U.S.-based.
Europe's companies in general are more exposed to the global economy than their U.S. counterparts, making them more vulnerable to countries imposing higher tariffs on goods. 
Some 18 percent of European company revenues comes from North America and 9 percent from China. Thirty-two percent is derived from emerging markets.
U.S. companies get just 4 percent of their revenues from China and 10 percent from Europe, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Multinational sportswear company Adidas (DE:ADSGn) fell 2.5 percent, as the fear of an end to unfettered access to global markets also bruised luxury stocks  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Hermes (PA:HRMS), LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Moncler (MI:MONC).
Industrial conglomerate  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) was one of the biggest drags on the STOXX, along with French planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR). 
Mining shares (SXPP) tumbled 2.4 percent, tracking a decline in London copper prices amid the escalating trade tensions.
Highly valued tech stocks were also selling off as investors shed the sectors that have led the strong equity rally. The tech sector (SX8P) fell 1.4 percent, having hit a 17-year high as recently as Friday.

The most impressive falls were in the UK retail and housing sectors.  Debenhams  (L:DEB) shares plummeted 10 percent after the British department store warned on profits for the third time in six months, blaming its poor trading on increased competitor discounting and weakness in its key markets.

The family separations, documented by online videos of youngsters detained in cages, has put U.S. President Donald Trump back at the center of a furor over immigration, an issue he inflamed as a presidential candidate.
""It's heartbreaking to see the images and hear the sounds of the kids. Kids are the most vulnerable people in any society. I think that what’s happening is inhumane, it needs to stop,"" said the CEO of the world's biggest company by market capitalization.
""I’m personally a big believer in the way to be a good citizen is to participate, is to try to advocate your point of view, not to just sit on the sideline and yell or complain,"" he told The Irish Times in an interview during a visit to Ireland. 
""That will be the approach we will take here. This one in particular is just heartbreaking and tragic,"" Cook said.
Trump told Cook that the U.S. government would not levy tariffs on iPhones assembled in China, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing a source familiar with the negotiations.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Britain happy with Murdoch's Sky News guarantees,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox had answered its remaining doubts about the independence of Sky News if the U.S. company buys all of its parent Sky, paving the way for a takeover battle over the pay-TV group.
Fox in April offered to spin off Sky News to Walt Disney Co to head off objections that Murdoch could have too much influence if he owned Sky as well as his British newspapers.
Media Secretary Matt Hancock had said Fox's proposal was the best remedy for the public interest concerns, but he wanted some additional guarantees.
He said on Tuesday that Fox had secured a commitment from Disney to operate Sky News for 15 years rather than 10 years, an increase in the funds available for the channel to at least 100 million pounds ($132 million) a year, and a pledge to retain its editorial independence.
Hancock said the revised undertakings would help to ensure that Sky News remains financially viable over the long term, free from any potential outside influence.
The measures, which are subject to a 15-day public consultation, clear the way for a straight fight for Sky between Fox and its U.S. pay TV rival Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA).
Sky welcomed the decision, saying the UK approval process remained the only outstanding precondition that was stopping it putting Fox's offer to Sky shareholders.
Fox said it now looked forward to a final decision clearing its transaction.
Fox's long standing 10.75 pence-a-share offer was trumped by a 12.5-pounds-a-share bid from Comcast in April, valuing Sky at $31 billion.
The shares were trading at 13.37 pounds on Tuesday afternoon, suggesting investors think this takeover saga still has a long way to go. 
Even if Fox wins the battle for Sky, it is unlikely to own the asset for long.
Comcast and Disney are going head-to-head in the United States to buy most of Fox's TV and movie assets, a deal that would include its current 39 percent stake in Sky, and potentially all of Sky if Fox is successful in buying the group.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is in talks to rescue a plane sale to China thrown into doubt earlier this year shortly after a perceived gaffe by two European envoys over China's sensitive historical relationship with Japan, people familiar with the matter said.
The Airbus talks come as France's prime minister embarks this week on a trip to Beijing and as the United States threatens new tariffs on Chinese goods. French officials cautioned there were no signs of an imminent airplane deal.
State-controlled China Eastern is seeking 150 single-aisle jets like the Airbus A320 or the competing Boeing (N:BA) 737, industry sources said.
China's ICBC Financial Leasing has also expressed interest in placing an Airbus aircraft order, the sources said. 
The fate of a landmark Chinese order for 180 Airbus jets was left uncertain in January when French President Emmanuel Macron unexpectedly failed to clinch the order during a Beijing visit. China often marks such visits with industrial deals.
A person familiar with the January negotiations said they had been complicated by the fallout from comments published by French and German envoys over the 1937 Nanking Massacre, in which China says Japanese troops killed 300,000 people.
In an op-ed piece in the Financial Times in December, French and German ambassadors to China cited the political, economic and social dividends of post-war reconciliation between France and Germany and drew a thinly veiled comparison with China.
""Will it be possible to transfer the experiences of Europe to Asia? We cannot answer this question. But it is important to us to share our own experiences in the context with the anniversary of the beginning of the Nanjing massacre.""
Two people familiar with the matter said Chinese officials reacted coolly to the piece, deeming it unwarranted foreign advice on a painful episode in China's history.
The first person familiar with the talks said this had slowed preparations for Macron's visit, meaning that the necessary advance work for a plane sale and other deals had not been completed in time.
A French diplomatic source acknowledged that the article triggered a negative reaction but said there was no evidence that it was linked to the outcome of the plane talks.
Macron's office and Airbus declined comment. German officials were not immediately available. The Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Separately Hainan Airlines has emerged as the buyer in a deal for 15 A350 passenger jets, industry sources said. Airbus disclosed the order without identifying the buyer this month.

OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn on Tuesday won a battle for control of SandRidge Energy, winning at least four of seven seats on the board of the U.S. shale producer that he wants to sell. 
Shareholders elected four of Icahn's seven-person slate and two nominees put forth by the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma oil and gas company, according to preliminary results. 
The final director's position was too close to call, a company spokesman said.
The company's poison pill and executive compensation plan were rejected by shareholders, another victory for Icahn, who had urged a 'no' vote for both. 
Icahn, who owns a 13.6 percent stake in the company, launched a fight for control of the board this year, arguing directors overpaid company executives, signed off on a costly deal that was later withdrawn, and failed to pursue a February takeover proposal.
Shares in the Oklahoma City company were up 3 percent at $16.30 in morning trading. The stock has slipped 24 percent so far this year. 
Icahn was unavailable for immediate comment, a spokeswoman said, and a representative of the billionaire investor attending the meeting declined to comment. 
SandRidge's former chief executive and finance chief were ousted earlier this year as Icahn criticized management, and its board said it would conduct a strategic review that included a sale of some or all of the company. 
The company expanded its board, offering two new seats on it to the billionaire investor, but Icahn said he did not trust the existing board to manage a sale and nominated his own slate to replace them. 
SandRidge had argued Icahn wants to gain control of the company on the cheap by disrupting its directors' review of a sale of assets or the entire company. 
Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co, two firms that issue proxy recommendations, each backed four of SandRidge's board nominees. Both urged holders to vote against the company's poison pill and its executive compensation plan. 
Last year, 52 percent of SandRidge shareholders who voted cast ballots in favor of the executive compensation plan. 
Icahn last year challenged SandRidge's $746 million deal for rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc, forcing it to back away from a purchase he called too expensive and designed to benefit the company's management at the expense of shareholders. 

Shareholders elected Jonathan Christodoro, John Lipinski, Bob Alexander and Randolph Read from Icahn's slate. They also approved existing SandRidge directors Sylvia Barnes and William Griffin Jr.

(Reuters) - Fender Musical Instruments Corp, the iconic electric guitar maker whose instruments have powered music from Eric Clapton to contemporary acts like Daniel Caesar, is replacing its biggest-selling lineup of guitars as its sales tick up.
The Hollywood-based guitar maker is replacing its entry-priced ""Standard"" series of Stratocasters and Telecasters that it has sold for more than 25 years with a new ""Player"" series, tweaking nearly all their features. Fender plans to keep making the instruments in Mexico, CEO Andy Mooney told Reuters. While the company still builds its priciest guitars in the United States, the Mexican-made instruments sell the most units.
Fender is keeping the same basic shapes the guitars have had since the 1950s and 1960s - a smart move, said Brian Majeski, editor of the Music Trades, which gathers data on the instrument industry, because changes to classic designs can be fraught in the guitar business. Fender's chief rival, Gibson Brands Inc, installed computerized tuning machines on its instruments in 2015, a move that did not go over well with players.
A drop in sales, along with Gibson's ill-fated purchase of a consumer electronics business, contributed to its bankruptcy filing last month with $500 million in debt. 
Fender, by contrast, overhauled instrument details like the feel of the frets under a player's fingers and the electronics that reproduce the guitar's sound but skipped digital add-ons.
Fender ""has these guitars that are just deeply woven into our musical culture,"" Majeski said. ""They're not trying to turn them upside down.""
Fender made several moves in recent years to reach new players without sweeping changes to its core product. Last year, it launched software for online lessons to help retain players who give up after purchasing their first instrument.
Mooney told Reuters the software now has 50,000 active users on the $9.99 per month service. Mooney has also spearheaded an effort to get more women into Fender's marketing and artist sponsorship campaigns after company research revealed nearly half of first-time guitar buyers are women.
Privately held Fender does not disclose financials, but Mooney told Reuters it made slightly more than $500 million in revenue last year, has about $100 million in debt and is cash-flow positive. He said revenue growth was in the ""high single digits"" and outpaced the industry-wide sales growth rate for fretted instruments, which grew 7.3 percent to $1.9 billion, according to Music Trades data.

""We listened very intently to what our customers told us we need to do,"" Mooney said, ""and their preferences do change over time.""

But stock investors can protect themselves by betting on the industry’s best cash-flow generators.
JPMorgan, which expects Brent to drop to the mid-$60s a barrel from $75 in the near to medium term as the cartel shifts toward production increases, says it prefers sector stocks that aren’t directly tied to the oil price, but rather reflect the industry’s lowest break-even cash flow levels. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  BP  (LON:BP) and  Galp Energia  (LS:GALP) are companies with the highest proportion of high-margin barrels, according to the bank.
“If oil trends lower following the OPEC meeting, the companies that investors should be buying are the ones that are structurally well-placed to manage a lower oil price, because they’re starting at lower cash break evens,” Christyan Malek, an analyst at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in London, said by phone. “Our preference is not for companies that are geared to the oil price because we aren’t that bullish oil, but for companies who offer the lowest cash break evens, they’ve got the best cash flow per barrel.”
Brent has retreated as much as 8 percent from the 2014 high reached last month, dragging down the Stoxx 600 Oil & Gas Index, as Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries now appear to be aiming for a modest production boost to bridge the gap between Russia’s push for a big ramp-up and Iran’s insistence that no change is needed. The sector is among the region’s best performers this year, and is seen increasing 2018 earnings by 36 percent. At the same time, analysts have reduced projections for profit growth in 2019 to 6.3 percent from 12 percent at the start of the year.
“Oil stocks have performed well this year, but on a multi-year basis, they’re still underperforming,” Malek said. “Investors remain skeptical that the oil price that they see is the real oil price as this week has proved.”"

MUNICH (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) suspended Audi boss Rupert Stadler and announced an interim replacement on Tuesday, seeking to steady its most profitable business after German authorities arrested Stadler as part of an emissions probe.
Audi said Stadler, 55, had requested to temporarily step down from his position, and named sales executive Abraham Schot as an interim replacement with immediate effect, confirming an earlier Reuters story.
Stadler's arrest has thrown Volkswagen (VW) back into turmoil almost three years after it admitted to using illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests on diesel engines.
Analysts said the arrest raised questions about whether Europe's biggest carmaker had done enough to reform in the wake of the crisis, and that it threatened a delicate truce among the group's powerful stakeholders, who had previously clashed about whether Stadler should remain in power.
Schot joined the VW group in 2011 after having worked as president and CEO of Mercedes-Benz Italia. He has been Audi board member for sales and marketing since last September.
Munich prosecutors arrested Stadler at his home in Ingolstadt in the early hours of Monday, saying they saw a risk he could try to suppress evidence. Prosecutors tapped his phone, a person familiar with the investigation told Reuters.
He remains remanded in custody in Augsburg, but has not been charged with a crime. 
VW and Audi said on Monday that Stadler was presumed innocent unless proven otherwise. 
Last week, Munich prosecutors said they were investigating Stadler for suspected fraud and false advertising and for his alleged role in helping to bring cars equipped with illegal software on to the European market.
VW has set aside around $30 billion to cover the cost of fines, vehicle refits and lawsuits arising from its ""dieselgate"" scandal, and is spending billions more on electric vehicles to try to rebuild its reputation. 
VW has for years said only lower-level managers knew of the emissions cheating. However, U.S. authorities filed criminal charges against former VW boss Martin Winterkorn earlier this year, and German prosecutors continue to investigate.
DEVELOPED AT AUDI
The technique of using software to detect a pollution test procedure, and to increase the effectiveness of emissions filters to mask pollution levels during tests, was first developed at Audi.
""In designing the defeat device, VW engineers borrowed the original concept of the dual-mode, emissions cycle-beating software from Audi,"" VW said in its plea agreement with U.S. authorities in January 2017, in which the company agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine to reach a settlement with U.S. regulators.
Stadler has been under fire from the media, politicians and VW's powerful trade unions for his handling of the scandal, but he survived a management reshuffle announced in August thanks to backing from the Piech and Porsche families that control VW. 
Peter Mosch, deputy chairman on Audi's supervisory board and head of its works council, said labor representatives had backed a move to appoint Schot as interim CEO to ensure that Audi's business did not suffer from the leadership crisis.
""For the employees it is now important that the interim CEO returns the company to calmer waters, drives the (diesel) investigation and brings it to a conclusion, but mostly keeps the day-to-day business in view,"" he said in a statement.

At 1415 GMT, VW shares were down 3 percent at 151.48 euros, extending Monday's decline.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Embezzlement and bribery with government money are among the charges that Malaysia is looking to bring against former prime minister Najib Razak following a probe into funds allegedly looted from the state-run fund 1MDB, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday.
Mahathir told Reuters in an interview that Malaysian investigators already ""have an almost perfect case"" against the principal suspects who had defrauded 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and misappropriated billions of dollars in public funds.
He also described Najib, who founded 1MDB in 2009, as playing a central role.
""He was totally responsible for 1MDB. Nothing can be done without his signature, and we have his signature on all the deals entered into by 1MDB. Therefore, he is responsible,"" Mahathir said.
Having retired as prime minister in 2003 after 22 years in power, Mahathir - who is aged 92 - came out of retirement and joined the opposition to topple Najib in an election last month. 
Following his stunning victory, Mahathir has reopened investigations into 1MDB and Najib's involvement in its operations. 
As a result of an anti-kleptocracy probe, the U.S. Department of Justice has alleged more than $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB and that about $700 million of that ended up in Najib's personal bank accounts.
Mahathir has barred Najib from leaving Malaysia, and police have searched properties linked to him, while anti-graft investigators have questioned both Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor. 
Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing. He has said having the nearly $700 million transferred into his account had been a donation from an unnamed Saudi royal, an assertion Mahathir said the government was preparing to challenge in court.
Responding to Mahathir's comments, Najib denied doing anything illegal, but added that even if he had given any illegal orders at 1MDB, the management and board of the fund would not have been bound to act on it.
""As far as I am concerned, I did not do anything that I thought was illegal (with regards to 1MDB),"" Najib told Reuters. 
Investigators are looking to bring ""a number of charges"" against Najib, Mahathir said, adding those charges would be based on abuse of power when he was prime minister. 
They could include ""embezzlement, stealing government money, losing government money and a number of other charges. Using government money to bribe. All those things,"" he said.
Mahathir said Rosmah was also being investigated in connection with 1MDB. 
""Some of the money is believed to have gone to her, lots of money,"" Mahathir said. ""We know about this, but finding the paper trail is a bit more difficult in this case because she doesn't sign any papers. Najib signs a lot of papers.""
Mahathir said he expected Malaysia to make its first arrest in the 1MDB case within months and ""hopefully"" start a trial by the end of the year.
""We are working as hard as possible at a furious pace. We think that we already have almost a perfect case,"" Mahathir said. 
Asked to name the targets of that case, he said, ""Against Najib, against Jho Low and a few others.""
Low is a Malaysian financier, who is also seen as a central figure in the 1MDB scandal. He is regarded as close to Najib and his family. 
Low's lawyer could not be immediately reached for comment.
""When we go to the courts, we will have clear evidence of the wrongdoing. We cannot afford to lose,"" said Mahathir.
'NO DEAL'
The prime minister said Low had contacted him to try to make a deal on 1MDB -- seeking protection from prosecution in exchange for providing information, but Mahathir said he had turned down the offer. Asked if he would consider reaching any similar kind of arrangement with Najib, Mahathir said: ""No deal. No deal.""
Mahathir's promises to root out corruption and punish those responsible for the 1MDB fraud was central to his successful campaign to unseat Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition that had ruled Malaysia for over 60 years until last month.
Malaysian investigations into 1MDB were essentially shut down during Najib's premiership after the then-attorney general - who was sacked by Mahathir in his first few days in office - cleared him of any wrongdoing even as at least five other countries continued their own investigations. 
U.S. investigators had regarded Najib's government as obstructive, sources have said. Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber said last year that Malaysian authorities had refused to cooperate.
Mahathir on Tuesday said he was confident of recovering ""quite a lot"" of the lost 1MDB money, adding Malaysia will look into why Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was paid almost $600 million for helping 1MDB issue debt, an amount that critics say exceeded a normal level for fees.
Goldman raised nearly $6.5 billion in three bond sales between 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB.
Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told Reuters last week that Malaysia was looking at whether there were grounds for claims against Goldman Sachs and other banks that profited from 1MDB.
Mahathir, who turns 93 next month, is the world's oldest prime minister. Aides, political allies and Mahathir himself say he has been working long hours in his first six weeks, belying his age.
His stint as premier this time around is harder, said Mahathir, in part because of the challenge of rebuilding and restaffing key ministries.
""Before when I was prime minister, the structure of machinery was intact. This time around, I had to form a new government with people who have no experience. And then I find that all the ministries, all the departments have become corrupted.""
Asked if he believed there had been other abuses beyond 1MDB, he said: ""We don't know for sure, but we have felt that a lot of government money was abused, made use of by the government for non-government purposes.""
Mahathir said he also understood he could not make a clean sweep of suspected corruption and keep the government running, as it was hard to find ""reliable people"" to fill posts.
""We can't sack everybody,"" he said.

389,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>","UPS to spend $130 million on new natural gas vehicles, fueling stations","By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Package delivery company UPS (N:UPS) on Tuesday said it will invest $130 million to buy 730 compressed natural gas vehicles and build five more domestic CNG fueling stations as the industry moves to shift from petroleum-burning vehicles to those that use less-polluting alternative fuels.
 United Parcel  Service Inc, along with rivals such as FedEx Corp (N:FDX) and  Deutsche Post  AG (DE:DPWGn) unit DHL, faces pressure from regulators in major cities around the world to lessen the environmental impact of its fleet. 
UPS has set a goal to have a quarter of the new vehicles it buys running on alternative fuels by 2020. UPS also aims to replace 40 percent of its ground transportation fuel with sources other than conventional gasoline and diesel. 
""We strongly believe further investment in our natural gas fleet is a key element to help us achieve our long-term goals for reducing our CO2 emissions,"" said Carlton Rose, president of global fleet maintenance and engineering for UPS.
This latest move will bring its investment in alternative fuel vehicles and related projects to more than $1 billion over the last decade, Atlanta-based UPS said.
UPS said  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Freightliner and Paccar Inc's (O:PCAR) Kenworth will supply a total of 400 semi-tractors that pull trailers of goods, and that Terminal Investment Corp, or TICO, will supply it with 330 terminal trucks that move trailers at UPS sorting facilities. 
Deliveries of the new vehicles will start this summer and be completed by the end of November, Mike Casteel, director of fleet procurement for UPS, said.
They will become part of UPS' ""rolling laboratory"" of roughly 9,100 low-emission vehicles, including all-electric, hybrid electric, ethanol and CNG vehicles, to learn which technology works best for particular routes, the company said. 
UPS separately has partnered with Workhorse Group Inc (O:WKHS) to build an all-new electric delivery van with a driving range of 100 miles (160 km), the first of which may be delivered this year, Casteel said. It also has pre-ordered 125 electric semi-trucks from Tesla Inc (O:TSLA). 
Its new CNG fueling stations will be in Goodyear, Ariz., Plainfield, Ind., Edgerton, Kan., Fort Worth, Texas, and Arlington, Texas. Most stations will open in 2019, the company said. 

UPS currently operates more than 50 natural gas fueling stations across the United States, as well as one in Vancouver, Canada, and one in Tamworth, United Kingdom.

LONDON (Reuters) - An internal Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) report written by a former manager at the bank and published on Tuesday alleges serious misconduct by the lender over the handling and disclosure of a fraud at its HBOS Reading unit.
The report, written in 2013 after the Lloyds manager had taken her concerns to the police, alleges HBOS executives knew of the fraud as early as 2004 and failed to properly disclose it, with far-reaching implications given Lloyds' takeover of HBOS in 2009.
It also states Lloyds mishandled its investigation and disclosure of the fraud following that takeover.
""This report was provided to the FCA and the police at the time, in 2014,"" a spokesman for Lloyds said, referring to the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
The former Lloyds manager began looking into the bank's handling of the fraud case on her own initiative, and was then asked to write the report when she alerted the bank's Audit department, the Lloyds spokesman said.
Lloyds did not in its statement address the substance of the report's allegations that it misled investors over its financial health by not disclosing the fraud earlier.
Lawmakers last week urged Lloyds to publish the report, which the bank had declined to do on the grounds it contained sensitive information about its customers.
Scottish businessman Neil Mitchell, a frequent critic of Britain's big banks, published the report online on Tuesday, saying it was in the public interest.
The report has circulated privately among regulators and law enforcement officials for years but has not been made available to the public.
Six people including two former HBOS bankers were jailed last year for a combined 47 years for their role in the fraud, in which the conspirators enriched themselves at the expense of the bank’s business clients.
The report says that if HBOS had properly disclosed the fraud in its 2007 annual report, the 4 billion pound ($5.3 billion) 2008 rights issue that stabilized its precarious financial position, and its subsequent takeover by Lloyds, would not have happened.
Its publication comes at a sensitive time for Lloyds as it attempts to move past a painful legacy of missteps before and during the financial crisis.
That process has been complicated by ongoing scrutiny of the bank's handling of the HBOS fraud.
Britain's financial watchdog is conducting a probe into HBOS and what its executives knew of the fraud, while a retired judge is probing whether Lloyds then properly investigated the incident after it bought HBOS in 2009.
That report will likely not be published until late next year at the earliest, Reuters reported in May.
Britain's National Crime Agency has also widened a review into the fraud at HBOS to look into allegations that fell outside of the initial criminal investigation.

396,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>","Tesla Probing `Extensive' Sabotage by Rogue Employee, Musk Says","(Bloomberg) -- A disgruntled Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. employee broke into the company’s manufacturing operating system and sent highly sensitive data to unknown third parties, according to an email Elon Musk sent to staff.
The worker, who had been denied a promotion, did “quite extensive and damaging sabotage” to Tesla’s operations, Musk wrote in the memo late Sunday, which was reported in full by CNBC. While a spokesman declined to comment, an employee who asked not to be identified confirmed he received the email.
Tesla is conducting an in-depth investigation into the matter, including whether the worker was acting alone, with others at the company, or with any outside organizations, Musk wrote. The electric-car maker’s shares fell as much as 2.3 percent in early trading Tuesday.
“As you know, there are a long list of organizations that want Tesla to die,” Musk said. He referenced Wall Street short sellers “who have already lost billions of dollars,” oil and gas companies that “don’t love” to see solar power and electric cars advancing, and automakers that produce gasoline and diesel vehicles. “If they’re willing to cheat so much about emissions, maybe they’re willing to cheat in other ways?” he said.
Musk’s email comes as Tesla races to ramp up production of its critical Model 3 sedan to 5,000 cars a week. Last week, Musk announced that he was reorganizing the company and shrinking Tesla’s workforce by 9 percent in a bid for profitability. More than 3,000 workers lost their jobs, and notices filed with the state of California revealed that over 500 employees in Fremont and Palo Alto were dismissed.
Fremont police didn’t receive or respond to any calls for service at the Tesla plant over the weekend, according to a spokeswoman.
‘Strange Incident’
In a Monday email, Musk invoked a late tech titan in urging workers to keep an eye out for any funny business after a fire briefly halted car output. In a “strange incident that was hard to explain,” Musk wrote that a small fire on a manufacturing line had stopped production for several hours.
“Could just be a random event, but as Andy Grove said, ‘Only the paranoid survive,’” Musk wrote Monday, referring to the late chairman and CEO of  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). “Please be on the alert for anything that’s not in the best interests of our company.”
Tesla can ill afford manufacturing setbacks now. It’s racing to meet a target to build 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of this month, a goal Musk told shareholders on June 5 that the company was “quite likely” to achieve. The company’s forecasts for generating profit and cash in the third and fourth quarters of this year are based on this objective, and falling short would reignite concerns about whether the company may need to raise more capital.
A Tesla spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the Monday email, which CNBC reported first. Smoldering in an air filter in the welding area of Tesla’s body line was extinguished in a matter of seconds, she said. Production has resumed and there were no injuries or significant equipment damage, she added.
Tesla stock has climbed for seven consecutive days and more than $19 billion has been added to the automaker’s market capitalization in the past month, in part due to the confidence Musk has expressed in achieving the Model 3 production target. In a tweet Sunday, Musk warned that those betting against the company “have about three weeks before their short position explodes.”
Tesla is no stranger to concerns of sabotage. The company sued a former oil-services executive in 2016 for impersonating Musk in an email to former Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler. In the lawsuit, Tesla said the email was part of an oil-industry effort to undermine the company’s push for energy-efficient transportation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - SigFig, a San Francisco-based startup that provides wealth management technology to financial companies, has raised $50 million from investors, it said on Tuesday.
The fundraising round was led by investment firm General Atlantic, with participation from existing investors including UBS Group AG, Eaton Vance Corp and Bain Capital Ventures.
SigFig will use the funding to invest in developing new technology and expanding the type of services it offers clients including large banks such as UBS,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Citizens Bank, it said.
Founded in 2007, the company sells software to established large financial institutions to enable them to offer new digital service such as automated wealth management, known as robo-advice. SigFig also provides robo-advice directly to consumers. 
It also provides technology to enable human financial advisors to enhance their services.
""We have seen a remarkable uptick in banks wanting to partner with fintech companies,"" Mike Sha, CEO and co-founder of SigFig, said in an interview. 
Sha said the company could also offer products to help bank branch employees provide advice to clients.
SigFig's investment round comes as traditional wealth managers and banks seek to improve their online and digital offerings in the face of changing customer demands and more competition from tech-savvy startups.
In November, Wells Fargo launched a robo-advice service developed with technology from SigFig, while Citizens Bank partnered with the startup in late 2016 to help manage portfolios of middle-income people saving for retirement.
""The market for digitally-native investment advisors continues to grow due to increasing customer demand for accessible and affordable financial advice,"" Paul Stamas, managing director at General Atlantic, who will join the company's board of directors, said in a statement.
SigFig had last raised $40 million in a round led by Eaton Vance in 2016. 
The round announced on Tuesday was not much larger because SigFig was a ""very capital efficient"" business and does not need to spend lots of money on marketing, Sha said. He added that the company was not profitable yet ""by choice"", because it was reinvesting in growing the business.

Other investors in the round included DCM Ventures, New York Life, Nyca Partners and Union Square (NYSE:SQ) Ventures.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares of ZTE Corp (HK:0763) plummeted on Tuesday after the U.S. Senate's passage of a defense bill set up a potential battle with the White House over whether the Chinese telecoms firm can resume business with its U.S. suppliers.
The 85-10 bipartisan vote - one of the few times the Republican-led Senate has veered from White House policy - came on the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods, escalating tensions between the world's two biggest economies.
Trump is, however, expected to lobby hard against the amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and before it can become law, the bill must be reconciled with one passed by the House of Representatives that does not include the amendment.
Any compromise measure must then be passed by both chambers and signed into law by Trump - a series of hurdles that has Asia-based analysts punting that ZTE will get eventually get its reprieve.
""The NDAA is not really a reversal of the ZTE deal, but will in all probability prolong the ban-lifting process for ZTE,"" said Nikhil Batra, a senior research manager with industry consultancy IDC.
ZTE's Hong Kong-listed shares tumbled as much as 27 percent to HK$9.56, their lowest level in nearly two years, before ending the day down 25 percent. Its Shenzhen shares fell by their daily limit of 10 percent.
The stock has lost around 38 percent, or more than $7.4 billion in market value, since trading resumed last week after a suspension in mid-April when the sanctions were announced.
""The longer it goes by without the ban being lifted, the more uncertain and damaging it is,"" said Jefferies analyst Edison Lee.
ZTE was hit in April with a seven-year ban barring U.S. suppliers selling to it after it broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea.
At Trump's urging, ZTE and the U.S. Commerce Department reached an agreement on June 7 to have the supplier ban, which has prevented ZTE from buying the U.S. components it relies on to make smartphones and other devices, lifted.
According to the agreement, the ban would only be lifted after ZTE pays a $1 billion fine and puts another $400 million in escrow in a U.S. approved bank for 10 years. It was also ordered to radically overhaul its management.

Last Wednesday, ZTE proposed a $10.7 billion financing plan and nominated eight board members as it seeks to rebuild its business.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters/IFR) - Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has lowered its likely valuation to between $55 billion and $70 billion following its decision to delay its mainland share offering until after its Hong Kong IPO, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The delay was triggered by a dispute between the company and regulators over the valuation of its China depositary receipts (CDRs), sources said, casting doubt on Beijing's efforts to lure foreign-listed Chinese tech giants back home.
Xiaomi Corp [IPO-XMGP.HK] (XTC.UL) is using a range of $55 billion to $70 billion in its discussions with potential cornerstone investors ahead of the planned launch of its Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) later this week, three sources said. 
The sources declined to be named because the discussions were not public. Xiaomi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the valuation.
The new valuation is far below the $100 billion touted by sources earlier this year and below the more recent floor price of $70 billion that the company and its advisers had informally used as guidance for investors.
Pre-IPO research from its sponsoring banks valued the group at between $65 billion and $86 billion, Thomson Reuters' IFR reported last week.
The company said it was asking regulators to postpone its application to sell CDRs, but gave no reason for the decision. 
""After iterative, careful research, the company has decided to implement its Hong Kong and mainland IPO in a measured way,"" Xiaomi said in a post on its Weibo account.
""We'll list in Hong Kong first, before going public on the mainland through the CDR.""
Beijing-based, Cayman-domiciled Xiaomi had been expected to raise up to $10 billion, split between its Hong Kong and mainland offerings in one of the biggest tech floats worldwide in recent years. Two sources said it was looking to sell about 10 percent of its enlarged capital in the Hong Kong offering.
The delay to its CDRs is a blow for Chinese officials, who have designed the offerings as a means for China to compete globally for major tech listings and give mainland investors access to its tech champions. 
Other companies known to be considering CDRs include  Alibaba  (N:BABA), search engine giant Baidu (O:BIDU) and JD.com (O:JD), Alibaba's e-commerce rival.
In Xiaomi's case, officials from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) wanted the CDRs to be priced below the level the company was targeting, according to two sources. 
Commission officials were concerned that a too-high valuation would lead to poor performance in the secondary market, damping investor enthusiasm for future CDR sales, the sources said.
Xiaomi executives on the other hand were looking for a high mainland price to help generate excitement among Hong Kong investors, whose tranche was expected to debut the day after the CDRs went public.
CSRC officials did not respond to requests for comment.
FRAILTIES EXPOSED
Xiaomi was set up in 2010 and doubled its smartphone shipments in 2017 to become the world’s fourth-largest maker, according to Counterpoint Research, defying a global slowdown in smartphone sales.
Its listing has come at a delicate time for China's stock markets, with the CSI 300 index of the country's top blue-chips falling 4.3 percent this month and 10.9 percent this year amid fears of a trade war with the United States.
""The China stock market is so fragile,"" said David Dai, general manager of Shanghai Wisdom Investment Co Ltd, a hedge fund. ""I think Xiaomi is worried about its valuation, and is considering a China listing at a better time."" 
The government needed to stabilize the market if it wanted to preserve its ability to raise capital for companies, he added.
Xiaomi is still expected to go ahead with its Hong Kong listing, which it plans to kick off later this week. The exact size of the Hong Kong deal is not yet clear, said the sources. 
CDRs were due to account for around half of the combined Hong Kong and mainland issuance, Xiaomi said last week.
Difficulties with finalizing the details of CDR rules and scheduling issues also contributed to the delays, sources said.

411,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2018 03:49AM ET</span>",Roche pays $2.4 billion for rest of cancer expert Foundation Medicine,"By Michael Shields and Ben Hirschler
ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche (S:ROG) is paying $2.4 billion to buy the rest of  Foundation  Medicine (FMI) (O:FMI), raising its bet on the U.S. genomic profiling group's ability to personalize cancer care.
The deal, backed by the boards of both companies, is worth $137 per share - a premium of 29 percent to FMI's closing price on Monday - valuing the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company at $5.3 billion.
The transaction is set to close in the second half of this year, the partners said in a statement on Tuesday.
It is the latest in a series of bolt-on acquisitions by Roche as the world's largest marker of cancer drugs seeks to tap into promising technology developed by biotech companies to drive future growth as its older drugs face competition.
Earlier this year it agreed to buy the rest of U.S. cancer data company Flatiron Health for $1.9 billion in a similar deal. Both purchases echo its success in taking control of California-based biotech company Genentech 28 years ago.
FMI develops tests to help doctors understand the genetic profile of patients' tumors and guide them to effective therapies. 
Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider said the deal fitted very well with Roche's position as an early leader in matching treatment to genetic profiles.
""This isn't only an advantage for the patients, but also should allow Roche to have more effective and targeted drugs, which should improve drug development and ultimately pricing power,"" he said.
Roche pharmaceuticals head Daniel O'Day said such technology was ""important to our personalized healthcare strategy as we believe molecular insights and the broad availability of high quality comprehensive genomic profiling are key enablers for the development of, and access to, new cancer treatments"".
FMI develops comprehensive genomic profiling assays to identify molecular alterations in a patient's cancer and match them with targeted therapies, immunotherapies and clinical trials.
The Swiss group said is planned to preserve FMI's autonomy within the wider Roche group, mirroring the approach of quasi-independence it pioneered with Genentech.
Roche first bought a 56 percent stake in FMI for $1 billion in 2015, so it has already seen the investment grow in value.
But it has a long way to go match the value creation achieved at Genentech, where Roche bought 60 percent of the company for just $2.1 billion in 1990 and enjoyed a string of blockbuster drugs. Roche finally bought out minority investors in Genentech in 2008 for $47 billion. 

Citi (N:C) is acting as financial advisers to Roche and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP is legal counsel to Roche. Goldman Sachs & Co (N:GS) is financial adviser to the FMI Special Committee and Goodwin Procter LLP is legal counsel.

In a statement on Monday, Trump said he had asked U.S. representatives to identify Chinese goods that would be subject to a new 10% tariffs. The move would be in retaliation for China’s decision to raise tariffs on $50 billion in U.S. goods, which was in itself in response to new U.S. tariffs. 
""China apparently has no intention of changing its unfair practices related to the acquisition of American intellectual property and technology. Rather than altering those practices, it is now threatening United States companies, workers, and farmers who have done nothing wrong,"" said Trump.  
He added that ""after the legal process is complete, these tariffs will go into effect if China refuses to change its practices, and also if it insists on going forward with the new tariffs that it has recently announced.” 
In response, China’s Ministry of Commerce also issued a statement on Tuesday indicating that Beijing will fight back with “qualitative” and “quantitative” measures if the additional list of tariffs on Chinese goods becomes reality. 
“Such a practice of extreme pressure and blackmailing deviates from the consensus reached by both sides on multiple occasions, and is a disappointment for the international community,” noted the ministry’s statement. 
“The United States has initiated a trade war and violated market regulations and is harming the interests of not just the people of China and the U.S., but of the world,” the ministry said. 
On Friday, Trump said he was pushing ahead with a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese products. 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also fell 2.5%. Telecoms firm ZTE Corp (HK:0763) plunged 25.5% on Tuesday after the U.S. Senate’s passage of a defence bill casted doubt over whether the company could resume business with its U.S. suppliers.
Xiaomi Corp also raised some eyebrows on Tuesday after the company said it is postponing its China depository receipts (CDR) offering until after it completes its listing in Hong Kong.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese stocks slid on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump's new threat to impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods, escalating a tit-for-tat trade war with Beijing.
The Nikkei share average fell 0.9 percent (N225) to two-week lows of 22,482.89, slipping further from last week's high just above 23,000. The broader Topix (TOPX) declined 0.7 percent to 1,758.35, hitting its lowest levels since June 1.
Trump's remarks came just days after he said on Friday he was pushing ahead with a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese products, which immediately prompted Beijing to respond in kind.
""Concerns about trade frictions between the U.S. and China intensified after Trump's comments,"" said Hideyuki Ishiguro, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
""Although the latest data showed Japanese exports were strong in May, if China's exports to the United States slow down, that would slow down capital spending in China,"" he said. 
With Washington and Beijing appearing increasingly headed toward open trade conflict, investors dumped shares of companies geared to global trade and Chinese demand.
Shin-etsu Chemical (T:4063) fell 2.9 percent to nine-month lows, having fallen almost 15 percent over the past month.
Construction equipment maker Komatsu (T:6301) fell 1.6 percent, hitting an 8-1/2-month low.
Despite the specter of intensifying protectionism, the current strength of the global economy is also prompting some investors to flock to shares that are perceived to have limited exposures to a trade war.
Tokyo Disney Resort operator Oriental Land Corp (T:4661) hit a record high while Central Japan Railway (T:9022) scaled 3-1/2-year peaks, before giving up gains on profit-taking. They both ended morning trade down 0.2 percent. 
Flea market app operator  Mercari  Inc's (T:4385) started trading at 5,000 yen, 66 percent above its IPO price of 3,000 yen in its Tokyo stock market debut, underscoring strong investor appetite for a rare Japanese unicorn.

""We have a rush of IPOs, a total of 11 by the end of month. While major shares are being hampered by trade concerns, investors' focus could shift to start-up shares,"" said Masayuki Doshida, senior market analyst at Rakuten Securities.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Monday in an email to staff that an unnamed Tesla employee had conducted ""extensive and damaging sabotage"" to the company's operations including allegedly making unspecified code changes to its manufacturing operating system and sending what the email said was sensitive Tesla data to unnamed third parties.
Company spokeswoman Gina Antonini declined to comment on the email.
Musk said in the email, which was seen by Reuters, that he learned about this alleged behavior over the weekend. 
""The full extent of his actions are not yet clear, but what he has admitted to so far is pretty bad,"" Musk wrote. ""His stated motivation is that he wanted a promotion that he did not receive."" Musk did not specify to whom he was referring.
Reuters could not independently confirm any of the claims in the email.
Musk wrote that the company would be investigating the matter this week, adding that Tesla needed to determine if the person was acting alone or in concert with ""any outside organizations.""
""As you know, there are a long list of organizations that want Tesla to die,"" Musk wrote, saying they included Wall Street short-sellers, oil and gas companies, and car company rivals but naming none. 
Earlier on Monday, Musk sent a separate email to employees informing them of a ""small fire"" on Sunday at a company facility. The email was seen by Reuters.
Tesla said in an email that on Sunday night there had been a ""smoldering in an air filter in the welding area of the body line. The smoldering was extinguished in a matter of seconds. There were no injuries or significant equipment damage, and production is back online.” The company did not specify the location of the fire, which Reuters was unable to independently confirm.
Musk said in the email that while the fire could have been a random event, ""Please be on the alert for anything that’s not in the best interests of our company.""
Last week, Musk announced that nine percent of the company's workforce was being laid off, without specifying an exact number.
Musk said the reorganization did not affect hourly assembly-line employees and was not expected to delay manufacturing targets. 
Tesla’s future long-term profitability hinges on ramping up Model 3 output, which is intended for mass production. 

Tesla's stock price slipped 53 cents to $370.30 in after-hours trading on Monday.

Its Hong Kong shares slid to their lowest since July 2016, while its Shenzhen stock fell its 10-percent daily limit on Tuesday. The U.S. Senate passed legislation on Monday that would restore penalties on the company, complicating President Donald Trump’s efforts to ease sanctions on ZTE after it pays a record fine and reshuffles management.
The agreement was struck after the U.S. in April blocked ZTE’s access to U.S. suppliers, saying it had broken a sanctions settlement and then lied about it. That prompted the company to declare it was shutting down just weeks after the ban took effect. It was deemed a key Chinese demand as the world’s two largest economies try to avoid a trade war and negotiate the denuclearization of North Korea. After a personal plea from Chinese President Xi Jinping to help the company get back into business, Trump last month instructed the commerce department to find a solution to save ZTE.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in recent weeks have tried to persuade lawmakers of the administration’s approach to ZTE, but legislators said the deal failed to address their national-security concerns."

422,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",China's Struggling Stock Market Faces Hit From Tariff Tensions,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s stocks, already languishing at the lowest level in almost two years, face another setback after the U.S. outlined $34 billion of tariffs that include products made by high-flying listed firms.
The first wave of 25 percent import levies will take effect on July 6, the White House said last week, in response to what President Donald Trump has called decades of theft of American know-how. The tariffs target Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Made in China 2025 plan that seeks to develop sophisticated manufacturing capabilities. For example, printed circuit boards; China’s biggest maker of those, Shennan Circuits Co., has tripled since its December initial public offering.
While “growth wise it’s unlikely to be too much of a dent, for the equity space, there’s a worry that it might topple the market over,” said Jingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist at IG Asia Pte Ltd. With investors also having to contend with a slowing Chinese economy and a strengthening U.S dollar, the selloff in mainland equities is poised to deepen, she said by phone.
About two hours before Chinese markets open on Tuesday, Trump upped the ante again, saying in a statement that he had directed officials to identify $200 billion of Chinese goods for an additional 10 percent tariff.
The ratcheting up of tensions is a blow to sentiment in the struggling $7.2 trillion equity market, where turnover has been dwindling on concern that the trade spat will hurt China’s already-slowing economy. More specifically, it’s a direct challenge to high-tech investing themes, which were some of the hottest plays last year.
Beijing retaliated last week with tariffs that are politically sensitive to Trump and withdrew any compromises achieved during prior negotiations. Analysts increasingly expect the confrontation to be a war of attrition as the two sides confront the chasm between them, while Beijing has signaled it won’t accept major changes to the Made in China 2025 blueprint.
The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.5 percent last week to close Friday at the lowest since Sept. 30, 2016. Markets in China and Hong Kong were shut on Monday for holidays.
The benchmark mainland index plunged 2.5 percent the day after Trump said he was moving ahead with the tariffs in late May, and has slumped 14 percent since Washington imposed levies on solar-panel imports in January, an industry dominated by China. It’s trading at the lowest level versus the MSCI All-Country World Index since November 2014.
Still, the Shanghai Composite is now hovering just above 3,000 points, a level that it’s bounced off in the past. Some institutional investors are “proactively” making plans to buy A-shares and will buy more if the gauge falls under 3,000, the China Securities Journal reported Tuesday, without saying where it got the information or identifying the institutions.
The latest tariff list “keeps trade war risks alive,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital, which manages A$188 billion ($140 billion). It’s more “classic Art of the Deal stuff” with an agreement likely in the coming weeks, “but the risks are high and the tariffs could well be implemented before the issue is resolved,” he said in an emailed note.
These are some of the Chinese products in the cross-hairs, according to the U.S. list released last week:

423,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",Apple Supplier Is Worst China Performer After Screen Prices Drop,"(Bloomberg) -- BOE Technology Group Co.’s stock market reversal is dramatic even by China’s outsized standards. It took less than a year for the Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). supplier to go from one of the nation’s best-performing stocks to among its worst -- a precipitous selloff that may not be over.
China’s largest maker of screens for TVs and phones shed more than 32 percent of its value this year, the steepest decline among the 50 biggest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. That was prompted by ballooning supply and plunging prices for the large screens that comprise most of its business. Even earning a coveted spot on Apple’s list of top 200 suppliers couldn’t overcome fears that demand-supply imbalances will persist, analysts say.
That’s a far cry from 2017, when its shares more than doubled, net income quadrupled and executives talked up their prospects of getting into lucrative smartphone screens. It ranked fifth in terms of gains among mainland China’s 50 largest publicly traded stocks. And the company sketched bold plans to get into next-generation OLED or organic light-emitting diode screens and of supplying future iPhones.
“BOE’s ride is over. Right now I can’t see catalysts for growth,” said Zhang Haidong, head of research for Jinkuang Investment Management. “Despite getting onto Apple’s suppliers list, its prospects remain tied to TVs, and they don’t look great.”
Valuation is part of the challenge. Despite its recent slide, BOE trades at more than 15 times current-year earnings, a higher multiple than industry leader Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. The Chinese company is now ramping up capacity to goose sales, while developing OLED screens in hopes of catching a wave of longer-term business. It completed and brought online a massive production plant for 65-inch-plus screens and began construction on another this year -- just as demand globally waned and prices fell.
That influx of capacity is not good news for an already depressed market. Prices for benchmark 65-inch panels dived 39 percent from last year’s peak to about $250 in June, according to Trendforce estimates compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Demand typically peaks however in the third quarter ahead of the all-important holidays, which could prop up prices. And the World Cup could provide a boost as consumers replace ageing TVs. Stock-wise, BOE’s still a tad cheaper than fellow Chinese display maker Tianma Microelectronics Co., which is hovering around 18 times current-year earnings.
But with capacity fundamentally continuing to outstrip demand, any gains may prove short-lived. In OLED, rivals Samsung and LG Display Co. have had a headstart -- the former is the sole supplier of the screens to Apple’s iPhone X. The cost of ramping up its screen capacity will also weigh on BOE’s margins in the near term.
BOE may thus never replicate its 2017 achievement -- it’s expected to average annual profit growth of 22 to 33 percent from 2018 to 2020, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Its top-line is expected to slow: analysts on average are projecting annual revenue growth of 25.2 percent over the next three years, down from the average of 30 percent over the past half-decade.
“Large panel prices won’t bottom till July at the earliest, and I don’t see any reversal in the trend,” said Iris Hu, an analyst with consultancy Trendforce.

The two divisions - the private client group overseen by David Kowach and wealth brokerage services overseen by Jay Welker - have long overlapped. Both employ financial advisers who work with mass affluent clients.
However the businesses are organized in different channels. Wealth brokerage services, which employs brokers who work in bank branches, is in the same section of the bank as the private bank, which employs wealth managers who advise the ultra-rich. 
During the bank's investor day conference in March, Jon Weiss, head of wealth and investment management, said Wells Fargo is exploring ways to increase efficiency among the bank's wealth businesses.
Wells Fargo Advisors spokeswoman Shea Leordeanu wrote in an emailed statement, ""No final decisions have been made because that work continues. Whatever the outcome, we will continue to serve our clients across multiple channels – community bank branches, advisor-led branches, FiNet, online and by phone - because our clients expect that from us Wells Fargo.""
Weiss is expected to address the plans on Thursday during a town hall-style meeting with brokers. 
The bank's plans to restructure were reported earlier on Monday by the Wall Street Journal. 

The bank had said in March it was examining its wealth and investment management division for possible customer abuse, including overcharging and inappropriate referrals, after inquiries from government agencies.

426,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 06:49PM ET</span>","AT&T promises fewer ads, tailored programing after merger","By Lisa Richwine
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T) is promising fewer commercials, smaller channel bundles and personalized programming now that it has taken over Time Warner channels in an $85 billion mega-merger.
After overcoming the U.S. Justice Department's objection that the deal would harm competition, AT&T, the country's number two wireless operator, said it will use its technology to reinvent how consumers receive and view entertainment.
A major aim is to reduce the number of commercials now that customers are accustomed to ad-free services such as Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), said John Stankey, chief executive of newly named AT&T unit WarnerMedia.
""One of the big benefits we can bring to the market is lighter ad loads,"" Stankey told Reuters in an interview.
AT&T, long dominant in the U.S. telephone industry, is now at the forefront of Hollywood with its purchase of Time Warner, which owned HBO, the Warner Brothers film and television studios, and Turner Broadcasting and CNN.
AT&T plans to use mobile phone and video data, supplied by customers who have given permission, to sell targeted advertisements. The thinking is that brands will pay more if they know their message is reaching someone likely to be interested in it. 
For example, ""if I'm a beer drinker, I'm more interested in seeing things about beer than soft drinks,"" Stankey said.
Some of Time Warner's Turner networks already have cut the number of commercials. Comedy network TruTV, for example, has reduced ad time by roughly 50 percent.
AT&T ""absolutely"" should be able to further reduce ad inventory across Turner networks, Stankey said.
AUTOMATED MARKETPLACE
The company will start selling targeted ads for Turner networks such as TNT and CNN ""in short order,"" Stankey said. 
An industry-wide, automated marketplace, which would sell ads across other companies' channels, would require cooperation across multiple players, and Stankey acknowledged that remains ""easily a year off.""
The Justice Department and other critics had argued that AT&T's purchase of Time Warner would harm consumers by limiting competition and leading to price increases. But a U.S. judge disagreed, and AT&T completed the merger last week. The government still may appeal.
AT&T now owns popular properties such as ""Game of Thrones"" along with the Harry Potter and Wonder Woman franchises. In the coming days, it will launch AT&T Watch, a package of Turner networks plus some from other media companies, Stankey said. 
Designed as a general entertainment package that is smaller than traditional cable bundles, AT&T Watch will not carry sports-specific networks, Stankey said. 
AT&T also plans to tailor programing to customer interests, such as by sending CNN news clips to mobile phone users based on their interests, or alerts about types of programing they might like based on earlier viewing, Stankey said.
Customers of HBO's online services should not expect any immediate change to the company's stance on password sharing, Stankey said. HBO limits the number of simultaneous streams but has accepted that some password sharing will occur.
AT&T is comfortable with password sharing among family members and believes most cases occur among people with a close relationship to someone who pays for the service, Stankey said. 

""If somebody becomes really passionate about doing something through password sharing, and at some point they get hooked on it, they move into being a paying subscriber,"" he said.

427,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Canada mulls auto firms aid in response to U.S. tariffs threat,"By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is considering all options, including providing financial aid to the auto industry, to cope up with possible U.S. tariffs, a senior federal minister said, even as officials expressed doubt Washington would follow through with a threat to impose the punitive measures.
U.S. President Donald Trump last month said he might impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on foreign-built automobiles, which could cause major economic damage to Canada and a heavily integrated North American industry.
After Trump slapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum on May 31, government ministers promised to support the sectors, and Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains told Reuters the same kind of aid could be ready for the auto industry.
""We're examining all options ... our view is that if any such action is taken, we're going to support our workers,"" he said in an interview last week.
""The message I would convey to the auto sector workers is - we have your backs.""
The bill could run into billions of dollars, depending on the extent of government support for the industry, which represents about 500,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributes around C$80 billion ($60.5 billion) to the economy a year.
Last year, Ottawa responded with a package worth C$867 million after the United States imposed tariffs on softwood lumber exports.
A Scotiabank analysis released Friday said steel and auto tariffs would knock growth in Canada down to 1.2 percent in 2020 from 2.1 percent in 2018, enough to force the Bank of Canada to cut rates.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is already under pressure for breaking a promise to balance the federal budget by 2020. Ottawa says there is now no target date for eliminating the deficit.
Trudeau's Liberals will need support from auto sector workers to win re-election in October 2019.
""We'd need to have an aid package; that's for damn sure,"" said Jerry Dias, head of the influential Unifor private sector union, when asked about auto tariffs.
Trudeau - in remarks to Reuters and other media outlets - said he thinks the auto tariffs threat is designed to gain leverage at talks to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) pact, where Canada and Mexico are resisting U.S. demands for major changes.
One Canadian government source, noting that an automobile crosses the countries' shared border six or seven times before it is completed, suggested the threat was unworkable.
""When would you impose the tariff - the first time? The fifth time? The seventh time?"" asked the official, who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity of the situation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Wendy's (O:WEN) restaurant in Oklahoma is under fire after an employee video showing a mouse inside a bag of hamburger buns was widely shared online.
The Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) video was filmed at a Wendy's restaurant in Catoosa, Oklahoma, the employee, Sky Frame, said in a post. It showed a mouse peering out among the buns. 
""Not only does Wendy's now have mice - we have crew members who leave cigarettes all over the place. Don't eat at Wendy's in Catoosa,"" Frame wrote on Facebook, alongside the June 14 video and a picture showing an unlit cigarette at a food prep station.
A Wendy's spokesperson said the local health department visited the restaurant on Friday and found no violations.
""This is an isolated incident at the restaurant; it did not happen at the vendor or distribution levels,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. 
""Our franchisee is aware of this situation and is taking this matter very seriously. They immediately launched an investigation with their pest control vendor and internal quality assurance experts to ensure immediate and appropriate action is taken,"" the spokesperson said.

The derivatives regulator said the bank made false reports and attempted to manipulate the U.S. Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix to benefit its derivatives positions.
ISDAfix rates are used to help value the cash settlement of options on interest rate swaps and other products. Pension funds and local governments often rely on products priced off the benchmark rate to help hedge against future interest rate changes.
The benchmark swap rates and spreads that are published daily indicate the prevailing mid-market rate, at a specific time of day, for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swap.
""We're pleased to have this matter behind us,"" JPMorgan spokeswoman Jessica Francisco said.Other big banks including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) PLC and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) had to settle similar charges relating to ISDAfix benchmark case with the regulator in 2015 and 2016.

1. U.S. Housing Data, U.S. China Trade Spat in Focus
With the U.S.-China trade spat garnering the bulk of investor attention, an update on the U.S. housing market could prove a timely distraction.
The Commerce Department at 08:30 ET is expected to report building permits fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.350 million units, while housing starts are forecast to rise 1.4% to 1.310 million units.
A speech by Fed official James Bullard at 7:00AM ET is expected to be scrutinised for further signs U.S. central bank members remain hawkish on monetary policy tightening following the Fed's rate hike last week.
Shares of  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) will likely also also be in focus after the aircraft maker added to last week's slump – the worst since March – on worries over an escalating trade war with China.
China is one Boeing biggest customers - one out of every four Boeing jetliners produced is reportedly delivered to Chinese customers.
The dollar made a subdued start to the week as trade tensions fuelled demand for safe-haven currencies like the USD/JPY and USD/CHF.
2. API Data Eyed Ahead of OPEC Meeting
A fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) due Tuesday will be monitored to establish whether the draw in U.S. crude inventories can continue for the second straight week.
The American Petroleum Institute reported last Tuesday crude oil stockpiles rose by 0.833 million barrels. That was in sharp contrast to the Energy Information Administration's report showing crude supplies fell by 2.101 million barrels.
Oil prices were in rebound mode on Monday amid a report that OPEC was considering a modest output hike to placate both Russia's demands for a large increase in production and Iran's view that output curbs should remain in place.
Crude oil futures on Monday settled 1.30% higher at $65.69 a barrel.
3. Bitcoin Bounce Nears Key Test
Bitcoin sprung to life in late afternoon U.S trade, hitting a nearly one week high amid a report Square (NYSE:SQ)'s Cash app was approved for crypto trading. 
New York's Department of Financial Services Monday granted a virtual currency license, or so-called BitLicense, to Square's Cash app, allowing users to buy and sell bitcoin instantly. 
Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) rose 3.18% to $6,706 on the Bitfinex exchange and looked set for test for a test of $7,100, which some crypto observers have recently identified as resistance – price levels that trigger selling. A significant push above this level could trigger further fund inflows, supporting a move higher in the popular crypto.
The total market cap of cryptocurrencies rose to about $287 billion, at the time of writing, from about $268 billion last week."
442,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 04:22PM ET</span>",Fujifilm sues Xerox for well over $1 billion after aborted merger,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fujifilm Holdings Corp sued  Xerox Corp  (NYSE:XRX) on Monday for well over $1 billion, faulting the printer and copier company for succumbing to pressure from activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason in calling off a proposed merger.
In a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Fujifilm accused Xerox of breach of contract and engaging in ""intentional and egregious conduct"" in abandoning the $6.1 billion merger announced in January.
Icahn, the billionaire, and Deason together owned 15 percent of Xerox shares, and said the merger undervalued the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company.
""It is inconsistent with shareholder democracy to allow Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, minority shareholders with only 15 percent of Xerox's shares, to dictate the fate of Xerox,"" Fujifilm said in a statement.
The merger was scrapped on May 13 when Xerox, in a settlement with Icahn and Deason, agreed to install several new directors and replace Jeff Jacobson as chief executive with technology executive John Visentin.
Xerox also cited unresolved accounting issues as a reason to end the merger.
In a statement on Monday, Xerox said it remained ""extremely confident"" it had a contractual right to back out, and would seek remedies for Fujifilm's ""mismanagement and misconduct.""
A spokeswoman for Deason had no immediate comment. Icahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Xerox has been exploring strategic options, including transactions with other companies, but the lawsuit could force it to address Fujifilm's grievances sooner.
A merger would have combined Xerox with the 56-year-old joint venture Fujifilm Xerox, in which Fujifilm and Xerox had stakes of 75 percent and 25 percent, respectively.
Thereafter, Fujifilm would have owned 50.1 percent of Xerox's common stock, and Xerox shareholders would have received a $2.5 billion special dividend.
Fujifilm had hoped the merger would deliver at least $1.7 billion of cost savings and $1 billion of new revenue annually.
Its lawsuit also seeks punitive damages and a $183 million merger termination fee.
""Xerox has recently been subject to the whims of activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who, notwithstanding their minority ownership of Xerox shares, have yanked the Xerox Board in more directions than can be counted,"" Fujifilm said.
Fujifilm has appealed an April 27 temporary injunction sought by Deason and granted by a New York state judge to block the merger.
Deason, who had accused Jacobson of arranging the merger to keep his job, is still pursuing a lawsuit accusing Fujifilm of aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty by Xerox's old board. Fujifilm filed counterclaims on June 14.
Xerox shares closed down 17 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $27.24 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The case is Fujifilm Holdings Corp v Xerox Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-05458.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: KKR close to signing deal for Altice's telecom towers - sources,"By Andrés González and Pamela Barbaglia
MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR (N:KKR) is close to buying a stake in the telecom towers business of Altice (AS:ATCA), three sources told Reuters, a deal that will help the telecoms and cable group to pay down debt and reshape its European operations.
Under the deal, which is being finalised, KKR will use its infrastructure fund to take a minority interest in Altice's towers subsidiary in France, the sources said.
The U.S. buyout group has trumped rival bids from private equity firm Blackstone (N:BX) and a consortium led by the infrastructure investment arms of insurers Allianz (DE:ALVG) and  Axa  (PA:AXAF) which also made it to the final stages of the auction, the sources said.
KKR declined to comment while Altice and the other bidders were not immediately available for comment.
Altice, whose debt equals more than twice its annual revenues, is rushing to finalize a series of non-core disposals involving telecoms towers in France and Portugal and its entire operations in the Dominican Republic.
Its founder Patrick Drahi has pledged to shift the company's focus from large acquisitions to sales growth and debt management.
The group's French masts could be valued at about 4 billion euros, according to estimates by RBC analysts, representing a multiple of 20 times its core earnings.
Altice's SFR division has around 20,000 tower sites in France although some of these assets belong to a joint venture platform with French mobile firm  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY).
The tower auction, which kicked off earlier this year, attracted interest from several heavyweight investors with Allianz and Axa joining a consortium with Digital Colony and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the sources said.
For KKR this is not the first minority deal in the telecom towers industry. Last year, it bought a 40 percent stake in Telefonica's telecom masts subsidiary Telxius for 1.3 billion euros.
As part of the Telxius deal, KKR also gained significant exposure to an international network with approximately 65,000 kilometers of submarine fiber optic cables.
Altice's reorganization, which involves the spin off of Altice's U.S. arm, is expected to complete toward the end of June and proceeds from the various auctions will be used to cut debt which rose to around $60 billion following a series of big ticket deals. 

In the United States, Drahi spent $28 billion in 2015 to buy cable companies Suddenlink and Cablevision (NYSE:CVC), and even flirted with a $185 billion bid for cable giant Charter.

PARIS (Reuters) - When French President Emmanuel Macron laid out a sweeping vision for eurozone reform last September, he spoke of ""rebuilding Europe"", with a common budget for the euro nations and a single minister to oversee it all.
The proposals he will discuss when he sits down with German Chancellor Angela Merkel outside Berlin on Tuesday will be far less ambitious, with deep differences between the two European powerhouses.
Many economists agree with Macron that fundamental reforms are needed to strengthen the eurozone and insulate the single currency -- the most potent symbol of Europe's integration -- from future crises, like the 2010-13 sovereign debt contagion that nearly tore the euro apart. 
But Merkel has limited room to act due to political pressure at home, and is always at pains to ensure France and Germany aren't pushing ahead with plans that have no deep backing from the rest of the European Union.
Macron and Merkel will discuss a separate budget for the 19 countries that share the single currency but much smaller than he wanted. Then there are gaps in opinion over a fund to calm bond markets in a crisis and a backstop for the banking system. 
""Things are going in the right direction, but the proposals we're getting from the Germans aren't sufficient,"" said a French official who acknowledged there were deep differences between the two sides.
A German official said there were still big questions about what sort of agreement Tuesday’s meeting would produce on the budget for the euro zone. The official said Merkel’s recent political troubles over migration policy could mean she is less inclined to make concessions to the French leader.
Besides the disagreement between France and Germany, it is also the nature of negotiations between the eurozone countries that grand ideas get chipped away at until a compromise is reached that satisfies all parties.
At the weekend, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and his German counterpart Olaf Scholz met in Hamburg to try to resolve much of the nitty-gritty before Merkel and Macron meet.
An official involved in those negotiations said ""real progress"" had been made in those discussions but acknowledged that two or three key issues still needed to be worked out.
""It's now up to heads of state to see if the final leap can be taken at the meeting in Germany,"" the official said.
FRENCH HOPES
Macron is hoping he and Merkel will be able to agree in principle on the budget. But whatever they come up with is going to be much smaller than his original idea for a fund of ""several points"" of eurozone GDP, equivalent to hundreds of billions of euros. The most Merkel has hinted at is ""tens of billions"". 
The French want the budget to help stabilize member states suffering short-term shocks and other imbalances. The Germans are not convinced that a stabilization fund would work and are wary about creating anything that involves them paying in, for the money to be transferred elsewhere.
There are also gaps in interpretation over how to reshape the European Stability Mechanism, a 500 billion euro fund set up by member states during the sovereign debt crisis to help ward off bond market turbulence.
Another point of contention is a proposed backstop to underpin eurozone banks. France and others want it implemented before 2024 but Germany has reservations about the timing and wants non-performing loans cleared from balance sheets first.
IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
While Europe's economy has picked up and there is no immediate sign of financial stress, many analysts maintain that reforms are needed to protect the single currency. 
""Make no mistake, the euro desperately needs revamping,"" Philippe Legrain, a former adviser to the European Commission president and a senior visiting fellow at the London School of Economics' European Institute wrote of the reforms.
""The eurozone's institutional framework also needs fundamental reform in four big areas: finance, fiscal policy, economic imbalances, and democratic choice and accountability.""
The reforms on the table are far from Macron's vision and a long way from winning universal backing. Even if Paris and Berlin agree a position on Tuesday, the views of the 17 other euro zone countries still have to be heard.
Historically, a shared Franco-German position has been enough to carry change in Europe. 
But the Netherlands, Finland, Ireland, Denmark and four other northern EU states agreed a joint position in March. They said now is not the time for more reform and worry about proposals that create a 'two-speed' Europe, with some rules for the wider EU and others for the euro zone. 
""Discussions about the future of Economic and Monetary Union should take place in an inclusive format,"" they said.
Macron's vision may also fall victim to other events.
Immigration is likely to dominate the summit of EU leaders. Officials have said disagreement between France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary about border security and the flow of migrants from the Middle East and Africa is a bigger threat to EU cohesion than the 2010-13 debt crisis.
The window for negotiation and agreement on Macron's plans will soon close. After the summer break, there will be Bavarian elections which could be decisive for the German coalition. 

In 2019, the EU's focus will shift to Britain's March exit from the union, and European Parliament elections in May, when there may be a surge in populist forces on the right and left.

450,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Brazil Central Bank Said to See Swap Volume as Unsustainable,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s central bank cannot sustain its current campaign to combat currency volatility until general elections in October, according to a central bank official familiar with the board’s thinking. 
Maintaining the pace of currency swaps sales would mean the stock would exceed the amount Brazil has in international reserves, the person said. The central bank remains willing to intervene with international reserves if necessary, said the person, who requested to remain anonymous.
The real reversed gains and fell 0.6 percent after the story was published.
""The Central Bank does not recognize ‘off-the-record’ statements, especially by supposedly ‘high-ranking central bank sources’,"" the central bank’s press office said by e-mail.
Brazil’s central bank, led by its President Ilan Goldfajn, has offered $26 billion dollars worth of foreign-exchange swaps in just over a week in an effort to reduce the currency’s volatility. The real, which has fallen by about 12 percent this year, is reacting to both an emerging market selloff that’s prompted policy maker action from Argentina to Indonesia, as well as prospects of a weaker-than-expected domestic recovery and uncertainty surrounding presidential elections.
“Resorting to FX intervention via reserves is a rather extreme move, given the long and successful use of swaps,” said Alvise Marino a foreign-exchange strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York. “The risk is that if the swap program were to prove insufficient to stop the currency from weakening further, the ability to announce another large increase in swap intervention would be limited by the already poor fiscal outlook.”
Swap sales in the last two weeks have had the desired effect in reducing volatility, but the central bank is still concerned over market reactions to the elections, the official said. The monetary authority sees an 11-day trucker strike as having exacerbated financial market volatility.
The central bank said in a June 14 statement that there’s no obstacle for outstanding currency swaps to ""considerably"" exceed amounts seen in the past. Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia reiterated on Monday that Brazil has tools to act in currency and interest rate futures markets.
While the swaps don’t change the supply of physical dollars in the country, they support the real by meeting demand from investors who want to hedge against the risk of the decline in the Brazilian currency. They also boost onshore dollar loan rates, encouraging commercial banks to bring greenbacks into Brazil to profit from the higher local rates.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P were modestly lower on Monday, having recovered from earlier lows, as gains in energy shares helped curb declines stemming from trade war concerns after China's retaliation to U.S. tariffs.
U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he was pushing ahead with tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, prompting a quick response from Beijing, which said it would put duties on several American commodities.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 130.24 points, or 0.52 percent, to 24,960.24, the S&P 500 lost 8.08 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,771.58 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.67 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,739.71.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), which has acted as a proxy for trade war tensions with China as it is the single largest U.S. exporter to the country, fell 0.8 percent as the biggest drag on the Dow. Construction equipment maker  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) declined 0.7 percent.
Chipmakers, which rely on China for a large portion of their revenue, also lost ground. The PHLX semiconductor index lost 0.99 percent and was on track for its worst daily performance in a month. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), off 3.6 percent, was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on tariff concerns and a downgrade by Northland Securities.
""The biggest thing hanging over markets is trade and the back and forth between the U.S. and China,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""If people thought this was really going to be a trade war, stocks would be down a lot more. The fact they're down so little means that people think what the Trump administration is doing is part of their negotiating strategy.""
Oil prices advanced in volatile trade ahead of this week's OPEC meeting, where top producers are widely expected to push for higher output. Even with the anticipated increase, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) maintained its bullish outlook on the oil market.
The S&P energy index rose 1.2 percent and was poised to snap a six-session losing streak. The index was boosted by gains in  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), up 1.3 percent, and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), up 2.5 percent.
The consumer staples index fell 1.5 percent, with tobacco major Philip Morris down 2.4 percent. Tobacco is among the 545 U.S. goods that China plans to impose tariffs on as of July 6.
Among other stocks, Valeant Pharmaceuticals' U.S.-listed shares tumbled 11.9 percent after the U.S. health regulator declined to approval the company's plaque psoriasis treatment lotion.
Biotechnology firm China Biologic jumped 20.6 percent after Chinese investment company CITIC Capital Holdings offered to buy it in a deal valuing the company at $3.65 billion.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 158 new highs and 42 new lows.

In an update on the Canadian central bank’s work on the issue of benchmarks, Deputy Governor Lynn Patterson said financial organizations need to begin considering their “readiness” for coming changes, including potential enhancements to the current benchmark regime in Canada.
“I realize I am giving you more work to do, but it is important that you keep up with these developments and ensure you are operationally prepared,” Patterson said in a prepared text of a speech she is giving in Toronto to the Investment Industry Association of Canada.
Tarred by rate-fixing scandals that struck at the height of the financial crisis, bankers and investors for years have been grappling with finding a replacement for benchmarks like the London Interbank Offered Rate, which Patterson said is supporting a $350 trillion market of loans and derivatives.
In the U.S. for example, an alternative benchmark has been created called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate that is already generating $800 billion in daily transactions.
The pace of work on new benchmarks accelerated last year when Libor’s regulator -- the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority -- announced that benchmark may be sustainable only until the end of 2021, Patterson said.
“This announcement came as a surprise to those who had not been closely following benchmark developments,” Patterson said. “Now, roughly a year later, there appears to be wider acceptance of what needs to be done, and progress is continuing despite the significant complexities.”
In Canada, the central bank set up a working group in March to determine how to proceed. It will need to decide whether the current risk-free overnight benchmark -- the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average -- needs enhancements, and whether a separate benchmark needs to be created, Patterson said.
An enhanced Corra could help replace trades now being done on the other Canadian benchmark, the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate.
“Should we be satisfied that this is enough?” Patterson asked. “We don’t know the answer to this question, but to help work through the issues we recently set up the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group.”
The group -- which has 21 members including representation from the nation’s banks, pension funds and investment firms -- will have a recommendation by the end of the year on enhancements toward the Canadian overnight benchmark.
Patterson also said that if a new benchmark is developed, “market adoption will be critical” and market participants will need to be patient as liquidity gets built.
“That means starting work relatively soon, or as soon as we know what reference rates we will be using in the future,” Patterson said, and called on market players not involved in the consultation process to participate in some of the subgroups."
458,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 01:14PM ET</span>",Head of VW's Audi arrested in Germany over diesel scandal,"By Edward Taylor and Jan Schwartz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) was holding crisis talks on Monday to find a stand-in boss for its Audi brand, a source familiar with the discussions said, after German authorities arrested Audi CEO Rupert Stadler as part of a probe into emissions test cheating. 
Stadler's arrest throws Volkswagen (VW) into turmoil as it struggles to reform itself in the wake of the cheating revelations, which emerged after regulators blew the whistle in September 2015 on the carmaker's use of illegal software. 
The arrest looks set to raise tensions on VW's supervisory board, putting at risk a fragile truce between management, VW's controlling Piech and Porsche families, as well as representatives from labor and the region of Lower Saxony.
VW has for years said only lower-level managers knew of the emissions cheating, but U.S. authorities filed criminal charges against former VW boss Martin Winterkorn earlier this year, and Munich prosecutors widened their probe into Audi this month.
The Munich prosecutors said on Monday Stadler, the most senior active VW official to be remanded in custody since the scandal broke, was being held on fears he might hinder their investigation.
""We need to find a solution for Audi's leadership for the time when he is not here,"" the source familiar with the talks said about Stadler's position. ""We will comment on this later.""
Stadler was given additional responsibilities for group sales in a revamp announced by VW's new Chief Executive Herbert Diess in April.
On Monday, VW and Audi directors were discussing the leadership crisis in separate meetings, with one source saying Dutchman Bram Schot was the front runner to become interim Audi chief. 
Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper said VW's supervisory board had already picked Schot for the job and only needed the formal approval of Audi's directors. VW denied any such appointment had been made.
VW has set aside around $30 billion to cover fines, vehicle refits and lawsuits since its ""dieselgate"" scandal broke, and has announced plans to spend billions more on a shift to electric vehicles as it seeks to rebuild its reputation. 
PHONE TAP
Whereas group CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned in the days after the cheating was disclosed, Stadler resisted requests to fall on his sword, and instead received backing from the Porsche and Piech families to remain in his post.
""His arrest is another low point in VW's diesel saga,"" said Evercore ISI analysts, who have criticized the group for a slow pace of reform. ""Almost three years after the diesel scandal broke, it takes police to take action against the Audi CEO."" 
The United States filed criminal charges against Winterkorn in May, but he is unlikely to face U.S. authorities because Germany does not extradite its nationals to countries outside the European Union.
The Munich prosecutors said the move against Stadler was not made at the behest of U.S. authorities. The 55-year-old was arrested at his home in Ingolstadt in the early hours on Monday, they said.
""The arrest warrant was made because of a risk that evidence might be suppressed,"" Stephan Necknig, a spokesman for the Munich prosecutor's office, told Reuters Television.
""During a search last week there were signs that the accused may tamper with evidence. To influence other suspects or witnesses, or people who could provide information to the investigating authorities,"" he added.
Sueddeutsche Zeitung, citing sources close to the investigation, said prosecutors had tapped Stadler's phone just before searching his premises last week.
Audi and VW said Stadler was presumed innocent unless proved otherwise. Stadler himself was not immediately available for comment.
VW shares closed down 3 percent at 156.06 euros, one of the biggest falls by a European blue-chip stock (FTEU3). 
Asked whether U.S. authorities were also seeking to arrest Stadler, a spokesman for the Department of Justice said: ""As a general matter, the department will neither confirm nor deny the existence of any ongoing investigation."" 
UNDER FIRE
Stadler has been under fire since Audi admitted in November 2015 - two months after parent VW - that it also installed illegal ""defeat device"" software to cheat U.S. emissions tests. 
Munich prosecutors are investigating whether Stadler acted swiftly enough to stop deliveries of manipulated Audi models in Europe once emissions problems had emerged, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters.
Stadler has held onto his post mainly thanks to the backing of members of VW's controlling Porsche-Piech families. Before becoming Audi CEO in 2007, Stadler worked as chief of staff to VW's former chairman and industry scion Ferdinand Piech.
Earlier this month, Munich prosecutors widened their probe at Audi to include Stadler and another member of Audi's top management, investigating them for suspected fraud and false advertising.
Most of VW's emissions problems have been in the United States, where a total of nine people have been charged and two former VW executives have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison terms.
But investigations are continuing elsewhere. Last week, German prosecutors fined VW 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) over the scandal.

463,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",History's Not on the Market's Side in a Trade War,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The first shots of a global trade war were fired on Friday as U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent levy on $50 billion of imports from China. The tariffs focus on “industrially significant technology,” and intend to hurt China for alleged theft of intellectual property rights. China responded within hours with a detailed list of imports from the U.S. valued at $50 billion that it would impose a similar 25 percent tax on. 
The financial markets have largely taken the decisions in stride, probably due to some estimates suggesting a negligible impact on economic growth, employment and share prices. The fallacy in interpreting the immediate investor reaction is that it misses the likely secondary and tertiary impact of the tariffs on suppliers of the affected items, the higher cost to users and reduced demand for the affected items. Such an impact tends to occur gradually, and is likely to have a more profound influence on share prices over time.
History suggests that investors should be cautious about extrapolating the immediate reaction of financial markets. The Smoot-Hawley tariff act passed in June 1930 is widely considered to have been a factor in deepening the depression and causing equities to plunge. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from that June to August 1930 as investors believed initially that the tariffs would provide a boost for American companies by deterring foreign competition. As late as October 15 that year, a euphoric Irving Fisher, the well-known Yale University economist, declared that equities had reached a “permanently high plateau.” The stock market crashed two weeks later. While the tariffs were not the instigator of the drop in share prices, they added to the bearish sentiment over time.
More recently, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs ranging from 8 percent to 30 percent on various steel products in March 2002 to last for three years. The levies were canceled in December 2003. In addition to the fear of retaliation by the European Union against American products including Florida oranges and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, a respected study found that the 197,000 jobs lost in steel-consuming industries exceeded the 187,500 people employed by the entire steel industry. Equities fell from March 2002 to October 2002 and did not regain their March 2002 levels until January 2004.
The latest skirmish has Chinese authorities targeting U.S. farm products, automobiles and energy. Food, beverage and feed are a major U.S. export category and soybeans, the top product in this category, is being targeted. Global giants such as Cargill Inc. and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. dominate this sector, and are likely to feel the pinch of the worsening global trade outlook.
China is the world’s largest market for automobile producers, and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).'s sales of 4.04 million cars in China in 2017 substantially exceeded the 3 million cars that it sold in the U.S. Automobile exporters will face not only the impact of reduced Chinese demand for U.S.-made cars once the tariffs go into effect, but would also have to pay more for imported steel on account of the new levies to be imposed on purchases from Canada, Mexico and the EU.
Crude oil and related products form the second-most important U.S. export category, and it is also the fastest growing export sector. China has become a significant importer of U.S. crude, and has indicated that the new levies would affect oil and other forms of energy purchased from the U.S.
The likelihood that the tariffs would affect a wide range of U.S. companies in a number of sectors stems from the fact that food, transportation and energy affect the entire economy with consequences for the stock market. Second, Trump has threatened to implement additional measures if the Chinese retaliate, and equities could be affected by a vicious cycle of tit-for-tat action.
History suggests that the harmful impact of tariffs affect equity prices over several months, and retaliation by trade partners typically makes the correction worse. And when the items targeted are widely used, the consequences are likely to be felt by companies in a broad range of sectors that supply to the affected companies, or cons their products."

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will invest $175 million to modernize and retool a plant in Lansing, Michigan, to build the next generation of luxury Cadillac sedans, the company said on Monday. 
Much of Cadillac's growth is expected to come from China, the luxury brand's largest market. 
""We expect global luxury sales will continue grow, with Cadillac's global volume and profit expected to double by 2021, and our investments in the U.S. will be a major driver,"" GM said in a statement.
Both mainstream and luxury sedan brands have struggled in the U.S. market as consumers have increasingly abandoned them in favor of larger, roomier SUVs and pickup trucks. 
Traditional passenger cars accounted for more than 50 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales as recently as 2012, but in 2017 made up less than 37 percent of sales. Automakers and analysts expect that shift to continue.
Cadillac's U.S. sales rebounded somewhat in the first three months of this year, with sedans up 7.2 percent, after plunging 27.4 percent in 2017.
Globally, however, Cadillac's sales for the first three months of 2018 were up 22.5 percent. 
In March, the former head of Cadillac, Johan de Nysschen, told Reuters that the automaker's data indicated that although sedans in China will shrink as a percentage of the overall vehicle market, by 2025 the luxury sedan segment will be as large as the entire Chinese luxury market is today. 
According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, vehicle sales in China totaled 28.88 million vehicles last year, up 3 percent.

Like other luxury brands, Cadillac has also been scrambling to come out with new SUV and crossover models to appeal to changing consumer appetites.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's bid to escape a lawsuit accusing it of breaking federal antitrust laws by monopolizing the market for iPhone software applications and causing consumers to pay more than they should. 
The justices said they would hear Apple's appeal of a lower court's ruling that revived the proposed class-action lawsuit by iPhone buyers over commissions that the Cupertino, California-based technology company receives through its App Store.
The case could expand the threat of antitrust damages against companies in the rapidly growing field of electronic commerce, which generates hundreds of billions of dollars annually in U.S. retail sales.
President Donald Trump's administration backed Apple and urged the justices to take the case. 
Businesses that potentially could be threatened by such consumer litigation are electronic marketplaces like the App Store, ticket site StubHub, Amazon's Marketplace and eBay where individual sellers set prices.
The antitrust claims against Apple date back to a 2011 lawsuit by several iPhone buyers in California federal court, including lead plaintiff Robert Pepper of Chicago, according to court papers. The plaintiffs said Apple has monopolized the sale of apps like messaging programs and games, leading to inflated prices compared to if apps were available from other sources.
Though developers set the prices of their apps, Apple collects the payments from iPhone users, charging developers a 30 percent commission on each purchase. Developers earned more than $20 billion in 2016, according to Apple. 
The company sought to have the antitrust claims dismissed, saying the plaintiffs did not have the needed legal standing to bring the lawsuit.
The case hinges on a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court decision that limited damages for anti-competitive conduct to those directly overcharged rather than indirect victims who paid an overcharge passed on by others. 
A federal judge in Oakland, California threw out the suit, saying the consumers were not direct purchasers because the higher fees they paid were passed on to them by the developers.
But the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 revived the litigation, saying Apple was a distributor that sold iPhone apps directly to consumers and must face the antitrust claims.
E-commerce reached $452 billion in U.S. retail sales in 2017, according to U.S. government estimates.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - It is too early to judge Google's (O:GOOGL) reforms in response to an antitrust case over online shopping, though there are signs some rivals are benefiting, Europe's competition chief said on Monday.
The comments from European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager come amid calls from Google's competitors for her to take more drastic action against the world's most popular internet search engine.
A year after being hit with a record 2.4-billion-euro ($2.8 billion) fine by the European Commission, Google has yet to create a level playing field, according to rivals such as British comparison shopping sites Foundem and Kelkoo and others in the travel search, digital mapping and publishing markets.
Google's proposal involves allowing competitors to bid for ads at the top of a search page aimed at giving them the chance to compete on equal terms.
Vestager said she was aware of the rivals' concerns but cited figures to show that competition was improving.
""We know from our monitoring there's been a steady increase in the numbers over the last few months. The most recent figures show at least one rival appears in about one-third of new shopping boxes as compared to 15 percent of the shopping boxes back in March,"" she told a European Parliament hearing.
""Similarly the share of clicks of products of rivals in Google shopping boxes also increased from 2.5 percent in February to 6.1 percent now. It's still too early to draw conclusions. We will continue our active monitoring and talk to market participants,"" Vestager said.
Google, which has previously said its proposal gives everyone a fair opportunity, could face fines up to 5 percent of its average daily worldwide turnover if it fails to comply with the EU order to create a more level playing field.

(Reuters) - The corporate tax cut passed by U.S. President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans that was in part designed to help dissuade U.S. companies from moving profits overseas may instead make the practice a lot more rewarding.
That is because companies which shifted profits linked to U.S. sales, research or production previously had to pay U.S. taxes on the money at the rate of 35 percent when they brought those profits home. 
The new tax bill cuts the overall corporate tax rate to 21 percent, and allows income from overseas to be taxed at about half that rate – to as low as 10 percent. 
 AbbVie Inc . (N:ABBV) is a case in point.
Its Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez told investors earlier this year that because of the change to a territorial system, whereby only profits reported by domestic subsidiaries face U.S. tax, the U.S. drugmaker expects its tax rate to fall to 9 percent this year from around 22 percent in recent years. 
That ranks among the lowest of the companies in the S&P 500 that have announced estimates for their tax rate, which average around 22 percent, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
The company has historically reported its income in lower tax jurisdictions, which is possible in part because AbbVie parks the majority of the patents for its top-selling drug in Bermuda - a country that has a zero tax rate on corporate profits, according to a Reuters analysis of 88 Humira patents.
Despite recording over half its $28.2 billion in 2017 sales in the United States and basing most of its research facilities there, the suburban Chicago company has never reported a profit in its home country, its annual reports show.
In 2017, AbbVie reported foreign earnings before income tax of $10.4 billion on international revenue of only $9.97 billion.
Yet, between 2013 and 2016 AbbVie had to pay around $1 billion a year of taxes in the United States, when it took the profits reported by foreign subsidiaries home to help cover expenses from its U.S. operations.
In the future, it will not have to pay such taxes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The authors of the tax legislation, including Senator John Thune of the Senate Finance Committee, said their bill would discourage the shifting of profits earned in the United States. 
But the principal anti-tax avoidance measures introduced still allow companies to benefit strongly from profit shifting.
AbbVie does not address the patent locations on earnings conference calls or in its SEC filings, and declined to discuss its accounting practices or its annual U.S. losses - which are widely accepted among investors who have scooped up its shares over the 5-year life of the company.
The main driver for AbbVie, a rheumatoid arthritis treatment called Humira, generated more than $12 billion in sales in 2017 from patients in the United States, where the most common dose has a list price of about $60,000 a year. 
“If the guardrails in the new territorial system were meant to prevent companies from avoiding all taxes, AbbVie’s (tax rate) is a pretty clear signal that these guardrails may not be effective,” said Matthew Gardner, senior fellow with the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy.
AbbVie is not the only U.S. company with big operations at home but which reports relatively few profits.  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE),  Expedia  Group Inc (O:EXPE), Boston Scientific Corp (N:BSX),  Synopsys Inc  (O:SNPS) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) also do the same and are set to be big winners from the shift in territorial system, executives have said and earnings for the most recent quarter show.
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2JwOFXH
Microsoft and Synopsys declined to say if their 8-year runs of reporting around half their sales in the United States but less than a quarter of their profits domestically reflected a tax reduction strategy. Expedia and Boston Scientific did not respond to requests for comment.
Pfizer said its 10 years of U.S. losses reflected operational matters rather than tax planning.
“Because of our U.S. domicile, we have significant domestic funding needs, such as paying for R&D, corporate functions, interest on our debt, to name a few. As a result, our U.S. operations can be less profitable than other jurisdictions,” the company said in a statement.
Democrats in Congress are examining how the new tax law incentivizes companies to use patents to shift profits overseas, and Oregon Senator Ron Wyden plans to issue a report dealing in part with the issue later this summer.
“The U.S. shouldn’t get suckered into a race to the bottom with a bunch of no-tax, resort-lined islands to please the tax avoidance industry and their lobbyists,” said Wyden, the Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member. 
The U.S. move away from worldwide taxation represents an adoption of modern tax orthodoxy. All the biggest western economies operate a territorial tax system but, conscious of the risk of profit shifting, they also have rules to tackle this. Typically, these rules allow governments to tax income reported in tax havens as though it arose in the home country.
Congress attached such a provision to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act approved at the end of 2017. Under the new Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) provision, if a company generates untaxed profits in a tax haven, it will be liable to have that profit taxed as though it arose in the United States.
However, the effective tax rate that will apply is half the U.S. tax rate of 21 percent, or 10.5 percent. And if a company reports a loss in the United States, this can be set against the GILTI provision, or deemed U.S. income. This can reduce the tax liability further.
Senate Finance Committee spokeswoman Julia Lawless did not respond to a question about whether the panel’s Republican members would consider raising the GILTI rate. But she said current discussions around the new law centered on its implementation rather than redrafting the Act.
“The international title of the tax overhaul included significant anti-base erosion provisions,” she said.
""THE BLUEPRINT""
Reuters reviewed close to 90 patents on Humira, most of which were cited by AbbVie in lawsuits as protecting intellectual property. Around two-thirds of those patents were assigned to the Bermuda subsidiary, AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd. Most of those patents were developed by teams of researchers entirely or somewhat based in the U.S., according to details in patent filings.
“This is the blueprint,” said Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the International Tax at the University of Michigan Law School. “The illusion that you would see more patents kept in the U.S. (under the new tax law) is unreal as long as there are places you can keep them off shore where you pay 0.”
The exact mechanisms AbbVie uses to report such a low a tax rate is not public. However, analysts and academics say corporate filings often show that drug companies frequently reduce their taxes by parking patents in a low-tax haven, as AbbVie does, and then have their affiliates - which manufacture or market the drug - pay the tax haven subsidiary royalty fees for the right to use the patent.
This arrangement sees a drug sold into a target market, like the United States, at a high price, with the U.S. distribution arm getting a sales margin as low as 5 percent.
Sometimes the U.S. distribution profit is not enough to cover group costs incurred in the United States. For example, many of AbbVie’s biggest costs - including $1 billion a year in interest charges and over $50 million in compensation for its top 5 executives - are covered by AbbVie’s U.S. entities, contributing to the U.S. loss, filings show.
That is why AbbVie can forecast a tax rate below the 10.5 percent GILTI rate, which some commentators have described as a new minimum tax rate.
“There is an incentive to profit-shift,” said Daniel Shaviro, a Professor of tax law at New York University.

BJEV is a subsidiary of the BAIC Group, which is focused on electric vehicles.
Joint ventures are currently required by China for foreign companies to build vehicles in the country. They're being phased out for electric-car companies amid a government push for widespread electrification. But for now, the economies of a JV appear to be appealing to Magna.

498,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 09:52AM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court to review scope of investor protection laws,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear an appeal by a New York investment banker banned from the industry by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a case that could limit the scope of those who can be held liable under laws protecting investors from securities fraud.
The justices will review a lower court ruling that upheld most of the SEC's liability findings against Francis Lorenzo, who served as the investment banking director at a broker-dealer called Charles Vista that was expelled from the securities industry in 2014. The case involved misleading emails he sent to investors about a financially struggling clean-energy company.
At issue is whether a person who did not personally make fraudulent statements but merely passed them along can be found liable for engaging in a fraudulent scheme. Anti-fraud provisions of U.S. securities laws prohibit false statements as well as other conduct categorized as acts, devices, practices or schemes. 
The SEC in 2015 found that Lorenzo violated the anti-fraud provisions by sending emails in 2009 seeking investors for a debt offering by a startup company that was in financial trouble because its technology to generate electricity from solid waste did not work. 
The commission said he made false statements in the emails and that his role in sending them constituted a deceptive scheme. It fined him $15,000 and barred him from working in the industry for life. 
A federal appeals court in Washington last year threw out Lorenzo's liability over the false statements, saying they were made by his boss. But the court said he was still liable for perpetuating the fraudulent scheme because he knowingly produced and sent the false statements in the emails. It ordered the SEC to reconsider the penalties against Lorenzo. 
Lorenzo appealed to the Supreme Court, saying that under the appeals court's ruling a person who did not make a false statement could still be held liable.

The Trump administration, backing the SEC, urged the justices to turn away the appeal.

506,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 08:26AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Airbus weighs new long-range A321 version in Boeing challenge,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is considering adding extra endurance to the longest-range version of its A321 passenger jet in a further effort to pre-empt a potential new mid-market jet being studied by U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA), industry sources said.
A new version called the A321XLR is the latest study on the drawing board in a battle of wits as both jetmakers battle for supremacy in the 200-270-seat segment, valued by analysts at hundreds of billion of dollars over 20 years.
The proposed new A321XLR would carry extra fuel and expand the range of the A321LR aircraft, which recently claimed a long-distance record for single-aisle jets in testing, the sources said, asking not to be named as the idea remains confidential.
It is expected to be aimed at North American carriers, whose ordering decisions could be decisive as Boeing weighs up whether to go ahead with plans for a new 'middle-of-the-market' aircraft.
""We do not comment on our product policy,"" an Airbus spokesman said.
Noting that Airbus had 80 percent of sales in the A321 category, the spokesman added, ""We are under no pressure"".
Airbus has been heavily outselling Boeing in the lower end of the 200-270-seat segment with the single-aisle A321, while Boeing has been dominating at the upper end with strong sales of the 787 Dreamliner at the expense of the Airbus A330neo.
This is the space into which Boeing proposes launching its 220-270 seat mid-market jet, a hybrid with the twin-aisle cabin of a wide-body jet but the smaller cargo space of a single-aisle plane thanks to a novel shape designed to fly more efficiently.
Airbus has been toying with several proposals to extend the A321's advantage and try to limit the impact of Boeing's new plane or even prompt its rival to abandon the idea.
Airbus says the A321LR, due to enter service this year, will have a maximum range of to 4,000 nautical miles (7,400 km). Boeing says the 737 MAX 10, the largest member of its competing 737 family, has a range of 3,300 nm.
JUGGLING RISKS
In a surprise move, Airbus previously halted work on a study dubbed A320neo-plus, Reuters reported in April.
The advanced blueprint would have featured increased fuel capacity, a longer fuselage and improvements to the A321's wing.
A longer-term project, code-named A320neo-plus-plus,"" with an all-new carbon-fibre wing, has also been put to one side.
By halting the studies, Airbus aims to force Boeing to show its hand on the middle-market segment before risking its own capital with a response, people familiar with the decision said.
But others say doing nothing is not without risk since failing to defend the profitable A321 could encourage Boeing to launch its newer jet. ""If you do it, you have to move quickly,"" an industry source said, referring to plans to improve the A321.
The A321XLR - with more fuel capacity but no extra seats or aerodynamic redesign - is a compromise bet that Airbus hopes will fend off Boeing for the smallest upfront investment.
In an interview last week, Boeing's sales chief said it would take the time needed to decide whether to launch its new jet, rejecting suggestions that it is dragging its feet.
""We are doing our due diligence,"" senior vice-president Ihssane Mounir told Reuters.
The jet is widely expected to be developed in two versions.
Boeing is looking at a product that is ""a little bigger than an A321 but goes a lot further"" and ""about the size of the A330 but has a lot better efficiency,"" he said. 
Speaking to Reuters earlier this month, Airbus President Guillaume Faury deflected questions about A321 revamp plans.

""Airbus like any company has different options and is looking at the future,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese discount retailer Don Quijote Holdings Co Ltd (T:7532) expects to hit its 1 trillion yen ($9.05 billion) sales target in the next financial year, a year earlier than forecast, a senior executive said on Monday. 
""We have progressed to where we can pull (the target) forward,"" Mitsuo Takahashi, Don Quijote's chief financial officer, said in a Reuters interview, adding that the discounter expects to have about 470 stores worldwide in the financial year ending June 2019, up from 416 now. 
Reaching 1 trillion yen in sales would propel Donki, as it popularly known, into the ranks of Japan's top retailers, such as Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co Ltd (T:9983), convenience store operator Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd (T:3382) and big-box electronics retailer  Yamada Denki Co Ltd  (T:9831).
The company, Japan's largest discounter, is known for stocking its stores floor-to-ceiling with an eclectic mix of products, from leopard-print rugs to designer goods, and has proved popular among Japanese shoppers and the growing numbers of tourists visiting Japan. 
Donki has upgraded its outlook for the financial year ending this month three times and estimates a 13 percent increase in sales to 935 billion yen over the last 12 months. Such as result would deliver its 29th year of unbroken sales growth.
The discounter, which calls itself a ""dirt cheap jungle,"" is expanding its chaotic retail style overseas. It currently has two ""Don Don Donki"" stores in Singapore, with another to open in Bangkok by the end of the year. 
Donki is looking to open one to two stores in Southeast Asia annually, Takahashi said, adding that the number of Singapore outlets could reach 10 or more. 
The discounter also owns stores in Hawaii and California.

BERLIN/OSLO (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) is in contact with Norwegian Air Shuttle, which is also the subject of bid interest from British Airways owner IAG, as the German airline looks to get involved in an expected wave of deals in the sector, its CEO told a newspaper. 
Shares in Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) jumped more than 10 percent on Monday following the comments by Lufthansa boss Carsten Spohr to Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
""In Europe, everyone is talking to everyone. There's a new wave of consolidation approaching. That means we are also in contact with Norwegian,"" Spohr was quoted as saying. 
Asked whether Norwegian would fit with the Lufthansa group, Spohr said: ""Takeovers are always a question of strategic value, the price and anti-trust. There are no easy answers.""
Norwegian reiterated on Monday that it had been approached by potential buyers and investors following an announcement in April that IAG (L:ICAG) had taken a 4.6-percent stake in the carrier.
""These parties have expressed indicative and preliminary interest in share acquisitions, mergers, structured transactions, financing of the group and various forms of operational and financial cooperation,"" a spokesman said.
""Norwegian believes that interest from several parties demonstrates the attractiveness of our business,"" he added.
Norwegian Air's shares were 11 percent higher at 276 crowns at 0959 GMT. Lufthansa shares were up 0.1 percent, outperforming a 1.0 percent weaker DAX (GDAXI) index in Germany.
After the failures of Air Berlin and Monarch last year, airline executives have predicted more consolidation this year in Europe, especially as rising oil prices make life tougher for carriers with weaker finances. 
Spohr told Reuters earlier this month that Lufthansa would grab more takeover opportunities if they arose and that carriers were all in contact with each other.
""There are no negotiations or in-depth talks and it is open whether anything will come of it,"" said a source with knowledge of the contact between Lufthansa and Norwegian.
Strategically speaking, Norwegian would fit well with Eurowings, Lufthansa's low-cost brand, the source added.
""The advantage is that it's a functioning flight operation with low costs,"" the source said.
After taking over parts of Air Berlin last year and acquiring the remaining stake in Brussels Airlines to expand its Eurowings brand, Lufthansa has also eyed Alitalia, though the sale process is being held up by political turmoil. 
Lufthansa had previously been interested in Scandinavian carrier SAS (ST:SAS), but two years ago said it had decided not to invest. 

IAG's CEO has said he will not engage in a bidding war for Norwegian, repeating to shareholders last week that Norwegian was not a deal the group had to do.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 06:47AM ET</span>",Behind flashy IPO of Japan's Mercari lies a thriving thrift economy,"By Sam Nussey and Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - When flea market app Mercari makes its market debut on Tuesday, it will mark the appearance of one of Japan's rarest beasts: a tech unicorn.
In most countries, a billion-dollar IPO might suggest the return of an equity boom. But in Japan, it sheds light on a ""thrift economy"" for second-hand items, which is thriving even as the Bank of Japan tries to stoke inflation.
Mercari's app allows users to buy and sell from each other, swiping and tapping their way through items as diverse as designer clothes and toilet paper tubes.
It has been downloaded 71 million times as Japanese shoppers, faced with weak wage growth and armed with smartphones, have shed their inhibitions about used goods.
""The deflationary mindset is alive and well,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics, citing data showing that households expect incomes to keep falling in the year ahead.
Founded in 2013, Mercari and information technology startup Preferred Networks Inc are Japan's only two unicorns - startups with valuations above $1 billion - according to data provider CB Insights.
Mercari joins a series of Japanese companies that have made their name by playing the counter-cyclical game. Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co Ltd and home furnishings chain Nitori Holdings Co Ltd, both known for affordable pricing, have seen years of expansion.
Mercari, however, reduces costs further by allowing consumers to deal directly with each other, cutting out shops altogether.
That's bad news for the country's retailers, who have been hammered by decades of weak consumption and falling prices despite the central bank's aggressive efforts.
Jun Shimada, a senior executive at major Japanese fashion company Bay Crew's Group, said the rise of Mercari could end up to be a bigger threat to retailers than internet retailers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Second-hand clothing, except for rarer items sold as vintage, used to carry a stigma, he said.
""Young people in particular no longer have any resistance to buying items that do not fall into the vintage category,"" he said.
One woman who bought an Italian leather handbag at one of Bay Crew's stores turned to Mercari after having second thoughts, uploading Instagram-style shots with her smartphone.
""I made this impulse purchase because I fell in love with the bluish-green color of the leather, but ended up carrying it less than 10 times because it didn't match any of my clothes,"" she said, trying to resell it for around 10,000 yen ($90.56).
Other online businesses are following in Mercari's steps, with Rakuten Inc's Rakuma app and Start Today Co Ltd's Zozoused offering used-goods services. And in February eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) announced it was buying Giosis Pte Ltd's Japanese operations, including the online shopping platform Qoo10.
Economists say that in theory, sellers and buyers on such sites can spend the money they save. But users are also more likely to think twice about buying items at full price, pushing down the prices of new goods.
Consumers ""can use the internet to compare the prices of goods and services nationwide or even globally,"" Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters on Friday, adding that ""recently some people say this is a reason why prices of goods and services are not rising that much.""
The BOJ has been aiming for 2 percent consumer inflation, but has struggled to achieve that despite five years of massive stimulus.
Core consumer inflation peaked at a 1 percent annual increase in February but has since slowed to a 0.7 percent annual increase in April, raising concern among economists inside and outside the central bank that inflationary pressure is waning.
In an effort to understand what is behind the weak numbers, the BOJ is likely to scrutinise several factors, including whether online shopping is driving down prices, according to sources familiar with the central bank's thinking.
The bank is likely to reveal its findings at a policy meeting in July, when it issues fresh quarterly forecasts on growth and inflation.
It said in a quarterly report in April that ""changes in distribution and deregulation have intensified competition for highly-commoditised goods and services.""
But Kentaro Arita, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, said that in the long run, Mercari would be a positive contributor to the economy. He said the company would foster innovation and efficiency, forcing retailers to raise their game.
""Mercari and companies like it force bricks-and-mortar retailers to focus more on strengthening their brand and offering something unique to distinguish themselves,"" said Arita, who said he uses Mercari.

515,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 06:21AM ET</span>",Speculative Fervor Builds at Fringe of a Quiet Week for S&P 500,"(Bloomberg) -- It was an outwardly boring week in the S&P 500. But in chancier corners of the market a decidedly risk-on tone is building, evidence traders are awakening after three months of shell shock.
While broad benchmarks sat still, speculative shares soared, among them companies that recently went public, stocks favored by short sellers, and firms with weaker balance sheets. A seven-week rally was preserved in the Russell 2000, which was joined in record territory by an index of microcaps.
Gains in the third category, companies with shakier finances, breathed new life into a trade that had prevailed for most of the bull market before deteriorating as investors sought safety. Known as the low-quality rally, its revival may signal indiscriminate buying pressure is building again for equities.
“Folks feel good about the risk-on trade,” Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, said by phone. “It’s not easy to get people to put money into the market, but you kind of have a healthy consumer, you’ve got healthy corporations, companies buying stock. Life’s good, the way I look at it.”
It was a week billed as the most important stretch for the world economy this year. President Donald Trump met with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, the Federal Reserve pondered interest rates, the European Central Bank set a limit on bond buying and China vowed to retaliate after the U.S. announced tariffs on $50 billion worth of goods.
Looking at reactions in the broad market, you would’ve thought nothing happened. The wire-to-wire change in the S&P 500 was the smallest of 2018, and benchmark volatility is roughly half its level in late March. Friday looked exciting early as the S&P 500 fell as much as 0.8 percent, but ended in a whimper.
For the five sessions, the S&P 500 gained 1 one-hundredth of a percent, closing at 2,779.42. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9 percent to 25,090.48. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.3 percent to 7,746.38.
Below the surface, things were jumping. Technology companies that went public recently soared. Dropbox Inc., which began trading on March 23, climbed 32 percent. Cloud-based software company Zuora Inc. surged 18 percent, topping off gains of more than 50 percent since the start of the month. An exchange-traded fund that tracks newly public companies, the Renaissance IPO ETF, posted its second-best weekly gain this year.
Avalara Inc., a Seattle-based company that provides sales tax-management solutions, started trading on the NYSE Friday and nearly doubled. There have been 22 technology companies to go public so far this year in the U.S., and they’ve gained an average of 70 percent, weighted by offer size, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
To Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer of Aviance Capital, a Florida-based advisory firm, it’s a sign of just how much risk investors are willing to take to juice performance.
“They’re chasing returns,” he said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “They’ve been forced into taking risk generally in equities where they’re in an area where they’re really not comfortable in.”
As crazy as it’s been, it’s still a little early for comparisons to past IPO frenzies such as the one in 1999. About 130 technology companies made their IPO in the U.S. that year, and the average gain was more than 300 percent, according to Bloomberg data.
The outperformance in weak-balance-sheet companies came even as the Fed was raising interest rates. A basket compiled by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) of companies with flimsier finances outpaced their stronger counterparts this week by more than half a percent. It may signal investor optimism as we enter the summer, according to Bertelsen.
“It shows that it’s actually a pretty healthy economic environment,” he said. “Why would you invest in a company where the balance sheet is stressed? You would do it if you felt that either the company or because of the economic situation that they’re going to grow into a more satisfactory fundamental balance sheet.”
Stocks that speculators bet will fall instead rose. A basket of 50 heavily shorted companies jumped more than 3 percent this week. The performance is more than double that of a separate group of companies favored by hedge-fund longs. The outperformance isn’t completely out of the blue either, as the high short interest stocks have jumped nearly 9 percent since June’s start.
“Honestly, people think growth is going to be the way that the market moves in perpetuity,” Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group LLC in Pittsburgh, said by phone. “And whenever I hear the word perpetuity, I know we’re in for a change. Stuff doesn’t last forever.”

519,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2018 04:24AM ET</span>","CYBG, Virgin Money join forces to take on Britain's biggest banks","By Emma Rumney
LONDON (Reuters) - Mid-sized bank CYBG (L:CYBGC) has agreed a 1.7 billion pound ($2.3 billion) all-share deal to acquire Virgin Money (L:VM), which it said will create Britain's sixth-largest bank by assets and a stronger challenger to the country's top four lenders. 
The deal, the biggest bank merger in Britain since the financial crisis, is on the same terms as CYBG's sweetened bid earlier this month and will see Virgin Money shareholders, which include entrepreneur Richard Branson, own around 38 percent of the combined group.
The merged company will be around twice the size of its largest rival among Britain's smaller banks and be able to draw on the firepower of the Virgin brand, which the combined group will pay a royalty to keep. 
CYBG CEO David Duffy, who will lead the new lender with Virgin Money CEO Jayne-Anne Ghadia acting as a senior advisor for an unspecified period of time, said the deal will create a bank with the capability to take on the largest players.
""The combination of CYBG and Virgin Money will create the first true national competitor to the status quo in UK banking, offering a genuine alternative for consumers and small businesses,"" he said in a statement. 
Virgin Money shares rose more than 2 percent before paring their gains to trade little changed at 355p by 0810 GMT. CYBG shares, which dictate the value of the deal, were also flat at 306.4 pence after initially falling. 
The take over still has to be approved by CYBG and Virgin Money shareholders, but John Cronin, analyst at stockbroker Goodbody, said both sets were likely to agree to the terms. 
""Ultimately, we believe this is a great deal for both sets of shareholders and we expect it should receive their support.""
Virgin Money investors will receive 1.2125 CYBG shares per Virgin Money share. Branson owns 35 percent of Virgin Money. 
JOB CUTS, SAVINGS
The agreement comes after over a month of talks between the two lenders, and ahead of a deadline on Monday afternoon when CYBG, owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank, either had to make a firm offer or walk away under British takeover rules. 
The banks said they expected to benefit from 120 million pounds in annual pre-tax cost savings, including by cutting approximately 1,500 jobs, leaving the group with a headcount of around 8,000. 
While banding together will help the two banks fight competitive pressures from established players and smaller, tech-savvy newcomers, they face a tough fight to take on Britain's big four, which dominate the sector.
The new lender's size will pale in comparison to the likes of Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS). It would be the main bank for just 2 percent of high street customers compared with around 24 percent for market leader Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY), according to data from industry body RFi Group.
Virgin Group CEO Josh Bayliss said CYBG is the partner Virgin Money needs to continue to grow. 
""We... look forward to helping the combined business rebrand to Virgin Money,"" he said, welcoming Duffy and CYBG employees to the group. 
CYBG, whose will pay a fixed royalty to keep the Virgin Money brand, which starts at 12 million pounds in the first year and increases to 15 million pounds in the fourth year. 

Like Duffy, CYBG's chairman, Jim Pettigrew and its finance director Ian Smith will all retain their roles in the combined group.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese stocks fell on Monday as an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China stoked concerns about the impact on global demand, triggering a sell-off in stocks such as makers of construction equipment. 
Also denting sentiment was a magnitude 6.1 earthquake in Osaka in western Japan on Monday, hitting the shares of utility companies headquartered in the Kansai region.
Kansai Electric (T:9503) dropped 1.9 percent though it said no irregularities had been detected at the Mihama, Takahama and Ohi nuclear plants after the quake. Osaka Gas (T:9532) stumbled 3.4 percent.
On the other hand, contractors based in the Kansai region soared on speculation that construction demand will rise after the earthquake. Asanuma Corp  (T:1852) rose 1.3 percent, Mori-gumi (T:1853) 1.6 percent and  Okumura Corp  (T:1833) rose 0.1 percent.

Manufacturers of construction equipment makers such as Komatsu Ltd (T:6301) and Hitachi Construction Machinery (T:6305) tumbled 3.9 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, while shares that rely on global capital expenditure to sustain demand followed suit. Industrial robot maker Fanuc Corp (T:6954) dropped 1.8 percent and Yaskawa Electric (T:6506) skidded 3.0 percent.
U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled an initial list of strategically important goods that would be subject to a 25 percent tariff effective July 6, a move China's Commerce Ministry called ""a threat to China's economic interest and security"".

TOKYO/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares fell to a 2-1/2 week low on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump cranked up trade tensions by going ahead with tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to immediately respond in kind.
Fears of a global trade war added to pressure on oil prices, which extended Friday's big fall, while the dollar retreated from near 3-week highs against the safe haven yen . 
Spreadbetters suggested a subdued start for European shares, with FTSE futures  off about 0.1 percent. U.S. E-Mini S&P futures (ESc1) stumbled 0.5 percent, suggesting a weaker start on Wall Street.

Financial markets in China and Hong Kong were closed for Dragon Boat festival holiday. 
Japan's Nikkei (N225) sank 0.8 percent as worries over growing protectionism overshadowed stronger-than-expected export data.
""The on-again off-again possible global trade war is looking to be back on again as the U.S. and China announced tariffs on each other's imports,"" said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. 
""This looks set to be the main theme that investors will focus on...with any further escalation in tension adding to the downside risk.""
Trump announced hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports on Friday, laying out a list of more than 800 strategically important imports from China that would be subject to a 25 percent tariff starting on July 6, including cars.
China said it would respond with tariffs ""of the same scale and strength"" and that any previous trade deals with Trump were ""invalid."" The official Xinhua news agency said China would impose 25 percent tariffs on 659 U.S. products, ranging from soybeans and autos to seafood.
China's retaliation list was increased more than six-fold from a version released in April, but the value was kept at $50 billion, as some high-value items such as commercial aircraft were deleted.
However, many market watchers believe there is still room for compromise, suspecting Trump's announcement was a negotiating tactic to wring faster concessions from Beijing.
""Ultimately, a negotiated solution is likely – and this is what both the U.S. and China want - but the risks are high and the tariffs could well be implemented before the issue is resolved,"" said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based chief economist at AMP.
LIMITED IMPACT?
Analysts say the direct impact of the tariffs may be limited, especially for the U.S. economy, which is in strong shape.
But Asia's other trade-reliant economies and companies plugged into China's supply chains are worried they will suffer collateral damage if world trade slows down, hurting global growth and dampening business confidence.
Shares of Japanese construction equipment makers Komatsu Ltd (T:6301) and Hitachi Construction Machinery (T:6305) tumbled 3.9 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. Both are vulnerable to any downturns in Chinese and global capital spending. 
""There are trade frictions not only between the U.S. and China but also between the U.S. and its allies. Trump could put more pressure on other countries like Japan and NATO courtiers,"" said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in Tokyo.
""So far investors have been escaping to high-tech shares and small cap shares. After all, money is still abundant. But investors should be cautious.""

525,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mellanox nears truce with Starboard over board seats - sources,"By Liana B. Baker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mellanox Technologies Inc (O:MLNX), a chipmaker based in Israel and the United States, is close to reaching a deal with activist investor Starboard Value LP over the composition of its board of directors, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The agreement would come after the chipmaker, which had a market capitalization of roughly $4.5 billion at the close of trading on Friday, adopted corporate governance changes after a special vote last month that affected how investors select directors in contested board elections. 
Mellanox's shares have been up more than 30 percent since the start of the year and closed at $85.90 on Friday. Mellanox could announce an agreement with Starboard as early as this week that would help it avoid a proxy fight at its shareholder meeting scheduled next month, the people added.
Starboard said last November when it disclosed its stake that it owned about 11 percent of the company.
The settlement with Starboard would involve naming two directors from Starboard's eight-person slate to Mellanox's board, the sources said.
As part of the agreement, another director who will be agreed upon later between Starboard and Mellanox will also be added to the board, the sources added. The 11-member board will not be expanded, the sources said.
The identities of the directors who would be named to Mellanox's board could not be learned. Mellanox's chairman, Irwin Federman, 82, will remain in place, while Peter Feld, a Starboard portfolio manager who was on the activist's slate, will not be added to the board, the sources said. 
The agreement includes a so-called standstill agreement between the company and Starboard, which requires the activist shareholder to support the board and company for at least a year, the sources added.
The sources declined to be identified because the talks are confidential, and cautioned that the settlement terms could still change, or that the deal could be abandoned altogether.
Mellanox declined to comment and Starboard could not be reached for comment.
The annual meeting of shareholders has been scheduled for July 25.
Starboard has shaken up boards in the semiconductor space before. In April 2016, its three shareholder nominees, including Feld, were added to Marvell Technology Group's (O:MRVL) board.
The hedge fund has helped steer a turnaround at Marvell, which has since pursued large acquisitions such as the $6 billion takeover of peer Cavium Inc. Starboard said in a filing last November that Marvell had approached Mellanox about a merger in the past and had been rebuffed.
In the past two years, the chip industry has witnessed a series of deals as companies try to gain market share in emerging areas such as automotive technologies and connectivity.

The recall covers 10,064 Denza models made between Sept. 19, 2014 and Dec. 5, 2017, Xinhua said, citing the State Administration for Market Regulation.
A Takata air bag inflator ruptured in a fatal car crash in Malaysia, Honda Motor Co (T:7267) said early this month, in what appears to be the 23rd death worldwide linked to the faulty part that can emit deadly metal fragments.
More than 290 injuries worldwide are also linked to Takata inflators that can explode, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June 2017. 
In April, auto components maker Key Safety Systems completed a $1.6 billion deal to acquire Takata. The merged company is now known as Joyson Safety Systems and is a subsidiary of China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (SS:600699). 

Shenzhen Denza New Energy Automotive Co, a joint venture between BYD and German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), will be responsible for replacing the defective airbags free of charge, Xinhua said.

Shareholders approved Georges Plassat's 13 million euros payout by over 68 percent of votes cast at an annual shareholders' meeting on Friday, triggering a wave of criticism from unions, employees' federations and the finance minister.
 Carrefour  said on Saturday that Plassat, who stepped down in July 2017, had decided not to apply a clause in his departure package under which he would get nearly 4 million euros for committing not to join a competitor.
""When you've failed at the head of a company - and that's the case - you don't leave with 13 million euros. He gives up 4 million euros in a non-competition clause at the age 69, it's a joke,"" government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told France 3 television.
""He gets 500,000 euros in retirement a year, 40,000 euros a month, I think that's enough and he should have given up his 13 million euro package, the whole thing, not just 4 million,"" Griveaux added.
Since Plassat's departure, his successor Alexandre Bompard has had to announce job cuts and store closures to boost performance while also launching an e-commerce offensive and seeking a Chinese partnership.
Griveaux said that Plassat's package amounted to ""thuggish behaviour"" and urged the AFEP and Medef employers' federations to ensure companies stuck to their executive pay guidelines.

The two federations said on Saturday they would revise their non-binding guidelines, which most large listed French companies currently follow.

Transport for London (TfL), the public body in charge of the Tube, said the award of the contract would allow Siemens Mobility Limited to push ahead with its plan to build a new factory in Goole, east Yorkshire, in northern England.
""The Siemens Mobility Limited factory would employ up to 700 people in skilled engineering and manufacturing roles, plus up to an additional 250 people during the construction phase of the factory,"" TfL said in a statement.
""As a result, around 1,700 indirect jobs would be created throughout the UK supply chain,"" it said.
Siemens said in March it had leased 67 acres (27 hectares) of land in Goole with a view to building a 200-million-pound ($266-million) train factory. The plans were subject to the company's success in securing major future orders, it said at the time.
Siemens Mobility Limited is Siemens's British subsidiary for its trains and transport technology business.
TfL said it had also received bids from a joint venture of Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and Japan's Hitachi (T:6501) and from France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) when the bidding process began in 2016.
Subsequently, Siemens and Alstom announced that their rail businesses were due to be merged. 
While the order is for an initial 94 trains for the Piccadilly Line, TfL said the contract was being awarded on the expectation that the manufacturer would also build trains of the same design for three other so-called Deep Tube lines. 
The Piccadilly Line, which carries more than 700,000 passengers per day, is the first of the four Deep Tube lines to receive a much-needed upgrade.
The new trains, expected to be delivered from 2023, will be 6 meters (yards) longer than the existing ones and will be designed to optimize space within the constraints of the narrow Deep Tube tunnels.
The 86 trains currently running on the Piccadilly Line were introduced in 1975 and had a design life of 40 years. They are now one of the oldest train fleets in passenger service in Britain.
The aging trains and signaling system restrict the current rush hour service on the Piccadilly Line to 24 trains per hour. That will go up to 27 trains at peak times by the end of 2026, after the new trains are brought into service, TfL said.
Combined with a signaling upgrade and the purchase of additional trains, peak period capacity on the busiest central sections of the Piccadilly Line will increase by more than half by the end of the 2020s, meaning an additional 21,000 customers will be able to board trains every hour at rush hour.
""This long-term sustainable investment will support London's growing population, which is set to increase to 10.8 million by 2041, supporting new jobs, homes and growth,"" it said.
Sabrina Soussan, CEO of Siemens Mobility, said the company was thrilled by the announcement.
""We can drive down lifecycle costs and significantly improve the passenger experience,"" she was quoted as saying by TfL.
A Siemens spokesman in Germany declined to comment.

They stand accused of engaging in or assisting psychological harassment, according to the court order, obtained by Reuters. Lombard, a former human resources head and a deputy CEO were placed under court supervision until trial.
""As it has always said, Orange rejects the accusations and will make its case during the public hearing which will be scheduled in the coming months,"" an Orange spokesman said.
Jean Veil, Lombard's lawyer, said the move was ""absurd"".
The crime of ""moral harassment"" can be punished with two years in prison and 30,000 euros ($35,000) in fines.
France Telecom, which has since become Orange, was hit by a wave of employee suicides beginning in 2008 that took the lives of over 30 workers in two years, including a man who stabbed himself in the stomach during a staff meeting and a woman who threw herself out of a window.
Blamed on workplace stress, the suicides continued in 2010, taking the lives of five workers in 10 days in one particularly difficult period.
A 2010 report by labor inspectors said management used ""pathogenic"" restructuring methods such as forcing people into new jobs and giving unattainable performance objectives.
Lombard, who denied any wrongdoing during an investigation of the suicides, stepped down as CEO of Orange in early 2010 amid criticism of his handling of the crisis.
""This must serve as an example so that management never again uses social violence to get people to leave,"" said the head of the CFE-CGC union at Orange, Sebastien Crozier.
The restructuring plan aimed to reduce France Telecom's headcount by 22,000 while shifting 10,000 people into new jobs and recruiting 6,000 new employees.
All but two of the accused executives are now retired.
A lawyer for the CFE-CGC union said that the trial was not expected before the second half of 2019.

PARIS (Reuters) - Former  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) chief executive Georges Plassat is to give up part of his departure package, the French retailer said on Saturday after facing pressure from employers' bodies, unions and the government over his payout.
Shareholders approved Plassat's 2017 payout by over 68 percent of votes cast at an annual shareholders' meeting on Friday, drawing whistles and boos from union representatives and individual shareholders.
Carrefour said in a statement that Plassat, who stepped down in July 2017, had decided not to apply a clause in his departure package under which he would get nearly 4 million euros ($4.64 million) for committing not to join a competitor.
It added that Plassat had taken the decision ""due to the incomprehension surrounding the financial conditions"" of his retirement.
Paris-based Proxinvest, a shareholder advisory firm, said before the shareholder vote that since Plassat had retired at the age of 68 the non-competition clause looked like a ""disguised retirement benefit"" not in line with widely accepted French employers' guidelines.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire weighed into the matter on Saturday saying that the package was ""incomprehensible and shocking"" since Plassat had left the company in a ""deteriorated situation"".
Since Plassat's departure, his successor Alexandre Bompard has had to announce job cuts and store closures to boost the performance at Europe's biggest retailer while also launching an e-commerce offensive and seeking a Chinese partnership.
Le Maire criticized Carrefour's shareholders for approving the package and discussed the matter on Saturday morning with Bompard and the heads of the AFEP and Medef employers federations, a ministry official said.
French employers' federations AFEP and Medef said afterwards they would revise their executive remuneration guidelines to avoid big divergences from their payout recommendations.
Most large listed French companies follow the recommendations and shareholder say-on-pay votes have become binding in French law since last year.
French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) has also faced pressure over shareholder votes on pay with investors voting on Friday only 56 to 43 percent in favor of last year's 7.4 million euro payout to Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn.
Ghosn, who lost a 2016 shareholder vote on pay, agreed to cut his 2018 compensation by 30 percent to secure French government backing for his renewal. 
The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder with a 15 percent stake, opposed the 2017 payout but backed this year's reduced package.

The Crown Property Bureau said its assets will now be ""subject to the same duties and taxation as would assets belonging to any other citizen"". Previously, assets registered in the name of the Crown Property Bureau were exempt from tax.
""The removal of exempted status was accomplished in line with His Majesty's wishes,"" the statement said. 
The exact size of the Crown Property Bureau is not made public, but Forbes magazine valued the bureau's holdings in real estate and other investments at more than $30 billion in 2012. 
King Vajiralongkorn, 65, who became monarch after the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in 2016, has overseen a number of changes to the way royal affairs are managed since taking the throne. 
A royal property law was amended in July last year to formally give the king full control of the Crown Property Bureau, which manages the multi-billion dollar holdings of the monarchy and controls huge swathes of land in Bangkok. 
A senior official at the Crown Property Bureau declined to comment when contacted by Reuters by phone about the changes. 
Palace representatives did not respond to several Reuters attempts to reach the palace for comment. 
Saturday's announcement is an extension of the July 2017 legal change and gives even greater authority to King Vajiralongkorn, who has shown himself increasingly assertive since the death of his father. 
In March, stock exchange data showed the king acquired a nearly $150 million stake in the country's biggest industrial conglomerate,  Siam Cement  Group Pcl (BK:SCC). In October, shares worth over $500 million in Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) (BK:SCB) were transferred to the king. 
The king is listed as SCB's seventh-largest shareholder.

Also in March, King Vajiralongkorn appointed Air Chief Marshal Satitpong Sukvimol as director-general of the Crown Property Bureau, replacing Chirayu Israngkun Na Ayuthaya who had held the post since 1987.

The two exchanges have been locked in dispute after India's three main bourses unexpectedly announced in February they would stop licensing their indexes to foreign bourses from August.
SGX responded that it would launch successor products to its flagship Indian equity derivative products on June 4.
Now NSE and SGX have been ordered ""to facilitate the continued listing of SGX Nifty products for at least two successive contract month maturations beyond the arbitration's completion date"", SGX said in a statement. The arbitrator has also asked SGX not to offer its proposed new India equity derivative products until the final decision, it said. ""Arbitration proceedings are continuing and the hearings on evidence are expected to commence in early 2019,"" the statement said. SGX had postponed the launch of a set of new India derivatives products after an Indian court in May referred a dispute around the proposed offerings to an arbitrator. The NSE had sought an interim injunction against the launch on grounds that the offerings infringed the intellectual property rights of its unit India Index Services and Products (IISL), which runs the Nifty index. The Bombay High Court then asked a senior retired judge to arbitrate in the matter, and resolve the issue by June 16. However, the June 16 interim order, which was reviewed by Reuters, laid out a timeline for filing of claims and counter-claims and set November 21 for hearing of the issues, with further directions to be provided on June 18.

Over the past two decades, SGX has become the most popular market for foreign investors to bet on Indian equity indexes, with Nifty 50 futures (SINc1) tracking the NSE's main index (NSEI). But NSE,  BSE Ltd  (NS:BSEL) and Metropolitan Stock Exchange moved to end licensing deals with foreign bourses so as to stem the loss of trades to overseas rivals, following SGX's plans to launch trade in single-stock futures contracts. The Indian government backed the decision, as it is keen to draw investors to an international financial center being developed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's western home state of Gujarat, sources say.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2018 03:49AM ET</span>","International fund managers turn to financials, tech as trade worries rise","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The rising tensions over global trade policy are prompting some top-performing international fund managers to look for the companies that can emerge as winners.
Fund managers from firms including AllianceBernstein, Causeway Capital Management and Janus Henderson are adding to positions in companies ranging from Italy's largest bank to China's largest e-commerce company, all in hopes of avoiding the fallout from a global trade war. 
Chief among the corporate attributes fund managers are now looking for are either a strong domestic business that would not be significantly affected by import tariffs, or a dominant market position, or intellectual property that would prompt customers to continue to buy its goods regardless of additional taxes. 
""The impact of a tariff is becoming a bigger factor in our decision-making,"" said George Maris, a portfolio manager of the $2.2 billion Janus Henderson Global Select fund. 
Maris, who said that he has been ""tactically"" trading more than usual because of the threat of tariffs, has increased his position in companies such as Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holdings Ltd (N:BABA) that are dominating their domestic markets. 
""Secular growth stories overwhelm the threat of increased trade frictions every time,"" he said. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said he was pushing ahead with hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports on Friday, and the smoldering trade war between the world's two largest economies showed signs of igniting.
China plans to hit back with additional tariffs of 25 percent on about $50 billion worth of United States products, the country’s Commerce Ministry said Friday. 
Trump laid out a list of more than 800 strategically important imports from China that would be subject to a 25 percent tariff starting on July 6 including cars, the latest hardline stance on trade by a U.S. president who has already been wrangling with allies. 
Trump blasted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as ""very dishonest and weak"" after the G7 summit in Canada last weekend and raised the prospect of tariffs on auto imports, a move that would impact the Canadian economy.
The European Union, meanwhile, has challenged aluminum and steel tariffs imposed by the Trump administration at the World Trade Organization and has drawn up a list of goods it would hit with retaliatory measures.
The threat of tariffs, along with rising U.S. interest rates, helped sink global stock markets in February. Since then, major stock indices have recovered most of their gains, with the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index up 4.91 percent for the year to date and the Stoxx 600 index of companies in the European Union up 2.51 percent over the same time. 
Conor Muldoon, a portfolio manager of the $8.7 billion Causeway International Value fund, said that trade and other macroeconomic concerns are ""presenting short-term opportunities."" The fund has been increasing its position in Italian bank UniCredit SpA (M:CRDI), for instance, after its shares sold off in March following elections that renewed concerns about whether the country could exit the eurozone.
Muldoon's fund is also increasing its position in pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK) and Japanese firm Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (T:4502) that have strong drug pipelines, he said. Shares of GlaxoSmithKline are up 19.5 percent for the year to date, while shares of Takeda are down 32 percent over the same time after it increased its $62 billion bid for London-listed  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP). 
Sammy Suzuki, a co-portfolio manager of the $77 million AB International Strategic Core fund, said that the threat of technological disruption in some markets was just as pressing a concern for some global companies as the impact of higher tariffs. As a result, his fund is focusing more on what he calls the ""enablers"", which are back-end tech firms that do not trade at as high valuations as companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). 
Spanish tech firm  Amadeus  It Group SA (MC:AMA), for instance, provides the technology backing the reservation systems used by airlines including British Airways, Southwest, and Lufthansa Group. Shares of the company are up 20 percent for the year to date. 
""Even if you wanted to, it's difficult to rip them out of these companies,"" he said. 
Suzuki has also been increasing his position in European luxury goods makers such as Italian apparel company  Moncler SpA  (MI:MONC) and British alcoholic beverage company  Diageo  Plc (L:DGE), both of which make products that should not be significantly affected by rising global trade costs, he said.

""You can find tariff-resistant businesses that are in niches, but it takes work to find them,"" he said.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 10:07PM ET</span>",Wall Street builds immunity to trade war rhetoric,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fears of tariffs and a potential global trade war have jostled U.S. stocks over the past few months, but there is a sense among investors that the market is taking the drum beat of rhetoric and statements more in stride.
In the latest salvo, U.S. President Donald Trump announced hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports on Friday, and Beijing threatened to respond in kind.
But even as the developments threatened to ignite a trade war between the world's two largest economies, the equity market largely shrugged it off. The benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) ended down only 0.1 percent on Friday.
That paled compared to losses earlier in the year that were sparked by fears of a U.S.-China trade war that would be detrimental to economic growth.
""The market has gotten reasonably comfortably numb to this tariff stuff,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""They are becoming more accustomed to this being a first foray and negotiating tool.""

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection is to begin collecting tariffs on an initial tranche of 818 Chinese product categories on July 6.
""It’s kind of the cry-wolf syndrome,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""I think people fear the tariffs and the uncertainty about it, but think, 'OK, this is just another negotiating point.'""
On March 1, the S&P 500 declined 1.3 percent when Trump announced plans for hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to protect U.S. producers.
Later in March, the S&P 500 tumbled 2.1 percent on another day of apparent escalating U.S.-China tensions.
So far, Trump has taken little action beyond tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum on imports from China, the European Union and other countries.

The market has grown more used to Trump's style, especially when it comes to international affairs, investors said.
""The market is starting to get accustomed to the president, the way the president negotiates, the way the president tries to prove his point,"" Carlson said. ""There is a growing awareness of how the president tries to do business.""
To be sure, certain areas of the market remain sensitive to rhetoric about trade. 
The S&P 500 industrial sector (SPLRCI), which includes multi-national companies such as plane maker Boeing (N:BA) and heavy machine manufacturer  Caterpillar  (N:CAT), has lagged the market since trade war concerns flared in March. Industrials dropped 0.25 percent on Friday, worse than the broader index's decline.
Steel shares <.SPCOMSTEEL> also have been jostled, as investors weigh benefits from protective measures against fears a trade war will undermine global demand.
Auto investors have also been whipsawed by trade policy. Potential higher steel costs stemming from tariffs could hurt car makers, while the Trump administration has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs.
""The prospects of a trade war are fairly significant,"" Tuz said. ""It’s just an uncertainty that investors haven’t had to deal with for a long time.""

547,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 07:34PM ET</span>","Theranos founder Holmes, former president indicted for fraud","By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Theranos Inc founder Elizabeth Holmes and the embattled blood-testing company's former president were indicted on charges that they engaged in schemes to defraud investors, doctors and patients, the U.S. Justice Department announced on Friday.
The charges against Holmes, 34, and Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, 53, were announced shortly after the privately held company said that she was stepping down as its chief executive.
Prosecutors said that Holmes and Balwani used advertising and solicitations to encourage doctors and patients to use its blood testing laboratory services despite knowing the company could not produce accurate and reliable results consistently.
""This conspiracy misled doctors and patients about the reliability of medical tests that endangered health and lives,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge John Bennett said in a statement.
The indictment also alleged that Holmes and Balwani made numerous misrepresentations about Theranos' financial condition and prospects. Balwani, who worked at Theranos from September of 2009 through 2016, had also served as chief operating officer and was a member of the board.
In a statement, Theranos said Holmes would remain chair of the company's board and David Taylor, the firm's general counsel, had been appointed CEO.
Each defendant faces two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. Prosecutors said both entered pleas of not guilty on Friday during a hearing before a federal magistrate judge in San Jose, California.
The criminal charges came after Holmes in March settled civil fraud charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which she was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years.
Lawyers for Holmes did not respond to requests for comment. Jeffrey Coopersmith, Balwani's attorney, said his client had committed no crimes.
""Mr. Balwani looks forward to trial because he did not defraud anyone, and it will be an honor to defend him vigorously,"" Coopersmith said in a statement.
Holmes, who started Theranos at the age of 19, was celebrated as a rising star of Silicon Valley until it became clear that many of the claims about the company's supposedly revolutionary blood test were bogus.
The company reached a $9 billion valuation based on its promise to disrupt the laboratory testing business.
In presentations to potential investors, to doctors at medical meetings and to the media, Holmes claimed the Theranos analyzer could perform a full range of clinical tests using tiny blood samples drawn from a finger stick, and that it could produce results that were more accurate, reliable and faster than those from conventional blood tests. 
The indictment alleges that Holmes and Balwani knew their analyzer had accuracy and reliability problems, performed a limited number of tests, was slower than some competing devices, and, in some respects, could not compete with existing conventional machines.
They told investors that Theranos could generate about $1 billion in revenues in 2015 when in fact the company had generated just a few hundred thousand dollars in 2014 and 2015, the indictment said.

In 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that Theranos' devices were flawed and inaccurate, setting off a downward spiral for the company that had bagged investors including venture capital firm DFJ, Walgreens (O:WBA), media mogul Rupert Murdoch and Oracle (N:ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison.

556,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 04:59PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week
1. US Stocks Sidestep Tariff Tantrums; Media Stocks in Demand
Familiar market foes returned to US stock markets this week as the U.S. and China vowed to move ahead with trade tariffs, while the prospect of a faster pace of monetary policy tightening also weighed on sentiment.
That, however, didn’t stop US stocks from notching a third-straight weekly win as a rally in tech and media stocks underpinned investor demand.
U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon ruled in favour of the AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX) merger earlier this week, sparking a wave of action in media stocks.
A day after the ruling, Comcast launched a $65 billion bid for Twenty-First Century  Fox Inc  (NASDAQ:FOX) assets that Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) had already struck a deal to buy, setting the stage for an intense bidding war.
Some market participants said a bidding war would be unlikely, however, as the much larger Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) would likely match an increased offer from Disney.
The Fed rate hike on Wednesday, meanwhile, was accompanied by a more hawkish outlook on rate hikes. The U.S. central bank hinted at the prospect of two additional rate hikes this year, taking the expected total rate hikes for 2018 to four from three previously.
The S&P 500 posted a weekly win despite closing 0.25% lower Friday at 2,781.50.
2. Crude Oil Prices Slump as OPEC Meeting Looms
Crude oil prices settled sharply lower Friday on concerns that OPEC would lift limits on production restrictions, paving the way for an uptick in global output, threatening the pace of rebalancing in oil markets.
Investor fears that OPEC and its allies would hike output at its June 22 meeting came to the fore this week amid remarks from both Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih.
Russia Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Thursday - after talks with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih - that both Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to gradually increase production.
While, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Al Falih said an increase in production was inevitable but insisted that production hikes would be reasonable and won't be anything ""outlandish.""
Crude futures settled 2.74% lower on Friday as data showed U.S. oil rigs continued to climb.
3. Dollar Rides Euro Slump to Glory
The dollar closed at year-to-date highs against its rivals despite a modest setback Friday, as a sharp tumble in the euro earlier this week encouraged traders to pile into the greenback.
The euro suffered its worst daily loss in two years on Thursday after the European Central Bank said that it would leave interest rates unchanged until the summer of 2019.
That came a day after the Federal Reserve had signalled a faster pace of rate hikes for this year and the next, further encouraging investor appetite for the greenback.
The dollar fell 0.16% to 94.79 against a basket of major currencies on Friday.
4. Gold Prices Tumble to 2018 Lows
Gold prices fell to 2018 lows on Friday as traders appeared to unwind their holdings of gold despite the growing prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China.
China ignored U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of further tariffs in the event of retaliation, vowing to immediately impose penalties of the ""same scale"" on American goods, raising the prospect of a tit-for-tat trade war between the world's two largest economies.
That, however, failed to lift demand for safe-haven gold amid expectations the dollar will continue its upside momentum after the Fed earlier this week hinted at a faster pace of monetary policy tightening.
The odds of a fourth rate hike at the Fed's December meeting has soared to 51.1% from 33.8% the previous week, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. 
5. Bitcoin Wobbles as Traders Scramble 
A sea of red emerged in cryptos this week, wiping more than $60 billion from the market, as bitcoin fell to a near four-month low before staging a timid rebound.
Bitcoin started the week on the back foot after South Korean crypto exchange Coinrail confirmed in a tweet cyber thieves had made off with over $30 million worth of lesser-known cryptocurrencies following a successful cyberattack.
That proved to be touch paper for further selloffs as the popular crypto fell close to a four-month low of $6,125.7, rattling traders' appetite to hold cryptos as billions of dollars were pulled from the market.
The total crypto market cap fell to about $282 billion, at the time of writing, from about $342 billion a week ago.
Over the past seven days, Bitcoin fell 18.67% on the Bitfinex exchange, Ethereum fell 14.04%, while Ripple XRP fell 19.29% on the Poloniex exchange."

567,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 02:53PM ET</span>",Merrill Lynch reviewing ban on commissions-paying retirement accounts,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp's Merrill Lynch Wealth Management on Friday said the firm is reconsidering an internal policy from 2017 that banned advisers from opening new retirement accounts that paid them commissions, according to a source familiar with the situation. 
Merrill Lynch, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), moved away from brokerage retirement accounts last year, banning the opening of new ones and moving many clients into advisory accounts, in preparation for the U.S. Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. 
That regulation from former President Barack Obama's administration, which was intended to curb conflicts of interest for financial advisers, was overturned in March by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Merrill Lynch head Andy Sieg told brokers on a conference call on Friday that the firm had launched a 60-day review of its individual retirement account policies and will consider keeping, relaxing or rolling them back, the source said.
""Now that the regulatory environment has shifted, we're taking a look at our policies, especially ... Individual Retirement Accounts, to ensure we keep our clients' best interest front and center,"" company spokesman Matthew Card said in a statement. ""Our core strategy, consistent with our principles, remains unchanged.""
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a replacement rule in April that would require brokers to act in the best interest of a customer when making investment recommendations for any type of accounts. The SEC is currently collecting public comments on the proposal. 
Firms that consider rolling back regulations put in place to comply with the defunct labor department rule must do so with an eye to the new SEC rule, though it is unclear when the SEC will issue a final rule. 
(This version of the story corrects Merrill Lynch head's name to Sieg in fourth paragraph.)

The European Commission said the deal did not raise any competition concerns, confirming a Reuters story last week.
""The proposed transaction would lead to only a limited increase in Sky's existing share of the markets for the acquisition of TV content, as well as in the market for the wholesale supply of TV channels in the relevant member states,"" the EU competition agency said on Friday.

Before the market opened Friday Trump announced that the United States will implement a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of goods from China related to intellectual property and technology, and pledged to impose further levies if China retaliates.
Within minutes of the announcement China said it planned to impose tariff measures of similar size and intensity.
The S&P 500 materials index (SPLRCM) was down 1.2 percent while the industrials index (SPLRCI) fell 0.8 percent after the news. S&P 1500 Steel index <.SPCOMSTEEL> was down 2.7 percent and U.S. Steel Corp (N:X) was last down 5.3 percent. Aluminum supplier  Alcoa  (N:AA) shares fell 5.2 percent.
""Industrial stocks are being hurt by the trade sanctions announced by the U.S. and compounding it is the stronger dollar,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.
Strength in the dollar often hurts companies selling goods overseas as it makes their prices less competitive. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, was last flat after rising as much as 0.4 percent. It was still on track for a 2.9 percent increase for the year to date. 

 Boeing Co  (N:BA) shares were down 2 percent in active trading.  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) shares fell 2.7 percent.

Icahn, whose hedge fund owns 13.6 percent of SandRidge and has said it could make an all-cash offer for the company, is assured of at least two of the seven seats under the formula set by the board and is expected to receive more. He is staking his reputation by pushing for a straight vote on his seven-person slate to manage a sale of the $544 million company after setbacks at Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK).
The investor could win three or four seats with the support of many of its largest shareholders, activists or distressed company investors, said David Beard, analyst at Coker Palmer Institutional.
Institutions including Icahn's hedge fund hold 88 percent of the company's stock, according to Thomson Reuters data, including Fir Tree Partners, Paulson & Co, Guggenheim Capital and Apollo Capital. 
Icahn was not available for immediate comment. 
SandRidge offered itself for sale after Icahn blasted what he called its ""nonsensical"" deal to acquire Bonanza Creek Energy (N:BCEI). That deal collapsed, leading to the ouster of SandRidge's chief executive and finance chief.
On Friday, SandRidge said 17 potential bidders including Icahn were preparing to view confidential financial data. The stock, which is off 26 percent this year to date, rose slightly to $15.44 on Friday.
It has attacked Icahn's board slate in a series of shareholder letters, arguing his losses from $7 billion in past energy company investments total $540 million. Icahn wants to ""gain control of SandRidge without paying an appropriate premium,"" it said. 
Icahn has support for three board seats from proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co. 
The larger number would provide the billionaire ""with a strong presence on the board, but without granting an outright majority to a shareholder who is admittedly part of an ongoing sale process,"" wrote ISS on June 6. 
SandRidge would already have been sold if there was strong demand for its assets, which are largely in high-cost oilfields and in decline, said Coker Palmer's Beard. It could take years to turn around the business no matter who wins the contest, he said. 

""Whether he wins two seats or all the seats, there is no magic switch that he can flip to drive shareholder value in the short term,"" said Beard.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",British M&A booms two years on from Brexit vote,"By Ben Martin and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Deal-making involving UK companies has picked up in the two years since the country's decision to leave the European Union, defying worries that Brexit would stifle mergers and acquisition activity, data from Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence shows.
The surprise referendum result in June 2016 initially stoked fears that deals involving British firms would dry up amid uncertainty about Brexit's impact on the UK economy.
But M&A activity involving UK companies has instead boomed and led to deals with a total value of $551 billion in the 12 months to the middle of June, according to the data. 
That was the highest level since the same period between 2006 and 2007, when deal-making surged before the financial crisis, and compares with $467 billion in the 12 months immediately after the referendum.
A weaker sterling in the wake of the referendum result has made British businesses more attractive targets to overseas buyers in the aftermath of the vote. That helped the level of inbound M&A into the United Kingdom reach a record $262 billion in the last 12 months, the data show. 
""The weakening pound has definitely made UK assets cheaper,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets.
Against the dollar, the pound remains around 12 percent below a pre-Brexit referendum high of above $1.50. On a trade weighted basis against its rivals, the British currency is about 12 percent cheaper than before the referendum vote.
Furthermore, Britain has also been swept up by a global M&A wave as cheap debt, boardroom confidence in the global economy, and high stock market valuations have made it easier for companies around the world to use equity to pay for deals.

The Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence data for the United Kingdom includes the competing bids for pay-TV firm Sky (L:SKYB), which both Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) and Comcast (O:CMCSA) are vying to buy, as well as moves by  Unilever  (L:ULVR) and RELX (L:REL) to unify their dual structures.

PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) has reorganized its sales operations as part of a push into services that has helped it take a lead over rival jet maker Airbus (PA:AIR) this year. 
Boeing set up a standalone division in 2017 to build a $50 billion business in services for civil and defense aircraft. These can include repairs, crew rostering, parts and even wind forecasts. It previously offered only limited services. 
Now sales of jetliner services have been brought under the same umbrella as plane sales, headed by senior vice president Ihssane Mounir, Boeing Co's overall commercial sales chief.
The previously unreported move, which started late last year, is designed to increase the number of deals and boost profits as it will make it easier for Boeing to sell high-margin services at the same time as it sells planes. 
The change comes as airlines try to keep a lid on costs by planning jet purchases and long-term operations together. 
""We approach the campaigns in a much more comprehensive way than we have ever done before,"" said Mounir, whose role was expanded to include responsibility for jetliner-related services across the group.
""So the price and inherent capability of the airplane are just one thing that we are bringing to the table. I'm not going to go beyond that, or I will be divulging the secret sauce.""
Airbus and Boeing dominate the jet market, worth $5 trillion over 20 years. Airbus is also developing services but has not brought sales together yet - though it may do so in future.
Boeing officials say recent sales wins for Boeing's 787 plane over Airbus' A330neo have involved ""multiple plays"" of which coupling jets and services can be one element.[nL5N1QO6BP] 
Mounir's 600-strong sales team has won orders for 376 planes, or 70 percent of new commercial jet orders this year. Airbus has the rest of the main market with 161 planes. 
Analysts say success for the 787 and a potential new mid-market Boeing jet depends in part on clipping the wings of the latest version of Airbus' older competitor, the A330.
European industry sources say Boeing slashed 787 prices to ""kill"" the A330.
Mounir, 46, who was promoted to one of the industry's most daunting jobs in October 2016, denied this.
""It has not been a price game (or) a price strategy,"" Mounir said when asked about the claim, adding multiple factors including improved reliability had boosted the 787.
""I am not out to kill anything; I am out to serve our customers ... I don’t wake up one day and say I am going to go and kill that product.""
Though Mounir will oversee certain services sales, income will still be reported under the Boeing Global Services unit. 
DOUBLE-ACT
Boeing has also sharpened its sales offensive by deploying both Mounir and Commercial Airplanes CEO Kevin McAllister, a former  General Electric  (N:GE) executive steeped in analytics.
The double-act attended a Sydney airline gathering last week and held back-to back meetings with airlines and lessors. Their Airbus counterparts appeared a less comfortable tandem, several delegates said.
""Between the two of us we are at the forefront of the battle...but in the backshop we have people who are really good,"" said Mounir, speaking in his first in-depth interview since taking charge of Boeing jet sales.
Born in Morocco, Mounir left for the United States at 17 and studied and taught aerospace engineering in Kansas before joining Boeing as an aerodynamicist.
Analysts say one of Mounir's challenges is to keep the smaller single-aisle 737 thriving as a main source of profits. Airbus leads that crucial segment with the hot-selling A321neo.
Boeing launched the 737 MAX 10 at last year's Paris Airshow to catch up. Around half the initial sales came at the expense of existing 737 variants, however.
Mounir said the 737 sales were on track and deflected questions about whether Boeing was ready to increase output.
Analysts say both companies could unveil new deals with airlines at the Farnborough Airshow in July.

""If our customers want to do something for the air show, we’ll do something special with them, have fun with them...But we are having a good year; I like where we are,"" Mounir said.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday after the United States announced tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to warn of retaliation and reigniting fears of a trade war between the world's two largest economies.
President Donald Trump said in a statement that a 25 percent tariff would be imposed on an initial list of strategically important imports from China from July 6 and vowed further measures if Beijing struck back.
In response, China's Commerce Ministry said it planned to impose tariffs of similar size and intensity. Beijing has published its own list that targets $50 billion in U.S. goods, including soybeans, aircraft and autos.
Boeing (N:BA), the single largest U.S. exporter to China, fell 1.9 percent, dragging the Dow lower for the fourth day in a row. 
Construction equipment maker  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) dropped 2.4 percent, agricultural trader  Bunge  (N:BG) 2.3 percent and automaker General Motors (N:GM) 1.6 percent 
Global financial markets have struggled since February in the face of signs Washington and Beijing were headed toward a trade war after several rounds of negotiations failed to resolve U.S. complaints over Chinese industrial policy, market access and a $375 billion trade gap.
""With the announcement of the tariffs there's a real risk that we can see a continued increased escalation,"" said Robin Anderson, senior economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa.
""A lot of market participants had anticipated the Trump administration and the Chinese to negotiate and not fully implement tariffs. But they did, which is a little bit of a disappointment.""
Investors are also weighing the impact of tightening monetary policy by central banks on the equities market.
The U.S. Federal Reserve increased its key interest rate for the second time this year on Wednesday and hinted at the possibility of two more hikes by the end of 2018. 
The European Central Bank weighed in on Thursday to say it would end its bond-purchase program at year-end, even if any interest rate hike was still distant.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Bank of America (N:BAC) has hired  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) veteran Bernard Mourad, who recently worked as an adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron, as its new head of corporate and investment banking for France, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
    Mourad, who is one of France's most well-connected bankers and made his name advising French telecoms tycoon Patrick Drahi on a string of deals to build his Altice empire, will start his new post in September, two of the sources said.
His appointment comes amid efforts by Bank of America to win more advisory work in France, where the bank slipped to twelfth in last year's league tables for domestic merger and acquisition (M&A) fees from fourth in 2016.
    The Wall Street bank is betting big on France, where it plans to relocate hundreds of people to its new office in Paris in preparation for Britain's departure from the European Union. 
    A first wave of moves from London will begin early next year and will affect roughly 400 jobs in Bank of America's markets, trading, sales and fixed income teams, sources have told Reuters.
    Mourad left Morgan Stanley in January 2015 after 15 years to join Altice, where he became president of its media group, which backs several news outlets such as French newspaper Liberation, and was also named deputy CEO of SFR Media. 
    But in October 2016 he resigned to become an adviser to Macron during his campaign to become president with his newly-formed party En Marche.
Stephane Courbon currently heads Bank of America's investment banking for France. It was not immediately clear how Mourad's appointment would affect his job.

The meeting also included representatives of China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors, State Administration of Foreign Exchange and China Development Bank, according to the report.
The government has asked HNA to stop diversifying via acquisitions and focus on its main travel business, the report said.
The Chinese aviation-to-financial services has been unloading assets and its stakes in companies such as  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT), Park Hotels & Resorts (N:PK) and Spain's NH Hotels (MC:NHH) as part of a wider reorganization.
The moves were sparked by mounting debt levels after announcing more than $50 billion worth of global M&A deals over 2016 and 2017.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 11:23AM ET</span>",Wells Fargo receives final approval to settle $142 million lawsuit,"(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Friday it received final approval from a district court in California to settle a $142 million class-action lawsuit, which compensates customers affected by a sales scandal related to phony bank accounts.
The settlement, in which Wells had received a preliminary approval in July last year, sets aside funds for compensating customers after the bank opened consumer or small business accounts, credit cards or lines of credit without their knowledge between 2002 and April 2017.
The United States' fourth-biggest bank is dealing with the fallout of two years of investigations, agreeing in April to pay $1 billion to settle with regulators who say it forced auto insurance on hundreds of thousands and routinely hit homebuyers with excessive fees.
Last month, the bank also agreed to pay $480 million to resolve a securities fraud lawsuit filed with the District Court for the Northern District of California which alleged the bank made certain misstatements and omissions in disclosures related to its sales practices.
Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said Friday's announcement was ""a significant step forward in making things right for our customers and restoring trust all of Wells Fargo's stakeholders."" 
Customers have until July 7 to claim money. 
Announcing the settlement with regulators in August, the bank also said that the mortgage and auto programs together ensnared more than 600,000 customers and would require nearly $300 million in refunds.
Analysts worry the scandal has hurt Wells Fargo both by distracting executives with investigations and lawsuits, and through its impact on the bank's public image.
In February, the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed a consent order on Wells that restricted it to grow assets beyond the $1.95 trillion it had at the end of last year ""until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls.""
Sloan, since then, has reassured shareholders numerous times that the bank was stable and ""open for business"".
Employees have also sought to downplay the scandal's impact on profitability or market share, and have said that few customers have left the bank.

Wells Fargo's shares were up 0.3 percent at $54.92 on Friday.

NEW YORK (LPC) - Electronic loan trading volume is rising in the US$1trn US leveraged loan market, but these trades still make up just a fraction of overall activity as many participants have yet to embrace the technology.  
About US$5bn of loan trades have been completed in the last 12 months on Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch’s Instinct Loans platform, about even with the prior year, which was introduced two years ago. 
MarketAxess, a multi-dealer system, said trade volume in the first quarter jumped more than 123% year-over-year, but activity was still just US$643m for loans compared to US$47bn for high-yield bonds. 
Electronic trading across investments increased as banks pulled back from making markets due to regulatory pressure, and new platforms offered liquidity by facilitating multiple offers. While other asset classes have started to use electronic systems, most loan trades are still completed over the phone, although lenders are positive about their future use.  
“If you look at loan trading, and all credit and fixed-income trading, electronic trading is a huge focus for clients, and more and more clients are looking at electronic [platforms],” said Alex Naboicheck, head of US par loan trading at BAML. “The [Instinct Loans] system continues to be successful and client adaption has continued.”
More than US$714bn of loans were traded in 2017, up almost 14% from 2016, according to IHS Markit, which includes transactions entered into before new-issue loans were completed, but only a small fraction were completed electronically.
Platforms can create more liquidity and streamline trading, but some participants say their firms do not do enough volume to warrant using an electronic system, or are afraid of trading away from arrangers who can dictate future new-issue allocations. 
COTTON ANNIVERSARY
BAML’s Instinct Loans, which started trading in June 2016, promised to deliver liquidity to the US leveraged loan market by offering two daily, thirty-minute trading sessions that allow multiple participants to bid on a specified number of loans.
While almost US$5bn of purely electronic trades was completed on Instinct in its second year, about another US$2bn traded as voice follow-ups to inquiry initiating from the platform. During that period, 276 different loans were bid or offered during the sessions. 
The bank said 15 clients executed 20% or more of their total yearly trading volume through Instinct.
BAML added new features last year, including a spreadsheet upload tool, which allows clients to enter an Excel file into Instinct with names they want to buy or sell, along with the price they would like to trade at. If the price is matched or bettered, the trade will be executed, which offers an alternative to a traditional OWIC or BWIC, said Naboicheck.
The bank also now offers commission-free trading for clients that put in US$25m of bids or offers in a session, he said.
“Everything done for Instinct has been to increase liquidity, and allowing and encouraging clients to put more bid and offers [in the system] helps accomplish that,” Naboicheck said.
MarketAxess’ electronic loan trading platform was launched in the second half of 2016, and allows investors to request loan prices from a variety of firms.
There are now 13 dealers using the loan system including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), and about 40 active clients, according to Sandy White, the high yield and leveraged loan product manager at MarketAxess.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel hinted at a new front in the trade row with the United States on Friday, warning that Europe's strategic interests rode on the future of Europe's car industry and hinting at competition probes of U.S. internet giants.
Just as U.S. President Donald Trump had given national security as a reason for threatening punitive tariffs on German cars, ""We should think about the strategic significance of the auto industry for the European Union so we can prepare an exchange with the U.S.,"" she said.
Trump has repeatedly criticised Europe, and Germany in particular, for running large trade surpluses over the United States, promising to put an end to what he saw as the continent free-riding on U.S. prosperity.
Speaking at an event to mark 70 years of Germany's ""social market"" economic model, she said the market dominance of giant U.S. internet platforms also posed a challenge to Europe's social model.
""The platform economy is a big problem,"" she said. ""It challenges both our competition authorities and the EU's, and raises the question of whether they need to get involved in the matter of the big concentration of big platforms from the U.S.""
Amid criticism of large digital companies, like Facebook (O:FB) and Google (O:GOOGL), the European Commission in March proposed taxing large corporations for their digital turnover - though finance ministers of the European Union's three Nordic countries have urged their partners to shelve the plan.
Such companies are accused by some EU states of paying too little tax in Europe, exploiting an outdated system that has allowed them to shift profits to low-tax countries like Luxembourg or Ireland.
This week, Merkel pushed strongly against Trump's view of the U.S.-EU trade relationship, saying that, if the repatriated European profits of U.S. internet giants were included, then the U.S. ran a current account surplus.
But, despite hinting at retaliatory measures that might be in the offing if the United States kept its hard line on trade, she stressed that she would prefer to stick to a multilateral path.
""You could of course say that in time of disruptive change, completely different methods are needed,"" she said. ""But the outcome of this approach is so uncertain, and so much is at stake, that we have to at least attempt multilateral deals.""
Trump's hardline stance on trade is major headache for German companies, which are heavily dependent on exports.
In addition to the EU-U.S. trade dispute, they fear that a similar confrontation between the United States and China could be detrimental.
Trump on Friday announced hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports and China threatened to retaliate in kind.
""The introduction of U.S. tariffs on China affects German businesses too,"" said Eric Schweitzer, president of the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce. ""German companies could get into trouble because of the trade dispute between the United States and China.""
Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI industry association, also said the trade conflict between the United States and China was hurting Germany, adding: ""There's a risk of a global spiral of protectionism.""

He said open trade was essential for German prosperity and employment given the nation's reliance on exports, adding that around 9 percent of German exports had gone to the United States last year and around 7 percent to China.

The latest measures are having the opposite effect, at least so far. Shares in Alcoa fell as much as 3.7 percent Friday, while the Pittsburgh-based steelmaker lost 4.8 percent.
It’s part of a mining and metal selloff fueled by concern that Trump’s announcement of tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports will end up curtailing demand in the world’s biggest consumer of raw materials.

Investors from around the world have lodged lawsuits at a regional court in Braunschweig, seeking around 9 billion euros ($10.4 billion) in damages from Volkswagen, which they say did not inform shareholders quickly enough over its cheating of emissions tests in the United States.
The lawsuit at the regional court in Braunschweig, near VW's Wolfsburg headquarters, is led by investment firm Deka. 
Due to procedural matters, the suit will now be extended to Porsche SE, the investment vehicle for the Porsche and Piech families that controls 52 percent of VW's voting stock, a spokeswoman for the court said.
""The third civil senate of the Higher Regional Court of Braunschweig today clarified that besides Volkswagen, Porsche Automobil Holding SE is also a defendant in the capital investor model procedure"" pending at the court, the court said in a statement. 
Lawyers for VW have said the carmaker had no obligation to disclose the possible financial damage of its emissions manipulations prior to Sept. 22, 2015 when it specified the implications of its use of illicit emissions-control software, because it believed the financial costs of the cheating would be insignificant.
""This (move by the Braunschweig court) is giving investors another chance to submit further claims,"" said Axel Wegner of law firm Tilp, which represents Deka Investment GmbH. 
Deka lost money on its VW shares when they fell sharply after the emissions cheating but says the purpose of its legal action is to provide a test case - resolving generic or common issues for other related cases. However, unlike in a U.S. class action suit, this case does not have the legal effect of resolving all individual claims.
Public hearings of the Braunschweig case are due to start in early September.

NEW YORK (LPC) - Media company Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp’s record all-cash US$65bn bid to buy Twenty-First Century Fox’s media assets, a day after AT&T’s long-sought acquisition of Time Warner received a green light, signals an oncoming wave of M&A that banks will aggressively compete to finance.
The federal judge’s ruling in favor of the US$85bn AT&T/Time Warner tie-up, first announced in October 2016, without any conditions, removed an obstacle for debt markets after several huge, high profile technology and healthcare deals were scuttled by antitrust or national security concerns.
“After the AT&T (NYSE:T) news, people have a much more optimistic view on the regulatory front, and I think that will push bankers to pitch more on M&A,” said one senior banker. “There’s more of a willingness to look at vertical integrations,” in which a company buys a supplier.
Comcast, in announcing its Walt Disney Co-topping bid, said it had “highly confident” letters from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) that the banks can secure the needed financing for the proposed acquisition.
A considerable amount of the needed financing was already put in place before this newly raised bid. In April, the company said it lined up £23bn (US$32bn) of loans led by BAML and Wells Fargo.
The existing credit comprises up to £16bn of 364-day bridge loans and up to £7bn of term loans, with the bridge expected to be replaced in part or in full by senior unsecured bonds, LPC previously reported. 
BAML and Wells Fargo declined to comment.
The AT&T victory “does make people feel a bit more of a risk appetite for complex transactions on the regulatory front,” said another banker.
Vertical transactions tend to be better for the M&A market because they allow companies to get into complementary areas for growth, as opposed to horizontal deals which focus more on synergies and cost cutting, he said. “That can be pretty helpful to the overall M&A market.”
Corporations buying other companies for growth have helped drive total M&A lending up to US$326bn so far this year, a 39% leap above the same time last year, according to LPC data.
Attention shifts next to Disney, and whether it answers Comcast’s bid by increasing its US$52bn all-stock agreement to purchase Fox’s film, television and international businesses.
And still in the regulatory review line is T-Mobile’s US$26bn proposed merger with Sprint, two leading wireless carrier competitors, in what is considered a horizontal deal.
HIGHLY CONFIDENT
As for Comcast’s new financing, banks typically provide ""highly confident"" letters as a tactic used for large hostile takeovers, that allows borrowers to avoid paying fees on funds committed by banks to a huge deal that may not take place.
Banks do not immediately tie up their balance sheets, as a result, while signaling to markets that financing will be there if the deal is approved.
Similarly, five initial banks indicated their confidence this way last November for chipmaker Broadcom’s unsolicited bid to buy rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The lending group was later expanded and provided US$100bn of financing – the largest loan package ever – before the deal was ultimately canceled as President Trump blocked the merger over national security concerns.
Banks remain eager to put money to work and see a more open dealmaking path after the AT&T/Time Warner merger outcome.

“Now that the judge has given the all-clear, without conditions, it’s basically a free ride, and this will open up other opportunities for companies in the space that need to position themselves,” a third banker said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Dozens of industrial plants in Russia have turned to the state's reinsurance company for cover after an extension of U.S. sanctions made it difficult to get reinsurance elsewhere, the head of that firm told Reuters.
The Russian National Reinsurance Company (RNRC) has signed the new contracts for dozens of industrial plants since new sanctions took effect in early April to cover risks including a halt in production or shipping, he said.
Nikolay Galushin's comments underscore the impact of fresh sanctions on the Russian economy as it chokes off access to regular reinsurance - a critical process that backstops insurance by sharing large risks.
RNRC was set up chiefly to offer reinsurance to firms barred from using Western providers. 
On April 6, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Russian magnate Oleg Deripaska and companies in which he is a large shareholder, including the world's second-largest aluminum producer Rusal (HK:0486), in response to what it called ""malign activities"" by Russia. 
The firms owned by billionaire Viktor Vekselberg were also sanctioned, as the United States responded to suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 election. 
""The insurance company which was covering these risks asked the foreign market (counterparts) where these risks were offloaded: are you with us or with the sanctions?"" Galushin said. 
""Basically, each single reinsurer said: we've pulled out, we can't do it,"" he said. Galushin did not name any companies whose risks RNRC has taken since April 6.
Galushin said that previously such risks had been ""almost entirely offloaded in the West"".
""We have taken the risks of all who had pulled out,"" he said. 
Relations between Russia and the West have worsened after Moscow annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine. 
Since then, a wide range of sanctions on companies, banks and individuals were imposed on Russia by the European Union, the United States and other Western nations.
Washington suggested it might lift the sanctions against Rusal and its parent En+ if Deripaska cuts his En+ stake to below 50 percent and introduces independent board members. 
The firms are set until mid-summer to come up with a plan to meet U.S. requirements to escape sanctions.
""There are a couple of dozen industrial plants which are insuring their property, (potential) losses from stoppage in production, cargoes, liability etc,"" Galushin said.
Deripaska's business empire includes insurer Ingosstrakh  as well as EuroSibEnergo. The U.S. Treasury gave Deripaska's counterparts until Oct. 22 to wind down business with Rusal.
Galushin said that the reinsurance liability limit on the single event on the ""new (sanctioned) risks"" exceeds 20 billion rubles ($320 million). RNRC's capital is 21.3 billion rubles and it also has central bank guarantee worth 49.7 billion rubles.
He said that the current capital was enough to cover for any potential payouts under the commercial contracts it has while in an event of a sanctioned company payout the central bank was ready to provide more funds.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors pulled more cash out of European and emerging markets in the past week, opting instead for U.S. stocks, as robust economic growth encouraged a sixth straight week of inflows, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said on Friday.
The bank's data, which tracks fund flows from Wednesday to Wednesday, references a period when investors braced for the U.S. Federal Reserve's second interest rate rise of 2018 and awaited signals from the European Central Bank on its stimulus exit path. The ECB said on Thursday it would end bond buying this year but not raise rates until the second half of 2019.
BAML said the week had seen $5.6 billion enter global equity funds, with U.S. stocks accounting for a $10.3 billion inflow and European equities losing $2.5 billion. Emerging stocks funds shed $1.3 billion and Japan suffered $400 million outflows.
""It's a game and world of two halves,"" BAML analysts wrote in a reference to the football World Cup which started this week in Russia. 
""U.S. decoupling from the rest of the world accelerating,"" BAML said, noting that in the past six weeks $29 billion had flowed to U.S. stocks, contrasting with losses of $13 billion from European markets. 
Emerging debt and equity redemptions now amount to $12 billion over the past seven weeks, the bank added.
""The bigger picture is global QE is ending, with the United States the sole growth story.""
Moreover, U.S. equities now stand just 3 percent off all-time highs, while euro zone and Chinese stocks languish around 30 percent off peaks, the note said.
European equities have shed nearly $20 billion so far this year, fund flows data shows, and a pan-European equity index is barely in positive territory, hit by signs of a growth slowdown and also fears the United States will impose large import tariffs on goods such as autos and steel.
U.S. markets meanwhile are benefiting from large tax cuts as well as the continued rally in technology shares.
On bond markets, investors bought higher quality investment-grade debt for the fourth week in a row, putting in $900 million, while junk-rated debt witnessed their sixth week of outflows. 

Emerging debt funds suffered their eighth straight loss-making week, shedding $1.3 billion.

ROME (Reuters) - An Italian administrative court has ruled that it cannot hear a case over derivatives brought against  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) that included a request for 2.7 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in damages from the U.S. investment bank. 
The ruling by the Court of Accounts published on Friday was made on April 19. A spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
""This court does not have jurisdiction,"" reads an excerpt from the ruling obtained by Reuters. 
The administrative court can appeal. The state now has three months to bring the matter before a new tribunal if it so chooses. 
Morgan Stanley had denied any wrongdoing and its lawyers had argued that a civil court should have had jurisdiction.
The case centers on Morgan Stanley derivative transactions made by the Italian state between 1995 and 2005 and terminated in December 2011 and January 2012.
The interest rate derivatives were meant as a form of insurance for the Italian government, one of the most heavily indebted in Europe, in the event that market rates rose.
Instead, after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, interest rates plunged, and the state incurred large losses on its derivative positions as it was able to borrow more cheaply in the bond markets.
State prosecutors had argued that some contracts negotiated with Morgan Stanley were speculative in nature and contained termination clauses that were overly advantageous to the bank.
""It cannot be held that the derivatives contracts being contested constitute a violation of law,"" reads an excerpt from the 80-page document that explains the ruling.
Morgan Stanley has repeatedly said the claim is groundless, and in August 2016 the bank rejected a settlement proposal from an Italian prosecutor for a one-off payment, a securities filing showed. 
The case also included claims against former senior officials at Italy's Treasury for a total of 1.18 billion euros. All the defendants have denied any wrongdoing.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 09:15AM ET</span>",Qualcomm-NXP deal still waiting for China nod: sources,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is yet to approve U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc's (O:QCOM) proposed $44 billion acquisition of  NXP Semiconductors  (O:NXPI), three people close to the talks said, dismissing an earlier media report that said Beijing had already greenlit the deal.
Chinese clearance would remove a long-running roadblock to the deal that has become entangled with broader trade tensions between the United States and China. The acquisition has already got a nod from eight of the nine required global regulators, with China being the only hold-out.
Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Friday morning that China had given its go-ahead to the deal, citing people with knowledge of the matter, driving up shares of the U.S. firm in extended trade.
But Reuters sources, who are close to the Qualcomm-NXP deal, said they were not aware of any Chinese approval. One of them said planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods expected to be unveiled later in the day could impact the process. 
Qualcomm did not have an immediate comment on Friday, while NXP did not respond to a request for comment.
China's State Administration for Market Regulation, the regulator which reviews merger deals, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. 
Qualcomm met with regulators in Beijing last month in a bid to secure a clearance, but sources at the time said an approval would depend on the progress of broader bilateral talks and the U.S. government lifting a crippling supplier ban on telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) (HK:0763).
Washington and Beijing have struck a deal to help ZTE back into business. However, trade talks remain in the balance with U.S. President Donald Trump expected to unveil ""pretty significant"" tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday.
Analysts said a Chinese approval would be significant as it would remove the last major barrier to the NXP deal, which is seen as key for Qualcomm to diversify its business and make a push into new areas like smart cars.
The U.S. chipmaker on Friday extended its cash tender offer to buy all shares of NXP by a week.

The offer is now scheduled to expire on June 22, the latest in a series of extensions since Qualcomm initially announced its bid for the Dutch semiconductor company in October 2016.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors snatched $9.7 billion out of stocks during the latest week, marking the largest withdrawals since early April, according to Lipper data on Thursday.
The withdrawals put more pressure on emerging markets as well. The research service's data covers the seven days through June 13, closing out on the same day that the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates.
The Fed on Wednesday also dropped its pledge to keep rates low enough to stimulate the economy ""for some time,"" and signaled a slightly faster pace of rate increases in the coming months, with two additional hikes expected by the end of this year, compared to one previously.
U.S. financial sector funds seen as benefiting from higher rates pulled in $793 million, the most since February.
Tensions between the United States and its trading partners threaten to shake the market's calm.
U.S. President Trump has made up his mind to impose ""pretty significant"" tariffs on Chinese goods, an administration official said on Thursday, as Beijing warned that it was ready to respond if Washington chose to ratchet up trade tensions.
""We had strong returns this week, but the mutual fund and [exchange-traded fund] investors weren't buying it,"" said Tom Roseen, head of research services for Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit.
""I don't think it's concerning at all but it tells us investors were taking some of that hard-won profit off the table.""
MSCI's emerging markets index is down nearly 3 percent this year, while the S&P 500 in the United States has delivered a positive 5 percent total return.
Dollar strength and tighter monetary policy have highlighted weaknesses in economies from Brazil to Argentina and Turkey, including questions about whether they can honor debts denominated in dollars that are growing harder to come by.
U.S.-based funds that invest primarily in emerging market stocks are on course for a second straight month of withdrawals and first quarter of outflows since 2016. More than $1.1 billion rolled out of the products during the latest week.
""Some people are concerned with global growth, but the Fed does have room as far as the U.S. economy goes,"" said Roseen.

635,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>","Trump Targets $50 Billion in China Goods, Vows More If Needed","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s administration moved the U.S. to the brink of a trade war with China, announcing tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports that America’s biggest trading partner has vowed to retaliate against.
In a statement Friday, Trump pledged additional tariffs if China follows through on the retaliation threats. The 25 percent duties are a response to the U.S.’s so-called Section 301 investigation earlier this year that accused China of stealing U.S. intellectual property in an effort to dominate the development of advanced technology.
“The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,” Trump said in the statement.
China, the world’s No. 2 behind the U.S., has pledged to retaliate on U.S. exports including soybeans and pork. The U.S. imported $505 billion of goods from China last year and exported about $130 billion, leaving a 2017 deficit of $376 billion, according to government figures.
Trump has frequently cited such an imbalance as the justification for a punitive trade policy toward China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and other trading partners.
“These tariffs are essential to preventing further unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China, which will protect American jobs,” he said. “In addition, they will serve as an initial step toward bringing balance to the trade relationship between the United States and China.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares fell and were set to end the week in the red on Friday while the dollar hit a seven-month high, as investors braced for a list of Chinese goods targeted in a first round of announced trade tariffs by the United States.
The MSCI All Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.3 percent in morning trade in Europe and set for a weekly loss. Wall Street was set to open lower.
U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to impose ""pretty significant"" tariffs and will announce a list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods on Friday, and a second wave of products worth $100 billion has been cued up. Beijing vowed it would strike back quickly if its interests were hurt.
The outbreak of a global trade war has been the most frequently cited 'biggest tail risk' by investors this year in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's monthly survey of global fund managers, on the back of ramped up protectionist rhetoric and measures by the U.S. administration.
It is not clear when Trump will activate the measures, but rising Sino-U.S. trade tensions will put more pressure on China's economy, which is starting to show signs of cooling after a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending.
Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said that in the context of trade flows, the sum of goods targeted was small.
""The big question is do we fall into tit for tat? What's the response going to be from China and the EU? Can it remain at a technical level or will we see a series of high-profile failing conversations between Mr Trump and other leaders?"" 
""That may not affect GDP growth all that much in the short term, but it will have a noticeable impact on cross-border capital flows and business sentiment,"" Milligan said.
The Asia Pacific MSCI index ex-Japan edged down 0.3 percent and was set for a weekly loss of more than 1 percent. Many markets in Asia were closed on Friday for holidays celebrating the end of Ramadan.
Chinese stocks led the losses, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite index plumbing a 20-month low, as investors worried about the economic damage from the trade tensions with the United State.
Japan's Nikkei average closed up 0.5 percent and Australian shares ended 1.3 percent higher.
European shares were set for their best week in more than three months as investors pushed back expectations for an interest rate increase after Thursday's European Central Bank meeting.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.4 percent, as a recovering euro weighed. Both stocks and the euro dipped briefly on a report said Germany's Christian Social Union party would dissolve its alliance with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. They recovered after the report was denied, and found to be a hoax. 
The single currency was headed for its worst weekly loss in 19 months after the ECB on Thursday signaled interest rates would be left at record lows into at least mid-2019. The currency had shed 1.9 percent to the dollar, its biggest daily decline since Britain voted to quit the EU in 2016.
The overall weakness in the euro gave a lift to the dollar, which hit its highest against a basket of currencies since November 2017. 
""I think the biggest concern at the moment, more than talk about trade, is the tightening of monetary conditions in emerging markets caused by a stronger dollar,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London, noting the Federal Reserve's forecast for a total of four interest rate rises in 2018.
While the Federal Reserve and the ECB provided much of the week's central bank fireworks, the Bank of Japan produced no surprises at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Friday and looked set to continue its asset purchases for some time.
Boosted by the ECB's announcement and positive comments on the euro from politicians in Rome, Italy's government bonds were on course for best week since Mario's Draghi's ""whatever it takes"" Outright Monetary Transactions program was created in September 2012. 
Oil prices fell as investors eyed a key OPEC meeting in Vienna. Saudi Arabia and Russia, architects of a producer deal to cut output, have indicated they want production to rise.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were down 0.3 percent at $66.69 per barrel; Brent was down 1 percent at $75.20.

A report to that effect had appeared earlier on a hoax Twitter account, briefly rattling markets.
The single currency (EUR=EBS), which briefly slipped into negative territory on the report, bounced a quarter of a percent after the denials and was trading at $1.1596.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) rapidly recovered most of its losses after the report, to trade 0.2 percent down on the day, while safe-haven German 10-year government bonds saw yields rise slightly off the session low of 0.38 percent (DE10YT=RR) which was touched after the reports. 
The disagreement between Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party on the refugee issue threatens the future of her coalition three months after it took office. 
On Friday, a senior CSU lawmaker said they want to preserve the parliamentary alliance with Germany's Merkel.

638,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>","HSBC battles entrenched locals, past mistakes in U.S. credit card push","By Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC's push into credit cards and personal loans in the United States will be no easy task as the bank faces entrenched domestic rivals and the legacy of a previous disastrous foray into U.S. lending.
The move by HSBC to embrace a riskier but more lucrative slice of the U.S. market, that it has largely shunned in recent years, is part of its broader strategy announced on Monday to improve profitability - eyeing a global return on equity of 11 percent by 2020. 
The bank's U.S. return on tangible equity, a key measure of profitability, is currently just 0.9 percent.
HSBC has just 0.1 percent of the credit card market in the U.S., according to data from RFi Group provided to Reuters, compared with 16 percent and 15 percent for market leaders Bank of America (N:BAC) and JPMorgan (N:JPM).
HSBC's plan is to sign up more of its existing customers for credit, as well as enticing new ones with cards that offer low fees or attractive cashback rates, according to Marcos Meneguzzi, head of cards and unsecured lending for HSBC in the U.S.
Europe's biggest bank will also be trying to sign up U.S. customers who are likely to have multiple cards already.
""It's a good time to be in the U.S. card market, notwithstanding the competition is fierce,"" said David Robertson, publisher of the influential Nilson report on the U.S. credit card market, citing low default levels and the growing economy.
""The question is whether you can convince your customer who already has a Capital One Card, and an America Express card and likely a couple of others, that they need yet one more.""
(For a graphic on HSBC's U.S. market share click https://reut.rs/2JFIeBI)
HSBC's target for the U.S. is to improve returns to over six percent by 2020.
HSBC's underperformance in the U.S, where it is a relative minnow in contrast to its strong position in Europe and Asia, is partly a legacy of its disastrous foray into subprime lending in the country when it bought consumer lender Household in 2003.
That deal saw the bank heavily exposed to the imploding U.S. subprime mortgage market as the 2007-8 crisis hit, costing the bank billions of dollars in writedowns and lawsuits and dampening its appetite in the world's biggest economy for a decade.
HSBC will this time focus on less risky borrowers that it knows more about, its executives said.

""We are focusing on prime customers who are engaging with the HSBC brand and eventually might be interested in building a broader relationship with us,"" said Pablo Sanchez, head of retail banking and wealth management U.S. at HSBC.

China has been under pressure to boost corporate governance at listed firms as the inclusion of mainland stocks in the MSCI's emerging markets benchmark on June 1 has put its stock market in the global limelight.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said listed firms should also take up the responsibility of helping impoverished regions, as it published revised corporate governance rules on its website seeking comment from the public. 
The regulator said the rule changes would impose more restraints on the power of controlling shareholders, and better protect the interests of small shareholders.
The revised rules require listed companies to ""beef up the work of Party-building and shoulder more social responsibilities, such as contributing to a better ecological system and helping the poor,"" CSRC said in the statement. 
However, beefing up ""Communist Party building"" at listed companies, a reference to studying the party's theories, conducting social activities in line with party doctrine and making rules along party lines, could be seen by some overseas investors and analysts as potentially causing conflict with shareholders.
The presence of party units has long been a fact of doing business in China, where party organizations exist in nearly 70 percent of some 1.86 million privately owned companies, the official China Daily said last year.
The regulator said it had also set up a basic framework for listed companies to disclose environmental, social and governance (ESG) information.

MSCI has said the ESG ratings of China-listed firms are low compared with firms in many other emerging markets, and the U.S. index publisher plans to publish a China ESG index next year.

The indictment filed in San Jose, California, alleges each defendant was aware that the trade secrets were stolen and that they were being possessed without authorization.
The individuals had all worked for the now-defunct San Francisco-based Jawbone, owned by AliphCom Inc, for at least a year between May 2011 and April 2015, before being employed by Fitbit, it said.
Each of them has been charged with one or more counts of possession of trade secrets and is scheduled to make an initial court appearance on July 9, the DoJ said.
Jawbone sued Fitbit in May 2015, just weeks before the wearable device maker's IPO, alleging Fitbit engaged in a clandestine effort to steal talent, trade secrets and intellectual property. However, the companies reached a global settlement agreement resolving all outstanding litigation in December 2017.

A Fitbit spokesman responded by pointing to a 2016 case involving the same individuals and said a federal administrative law judge found that ""no Jawbone trade secrets were misappropriated or used in any Fitbit product, feature or technology.""

Airbus CEO Tom Enders told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that a decision by Germany and France to develop a new ""Future Combat Air System"" was an important step toward expanding European defense cooperation.
He said Airbus and Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) had come to agreement surprisingly quickly on their respective roles in the fighter jet project, but warned governments against trying to influence the process. 
""It will be a success if we don't let governments interfere with their demands for the use of specific suppliers and locations in certain countries. That will only lead to disaster,"" Enders told the newspaper.
Similar issues have cost Airbus dearly, said Enders, who has often criticized the way the multi-nation A400M military transport plane program was structured when it began. Airbus took a further 1.3 billion euro ($1.5 billion) charge on the troubled program in February.
""I hope that European companies will insist that future multilateral programs have clear leadership structures and reasonable technical requirements and timetables,"" he told the newspaper.
Airbus, which builds the Eurofighter Typhoon, and Dassault, which builds the Rafale jet, signed an initial agreement in April to cooperate on the new air combat system, with an eye to replacing current fighter jets by around 2035-2040.
Enders also called for Germany to move forward more boldly on closer European defense integration, citing concerns about what he called the ""deplorable"" state of the German military after years of neglect.
One key step would be to introduce majority-rule decisions in European foreign policy, replacing the current requirement for unanimous decisions, Enders said.
""Europe can only safeguard its interests if it is unified. It's burning all around us,"" the Airbus executive said, citing escalating tensions with the United States, difficult ties with China and Russia, and increasing tensions within the EU itself.
He urged EU officials and member countries to focus less on EU budget debates and more on strengthening security, securing Europe's borders and moving forward on a joint foreign and defense policy.
The EU also needed to look at tax cuts pushed through by U.S. President Donald Trump that were providing a big incentive for companies to invest there, he said.

""If we in Europe continue to have high government spending and thereby high taxes, we will fall behind,"" he said. ""The low tax rates and the threatened protectionism are a strong incentive to invest more there.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's (N:F) struggle to boost sales in China showed no sign of ending soon with volumes for May sliding 29 percent despite steps being taken by the U.S. automaker like appointing a new sales leader and readying launches of new products.
The company's sales volumes in the world's biggest auto market fell in May to 61,744 vehicles from a year earlier, Ford said on Friday. 
That took sales volumes for the first five months of the year to 338,386 vehicles, down 22 percent from the corresponding period a year ago.
Ford has been dealing with the sales slump since last year, caused in part by a dearth of competitive fresh products.
The company has since announced plans for several new products including the redesigned Focus and Escort cars, as well as the Nautilus, a new premium Lincoln model Ford is gearing to sell soon.
The problem is those new models won't start arriving in dealer showrooms until later this year.
“We are progressing our China 2025 strategy by introducing a series of new products..., sharpening our operational execution, and improving our business fitness as we prepare for a new chapter of growth,"" Peter Fleet, head of Ford's Asia Pacific operations, said in a statement.
Ford earlier this month announced a new sales leader for its premium Lincoln brand, appointing Mao Jingbo, a former Mercedes-Benz China senior executive, to replace the current leader Amy Marentic, who is returning to the United States to assume a new position at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.
Its sales fell 6 percent last year even as overall vehicle sales in China rose 3 percent.

Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) plans to build a global trucks business by integrating its MAN and Scania divisions and building a stake in U.S. truck maker Navistar (N:NAV) to challenge rivals  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volvo (ST:VOLVb).
These plans were dealt a blow when the truck and bus division's previous CFO Matthias Gruendler resigned for personal reasons last month.
Schulz has been responsible for strategy, mergers and managing the relationship with Navistar and Hino, VW said. He joined the group in January 2017 from rival Daimler (DE:DAIGn).
Separately a spokeswoman for Volkswagen Truck & Bus said the division had on Thursday converted its corporate designation from a GmbH, or a limited liability company, into an AG, or a stock corporation.
That would make it easier to issue shares if the division were to be floated. Volkswagen has said it is considering a listing or partial listing of the trucks division, but that this will not happen in 2018.
A flotation would allow Volkswagen Truck & Bus to build a war chest to buy out Navistar. Regulatory filings by the U.S. truck maker from April showed that Volkswagen could take full control of the company going forward. 
VW already has a 16.85 percent Navistar stake and both truck makers are already collaborating in the area of electrification.

653,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Powell Styles Himself Fed Chairman for the People as Rates Bite,"(Bloomberg) -- Alan Greenspan famously said he’d mastered the art of mumbling “with great incoherence” as Federal Reserve chairman. Jerome Powell is attempting the opposite approach.
“Because monetary policy affects everyone, I want to start with a plain English summary of how the economy is doing, what my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are trying to do and why,” Powell, who took the helm at the U.S. central bank in February, said at the outset of his June post-meeting press conference on Wednesday.
That bid for a broader audience is the latest step in an evolution: Fed leaders have been striving toward greater transparency for years, and now Powell is pushing democratization a step further.
He’s a non-economist who uses concise, simple terms -- growth is “great” and “there’s a lot to like” about low unemployment. He downplays the importance of modeled relationships and emphasizes the data in hand. He’s adding more press conferences, and the Federal Open Market Committee has already shortened its post-meeting statement under his watch.
The shift toward plain-spokenness comes as the Fed approaches a treacherous policy juncture.
Starting next year, policy makers expect to lift rates past their neutral level, so that monetary policy will stop boosting the economy and start holding it back. Running tight policy has been a public relations headache for the Fed throughout its history, and communicating a rationale early, optimistically, and in a way the public can understand could help to contain any backlash.
“The Federal Reserve has the incredible challenge that they have to communicate that wage growth can actually be too high, and that the unemployment rate can be too low,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.
Sign of Times
In some ways, Powell’s increased transparency fits his time. He was appointed by President Donald Trump, who is in constant, direct communication with the public that elected him after warming to his blunt style. Like Trump, Powell accentuates the positive while also acknowledging Americans’ economic pain.
“Most people who want a job can find one,” he said Wednesday. “We’re well aware that there are pockets out there of people who have not felt” the recovery, “but broadly speaking, it’s a good economy.”
Powell’s simple speech is enabled by the economic backdrop. With unemployment low, inflation contained near the Fed’s 2 percent goal, and growth pumped up on fiscal stimulus, it’s safe to give the economy an A grade.
“It’s easy to have a pretty confident view, so I think the plain-spokenness probably works right now,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York. He noted that Powell is less clear about the longer-term outlook. “Is that because it’s the long run, or because making policy restrictive is uncomfortable territory for them? We’ll see.”
As rates move gradually toward a restrictive setting, Powell’s Fed is staring down an epic communication challenge: They’ll need to convince Americans and a president prone to public outbursts against enemies that hikes are intended to help the economy, possibly by restraining it.
Political Pressure
The Fed now expects to lift the fed funds rate above its long-run level in 2019, which means that they could begin actively curbing growth next year. That’s a tough policy to carry out: Officials expect to push the unemployment rate up by a full percentage point in the longer run, from 3.5 percent in 2019 to 4.5 percent.
To put that in perspective, 1.2 million people who have a job at today’s 3.8 percent unemployment rate would lack them if joblessness were at 4.5 percent, all other things being equal.
Painful rate hikes have historically spurred backlash, both from lawmakers and from the public. Chair William McChesney Martin was pressured by the White House over his monetary policy. When Paul Volcker lifted rates to tackle America’s high inflation in the 1980’s, carpenters mailed wood to the Fed chief -- saying it was no longer needed for building because no one was buying houses.
While the modern Fed is projecting a far milder overshoot on rates compared with the Volcker years, it could still draw unwanted attention. Dan DiMiccio, a Trump ally and former adviser, tweeted on Wednesday that the Fed’s rate hike and quicker projected hiking path was a “big mistake.”
Real Threat
Political threats to the U.S. central bank aren’t to be taken lightly. While the Fed is independent of the executive branch and lawmakers can’t intervene in monetary policy, they can legislate to change the Fed -- and there’s some appetite to do so, as regularly introduced “audit the Fed” bills attest.
Plain, optimistic communication could help the public to understand the Fed’s rationale, but it can only go so far.
“Plain-spoken or not, there’s going to be some flak when the Fed starts pressing on the brake pedal,” said Carl Riccadonna, chief U.S. economist at Bloomberg. “You start dumping cold water on the economic gains of tax reform? President Trump is not going to be a happy camper.”

654,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 04:17AM ET</span>",Zara looks to technology to keep up with faster fashion,"By Sonya Dowsett
MADRID (Reuters) - The pioneer of fast fashion isn't looking so fast anymore. 
 Inditex  (MC:ITX), the world's largest clothing retailer and owner of the Zara chain, faces growing competition from younger, online-only players like Boohoo.com and Missguided. Its rivals are churning out clothes at higher speeds - as little as one week from design to point of sale - refreshing their sites daily with hundreds of new items. 
In an attempt to keep its edge, the Spanish company is developing new technologies, hooking up with tech firms and hiring talent from start-ups.
The success or failure of such efforts could help determine whether Inditex can adapt to the changing landscape of apparel retail, where Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is set to overtake Macy's as the biggest seller of clothing to Americans. 
More broadly, it could point to whether the model of combining online sales with a large network of physical stores can ultimately prevail in mass-market fashion, where tailored trousers sell for under 30 euros ($35) and sequined dresses for under 50 euros. 
Inditex has an innovation unit, led by former telecoms engineer Alejandro Ferrer and startup founder David Alayon, but has previously revealed little about its work.
The unit is testing ways of improving stock handling. It has hooked up with California-based Fetch Robotics to test robots to work in stock inventory, the company told Reuters. It has also partnered with chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) on creating devices that can quickly gauge the volume of clothing in boxes. 
The unit tests technologies that make the most of an asset new rivals lack - physical stores. Inditex said it was focusing on areas like ""location intelligence"", ultrasound technology used to track footfall in stores, as well as virtual assistants to help customers. 
Location intelligence allows apps to switch to ""instore"" mode when a customer enters a store, so the customer can locate products and receive offers.
A source familiar with the matter said Inditex has also formed development partnerships with technology companies like Jetlore, which uses artificial intelligence to predict consumer behavior, and Spanish big data start-up El Arte de Medir.
Executives at Inditex, who are famously tight-lipped and rarely grant interviews, confirmed the tie-ups but said the projects were at the testing stage. The company would not give details, saying it was commercially sensitive information. 
'NO SECRET SAUCE'
Zara pioneered the fast-fashion concept in the 1980s. It was the first to develop a method of quickly reacting to changing trends, using agile supply chains based on sourcing production close to headquarters to speed its ""lead times"" - from the beginning of the design process to a product reaching stores - to about three weeks. 
But fast-growing new entrants to the market, unburdened by large store estates, are bringing production much closer to distribution and continuously refreshing merchandise.
Boohoo.com, founded in the British city of Manchester in 2006, operates on a ""test and repeat"" model whereby it produces small batches and scales up production on those that sell best. Over half of its products are made in Britain. 
The company, whose sales doubled last year, said it had lead times as short as two weeks. Missguided, which is also based in Manchester, has said its lead times can be as little as a week.
Inditex's model is based on sourcing production close to its headquarters in Galicia, northern Spain so orders can quickly be sent to its network of over 7,000 stores worldwide. Its suppliers are mostly in Spain, Portugal, Turkey and Morocco, rather than the traditional Asian manufacturing hubs. 
But some new online players are changing the game by bringing manufacturing even closer, with Boohoo.com sourcing over half its products from Britain.
ASOS (LON:ASOS), a British e-tailer which has many factories in continental Europe, is looking to increase production at home to improve lead times which stand at four to six weeks. 
""When it comes to apparel, there's no secret sauce,"" said Felipe Caro, a business professor at UCLA Anderson School of Management who wrote a case study on Zara. ""To shorten lead times, there's no other way than doing local production."" 
Inditex is seeking to integrate online sales with its bricks-and-mortar network by focusing on large, attractive stores where customers might try on items to buy later on computers or smartphones. 
In February, the firm hired Sergio Alvarez who co-founded CARTO, a start-up focusing on location intelligence, to work in its online business. 
Inditex has worked with its alarm provider, Tyco, to incorporate a tiny micro-chip into security tags carrying style and size information about the garment and allowing the company to locate its whereabouts at any point in the supply chain.
When the company released quarterly results this week, Inditex CEO Pablo Isla told analysts that tight control of stock through tagging means more clothing items can be sold at full price as items in stock at a store can be also offered online.
""This is full integration between store and online stock rooms,"" he said.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 03:44AM ET</span>","ZTE's shares slide on trade war jitters, lost 30 percent of market value this week","By Sijia Jiang and Anne Marie Roantree
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares of ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063) plummeted on Friday on renewed worries of a trade war and the Chinese telecommunications giant has now lost 30 percent of its market value since share trading resumed this week.
U.S. President Donald Trump is due to unveil revisions to his initial tariff list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods on Friday, reigniting concerns of a full-blown trade war. 
ZTE was crippled when the United States imposed a seven-year supplier ban on it in April after it broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea.
The stock slid as much as 10 percent in both Hong Kong and Shenzhen, bringing its total market value loss to $5.8 billion since trade resumed on Wednesday in the wake of a deal with Washington. 
ZTE late on Wednesday proposed a $10.7 billion financing plan and nominated eight board members as it seeks to rebuild its business, helping it briefly regain some ground.
""I think the market is concerned about a resumption of a U.S.-China trade war that could lead to this deal being off,"" Jefferies analyst Edison Lee said, adding, however, that he did not think that would be the case. 
If Washington adopts tariffs, Beijing is expected to hit back with its own duties on U.S. imports, including soybeans, cars, chemicals and planes, according to a list it released in early April.
The supplier ban, which has prevented ZTE from buying the U.S. components it relies on to make smartphones and other devices, will not be lifted until ZTE pays a fine and places $400 million more in an escrow account in a U.S.-approved bank. 
ZTE's Hong Kong-listed stock fell to as low as HK$13.38, while its Shenzhen shares fell by their daily limit of 10 percent to 22.82 yuan. Its current market value is around $13.5 billion. 
Hong Kong stock exchange data showed ZTE was the second-most traded stock in the Shenzhen-connect southbound trading on Thursday, with turnover of HK$240 million. It was the most traded stock in the southbound trading on Wednesday with a turnover of HK$1.45 billion. 
On Friday, Nomura cut ZTE's target price to HK$16 from HK$27, saying it expects it will take a long time for the company to recover, and that its consumer business in particular could see loss of market share to competitors. 
The case has become a focus of bargaining talks as Washington and Beijing look to avert a trade war.
U.S. lawmakers have attacked Washington's agreement with ZTE and plan legislation to roll it back, citing intelligence warnings that ZTE poses a national security threat.

657,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 03:23AM ET</span>",Volcker 'fix' may cause new headaches for Wall Street,"By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A proposal to simplify a rule banning banks from proprietary trading, rather than making life easier for Wall Street, could ensnare billions of dollars' worth of assets not currently caught by the regulation.
This little-noticed wrinkle, if it were to make it into the final rule, could prompt Wall Street firms to overhaul their treasury, trading and merchant banking operations and change their accounting practices, lawyers and executives told Reuters. 
On May 30, U.S. regulators unveiled a plan to modify the so-called Volcker Rule introduced following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, aiming to make compliance easier for many firms and relieving small banks altogether.
Wall Street has long complained about the complexity and subjectivity of the rule, which bans banks that accept U.S. taxpayer-insured deposits - such as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) - from engaging in short-term speculative trading.
Republicans, the business lobby and analysts initially welcomed the proposal as a long overdue move to streamline and clarify the rule, while consumer advocates and progressive Democrats criticized it as a risky Wall Street giveaway.
But after digesting the 494-page consultation, financial industry executives and lawyers said it could actually create new headaches for big banks by banning a swath of trades and long-term investments not currently covered by the rule.
""It's going to capture trades that wouldn't be captured by the current regulation and that's the bogeyman people would want to avoid in this proposal,"" said Jacques Schillaci, a banking lawyer at Linklaters LLP who has studied the proposal.
The draft is subject to a 60-day consultation period during which industry participants will lobby for changes, with a final version, which is likely to be substantially revised, expected around January.
One of the most-hated aspects of the Volcker Rule presumes purchases and sales of instruments within 60 days count as proprietary unless the bank can prove they qualify for an exemption, such as market making or hedging.
This part of the rule aims to identify short-term trades that are intended to be speculative in nature, but banks say it is too subjective because it would require second-guessing traders' intentions.
Regulators have proposed replacing it with a more objective test, based on the accounting treatment of the instruments traded.
Under the new test, trading activity by desks that daily book net realized or unrealized gains and losses exceeding $25 million is only allowed if the bank shows that trading qualifies for the rule's exemptions. 
Since the crisis, however, banks have applied this mark-to-market or ""fair value"" accounting treatment to a range of longer-term investments to better manage their risk.
As a result, the proposal would bring under the rule the vast majority of equity investments, derivatives and a range of fixed income securities that banks hold for many years but not to maturity. 
While some of these investments, such as U.S. treasuries, other government-related securities and some derivatives, would qualify for exemptions, many would end up being prohibited given the relatively low $25 million threshold, the industry experts said.
This could disrupt how bank groups structure their trading desks and manage their strategic investments and risk. The proposal may also prompt banks to elect not to mark-to-market some assets.
Spokespeople for the Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation declined to comment.
A spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said the agency looked forward to reviewing stakeholder comments. 
HIDDEN RISKS
The rewrite of the Volcker Rule comes amid a broader push by President Donald Trump-appointed regulators to boost bank lending and economic growth by relaxing regulations.
Brought into law by the 2010 Dodd Frank Act, the Volcker Rule is one of the most politically sensitive post-crisis rules and any changes will be closely-watched by Democratic critics, who warn tinkering with it could increase risks to the financial system. 
But the accounting snag also underscores the hidden risks of rewriting complex financial rules for the banking industry, which could confront a new set of problems - and costs - if the effort does not go as they had hoped.
""Tinkering with these rules, and regulatory change, imposes cost in and of itself,” said Cliff Stanford, a banking regulation lawyer at Alston & Bird.
Regulators have said they are very open to feedback on how to refine the draft and the banking industry will lobby aggressively on this particular issue, the executives and lawyers said. 
While the banks may push the regulators to narrow the scope of the new accounting test, expand the current exemptions, or raise the $25 million limit, scrapping the test altogether will be a tough sell.
Regulators see it as a failsafe that prevents firms evading the rule and believe focusing on the accounting treatment is clearer and more enforceable than the current 60-day intent test.

""There isn’t such a thing as a perfect fix for what they’re trying to do with this aspect of the rule,"" said Schillaci.

658,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 03:05AM ET</span>",Australian regulator sues Westpac for staffer's poor financial advice,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian regulator filed a lawsuit against No. 2 lender Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) over a financial planner it alleges gave poor advice for years, upping its scrutiny of a sector already under fire amid an embarrassing public inquiry.
Australia's A$5 billion ($3.7 billion) financial planning sector has provided some of the most damning evidence at an inquiry into finance sector misconduct, ordered by the government after a string of banking scandals including fraud.
Amid the backlash, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on Friday said it filed a Federal Court lawsuit alleging that Westpac was liable for a financial planner in its employment failing to act in the best interests of customers, as well as for the planner's inappropriate financial advice and failure to prioritize the client interests.
Court documents made public by ASIC showed the regulator was seeking fines plus declarations the bank failed to do everything necessary to provide financial services ""efficiently, honestly and fairly"".
ASIC said the country's Corporations Act came with a maximum penalty of A$1 million ($746,400) for each wrongdoing, without specifying how many instances of wrongdoing its lawsuit alleged.
Westpac said it was reviewing the case and would cooperate with the regulator to resolve proceedings as soon as possible.
It said it identified compliance concerns with, and fired, the planner in question in 2014, then ""proactively initiated remediation to identify and compensate affected customers"".
The year-long inquiry into the financial sector, called a Royal Commission, has heard evidence of fraud and allegations of board-level misconduct since it began in February, including misleading a regulator about allowing financial planners to charge for advice without giving it.
The chairman, chief executive and several directors of the country's biggest wealth manager, AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), have stood down over accusations of financial planner wrongdoing, while the country's third-largest lender, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ), has said it would stop paying planners bonuses for selling its products.
The former Westpac planner has not appeared at the Royal Commission. However, another parliamentary hearing in 2017 heard the planner charged 177 clients over six years without providing advice.
While the latest lawsuit stemmed from one former planner, the regulator said the bank breached part of the law ""which requires Westpac to do all things necessary to ensure that the financial services covered by its license are provided efficiently, honestly and fairly, and to comply with financial services laws"".
The lawsuit is the regulator's second against Westpac in a year. Last month, the bank was cleared by a court of allegations leveled by ASIC that it rigged a key rate to boost profit.
Australian bank shares have been hammered by the Royal Commission, losing more than A$50 billion in market value since hearings began.
On Friday, Westpac shares closed 2 percent higher along with the broader market (AXJO), but are still down 11 percent since the inquiry started.
The regulator said the matter would have its first court hearing on July 19.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Malaysia's Najib may face charges of money laundering, misappropriation of property - source","By Rozanna Latiff
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian authorities investigating scandal-hit state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) are considering charging former prime minister Najib Razak with money laundering and misappropriation of property, a source familiar with the matter said.
Najib, who founded 1MDB in 2009, is the subject of a money laundering and corruption probe, after reports that millions of dollars made their way into his personal bank accounts from the fund and its former subsidiary, SRC International. The former premier has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to 1MDB.
Najib, 64, suffered a shock loss in the May 9 general election, the first change of government since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957. Mahathir Mohamad, who was elected prime minister, has vowed to bring back funds allegedly siphoned from 1MDB and punish those responsible.
Malaysia's new Attorney General Tommy Thomas said on Tuesday his office was studying possible criminal and civil action, after receiving investigation papers on 1MDB from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC).
A source close to the investigations told Reuters Najib may be charged with dishonest misappropriation of property under the Malaysian Penal Code. The source declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak on the matter.
The offense carries a maximum jail sentence of five years, a fine and whipping. The law, however, forbids men over the age of 50 years from being whipped.
Any fine would be decided by the court depending on the offense and amount misappropriated. 
According to the source, Najib may also face money laundering charges, which would carry a maximum sentence of 15 years' jail and a fine of no less than five times the value of the laundered proceeds. 
It is now up to the attorney-general to decide whether or not to accept the recommendations, file different charges or call for further investigations. The previous attorney general cleared Najib of wrongdoing in relation to 1MDB.
MACC and the attorney-general's office did not respond to requests for comment.
Najib's spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Najib said this week that if he was charged on ""political grounds"" he was confident the courts would find him innocent.
1MDB is the subject of money-laundering probes globally, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.
The U.S. Department of Justice has alleged more than $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, about $700 million of which ended up in Najib's personal bank accounts.
Police on Monday raided another house linked to Najib in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, the latest premise to be searched in connection with their investigation into 1MDB.
Authorities seized hundreds of luxury handbags and dozens of other bags filled with jewelry and cash in earlier searches of premises linked to Najib. 

MACC this week called on four individuals to assist in its probe of 1MDB, including an aide to Jho Low - a central figure in the 1MDB scandal closely linked to Najib and his family.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>","Pipe dream? Chevron, Woodside vie to shape Australia's LNG sector","By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - After spending a decade and billions of dollars developing Australia's vast gas reserves, U.S. energy giant  Chevron  Corp and local firm Woodside Petroleum are at odds over the pace and timing of the next leg of expansion.
Shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have become one of Australia's biggest exports and a key source of revenue for many energy majors, so any hurdles in the sector's development could strike a substantial blow.
The issue comes down to how quickly to build a shared infrastructure system that would include a major trunk pipeline for transporting gas from mammoth new offshore fields owned by various companies in northwest Australia. 
Woodside (AX:WPL) wants to take the lead in such a project, pushing to build soon so it can go ahead with its $11 billion Scarborough development, the only new gas field in the region that is primed for a final investment decision by 2020.
But Chevron (N:CVX) would prefer to spend more time planning and building such a system, which it says could be led by it or other companies.
""I don't think there are any showstoppers in changing ... to a more shared infrastructure model,"" Chevron's Asia Pacific exploration and production president, Stephen Green, said in a group interview.
""It's just getting the alignment of all the different parties that want to participate in that value chain and coming up with the structure that satisfies each party's needs.""
Firms with stakes in the region's gas fields, including Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa),  BP  (L:BP) and BHP Billiton (AX:BHP) (L:BLT), will need to decide which option to pursue within the next 18 months to ensure untapped reserves are available ahead of a supply shortfall that some industry analysts see emerging from around 2022.
Putting pressure on his peers, Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said last month that any rival would need to negotiate with him by September to get their gas into an infrastructure system led by Woodside.
""They really need to get to us in the third quarter and be very serious about what they're doing, because that window will close,"" he said at an investor briefing. 
Chevron has not put a cost estimate on its infrastructure plan, saying it depends on how big any trunkline is and how many fields it connects to. Woodside has not given an exact estimate of costs for a shared project that it would lead.
""Talk of collaboration is good rhetoric, but there are an awful lot of moving parts,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Saul Kavonic.
BHP and BP declined to comment. Shell declined to comment except to reiterate that its Australian head, Zoe Yujnovich, has called for ""greater cooperation between ventures to reduce waste and duplication"".
Chevron and Woodside are key in Australia's LNG sector as they operate the four LNG plants in Western Australia, and between them have a total of more than 60 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of undeveloped gas resources in the region's offshore Carnarvon and Browse basins.

BURNT BY COSTS
Until now, all 10 of Australia's LNG developments have been built as megaprojects, with the owners constructing pipelines and LNG plants dedicated to their own fields. Critics say that has wasted huge amounts of money as infrastructure has been duplicated, helping push total development costs to an eye-watering $200 billion.
Burnt by a cost of $54 billion in developing its huge Gorgon project off Australia's northwest coast, Chevron wants to change strategy.
""It's our view that that's not the most cost efficient ... way to see resources developed across a large, prolific basin like the Carnarvon,"" said Chevron's Green.
Cost control is key in a competitive industry in which Australia and Qatar vie for position as the world's biggest producers and in which major new output is seen coming online in places such as the United States, Canada, East Africa and Southeast Asia.
After years of sky-high LNG prices prior to 2014, when Asian spot cargoes sold for $20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), prices are languishing at half of that.
And the fate of the biggest undeveloped gas resource off Western Australia, the Browse project, where Woodside is operator, will likely remain in limbo until a common infrastructure is built.
But both Coleman and Green expect each other's companies to come around eventually.
""I absolutely am confident we'll work things out,"" Green said, noting that Chevron and Woodside have long been partners in energy projects.
And the possibility of Chevron or Woodside buying out additional stakes in the region's gas fields and LNG projects could help align interests better to speed up a resolution. 
""M&A can play a key role in helping to create alignment across the joint ventures,"" said Wood Mackenzie's Kavonic.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average rose on Friday morning after the European Central Bank announced it would avoid raising rates until mid-2019, but chip-related stocks tumbled after a brokerage slashed the target price of Tokyo Electron.
The market was on mid-day break when the outcome of a Bank of Japan meeting was announced. As widely expected, the BOJ kept its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1 percent and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around zero percent.
The Nikkei (N225) gained 0.4 percent to 22,827.77 at the break.
The ECB announced it would end its bond-purchase program at year-end but signaled that any interest rate hike was still distant.
""Investors were relieved that there is no imminent tightening in Europe, the day after they were spooked by the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish stance,"" said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities.
For the week, the benchmark index has risen 0.6 percent so far.
Drugmakers were steady, with Astellas Pharma (T:4503) rising 1.3 percent and Eisai Co (T:4523) soaring 2.5 percent.
Mining stocks were also bought, with Inpex Corp (T:1605) gaining 0.9 percent and Japan Petroleum Exploration (T:1662) adding 1.4 percent.
Semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker Tokyo Electron Ltd (T:8035) stumbled as much as 5.1 percent to 19,025 yen, the lowest point in four months, after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) cut its target price to 17,600 yen from 19,700 yen.
The brokerage firm said it expects memory makers to scale back their capex plans, which will likely cause Tokyo Electron's operating profit to miss its guidance in the year ending March 2019.
The downgrade dented sentiment among other chip-related companies, with Advantest Corp (T:6857) shedding 3.6 percent and Shin-Etsu Chemical (T:4063) declining 2.4 percent.
Credit Suisse hiked the rating of Murata Manufacturing (T:6981) to 'outperform' from 'neutral', saying that major Japanese MLCC (Multilayer Ceramic Capacitor) makers are pushing for price increases across all products of 20–30 percent for all clients. Murata soared 6.2 percent.
Taiyo Yuden (T:6976) jumped 9.7 percent after the brokerage raised its target price to 4,000 yen from 2,130 yen, citing the same factor.

The broader Topix (TOPX) rose 0.3 percent to 1,788.49.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), the No. 2 wireless carrier, on Thursday closed its $85 billion deal to acquire media company  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX) after U.S. antitrust regulators indicated they would not seek a delay.
The deal, first announced in October 2016, was opposed by President Donald Trump. AT&T was sued by the Justice Department, but won approval from a judge to move forward with the deal on Tuesday following a six-week trial.
The Justice Department still has 60 days to appeal the decision by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, even though the deal has closed.
Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled on Tuesday that the deal to marry AT&T's wireless and satellite businesses with Time Warner's movies and television shows was legal under antitrust law. The Justice Department had argued the deal would harm consumers.
U.S. President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Time Warner's CNN coverage, denounced the deal when it was announced in October 2016.
In its lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal, filed in November 2017, the Justice Department said that AT&T's ownership of both DirecTV and Time Warner, especially its Turner subsidiary, would give AT&T unfair leverage against rival pay TV providers that relied on content like CNN and HBO's ""Game of Thrones.""
The AT&T ruling is expected to trigger a wave of mergers in the media sector, which has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
The first to come was Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's $65 billion bid on Wednesday for the entertainment assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.
AT&T had been worried about closing its deal ahead of a June 21 deadline if the government won a stay pending an appeal. Any stay could take the deal beyond a June 21 deadline for completing the merger, which could allow Time Warner to walk away or renegotiate the proposed transaction with AT&T.
The government may have a difficult time winning on appeal because of the way Judge Leon wrote his opinion, four antitrust experts said.
""I don't think this would be overturned. It is so rooted in the facts that I would be surprised if an appellate court overturned such a fact-laden opinion,"" said Michael Carrier, who teaches law at Rutgers.
In a scathing opinion https:// Leon found little to support the government's arguments that the deal would harm consumers, calling the evidence for one argument against the deal ""gossamer thin"" and another ""poppycock.""

The merger, including debt, would be the fourth largest deal ever attempted in the global telecom, media and entertainment space, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would also be the 12th largest deal in any sector, the data showed.
 
"
667,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>",How Reuters reported the AT&T-Time Warner ruling first,"(Reuters) - For U.S. media companies and investors, it was the ruling of the decade. 
A federal judge in Washington had sole power to decide whether telecoms company AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) could buy  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX), the parent of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros, for $85 billion and reshape the U.S. media landscape.
After a six-week long trial, Judge Richard Leon set a hearing date of June 12 at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT) to announce his ruling. People were so keen to get a seat in his courtroom that they took turns standing in line more than 24 hours ahead of the event. 
Reuters reporters Diane Bartz and David Shepardson stood in line from 7 a.m. that morning to secure two of the 27 seats reserved for reporters. Shepardson's seat was the more advantageous of the two, nearer the aisle.
Leon's rules were simple, but a nightmare for reporters working in a real-time, all-digital news environment.
First, everyone in his courtroom was barred from having active electronic devices with them, and court officials tested each as people entered the court.
Second, no one could leave until Leon had completed reading an abbreviated recap of his 172-page ruling and had left the courtroom himself. One of Leon's clerks said the only exception would be for people ""on a gurney.""
With those rules in mind, Reuters had another reporter, Ginger Gibson, outside the courtroom with a series of prepared alerts ready to transmit from her laptop covering a range of possible outcomes. Gibson was set up just outside the door where she could see a signal from Bartz or Shepardson telling her which alert to send.
Immediately after the courtroom doors closed, however, another court official forced everyone who did not go into the hearing to clear the hallway. The last-minute twist meant Gibson was not where her colleagues would expect her to be when they came running from the court.
Inside the courtroom, Leon delivered his ruling: AT&T could proceed with the Time Warner purchase with no restrictions, widely seen as a green light to further media-telecoms mergers worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
When Leon finished, Shepardson - a former high school hurdler - made a dash for the aisle and the door, vaulting briefcases and people. He burst through the crowd into the hallway looking for Gibson, who was no longer where he had left her.
But she had managed to stay in a position where she could see the door, and as it opened she ran forward with her open laptop, meeting Shepardson halfway down the hall. The ruling matched one of the prepared scenarios, and they sent the alert - 10 seconds ahead of the competition.
The market reacted immediately.

Within minutes, Time Warner shares were up more than 4 percent while those of AT&T tumbled 5.5 percent. Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox, seen as one of the key properties to be put into play by the ruling, shot up 6 percent in less than three minutes.

668,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 08:11PM ET</span>",A northern Chinese powerhouse grapples with a slowdown as credit curbs hit,"By Yawen Chen, Shu Zhang and Elias Glenn
TIANJIN, China (Reuters) - Cracks are appearing in the economy of the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin as the local government struggles with a crackdown on the credit-fueled investment that has transformed its skyline in recent years.
Some state firms are defaulting or scrambling for funds to meet obligations and some lenders are refusing to lend to Tianjin companies, according to creditors, government sources and documents viewed by Reuters. 
In the city's sprawling new business district - once billed as China's answer to Manhattan, now slightly more modestly as its Canary Wharf - many skyscrapers stand unfinished or empty.
With an economy the size of Vietnam's, Tianjin's troubles will be a high-profile test of President Xi Jinping's commitment to pivot China's economy away from a credit-fueled growth model. The city sits on the coast, on Beijing's doorstep, just a 30-minute high-speed train ride away.
Tianjin's problems also reflect growing strains on China's economy as curbs on pollution, local government debt and shadow financing hit home. On Thursday, China said investment growth in May grew at the slowest rate in more than 22 years.
Tianjin's state-owned firms have been particularly hard hit by Beijing's efforts to rein in risky lending and curb bad debts by closing off shadow financing channels such as trusts, among other measures.
Their plight is compounded by the deteriorating finances of the Tianjin government as property speculation curbs cool the city's real estate market, government sources said.
A major state bank recently prohibited its Tianjin branch from making new loans to the city, according to a source with direct knowledge. The source declined to name the bank due to the sensitivity of the matter.
A trust firm with outstanding loans to state companies in Tianjin has made a similar decision due to fears of rising default risks, according to a source at the company. 
""We are not making any new loans to Tianjin,"" the source said, adding that the trust firm believed some state companies had ""given up"" on timely repayment of debts.
Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist for China at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), said local governments like Tianjin had faced relentless pressure to tighten fiscal policies.
""It has been building up and we expected some events like this to happen this year,"" Zhang said. ""The pressure is on, the pressure is persistent."" 
In the past two months, CITIC Trust and Guotong Trust have issued warnings about the debt repayment abilities of Tianjin state conglomerates like Tianjin Municipal Development Co and Tianjin Real Estate.
Both companies invested in large debt-financed projects in Tianjin as part of the local government's drive to boost economic growth. 
In recent years, Tianjin has been reshaped with a spate of high-profile construction projects like the Binhai New Area, a vast development that includes finance and high-tech zones, a new futuristic library that went viral online when it opened last year, as well as some of the tallest skyscrapers in China. 
The city also hosts meetings of the World Economic Forum every two years in an enormous convention center on the outskirts of town.
Development in the city has also been driven by bodies like the China Development Bank as part of an effort by the Chinese government to integrate the economies of Tianjin, Beijing and Hebei province. The policy lender pledged 2.1 trillion yuan to the region between 2015 and 2017.
Those building efforts have cooled as Beijing reinforces a ban on local governments giving implicit guarantees to projects and amid a nation-wide campaign to reduce debt risks.
The Tianjin government did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
DIM PROSPECTS
The two companies that were said to be at risk of default appear to be making amends. Tianjin Real Estate repaid maturing loans in May and Tianjin Municipal Development said it would make payments in June, according to documents viewed by Reuters.
Neither company responded to faxed requests for comment.
But investors remain concerned about the city's growth prospects.
Tianjin reported 1.9 percent economic growth in the first quarter, the lowest among provincial-level regions, with fiscal revenues plummeting 17 percent. Fixed asset investment plunged 25.6 percent.
The city's difficulties were evident during a recent visit to Yujiapu, a financial district in Binhai, which sprawls across a bend in the Hai river to the south of city.
One proposed pillar of the zone, the Rose Rock International Finance Centre, has yet to be built even though ground was broken in 2011. The undeveloped site is now home to a rose garden.
In the high-tech zone, construction on Goldin Finance 117, supposed to be one of the country's tallest skyscrapers, has been halted for more than two years. The building remains uncompleted, with tall weeds sprouting from its foundations.
""Private investors are lured in by the government's new concepts and promises and then reality falls short,"" said a real estate source involved in Binhai's development, referring to the stalled projects. The source declined to be named.
The vacancy rate of Binhai's grade A offices stood at 67 percent at the end of the first quarter, according to JLL, a commercial property agency. 
(GRAPHIC: GDP and fixed asset investment in Tianjin and Beijing: https://reut.rs/2xTf3G1)
REVENUE SLUMP
Tianjin has long counted on the sale of land use rights to cover the bulk of its interest payments on the debt incurred during its construction boom, a government source said. 
The ratio of liabilities to government revenue for Tianjin's state-owned enterprises was the highest in China at more than 600 percent last year, according to Moody's Investors Service.
But since tightening measures were strengthened last year to cool property prices, the market has slumped. In the first quarter of 2018, a category of government revenue mainly comprised of land sales fell 10.8 percent from a year earlier. Deed transfer taxes and land value-added taxes dropped 31.5 percent.
Tianjin Municipal Construction Group - parent of Tianjin Municipal Development, and itself directly owned by the municipal government of Tianjin - had a loss of 26.6 million yuan last year after generating a profit in 2016, according to a financial report disclosed on May 2.
Tewoo Group Co, a state firm, started raising funds this year by issuing loans of 500 million yuan in its own name through Everbright Trust. 
Another government source with ties to local government funding vehicles in Tianjin said Tewoo used to raise funds only through subsidiaries.
""This highlights how bad the situation is and how hard it is to raise funds for all these local government financing vehicles in Tianjin,"" the source said.
TEMPTATIONS
A Chinese policy think tank source who visited Binhai last month and met with local officials said that they saw sales from an abundant land bank as the key to recovery.
""Binhai's debt problem is severe, but they say 40 percent of their debt could be 'resolved' by beefing up land sales,"" the source said.
However, Tianjin has already been criticized by state media for undermining property curbs with a campaign to attract talent to the city by relaxing some purchase restrictions targeting outside speculators.
Investors, meanwhile, have been frustrated by the local government's tendency to block defaults and bankruptcies.

""Investors are showing huge concerns about Tianjin's commercial and legal environment,"" said a senior manager at National Trust, which is chasing nearly 700 million yuan in overdue fees from two subsidiaries of a state-owned group.

670,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Ackman's hedge funds gain after years of losses, Chipotle helps","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - William Ackman's private hedge fund has gained more than 9 percent this year while his publicly traded fund is up double digits, marking a dramatic reversal for the billionaire investor after three years of losses.
Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) International climbed 9.3 percent from January through June 12, an investor in the fund said on Thursday. According to data from HSBC, the firm now ranks as one of the top 20 performing hedge funds for 2018.
Pershing Square Holdings, the largest fund managed by Ackman's New York-based Pershing Square Capital Management, has climbed 11.4 percent since January, Pershing Square told clients late on Wednesday.
Last month Ackman told clients that performance was improving as all of his portfolios were finally in the black for the year. 
Those gains have now grown and could signal a comeback for 52-year old manager after three years of back-to-back losses that helped shrink Pershing Square's assets to roughly $8 billion, about half of what Ackman managed at the firm's peak in 2015.
Despite years of poor performance, Ackman remains one of the industry's most closely watched managers at a time active management has come under fire for high costs, and as other prominent fund managers post sluggish returns.
Ackman, who made three new investments this year, is now beating the average hedge fund's roughly flat return for the year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.
Returns have been fueled by gains at Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and Automatic Data Processing. 
Burrito chain Chipotle, in which Pershing Square is the biggest investor with a 10 percent stake, saw its share price tumble to $251 after a string of food safety lapses.
Ackman bought the stake in 2016 for an average cost of $405 and joked last year that his investment team would be eating Chipotle until the stock price recovered. Earlier this year he helped install Brian Niccol as chief executive and Chipotle closed at $460.44 on Thursday, gaining 58 percent since January.
Automatic Data Processing, where Ackman lost a bitter proxy contest in late 2017, has climbed 19.75 percent since January to close trading on Thursday at $139.82, far above Ackman's average cost of $105 a share.
The human resources software company held an investor day earlier this week and said its chief financial officer, Jan Siegmund, will be leaving.
Ackman, who told investors earlier this year that he would be lowering his profile as he seeks to turn around the firm's performance, declined to comment.

Last year Ackman had said he was ready for a comeback. ""I'm incredibly focused. I've got something to prove,"" he said.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 06:19PM ET</span>",Adobe tops estimates on digital media business momentum,"(Reuters) - Adobe Systems Inc (O:ADBE) topped analysts' profit and revenue estimates for the eighth straight quarter driven by strength in its digital media business, which houses its flagship product Creative Cloud.
Adobe's shares, which have gained over 47 percent so far this year, fell 3.5 percent at $249 in extended trading after the company forecast third-quarter revenue nearly in line with estimates.
The maker of image-editing software Photoshop said it expects third-quarter revenue of $2.24 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.68 per share. This compares with analysts' estimate of a revenue of $2.22 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.61 per share.
""The third-quarter guidance looks to be an in-line guide, which we would expect them to beat given how strong the business is. But, it is nothing we are worried about,"" said Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at private investment firm J Stern, which holds a position in Adobe.
Last month, in a move to bolster its Experience Cloud business, Adobe agreed to buy e-commerce services provider Magento Commerce from private equity firm Permira for $1.68 billion.
""We expect the closing of Magento to be slightly dilutive to our Q3 GAAP earnings per share target"", Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said on a conference call with analysts.
Adobe's second-quarter net income rose to $663.2 million, or $1.33 per share, from $374.4 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier.
The company's digital media business, that includes Creative Cloud, posted revenue of $1.55 billion, compared with $1.21 billion, a year earlier.
Revenue in Adobe's Experience Cloud business, which provides services including analytics, advertising and marketing, rose to $586 million, above estimates of $570.4 million. 
Adobe's quarterly revenue rose to $2.20 billion from $1.77 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $2.16 billion. 

Excluding certain items, Adobe earned $1.66 per share, beating analysts' estimate of $1.54 per share.

672,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 05:58PM ET</span>",World's rich grow richer as bull markets roar on: study,"ZURICH (Reuters) - The pool of money held by the world's wealthiest people grew by 12 percent last year to nearly $202 trillion as bull markets and the dollar's weakening against most major currencies boosted global fortunes, an international advisory firm's study released on Thursday said.
Adjusted for exchange rate swings, wealth rose 7 percent, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) survey found. 
While residents of North America held the greatest share of personal wealth at almost 43 percent, the fastest growth came in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Most super-rich individuals lived in the United States, China and Japan.
The business of providing advice to those super-rich is still strong in North America. 
However, legacy retail brokerages such as  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Bank of America Merrill Lynch Wealth Management (N:BAC), UBS AG Group's Wealth Management in the Americas (S:UBSG) and  Wells Fargo  Advisors (N:WFC) lost market share as less wealthy clients went elsewhere.
Legacy brokerages' market share fell to 37 percent in 2016 from 41 percent in 2012, while the portion held by direct channel firms such as  Charles Schwab  (K:SCHW) and Fidelity grew modestly to 21 percent from 20 percent.
More than 35 million Americans now have between $250,000 and $1 million, a wealth bracket the industry calls mass affluent. BCG senior partner Brent Beardsley said that many mass affluent savers hold a lot of their money in a retirement account, like a 401(k), which oftentimes are managed by a company like Schwab or Fidelity.
""(They have) a natural structural advantage"" over legacy brokerages, Beardsley said. 
BCG's annual study also showed Switzerland remained the world's biggest center for managing offshore wealth with $2.3 trillion, followed by Hong Kong with $1.1 trillion and Singapore with $0.9 trillion.
The two Asian centers have grown at yearly rates of 11 and 10 percent respectively over the past five years, more than three times the 3 percent rate Switzerland has posted.
It is in the fast-growing markets that large wealth managers including Swiss banks UBS and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) are casting wider nets. 
The Swiss banking secrecy from which they long profited has been weakened, meaning rich people from around the world can no longer easily use the Alpine Republic to stash wealth away from tax authorities at home. 

The changes have put Switzerland in fierce competition with faster-growing centers like Hong Kong and Singapore.

695,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 04:06PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Tariff Tensions in Focus 
U.S. President Donald Trump will decide later Thursday whether to move ahead with tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports on Friday.
If the U.S. does move ahead with the tariffs it raises the risk of retaliation from the Beijing, sparking fears of a tit-for-tat trade war between the world's largest two economies.
But the list of imported goods – subject to a levy – was revised lower from the original list in April, according to media reports.
The list is expected to include between 800 and 900 products, well below the original list of about 1,300 products published by the U.S. Trade Representative in April, CNBC reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter.
The tariffs would raise the prospect of a global trade war as the United States' other trading partners such as the EU and Canada have recently vowed to retaliate with countermeasures to the U.S.'s tariffs on imported steel and aluminium.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed modestly lower at 25,175.31
2. Consumer Sentiment, New York Manufacturing Data Eyed
A regional U.S. manufacturing report and consumer sentiment data will round off this week's release of top-tier economic data.
Michigan’s consumer expectations Index due 10:00 am ET, is expected to show a preliminary reading of 89.7 for June, while consumer sentiment is forecast to show a preliminary reading of 98.5 for June, up from a reading of 98 last month.
The New York Fed’s Empire State manufacturing index at 08:30am ET – a gauge of New York-area manufacturing – is expected to show a drop in June compared to the previous month.
The duo of reports could further strengthen the narrative of a strong U.S. economy, which Fed chair Powell said was in ""great shape"" during a press conference earlier this week.
The dollar rose to two-week highs Thursday as EUR/USD tumbled following the European Central Bank's announcement that it would leave interest rates unchanged until at least the summer of 2019.
 3. US Rig Count on Tap 
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production, which rose to a record high.
Data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs continued their climb, raising the prospect of a continued expansion in U.S. output.
U.S. oil output jumped to a record 10.9 million bpd, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.
Crude prices rose on Thursday on comments from Saudi's oil chief, insisting that the inevitable increase in production would be reasonable.
Crude futures settled 25 cents higher at $66.89 a barrel on Thursday."

The list is expected to include between 800 and 900 products, well below the original list of about 1,300 products published by the U.S. Trade Representative in April, CNBC reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter.
The tariffs would raise the prospect of a global trade war as the United States' other trading partners such as the EU and Canada have recently vowed to retaliate with countermeasures to the U.S.'s tariffs on imported steel and aluminium.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed modestly lower at 25,175.31
2. Consumer Sentiment, New York Manufacturing Data Eyed
A regional U.S. manufacturing report and consumer sentiment data will round off this week's release of top-tier economic data.
Michigan’s consumer expectations Index due 10:00 am ET, is expected to show a preliminary reading of 89.7 for June, while consumer sentiment is forecast to show a preliminary reading of 98.5 for June, up from a reading of 98 last month.
The New York Fed’s Empire State manufacturing index at 08:30am ET – a gauge of New York-area manufacturing – is expected to show a drop in June compared to the previous month.
The duo of reports could further strengthen the narrative of a strong U.S. economy, which Fed chair Powell said was in ""great shape"" during a press conference earlier this week.
The dollar rose to two-week highs Thursday as EUR/USD tumbled following the European Central Bank's announcement that it would leave interest rates unchanged until at least the summer of 2019.
 3. US Rig Count on Tap 
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production, which rose to a record high.
Data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs continued their climb, raising the prospect of a continued expansion in U.S. output.
U.S. oil output jumped to a record 10.9 million bpd, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.
Crude prices rose on Thursday on comments from Saudi's oil chief, insisting that the inevitable increase in production would be reasonable.
Crude futures settled 25 cents higher at $66.89 a barrel on Thursday."

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ticked higher on Thursday, after the European Central Bank signaled that any interest rate hike was still far away, even as it moved to end its 2.55 trillion euro stimulus program by the end of the year.
The ECB's statement came as a relief, especially after the Federal Reserve raised rates for the second time this year on Wednesday and hinted at two more hikes by the end of 2018.
Technology stocks were the biggest gainers, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) leading the pack, while bank shares took a hit and weighed on the benchmark S&P 500.
""The Fed rate increases, the ECB's decision to end its bond buying program, it suggests higher rates down the road,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. 
""For the most part it's a positive because they feel the economy is strong enough to handle that."" 
U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in May to post its biggest advance since November 2017, while another report showed number of Americans on jobless rolls fell to a near 44-1/2-year low.
Meckler said reaction was mixed to the policy announcements, as markets were split between ""those that think the economy is very strong and those who are concerned about inflation.""
At 12:55 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 26.64 points, or 0.11 percent, at 25,174.56, the S&P 500 was up 5.66 points, or 0.20 percent, at 2,781.29 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 56.87 points, or 0.74 percent, at 7,752.57.
J.P Morgan Chase's 1.9 percent fall was the biggest drag on the S&P 500. The financial index was down 0.96 percent, the biggest loser among the major S&P sectors.
""You have the yield curve continuing to flatten, which is not great for financial stocks,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
The yield spread between U.S. 30-year bonds and U.S. 5-year notes narrowed to the flattest level since January 2012 after the Fed decision on Wednesday.
Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) jumped 3.9 percent after the company offered Twenty-First Century Fox $65 billion to lure it away from a merger with Walt Disney. 
Disney also rose 1.9 percent and Fox was up 1.9 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.32-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.14-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 30 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 133 new highs and 20 new lows.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Polish shopping center operator EPP looks to small cities to drive growth,"By Alan Charlish
(Reuters) - EPP (J:EPPJ) is looking to expand in smaller Polish cities, as rising wages and a state child benefit program drive consumer spending in less affluent provincial areas, the shopping center operator's chief executive said on Thursday.
Polish consumers are spending more as a tightening labor market has pushed up wages, while the conservative government's 500+ child benefit program has added to the spending power of families with two or more children.
""The biggest increase in disposable income in Poland is not in the big cities, it's in the smaller cities,"" Hadley Dean told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""That is a combination of the middle class spreading across Poland... but also 500+ and the increase in the minimum wage has had a huge impact in these cities."" 
Poland's conservative government introduced the 500+ child benefit program in 2016, giving families 500 zlotys ($136.15)a month for their second and each subsequent child. It also raised the country's minimum wage to 2,100 zlotys gross monthly in 2018 from 2,000 zlotys in 2017.
Saying that the impact on spending power is more noticeable for lower-paid families in small provincial cities, Dean took the central city of Kalisz as an example.
""We're seeing an increase in sales in Wroclaw of let's say 2 percent and we're seeing an increase in sales of 12.5 percent in Kalisz,"" he said.
In 2017 Kalisz had a population of just over 100,000, making it more than six times smaller than Wroclaw, according to data from Poland's Central Statistical Office.
ONLINE IMPACT
While shopping centers around the world have been grappling with competition from online retailers, Dean is confident about the sector's future in Poland.
""In Poland 50 percent of online sales are click and collect, so actually online sales are amplifying in-store sales in Poland,"" he said.
EPP is also looking to boost sales in its food halls by providing delivery services in partnership with restaurant operator AmRest Holding (WA:EATP).
The offer, which uses AmRest Holding's PizzaPortal online platform for orders, is being trialed in Wroclaw and the company aims to roll it out to other shopping centers, Dean said.
""What we're doing is helping the food operators in our shopping center make more money, but of course we make more money too,"" Dean said, adding that EPP thinks the offer could increase food court sales by 15 percent. 
Shares in the company, which is incorporated in the Netherlands and listed in Johannesburg, have risen 5.8 percent year to date, which compares with a 9.1 percent fall in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Mid Cap Index <.JMIDC>.

BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - In a year when many major galleries made record sales, conversations at the world's biggest art fair this week were not just about the eye-watering sums paid for top works, but also about how to ensure the viability of the market's lower end.
There was no shortage of top-ticket works on sale at Art Basel, which opened to the public in the Swiss city on Thursday: a pair of paintings by 20th-century American abstract expressionist Joan Mitchell sold for $14 million apiece during the fair's opening days, reserved for VIPs.
""It's like that magnificent moment,"" said Dominique Levy of Gorvy Levy which sold Mitchell's untitled 1959 work.
Marc Glimcher, who heads one of the world's biggest gallery enterprises, Pace, said: ""Art Basel is always good, but it isn't always this-year good. I think many people had the best first day of Art Basel they've ever had.""
But with galleries feeling the pressure from lighter foot traffic and the high cost of fairs where much of today's primary buying happens, the art world is considering how to support the market's ""squeezed middle"".
""It's always been the case that the top end of the market does a little bit better, but the margin between how it's performing and everybody else is performing has become wider, and that's obviously a concern,"" said Clare McAndrew, author of the Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report.
Over the last 10 years, works under $1 million have fallen in value, whereas works selling for over $10 million have increased nearly 150 percent, the report found.
""It's paralleling what's happening in the world,"" McAndrew said. ""The gap between the ultra-rich and everybody else has never been wider.""
Facing a top-end boom that is pricing out museums and avid collectors, the art world must ensure the survival of small galleries that might be supporting the next Vincent Van Gogh, said New York gallery owner Sean Kelly.
""It's the smaller galleries that feed the mid-tier galleries that feed the larger galleries, and we all have to be respectful of that process because otherwise it's like watching the Great Barrier Reef die,"" he said.
""We're all part of a much larger ecosystem.""
With most wealthy U.S. collectors buying works priced under $5,000, according to a survey by UBS, art vendors should look to new audiences, particularly in emerging markets, said Patricia Amberg who runs UBS's Art Competence Centre, which advises clients with more than $50 million with the bank on collecting.
Online sales, which have grown 72 percent over the last five years, present a particular opportunity for the lower end of the market, she added.

Art Basel runs until Sunday.

(Reuters) - Kentucky's attorney general on Thursday sued Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA), accusing the company of playing a dual role in propagating an opioid epidemic in the state as both a pharmacy chain and wholesale drug distributor.
The lawsuit by Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear was his sixth to date seeking to hold corporations like drug manufacturers and distributors responsible for their roles in the drug abuse crisis.
The lawsuit, filed in state circuit court in Boone County, said Walgreens filled massive opioid orders in both unusually large sizes and great frequencies. In its role as a distributor that shipped drugs, the company failed to report suspicious orders to authorities.
At the store level, Walgreens dispensed opioids at ""such an alarming rate and volume that there could be no legitimate medical purpose associated to their use,"" according to the complaint.
The only possible explanation for the large quantities of opioids dispensed from its Kentucky stores was that some of the drugs were distributed to addicts and abused or diverted for illegal uses, the complaint said.
""While Walgreens' slogan was 'at the corner of happy and healthy,' they have significantly harmed the health of our families in fueling the opioid epidemic,"" Beshear said in a statement.
The lawsuit alleged that because Walgreens allowed for the proliferation of dangerous opioids into Kentucky, the state's citizens suffered from drug addiction, overdoses and death.
The lawsuit seeks damages and penalties as well as an injunction.
Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens declined to comment.
Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Kentucky had 1,404 overdose deaths in 2016, the lawsuit said. The state had the third highest drug overdose rate in 2015 behind West Virginia and New Hampshire, according to Beshear's complaint.
States, counties and cities have filed hundreds of lawsuits, accusing drugmakers of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing, and accused wholesale distributors of failing to report suspicious drug orders.

Beshear is pursuing similar cases against drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK) as well as drugmakers Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and Endo International Plc (O:ENDP).

723,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 12:18PM ET</span>",European shares rally after ECB pushes back rate hike bets,"By Danilo Masoni and Helen Reid
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares jumped on Thursday after the European Central Bank said interest rates would stay at record lows at least through the summer of 2019 as it announced an end to its massive stimulus plan.
Stock benchmarks across Europe enjoyed their best day in 2-1/2 months as they benefited both from a weaker euro and the surprise extension of lower interest rates. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) and the euro zone STOXX (STOXXE) jumped 1.4 and 1.3 percent, while the exporter-heavy German index (GDAXI) gained 1.7 percent as the euro fell to a session low following the ECB's statement.
Along with France's CAC 40, they had their strongest gains since April 5. 
Edmund Shing, head of equity derivatives at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), said low rates for longer was a boon for equities as it ensured liquidity remained strong. 
""One of the key drivers for risk assets has been and continues to be liquidity, beyond all other things. The longer they delay rate hikes the longer liquidity stays decent,"" he said.
""The hawks had been guiding for a June hike before the meeting and given the clear guidance the ECB gave today on interest rates, it had to be priced out,"" said AFS Group analyst Arne Petimezas. 
""It doesn't seem like we're at the stage where the hawks are on top of things,"" he added. 
Interest-rate sensitive sectors such as autos and utilities surged, while the euro zone's banking stocks (SX7E), which suffer from low interest rates, fell 0.2 percent, among the only stocks in negative territory. 
Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), Spain's  Bankia  (MC:BKIA), and Italy's Unicredit (MI:CRDI) were the biggest fallers, down 1.2 to 2 percent. 
""It's a disappointment"" for banks, said BNP Paribas' Shing, adding that the ECB's negative deposit rate costs banks money. 
""The faster the deposit rate gets back to 0, the better for banks' profitability.""
AUTOS SECTOR 
If the ECB succeeds in supporting the economy and productivity, however, this could have positive knock-on effects for banks through boosting demand for financing and alleviating the burden of non-performing loans, he added.
The autos sector (SXAP) rose 1.8 percent, its strongest gains in 2 1/2 months, also boosted by a weak euro. 
Rolls-Royce (L:RR) gained 6.5 percent after saying it would save 400 million pounds ($535 million) a year by cutting 4,600 jobs in its latest attempt to simplify the business and generate more cash.
""After spending around four and half years in purdah, an incremental 400 million pounds of FCF (free cash flow) would allow Rolls-Royce to take a significant step toward meeting its financial targets,"" Jefferies analysts said.
""That should then mean Rolls-Royce can make an adequate annual return to shareholders through the dividend.""
Danish hearing equipment maker GN Store Nord (CO:GN) was the top gainer on the STOXX, up 12.2 percent after it upped its 2018 sales and profit forecasts for its headset business.
Shares in heavyweight drugmaker GSK (L:GSK) rose 2.3 percent. Investors welcomed news its two-drug treatment for HIV met its main goal in late stage studies - a boost after regulators warned of possible birth defects from one of the two drugs.
On the DAX, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) rose 2.2 percent. It fell in early trading after the carmaker was fined one billion euros over diesel emissions cheating.

730,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 12:04PM ET</span>","In Natus proxy fight, Glass Lewis supports Voce nominees","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Influential proxy-advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co recommended that Natus Medical Incorporated shareholders remove two company nominated directors and replace them with hedge fund Voce Capital Management's nominees.
Glass Lewis' recommendation, released to clients late on Tuesday and seen by Reuters on Wednesday, echoes last week's report from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which also suggests that shareholders oust the medical equipment and supplies company's two directors who are up for election this year.
Both Glass Lewis and ISS wrote that the company's financial performance has been weak and lagged its peers, making it appropriate to elect dissident directors Lisa Wipperman Heine and Joshua Levine. Natus' annual meeting is scheduled for June 22.
The company said in a statement that it believes Glass Lewis should have backed its directors, Doris Engibous and Robert Weiss. In a letter to shareholders, the company wrote ""Voce's nominees are not qualified to serve on your Board."" 
Voce, run by Daniel Plants, owns 2.2 percent of Natus and tensions have been rising ever since Plants in March asked for a meeting with the company's board chairman and independent directors.
The company's chief executive officer, James Hawkins, met with a Voce employee at an industry conference but neither Plants nor board Chairman Robert Gunst attended that meeting.
Voce also asked for shareholders to vote out Gunst and appoint a third nominee, Mark Gilreath, to the company's six-member board. Both Glass Lewis and ISS stopped short of recommending for Gunst to be removed.
""We believe electing two dissident nominees to the six-member board would provide an appropriate level of new perspective and oversight on the board without being overly disruptive to the company,"" the Glass Lewis report said.
Glass Lewis also wrote that it was especially concerned that the current board had not looked into a lawsuit filed in federal court in Oakland, California alleging that CEO Hawkins made ""false and misleading statements to shareholders about the company's business in Venezuela."" 
Voce last year returned 19 percent and gained 10.36 percent in the first five months of 2018, making it one of the hedge fund industry's best performers. The average activist hedge fund, which pushes for management change, has gained roughly half a percent in 2018 after gaining 5.45 percent in 2017.

731,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>","Much like Italian rout, markets may not price Brexit risks until they hit","By Tommy Wilkes and Tom Finn
LONDON (Reuters) - A catastrophic, messy Brexit might be looming for Britain next year but judging by how the pound is trading, one would hardly know it. Increasingly, it seems a risk is not a risk for financial markets until it actually hits.
The calm in sterling at such a juncture is leading some to draw parallels with Italy's mini-crisis where 2-1/2 months of relative calm following March 4 elections exploded onto markets at the end of May, prompting panicky last-minute selling.
The pound, which crashed to 31-year lows against the dollar immediately after Britain's June 2016 vote to leave the European Union, has since recovered about half of those losses. In recent weeks it has traded within tight ranges even as debates on how to exit -- within London's political establishment and with Brussels -- grow more heated.
That's despite the possibility, albeit slim, of a ""no-deal Brexit"" -- exiting the EU without a trade agreement in place.
The reason might be that current exchange rates -- 11 percent below pre-referendum levels -- adequately price that worst-case scenario. Or that markets are confident the worst will be averted.
But the calm may also reflect a broader shift in market psychology, increasingly evident in recent years, whereby risk is ignored until it hits traders squarely between the eyes -- the most recent example being Italy.
""No one seems to have a clue what's going to happen or even what the worst case scenario will be. In light of that the prevailing attitude is 'let's just ignore Brexit for now and focus on the Bank of England's rate hikes,'"" said Markus Schomer, chief economist at PineBridge Investments. 
It was expectations of BoE rate hikes that drove speculators' bullish sterling positions to three-year highs in February, but as policy tightening bets ebbed, positioning has returned to neutral, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows. 
Prime Minister Theresa May's victory on Tuesday in defusing a parliamentary rebellion over the government's EU withdrawal bill did fuel a small sterling bounce. But that has already fizzled. 
May's win makes a ""no deal"" scenario, the one most feared by markets, less likely. But it does not overcome other hurdles: agreeing what sort of Brexit deal her party wants, and then getting the nod from the EU. 
Last year, the pound swung on almost every Brexit headline, but a March agreement on a 21-month post-Brexit transition may have soothed nerves.
Investors reckon markets have stopped second-guessing Brexit talks, preferring to sit on the sidelines until the crunch point for avoiding a ""hard"" or disorderly Brexit hits home. As a result, levels of volatility in the pound against the dollar  have almost halved since January. Against the euro (EURGBP=D3) volatility is well below the 2017 average.
""Markets retain a sense of ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,"" said Mike Amey, head of sterling portfolios at Pimco.
The signs are that investors are not preparing for big moves. Implied volatility  - a measure of expected price swings - is two-thirds of its 2018 high and is below year-ago levels.
Another derivative market positioning gauge, risk reversals, shows that demand for ""call"" options on the pound -- essentially a view an asset will climb in value -- has risen in recent months, compared with demand for ""puts"", options used to hedge against price declines.
The overall gauge has turned less negative, suggesting markets have become less concerned about a no-deal. 
DOING NOTHING
Market reluctance to price Brexit scenarios in advance has echoes of other big binary events, including the Brexit referendum itself, the U.S. election outcome and the 2014 Scottish independence vote.
In all these cases, traders preferred to trade on near-term news, ignoring other possibilities until they become reality.
UK stocks too mirror the fall in Brexit sensitivity. UK stocks have bounced back (FTSE) (FTMC) and high street betting interest has dwindled -- amounts wagered in May were less than a third of January, Betfair said.
""I don't want to say markets are not rational but it feels like that's the way rational market actors are dealing with risks that they are unable to price - just assume the worst case or say let's do nothing and focus on something else,"" PineBridge's Schomer said. 
But markets are hardly pricing the worst no-deal scenario.
Sterling has recovered half its post-referendum plunge from $1.50 to below $1.20. The rally to above $1.43 this year and the subsequent fall were driven central bank policy forecasts rather than the fortunes of Brexit talks. 
Against the euro, the pound has remained range-bound between 86 pence and 89.3 pence this year.
Analysts say sterling could slide to below $1.27 and possibly through post-referendum lows of sub-$1.20 if a deal is not agreed before April 2019.
""The number of scenarios for Brexit is baffling, so many won't play the speculative trade,"" said ING Bank strategist Viraj Patel, noting it was hard to position for an event that's nine months away.
Jonathan Davies, head of currency strategy at UBS Asset Management, said sterling doesn't look that cheap. He estimates its pre-Brexit fair value at about $1.55 and 83 pence per euro.
""The discount that sterling is trading at relative to its ""no Brexit"" scenario is not that large,"" Davies said. 
""You can't rule out the risk of something going badly wrong in the negotiations.""

736,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 10:49AM ET</span>","Malaysia to seek return of 1MDB money from banks, political parties","By Joseph Sipalan and A. Ananthalakshmi
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia intends to recover all funds illicitly taken from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), and determine whether there are grounds for claims against companies, including Goldman Sachs (N:GS), that profited from dealing with the beleaguered state fund.
Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that a plan was ""on the table"" to ask all individuals and political parties to return money that came from 1MDB, which was allegedly used as a slush fund by former prime minister Najib Razak.
Having defeated his former protege in an election last month, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's administration has launched an investigation into how the fund founded by Najib lost billions of dollars.
Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and repeated earlier this week that he did not benefit or steal money from 1MDB.
Lim said the government would also scrutinize the $600 million paid in fees to Goldman Sachs for raising nearly $6.5 billion in three bond sales between 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB. Critics said the fees earned from those bond issues were far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent fees a bank could expect.
""We will be looking at the possibility of seeking claims from Goldman Sachs, where there are grounds to do so... definitely,"" Lim told Reuters in an interview.
Reuters had reported last week that according to sources familiar with the issue Malaysia is considering asking the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) to get Goldman Sachs to return fees earned from the bond issues.
Civil lawsuits filed in 2016 by the DOJ alleged that over $2.5 billion raised from those bonds were misappropriated by high-level 1MDB officials, their relatives and associates.
He also said Malaysia will look at the conduct of other banks involved in 1MDB transactions.
""We've got to see the nexus, whether they were at fault."" 
Lim said the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO), the party Najib had led until his election defeat, and from which Mahathir resigned in order to join the opposition, was not the only party to have received 1MDB money.
""To be fair, UMNO is not the only political party that received money,"" Lim said. ""Those who have taken money from 1MDB, should return it to the country."" 
INTERNATIONAL EFFORT
Lim said the DOJ and enforcement agencies in several other countries were giving strong cooperation to Malaysia's efforts to recoup 1MDB funds, and bring prosecutions.
A proposal to monetize assets acquired using 1MDB funds that U.S. authorities are looking to seize under its anti-kleptocracy program was an option under consideration, Lim said.
The DOJ is seeking to seize $1.7 billion in assets allegedly bought with funds stolen from 1MDB, including a Picasso painting, shares in a Hollywood production company, a yacht and nearly $200 million in jeweler.
Last month, Malaysian police said that cash worth 114 million ringgit ($28.6 million), jewelry and over 400 luxury handbags were seized from several apartments linked to Najib, as part of their probe into 1MDB.
Lim said his ministry is also investigating several ""highly suspicious"" deals made by Najib's administration to determine if they were carried out to help pay for 1MDB dues.
He declined to identify the deals, but said Malaysia was investigating state-run palm oil agency Felda's $500 million acquisition of a non-controlling stake in Indonesia's PT Eagle High Plantations Tbh (JK:BWPT). 
He did not say if the Felda deal, which was criticized for being expensive, was linked to 1MDB.
Last month, the finance ministry said about $500 million raised from a land sale by the government to the central bank, along with funds from sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional, were used to pay 1MDB's liabilities in 2017.
Lim said the government will have to pay an estimated 50 billion ringgit in debts and interest accumulated by 1MDB.
""We are forced to pay that much against our will,"" Lim said, adding that the government has sufficient funds, but may consider restructuring debt to clear 1MDB's dues if it can secure better yields.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Hong Kong market could open cash flood gates for U.S. biotechs,"By Tamara Mathias
(Reuters) - When U.S. biotech startup Sorrento Therapeutics named ex-Lehman Brothers executive Jiong Shao as its new finance chief about two months ago, it was widely seen as a move driven by his background in raising capital for  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent.
Sorrento Therapeutics Inc is among a few early-stage U.S. biotechs wary of being overlooked in a crowded New York stock market and looking at listing itself in Hong Kong as Asia's financial center rolls out the red carpet with a drastic overhaul of listing rules.
Striving to catch up with New York and Shanghai as an IPO hotspot, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange announced new policies late last year that actively court biotech companies, including those that do not have a drug on the market.
The new rules particularly target early-stage biotech companies with a minimum market value of about $200 million, including those that do not yet earn revenue. 
Sorrento, which is developing CAR-T cancer drugs and medicines to treat pain, is among a group of companies that believe they will get a more enthusiastic reception in Asia - and with it a higher valuation and more money. 
""We strongly believe we are under-appreciated in the U.S. and our shareholders deserve more,"" Chief Financial Officer Shao told Reuters.
In February, the drugmaker announced plans to pursue a second listing in Hong Kong in a letter to shareholders.
Sorrento has since said it expects to complete the listing by the end of the year or in the first quarter of next year and believes investors in China are especially keen to pump money into CAR-T drugs, a new generation of cancer medicines that involve genetically manipulating patients' immune systems. 
""In Hong Kong there's only one company that has a CAR-T program, which is Genscript Biotech Corporation, and it has a market value of around $6 billion. That has appreciated from about $700 million since last year, so you're talking about an 8 to 10 fold appreciation,"" Shao says. 
Wendy Pan, a partner at law firm Sidley Austin LLP, who convened a group of biotech companies and investors to provide industry feedback to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on revamping the rules, says early-stage biotech firms are valued higher in China than in the U.S.
""A lot of general funds in China are now setting up dedicated healthcare teams and are willing to pay more just to get into the space,"" she said.
Pan estimates that by the end of the year, about half a dozen biotechs will probably list in Hong Kong, and another 10 will have submitted their applications.
BIOSIMILAR ATTENTION 
Intense competition for capital in the United States, especially in revolutionary new fields of drug development like gene therapies and immuno-oncology, is also helping drive more smaller fish to foreign waters.
David Wang, Senior Managing Director at healthcare investor OrbiMed Asia, cites biosimilars - FDA-approved knock-offs of biologic medicines which are made in living cells - as one technology attracting a lot of attention.
""Some companies from a U.S. perspective are not novel, but for China ... they are a very novel thing,"" Wang said. 
""If you're a biosimilar company in the U.S. people don't believe that's going to be a big deal. However, in China biosimilar is big stuff.""
With a lack of experience, however, comes more risk in a capital-intensive sector where firms often have no revenue at all to show when fundraising.
A number of analysts also say that there is no big shortage of capital for biotech in the United States.
""Biotech investing is a little bit of a minefield... (and) in a market that's not used to investing in early stage biotech, it comes with a lot of risk,"" Oppenheimer analyst Mark Breidenbach said.
""I don't see any of my other companies flocking to list on the Hong Kong exchange."" 
If reports on one of the sector's unicorns, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates-backed blood-testing company Grail Inc, are anything to go by, however, company executives are being attracted by the enthusiasm of Asian investors.
Bloomberg reported earlier this year that Grail, which already raised $900 million to support its trials last year, would reel in $500 million in Hong Kong. 
Ira Pastor, CEO of privately held Bioquark, also argues that there might be more money in total in the private equity space than ever before, but for smaller companies ""its not going to come from U.S. private equity.""
""Clearly it (Hong Kong) is an area of the world that there's a lot of wealth floating around in (and it) represents a pool that maybe even understands our story a little better than the U.S.,"" he said.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 10:28AM ET</span>",VW could face further fines from German authorities,"BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) could face additional fines in Munich and Stuttgart on top of the 1 billion euros ($1.2 bln) it has been told to pay for management lapses which caused emissions cheating on 11 million VW diesel cars.
Prosecutors in the German town of Braunschweig used a so-called administrative order to fine Volkswagen for oversight problems which allowed millions of polluting VW cars to hit the road.
The fine is one of the biggest ever penalties imposed by German authorities against a company. 
It deals yet another blow to one of Germany's big industries which is struggling to recover from the fallout from the emissions cheating scandal that broke in Sept. 2015.
The 1 billion euro fine is not included in the 25.8 billion euros ($30 billion) that Europe's biggest carmaker has set aside to cover costs related to its admission that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests, and it will hit earnings, analysts at Evercore ISI said.
But shareholders should welcome the move since it marks an end to some of the criminal proceedings against the carmaker, they added.
However, that is not the end of VW's legal problems.
Prosecutors in the southern city of Munich said they too are examining whether to impose similar fines on VW's premium division Audi (DE:NSUG), for its role manipulating 6 and 8 cylinder diesel engines.
That would be in addition to Braunschweig's fine which sanctioned violations tied to 4-cylinder diesel engines.
Stuttgart prosecutors, who have launched a probe against employees at Daimler, Porsche, which is another part of the Volkswagen group, and auto supplier Bosch said they too may consider the use of an administrative order.
""In all these proceedings it is possible that a regulatory offense procedure will be carried out, we are still evaluating this possibility,"" a spokesman for the Stuttgart prosecutor's office said on Thursday.
TIMING ISSUE
Prosecutors in Braunschweig are also investigating Volkswagen executives including chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and chief executive Herbert Diess to see if they informed investors in a timely fashion about the scale of potential fines faced by the carmaker for cheating U.S. emissions tests.
The company denies any wrongdoing by its executives.
Braunschweig said it may rule on the matter in the coming months. The town is the main legal jurisdiction covering VW's headquarters in the German town of Wolfsburg.
""On market manipulation, it is possible that there will be a decision this year. A decision does not necessarily mean bringing charges, it could mean closing the proceedings,"" Braunschweig prosecutor Klaus Ziehe said at a news conference.
In a filing submitted to a Braunschweig court on Feb. 28, Volkswagen argued it did not violate corporate disclosure rules because it did not understand the scope of potential fines and claims faced by the company.
Four days before U.S. regulators blew the whistle on Volkswagen, Poetsch - the company's chief financial officer at the time - saw the potential financial risk from emissions violations at 150 million euros, the court filing shows. 
U.S. authorities disclosed Volkswagen's systematic emissions cheating on Sept. 18, 2015, sparking the biggest business scandal in the company's history and triggering a crackdown on emissions across the industry.

Volkswagen shares were up 2.5 percent by 1400 GMT, outperforming the blue-chip DAX index (GDAXI) and the Stoxx 600 Autos index.

746,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>","Robots Luise, Renate join Airbus A320 production line in Hamburg","HAMBURG (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus inaugurated a new production line for its best-selling A320 jet with robots Luise and Renate joining human workers as it turns to new automation to help it deal with an eight-year order backlog. 
Airbus hopes digital technology will enable higher production and trigger a significant shift in research and development spending toward high-tech manufacturing.
The planemaker is ramping up production of the single-aisle A320 jet, which competes with Boeing's 737, from 50 to 60 planes per month. Airbus has sold 8,000 of the jets with another 6,000 on order. 
The new final assembly line in Hamburg, like other lines, has a top rate of 10 aircraft per month, which it will reach by mid-2019. 
The two robots, whose names were chosen by employees, will in particular help to drill over 2,000 holes to join the two halves of the fuselage together, work normally done by humans.
They form part of a new final assembly line where the fuselage and wings are transported by automated moving tooling platforms, rather than being lowered by cranes onto fixed jigs, and where dynamic laser tracking is used to perfectly align aircraft parts.
The savings from the new technologies are not about time, but about precision and ergonomics, Airbus staff said. 
""It's more efficient when you are not drilling all holes by hand,"" Klaus Roewe, head of the A320 family program, told reporters in Hamburg, saying that the other new technologies for maneuvering parts would help to reduce the likelihood of damage or errors. 
Roewe said around one-third of the new technologies on the new final assembly line could potentially be transferred to other lines, whether in existing ones in Hamburg, France, China, or the United States. 
""The priority is to ramp up and then we will start thinking about what we can transfer,"" he said. 
Airbus has also extended and modernized its delivery center for the A320 family in Hamburg as part of plans to help it deal with the production ramp-up.

Allergan, whose director Patrick O'Sullivan will retire from the board in July, said its board will continue to have 12 members of which 10 are independent, following the changes.
Freyman, who retired from Abbott in 2017, most recently served as executive vice president, finance and administration for the company since June 2015. 

Last week, two of Allergan's shareholders, hedge funds Appaloosa Management and Senator Investment Group, asked the drugmaker's board to split the role of chief executive officer and chairman as well as reconsider its acquisition strategy.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Unilever  (AS:UNc) (L:ULVR) is ""extremely unlikely"" to stay in Britain's FTSE 100 blue chip share index (FTSE) after the consumer products company moves its headquarters to the Netherlands.
Unilever also said on Thursday that a truckers strike in Brazil would hit sales more than expected, contributing to a 4 percent drop in the company's shares.
The group said the strike in Brazil last month - which prevented all deliveries to factories or stores for 11 days - would reduce second-quarter sales by 150 million euros ($177.38 million).
That translates to about 120 basis points of sales growth for the second quarter and 60 basis points for the half year, Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said.
He said Unilever's overall sales growth for the first half of the year would be below its full-year target range of 3 to 5 percent because of the strike, but it would be in that range for the full year. 
Liberum analyst Anubhav Malhotra estimated the strike would cost Unilever 10 to 15 basis points of organic sales growth for the full year and no more than a 1 percent reduction in earnings-per-share consensus. 
""The magnitude was a bit higher than some of us would've expected,"" Malhotra said. Brazil accounts for about 6 percent of Unilever sales.
FTSE-LOOSE 
Unilever said in March that Rotterdam would be its headquarters in a blow to Britain just before Brexit. The group is ditching its dual-headed legal structure to simplify the company and give it greater flexibility when doing mergers and acquisitions.
Pitkethly said that after extensive engagement with listings group FTSE Russell, it was clear its new shares were ""extremely unlikely"" to be included in the FTSE UK series.
The group has certain listing requirements and analysts had previously predicted that Unilever would not meet them. 
""We understand and appreciate that a departure from the FTSE index has negative implications for some investors that are benchmarked to it, however simplification is the right thing for the company and our shareholders as a whole,"" Pitkethly said.
""We'll be maintaining a premium listing in London and we would hope that those investors who are impacted have got sufficient flexibility in their portfolios to continue to hold Unilever."" 
Pitkethly said he expected the shares would be likely to have increased weighting in pan-European indices instead. 
The company is on track to send out documentation about the move early in the third quarter, ahead of shareholder votes at the end of the third quarter, with the change being completed by the end of the year.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 07:23AM ET</span>","Rolls-Royce cuts 4,600 jobs at 'pivotal moment' for business","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (L:RR) is to cut 4,600 jobs over two years in the latest attempt by boss Warren East to reduce costs and complexity and make Britain's best known engineering company more profitable and dynamic.
East, a softly-spoken former tech boss, has overhauled the 134-year-old Rolls since he took charge in 2015 but the new cuts come as the group grapples with an aero-engine problem that has grounded planes and angered clients.
The announcement, which East said is not linked to the Trent 1000 engine issue, marks the biggest round of job cuts since the company had to retrench during the aviation crisis that followed the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001. 
The plan will remove 10 percent of the workforce, targeting duplication in corporate, administration and management roles to try to save 400 million pounds ($536 million) a year by 2020. 
Two thirds of the job cuts will fall in Britain. Rolls is the biggest employer in the city of Derby, central England, with 15,700 at its headquarters. 
""Rolls-Royce is at a pivotal moment in its history,"" East told reporters. ""We are poised to become the world leader in large aircraft engines. But we want to make the business as world class as our engineering and technology. 
""We are proposing the creation of a much more streamlined organization. We have to significantly reduce the size of our corporate center, removing complexity and duplication that makes us too slow, uncompetitive and too expensive.""
The cuts will not affect its engineers, Rolls said.
The news has echoes of an announcement from BT (L:BT) last month, another venerable company that is cutting 13,000 managerial and back-office jobs to reduce bureaucracy and respond faster to its customers' needs.
CASH TARGET
East, who built the chip designer ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) from a start-up into Britain's biggest tech company, has complained that Rolls, a rival to  General Electric  (N:GE), is too complex and cumbersome due to layers of bureaucracy above the shopfloor.
Driving home his new focus, he has set a 2020 free cash flow target of 1 billion pounds, a sizeable jump from the 273 million pounds recorded in 2017, off revenue of 15 billion pounds. 
In January he divided the company into three business units - Civil Aerospace, Defence and Power Systems - and the new restructuring is designed to remove management duplication between those layers and the corporate center. 
The cuts follow a lengthy period of investment in previous years that has meant it is now delivering its biggest ever increase in large engine production. 
The union Unite warned: ""There is a real danger that Rolls-Royce will cut too deep and too fast with these jobs cuts, which could ultimately damage the smooth running of the company and see vital skills and experience lost.""
The major restructuring, costing a total of 500 million pounds between 2018 and 2020, will be reported as separate one-off costs, allowing it to stick to its targets for free cash flow.
""These changes will help us deliver over the mid and longer-term a level of free cash flow well beyond our near-term ambition,"" East said.
The company holds an investor day on Friday where it is expected to provide more details on its targets and outlook. 
Asked about the potential sale of the company's commercial marine business, which supplies oil and gas customers and is under review, East said he would provide shareholders with a ""short update"" on Friday. 
Investors will also be looking for hints that the dividend could start to grow. It was halved in 2016 to enable the company to shore up its finances and cope with the declines in its aero engine and oil and gas businesses over the previous two years.
Rolls shares traded 3 percent higher to 854 pence by 1055 GMT after it published details of the restructuring plan.
The rise came despite analyst concerns about Rolls excluding the costs of restructuring from its the free cash flow targets. 
""In our view on first pass the headlines imply a notable underlying downgrade to current market expectations in outer-year estimates with higher than anticipated costs in the near term,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Phil Buller said in a note.
""How much of this is driven by the growing Trent 1000 issues is unclear.""
TEST OF MANAGEMENT
The overhaul will test East's management skills however, coming against a backdrop of huge pressures on the group which has been blindsided by problems with parts of the Trent 1000 engine which powers the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner jet.
Having discovered that parts of the engine were not lasting as long as expected, the company is having to ground planes to carry out inspections, forcing airline clients to lease alternative planes to meet demand in the busy summer period.
That program has pushed up costs, increasing pressure on Rolls to find savings elsewhere. East said the job cuts were not linked to the engine problem. 
""The people that will be leaving the business have nothing whatsoever to do with solving the issues our customers are having with our engines today,"" East said. 
""I know it sounds incongruous at face value, the loss of the work force while we're dealing with these issues but they're really two separate issues altogether.""

Rolls-Royce has 55,000 employees worldwide, of which 26,000 are in Britain. The latest changes follow previous job cuts and the creation of other roles following a series of profit warnings in 2014.

LONDON (Reuters) - Germany's HSH Nordbank, once the world's biggest ship financier, aims to buy shipping loans from other banks and make new investments in the industry as it emerges from years of turmoil, a top bank official said.
The bank's regional government owners are selling the lender to buyout groups Cerberus Capital Management and J.C. Flowers, with investors GoldenTree, Centaurus Capital and Austrian bank  BAWAG  (VI:BAWG) also taking stakes.
""HSH, at the end of this process of privatization, will for the first time since 2008 be restored. We will not have the same restrictions we faced or the pressures to reduce bad debt,"" Christian Nieswandt, global head of shipping with HSH Nordbank, told Reuters.
""We are looking to re-invest in the shipping space and are looking for high quality business,"" he said, adding the bank had an annual budget of 700 million euros until 2022 to invest in new shipping business, including buying loans from other banks.

By Aditi Shah and Jamie Freed
NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indian airlines are turning to the international market in search of better returns as the intensifying fight for a bigger share of the world's fastest growing domestic market - where price is king - drives down profits.
While global airlines' profits have been strong since 2015 - though with wide regional variations - Indian carriers are struggling to remain profitable, despite filling nearly 90 percent of their seats and benefiting from a more than doubling of domestic passenger numbers over the last four years.
""It is an incredibly tough domestic market, very price sensitive,"" said Stephen Barnes, chief financial officer of Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL), which operates an Indian carrier, Vistara, in a joint venture with the Tata Group.
""Commanding a premium for a premium product is hard to do. From our perspective we invested in order to see the business grow internationally. If you look at the results of Indian airlines their performance is better internationally.""
Promotions such as $50 one-way tickets on the two-hour flight from Mumbai to Delhi are easy to find and, with airlines expected to take delivery of more than 500 aircraft over the next five years, pressure on fares and profits is increasing.
India is one of the cheapest domestic airline markets in the world, with an average fare of 13 cents per kilometer flown, according to data from travel firm Rome2Rio, less than half the 27 cents per km average in China and the United States.
Airlines including Vistara, SpiceJet Ltd (BO:SPJT) and InterGlobe Aviation Ltd's (NS:INGL) IndiGo are in talks to buy or lease widebody aircraft as they firm up international growth plans to boost profitability.

INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES
There is huge potential for international travel from India, where the domestic aviation market has grown about 20 percent annually in recent years. 
Only 0.3 percent of the 1.3 billion population currently travel abroad for a holiday every year, a fraction of the estimated 100 million Indians who could potentially afford to do so, according to an analysis of household income by aviation consultancy, CAPA.
The international market is dominated by foreign carriers but the market share of Indian airlines including Air India and Jet Airways (NS:JET) has been climbing, helped by policies that limit access by foreign carriers, and reached about 38 percent in 2017, up from 31 percent a decade earlier. 
Foreign airlines such as Emirates and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) have reached the limit of flights into India allowed under bilateral agreements and New Delhi has not extended additional rights, creating an opening for domestic carriers to grow, said Binit Somaia, director for South Asia at CAPA.
""Demand is there, income levels are rising and people want to travel internationally,"" he said.
Jet Airways is considering launching new flights from Mumbai to Sydney, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, while Vistara is planning to order six  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787 aircraft and will expand its narrowbody fleet of Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neos as it starts international flights, sources have said. 
A Jet Airways spokesman said the airline ""continuously reviews its fleet and network plan ... to realize greater synergy with its business strategy.""
DOMESTIC COMPETITION
In the domestic market, which provides crucial connections for international flights, airlines have been jockeying for position at a time when one-time leader Air India has been losing market share to rivals with far lower costs, such as IndiGo.
The Indian government last month failed to attract a single bidder by the deadline for its 76 percent stake sale in the loss-making national carrier. 
Revenue per available seat kilometer, a measure combining airfares and seats filled, has been falling at Indian airlines due to stiff competition at a time when the oil price has risen nearly 50 percent in the last year.
For graphic on revenue per available seat kilometer vs oil prices click https://tmsnrt.rs/2y3dci5
IndiGo last month reported a steep fall in quarterly profit due to higher fuel prices and continued pressure on yields, a proxy for airfares.
IndiGo has lifted the proportion of its capacity dedicated to international flights to 15 percent, from 11 percent, in the last year and is seeking regulatory approvals needed to operate long-haul flights, Rahul Bhatia, the company's chairman, said during an analyst call.
SpiceJet and IndiGo are the only two listed Indian airlines to post a profit for the last 13 quarters consecutively.
Analysts say SpiceJet has achieved this by maximizing its aircraft utilization and also flying less competitive routes where it can have a better control over fares, helping protect yields. 
Even so, it plans to expand its international flights as it starts taking delivery of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft from August. The planes, which have a range of six hours and can reach destinations such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok, will mainly be deployed on international routes. 
Infrastructure constraints at major Indian airports like Mumbai and Delhi, where daytime slots are hard to get, also make going international a better option as airlines can utilize night-time slots, a SpiceJet official told Reuters. 
""International is the only way out,"" the official said.

759,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 06:21AM ET</span>","Wall Street wants more female traders, but old perceptions die hard","By Anna Irrera
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As a biomedical engineering student at Duke University, Priya Karani thought she did not have the right skills to break into the heavily male-dominated field of Wall Street trading.
""I was never interested in a career in trading at a bank because I didn’t know it was an option,"" Karani said.
A decade later, Karani is a director at  Barclays  PLC (L:BARC) in New York where she trades healthcare derivatives and helps the bank's effort to attract more women to trading by talking to female college students about her job.
Despite such efforts Karani still represents a small minority since few women apply for jobs in trading, deterred by its decades-old reputation as an ""alpha-male territory"" and misconceptions about skills it requires.
""Trading is a hard one to crack,"" said Jon Regan, a head of global markets for executive search firm Sheffield Haworth. ""I don't think it has changed much, although firms are working hard to improve their gender ratios.""
The firm, which works for many leading investment banks and conducts studies on behalf of its clients, found women generally account for 12 to 15 percent of trading roles, he said.
There are no industry-wide data but the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees U.S. brokerages, said women accounted for about 28 percent of individuals registered with it at the end of 2017. Those numbers include not just traders, but also investment advisers.
Banks' efforts to change that have intensified over the past year with the emergence of the #MeToo movement and growing shareholder calls for disclosures on workforce diversity.
For example,  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) released information on diversity and gender pay gap for the first time this year in response to calls from an investment advisory firm.
Since last year, major employers have also been obliged to report gender pay gap data for their British operations, which for banks showed women underrepresented in higher earning roles.
COACHING, NETWORKING AND MENTORING
Barclays' Sophomore Springboard program that Karani supports is one of several initiatives banks have introduced recently to make trading rooms more diverse.
Citigroup Inc (N:C) does college recruitment focused on informing young women about trading careers and offers them interview coaching, while JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) has been running an internal program for the past two years called Women Who Trade, which offers networking for female traders of all levels, including potential recruits.
""We are doing a better job at ensuring analyst classes have a better intake (of women),"" said Claudia Jury, global co-head of currencies and emerging markets at JPMorgan and a senior sponsor for the program. The bank has hired around 30 women through the program since 2016, it said.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) started its Trader Academy in London last year, offering eight months of mentoring, networking and job shadowing for 16 female college students. The bank plans to expand the program to the Americas this year and Asia soon after.
Goldman has said it wants women to eventually make up half of its overall workforce, but acknowledges trading is far from that goal.
""Having women in particular from a trading perspective has always been a challenge for us,"" said Janine Glasenberg, the bank's head of graduate recruiting in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Banks are so keen to improve their diversity ratios that one declined to make young female traders available for interviews out of fear they might get poached by competitors.
Shareholder pressure aside, managers and some studies say hiring more women simply makes business sense.
David Hesketh, chief executive of a London-based startup TradingHub said trading simulations the company ran in 2014 and 2015 for hundreds of interns as part of banks' recruitment programs showed women made fewer trades and took fewer risks. They would also break the rules less than half as often as men. In all, having more women on a team could translate into savings on brokerage fees, loss provisions and fines. 
""That is kind of nuts, if you think some firms are getting fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Hesketh said.
BOYS CLUB VIBE
Yet former female traders interviewed by Reuters describe an industry, which has left behind discriminatory attitudes common only a decade ago, but where women remain heavily outnumbered and can sometimes feel like outsiders in a ""boys' club."" 
Simmy Grover, who worked as an equity trader at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in London between 2006 and 2009, recalled how just over a decade ago one investment bank was ready to offer her a job, but just could not imagine her on the trading floor.
""I remember walking into an interview and I was asked why I had applied for trading because I was a woman and I should be applying to sales.""
Grover, now a researcher at the University College London, said she ended up working as a trader elsewhere anyway. While she said she never felt marginalized on the job, she would sometimes get overlooked by brokers hosting social events- typically involving watching a soccer game and a trip to the pub. 
Divya Krishnan, who was a trader between 2009 and 2014 as part of Citi's program for quantitative analysts, said in her time the bank was already trying to help young recruits, offering networking opportunities and linking them up with experienced female traders.
They told them, she recalls, to be confident and avoid apologizing too much, something she said women tended to do.
But like Grover she found it was harder to fit in after hours. ""I was never a sports person, but that was always a topic of conversation. I had to learn that,"" Krishnan, who now works for fintech startup Motif, said.
While workplace culture is slow to change, banks focus their outreach in colleges on broadening a pool of potential candidates by dispelling the myth that only math wizards or those with finance degrees can succeed in trading.
""We spend a lot of the time encouraging women who have liberal arts backgrounds to look at this business,"" said Amanda Magliaro, a managing director and head of global structured finance distribution at Citigroup.
Magliaro, who graduated as a Japanese language major and holds an MBA in finance, said the efforts, including interview coaching for women joining its internship program, were bearing fruit: ""It has improved the numbers."" 
Headhunters say, however, it will take time before effects of such efforts show up in banks' gender ratios.

""Firms would like to have more women in trading and other areas, but there aren't that many women in the pipeline,"" said Ross Gregory, a director at recruitment firm Proco Commodities.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Australian bank ANZ says to cut at least 60 markets jobs,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) said on Thursday it will cut about 60 staff positions from its markets division across the world due to ""challenging"" conditions and ""ongoing headwinds"".
The job cuts impact 30 employees in Australia and a similar number across Asia, Europe and the United States, equating to roughly 7 percent of its workforce, spokesman Stephen Ries said in an email. 
ANZ has found itself at the center of one of Australia's biggest cases of alleged white-collar crime following cartel conduct investigation by the country's competition watchdog over a $2.3 billion stock issue.
Australian banks are also being investigated by a quasi-judicial public inquiry called Royal Commission which has already earthed a series of malpractices and dodgy behavior.
ANZ's job cuts were announced internally on May 4 by Shayne Collins, ANZ's managing director of markets, but the information was officially confirmed by Ries on Thursday after Sky News first reported.
""As you saw in the (first-half) results...conditions are challenging for our sector,"" Collins said in an internal email to staff, a copy of which was viewed by Reuters.

""We have agreed on a plan with both of them to catch up with production, both are now hitting the targets and are on track, which is good news,"" Klaus Roewe, head of the A320 jet family program, told reporters in Hamburg as Airbus inaugurated a new assembly line for the best-selling single-aisle plane.
The delays in getting engines from United Technologies (N:UTX) unit Pratt & Whitney and CFM International, co-owned by  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (N:GE), have left Airbus lagging behind the pace it needs to reach its full-year delivery goal.
With jets left parked at its production sites while they wait for engines, Roewe said Airbus would have reduced production had it known the extent of the problems. 
""Did we intend to build so many airframes to park them? For sure not,"" Roewe said. ""If we had known the size of the technical and industrial problems we might have slowed down production."" 

He said Airbus would not be parking aircraft by the end of the year, but would still be in arrears in terms of deliveries.

764,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 04:08AM ET</span>","Embattled ZTE seeks $10.7 billion credit line, nominates 8 board members","By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063) has proposed a $10.7 billion financing plan and nominated eight board members in a drastic management overhaul, as it seeks to rebuild a business crippled by a U.S. supplier ban. 
The news, announced late on Wednesday, indicates China's No.2 telecom equipment maker is working towards meeting conditions laid out by the United States so it could resume business with American suppliers, who provide about 25-30 percent of the components used in ZTE's equipment.
Investors cheered the development, driving up ZTE's Hong Kong-listed shares as much as 3.7 percent on Thursday morning.
A day earlier, embattled ZTE's shares plunged a record 41 percent in Hong Kong and 10 percent in Shenzhen, wiping almost $3 billion off its market value, as it resumed trading after being suspended for almost two months due to the U.S. ban. 
The United States imposed the seven-year supplier ban on ZTE in April after it broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea.
ZTE last week agreed to pay a $1 billion fine to the U.S. government. The ban will, however, not be lifted until ZTE pays the fine and places another $400 million in an escrow account in a U.S.-approved bank for 10 years.
ZTE was also ordered to radically overhaul its management and hire a U.S.-appointed special compliance coordinator. 
BOARD OVERHAUL
As part of its deal with the United States, ZTE needs to replace its 14-person board and fire all leadership members at or above the senior vice president level, along with any executives or officers tied to the wrongdoing. The U.S. commerce department can exercise discretion in granting exceptions.
In filings late on Wednesday, ZTE said its controlling shareholder, Zhongxingxin, had nominated 8 new board members.
That included 5 non-independent directors - Li Zixue, Li Buqing, Gu Junying, Zhu Weimin, and Fang Rong - all from state-linked firms that are shareholders of or have investment relationships with Zhongxingxin.
Zhongxingxin has a 30.34 percent stake in ZTE.
Cai Manli, Yuming Bao and Gordon Ng have been nominated as independent non-executive directors.
Voting on this will take place at an AGM on June 29.
According to a Reuters estimate based on company filings and a source with knowledge of the matter, ZTE's management overhaul could result in about 40 senior executives being replaced. 
The company can find most candidates internally, Jefferies analyst Edison Lee said. ""That is feasible, though it will of course cause confusion and slow down decision-making.""
CREDIT LINE
ZTE also proposed to amend a company statute at the AGM to remove a clause that required the chairman to be elected from directors or members of the senior officers of the company who had served for three years or more. 
In addition, ZTE proposed to allow the board to apply for a $10.7 billion credit line, including a 30 billion yuan ($4.69 billion) from Bank of China (SS:601988) and $6 billion from China Development Bank. 
ZTE's Shenzhen-listed shares dropped by the maximum daily permitted limit of 10 percent on mainland exchanges for a second day on Thursday, tracking recent losses in Hong Kong.
Jefferies set a target price of HK$14.41 for the Hong Kong-listed ZTE stock, citing significant near-term selling pressure.
The Hong Kong-listed ZTE stock gave up early gains to trade almost flat at around HK$14.90 ($1.90) by 0757 GMT, in a broader market (HSI) that was down more than a percent.

768,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>",FINMA finds serious shortcomings at Swiss bank Raiffeisen,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss financial market supervisor FINMA found serious breaches at Raiffeisen Switzerland in a probe related to fraud allegations against former Chief Executive Pierin Vincenz.
""FINMA has found that the bank's handling of conflicts of interest was inadequate. In addition, Raiffeisen's board of directors failed to adequately supervise its former CEO, thereby enabling him, at least potentially, to generate personal financial gain at the bank's expense,"" the watchdog said in a statement on Thursday.
It told Switzerland's third-largest bank, which is owned cooperatively by 1.9 million customers and is not listed, to conduct a detailed analysis of converting into a limited company ""since a company's legal form and group structure have a significant impact on corporate governance requirements"".
Prosecutors are investigating Vincenz, who denies wrongdoing but has been forced to resign from business roles, on suspicion of breach of trust linked to cashless payments business Aduno as well as private equity firm Investnet.
Vincenz was released from investigative custody on Tuesday after being held for three months.
FINMA's investigation focused on the bank's handling of ownership in Investnet, a firm majority owned by Raiffeisen from 2015 in which a minority stake was sold to Vincenz.
""Although (Vincenz), as CEO of the bank, was selling shares in Investnet Holding AG and at the same time, as a private individual, buying the same shares and was therefore involved in a clear conflict of interest, he did not recuse himself, as he should have done under the bank's internal policies,"" FINMA said.
""For its part, the board of directors of Raiffeisen Switzerland also failed to investigate the obvious potential conflicts of interest and enforce the internal rules on disclosure and recusal.""
FINMA said Raiffeisen needed ""fresh blood"" on its board with stepped-up banking and compliance expertise, as well as appropriate qualifications for its audit and risk officers.
Raiffeisen said it acknowledged FINMA's findings and had already begun implementing many of the measures, noting five board members had or would soon be stepping down, and two new members were proposed for election at the group's delegate assembly on Saturday.
Current Chief Executive Patrik Gisel, who worked with Vincenz for years before taking the helm in 2015, has also come under pressure from the probe.
FINMA said it had thus far not found any evidence that would justify launching enforcement proceedings against current Raiffeisen officials, adding it would wait for findings from the bank's internal investigation to determine whether it would launch further individual proceedings.

The most famous advertising executive in the world quit the marketing giant he built from scratch in April following an allegation of personal misconduct, prompting concerns among some investors over the handling of his departure. 
Nearly 30 percent of shareholders opposed WPP's executive pay proposal at the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. These included share awards to Sorrell that could be worth 20 million pounds, although they are expected to be well below that due to recent underperformance.
Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), WPP's seventh largest owner with a two percent stake according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data, voted in favor however, and also backed the re-election of chairman Roberto Quarta, which was opposed by almost 17 percent of shareholders.
The fund, which frequently opposes pay deals it considers too complex or otherwise in breach of its guidelines, did not elaborate on its vote.
In March, NBIM voted against stock option grants to Tesla (O:TSLA) boss Elon Musk, and recently voted with activist shareholders at Facebook (O:FB), Alphabet (O:GOOG) and Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) on issues ranging from share buybacks to transparency and appointments.

Voting records from the last five years show NBIM backed all management proposals at meetings of WPP shareholders.

Because its currency is pegged to the dollar, the Asian financial hub effectively imports U.S. monetary policy and adjusts borrowing costs in line with the Fed. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority raised its base rate to to 2.25 percent from 2 percent Thursday, following a 25 basis point move by the Fed.
It’s only a “matter of time” before banks raise deposit and prime rates as the upward trend in Hibor, the benchmark interbank lending rate, is obvious, HKMA’s chief executive Norman Chan told reporters at a press conference Thursday.
A quarter point increase by the U.S. central bank presents little immediate risk to a city shielded by ample liquidity and buoyant growth momentum, though it does raise the question of when local banks will push up the ceiling for rates they charge borrowers for the first time since 2006.
With the real estate market showing little sign of slowing, a prime-rate hike will pose a challenge to investors who are currently bullish on the economy, and make decisions in Washington much more relevant.
“Major banks will raise the prime rate first -- as soon as this week -- and other smaller lenders will follow their lead to do the same,” said Ken Cheung, a senior currency strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. “Direct impacts on the housing market should be limited.”
Economic growth accelerated at the fastest pace since 2011 in the first quarter, with the jobless rate tumbling to a two-decade low. Despite repeated warnings from the de facto central bank, Hong Kong’s property market shows no sign of cooling down, and the wealth effect that creates is driving robust domestic consumption.
That means that the city’s economic fundamentals are solid enough to cushion a gradual rate hike trajectory, according to Tristan Zhuo, senior economist at Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd.
“The Fed hike in June will probably not spill over to the real economy in Hong Kong, given the federal funds rate is still relatively low compared with levels in the previous tightening cycles,” he said.
The divergence between Hong Kong’s effective rates and the U.S. though has caused the HKMA headaches. Officials have had to step in this year to defend its currency peg, buying local dollars to offset the impact of investors shorting them.
The pass through from the Fed to Hong Kong consumers isn’t direct, according to Iris Pang, an economist with  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV.
The Fed has been raising rates since late 2015 “but mortgage rates haven’t come up, they’ve come down,” she said in an interview. “Competition is very fierce these days in terms of lending. Banks tend to compete on consumer loans or mortgages, so mortgage rates are kept at a very low level.”
Local banks still have a stockpile of more than HK$100 billion in cash, which is a solid buffer against outflows and enough to dull incentives to raise interest rates. Upcoming mega stock offerings from Chinese tech unicorns are expected to bring more money, as a tweak of listing rules is supposed to mark a new era for the city’s capital market.
“Hong Kong is attracting money like a magnet,” said Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong, who forecasts a prime-rate increase later this year. “The property market and economic momentum won’t sour, unless the Fed raises rates aggressively and that leads to a liquidity squeeze.”

NEW YORK (IFR) - Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) says it has ""Highly Confident Letters"" from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) for its US$65bn 21st Century Fox bid. 
A ""Highly Confident Letter"" is a note from an investment banking firm that says the firm is highly confident it will be able to arrange the financing for a securities deal.
Comcast's competing bid for 21st Century Fox is the largest all-cash deal of all-time, surpassing Bayer's US$64bn merger with  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), according to Thomson Reuters Deal Insight data.
Comcast said its all-cash proposal is not subject to a financing condition.
It is proposing to acquire 100% of outstanding shares of 21st Century Fox for US$35.00 per share in cash. 
It also said it would reimburse the US$1.525bn break-up fee paid to 21st Century Fox by Disney for a total cost to Comcast of US$4.025bn in the ""highly unlikely"" scenario that Comcast's transaction does not close. 
The deal will take Comcast's net leverage to above four times, according to executives speaking on a conference call Wednesday. 
That number would include the leverage incurred from Comcast's acquisition of Sky, which the US media company is also hoping to buy. 
One analyst on the call expressed surprise at the proposed increase in leverage, noting the company has been ""historically conservative on the leverage front"". 
Comcast executives said they plan to cut net leverage by half a turn each year with free cash flow to arrive at 2.2x. 
""We are very focused on getting our leverage back down,"" one Comcast executive said. 
The company is expecting to maintain its investment-grade rating.
Moody's has warned it may cut Comcast's A3 rating, citing concerns about higher debt levels, especially in light of Comcast's simultaneous US$30bn all cash bid for Sky.

S&P and Fitch both have A- ratings on Comcast.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 07:28PM ET</span>","Senate, White House gear up for battle over China's ZTE","By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation to block the Trump administration's agreement allowing China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) to resume business with American suppliers could be killed in the U.S. Congress in the coming weeks, lawmakers and aides said on Wednesday.
The U.S. Senate is due to vote within days on the measure as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a defense policy bill Congress passes every year. The White House strongly opposes the ZTE measure.
If it passes, the House of Representatives and Senate must negotiate a final version of the NDAA. The ZTE provision, which is not included in the House version of the defense bill, could be stripped out during those negotiations. 
Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said he would oppose anything in the NDAA not germane to the Defense Department if it threatened to delay swift passage of the $716 billion bill, which governs everything from military pay raises to aircraft and ship purchases, military aid and other national security policies.
He said that process could be completed by the end of July.
The House NDAA includes a separate provision barring U.S. government agencies from using ""risky"" technology from ZTE or Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], describing the Chinese telecommunications companies as ""linked to the Chinese Communist Party's intelligence apparatus.""
Should it become law, the ZTE measure would restore penalties on the company for violating export controls and bar U.S. government agencies from purchasing or leasing equipment or services from the Chinese company.
The U.S. government banned the company earlier this year, but the Trump administration reached an agreement to lift the ban, while it is negotiating broader trade agreements with China and looking to Beijing for support during negotiations to halt North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Chinese President Xi Jinping requested the change.
STIFF PENALTY ON ZTE
In a settlement with the U.S. Commerce Department, ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, overhaul its leadership and meet other conditions, including putting $400 million in escrow in a U.S.-approved bank.
The White House pushed back against the legislation, defending the agreement as ""part of an historic enforcement action"" giving the U.S. government some leverage over ZTE's activity without ""undue harm"" to U.S. suppliers and workers.
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said the administration will work with Congress to ensure that the final version of the NDAA ""respects the separation of powers.""
And some of Trump's fellow Republicans, who control Congress, back the White House.
Republican Senator David Perdue tried and failed to win the Senate's support for killing the ZTE measure on Wednesday, arguing that limiting the Commerce Department's authority would undercut Trump's ability to negotiate trade deals with China.
But the ZTE measure's main sponsors, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen and Republican Senator Tom Cotton, both said they believed it had enough support from Republicans and Democrats to pass the Senate despite White House opposition.
""These companies have proven themselves to be untrustworthy, and at this point I think the only fitting punishment would be to give them the death penalty - that is, to put them out of business in the United States,"" Cotton said in a Senate speech, referring to both ZTE and Huawei.
Cotton said he and Van Hollen would keep working in the common months to ensure the ZTE measure stays in the defense bill.

ZTE shares plunged in Hong Kong and Shenzhen markets on Wednesday in its first day of trading after an almost two-month halt. Investors wiped about $3 billion off its market value, or about 40 percent, in initial trading.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended a choppy session lower on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected and projected a slightly faster pace of rate hikes this year.
Two more hikes are now expected by the end of this year, compared with one previously. 
The central bank, which raised its benchmark overnight lending rate a quarter of a percentage point to a range of between 1.75 percent and 2 percent, also dropped its longstanding pledge to stimulate the economy ""for some time.""
Stocks were volatile after the statement but ended near the lows of the session, and selling was broad-based, with most S&P sector indexes ending lower. The Cboe Volatility index (VIX) rose.
""The expectation now is for four rate increases in total in 2018. Consensus had been more like three, moving toward four, so I think that's a bit of a surprise,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management in Chicago.
""It seems as if the Fed is much more confident now in inflation reaching, in fact maybe breaching a little bit, their target, so they are pulling forward some of the rate increases.”
Fresh projections from policymakers suggested that inflation would run above the Fed's 2 percent target, hitting 2.1 percent this year and remaining there through 2020.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 119.53 points, or 0.47 percent, to 25,201.2, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 11.22 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,775.63 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 8.10 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,695.70.
S&P financials (SPSY), which tend to benefit from rising interest rates, ended down 0.3 percent.
""The financials are a bit of a puzzle. There's always a lag between the increases in deposit rates and fund costs and interest on loans,"" said Robert Eisenbeis, vice chairman and chief monetary economist at Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Florida. 
""There's some processing and digesting going on."" 
Traders of U.S. short-term interest-rate futures increased bets the Fed will raise rates again this year and next after the Fed's statement.
A ruling Tuesday that approved AT&T Inc's (N:T) $85 billion deal to buy  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) put the spotlight on media and telecom shares, which mostly rose.
Shares of HBO channel owner Time Warner rose 1.8 percent. AT&T dropped 6.2 percent in its highest volume day ever, sending the S&P telecom services index (SPLRCL) down 4.5 percent.
Shares of other telecom and media companies such as Sprint Corp (N:S), CBS Corp (N:CBS) and Discovery Inc (O:DISCA) ended higher.
After the bell, Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) offered $65 billion for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) media assets. Twenty-First Century Fox shares were up 0.2 percent in after-hours trading, after closing the regular session up 7.7 percent. Comcast shares ended the session down 0.2 percent.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 05:04PM ET</span>",Apple to undercut popular law-enforcement tool for cracking iPhones,"By Joseph Menn
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said on Wednesday it will change its iPhone settings to undercut the most popular means for law enforcement to break into the devices.
The company told Reuters it was aiming to protect all customers, especially in countries where phones are readily obtained by police or by criminals with extensive resources, and to head off further spread of the attack technique.
The privacy standard-bearer of the tech industry said it will change default settings in the iPhone operating system to cut off communication through the USB port when the phone has not been unlocked in the past hour.
That port is how machines made by forensic companies GrayShift, Cellebrite and others connect and get around the security provisions that limit how many password guesses can be made before the device freezes them out or erases data. Now they will be unable to run code on the devices after the hour is up.
These companies have marketed their machines to law enforcement in multiple countries this year, offering the machines themselves for thousands of dollars but also per-phone pricing as low as $50. 
Apple representatives said the change in settings will protect customers in countries where law enforcement seizes and tries to crack phones with fewer legal restrictions than under U.S. law. They also noted that criminals, spies and unscrupulous people often use the same techniques. Even some of the methods most prized by intelligence agencies have been leaked on the internet.
“We’re constantly strengthening the security protections in every Apple product to help customers defend against hackers, identity thieves and intrusions into their personal data,” Apple said in a prepared statement. “We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don’t design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs.""
Apple began working on the USB issue before learning it was a favorite of law enforcement. 
The setting switch had been documented in beta versions of iOS 11.4.1 and iOS12, and Apple told Reuters it will be made permanent in a forthcoming general release.
Apple said that after it learned of the techniques, it reviewed the iPhone operating system code and improved security. It decided to simply alter the setting, a cruder way of preventing most of the potential access by unfriendly parties.
With the changes, police or hackers will typically have an hour or less to get a phone to a cracking machine. That could cut access by as much as 90 percent, security researchers estimated. 
This also could spur sales of cracking devices, as law enforcement looks to get more forensic machines closer to where seizures occur. Undoubtedly, researchers and police vendors will find new ways to break into phones, and Apple will then look to patch those vulnerabilities.
The setting change could also draw criticism from U.S. law enforcement officials who have been engaged in an on-again, off-again campaign for legislation or other ways to force technology companies to maintain access to users’ communications.
Apple has been the most prominent opponent of those demands. In 2016, it went to court to fight an order that it break into an iPhone 5c used by a killer in San Bernardino.
Then-FBI Director James Comey told Congress that without compelling Apple to write new software to facilitate the digital break-in, there would be no way to learn if the shooter’s device contained evidence of a conspiracy. The FBI ultimately found a contractor that broke into the phone without Apple's cooperation.
Apple and most private security experts argue that government contractors and others can usually find means of cracking devices. They also say that weakening encryption by design would lead to more hacking by those outside of government.

Until recently, current FBI Director Christopher Wray repeatedly claimed that the Bureau had been unable to get into more than 7,000 phones in 2017. Last month, the Washington Post reported that the true number was less than a third as high. The FBI blamed ""programing errors."" https://wapo.st/2lbOiUd

788,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>","Thanks to Fed, an Inverted Yield Curve Is Imminent","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If Federal Reserve officials are truly trying to avoid an inverted yield curve, they have a funny way of showing it.
Policy makers on Wednesday raised the central bank’s benchmark as expected while also shifting their “dot plot” higher for the next two years. They now anticipate a total of four quarter-point rate hikes in 2018, up from three previously. In 2019, the median estimate calls for a 3.125 percent fed funds rate (or a range of 3 percent to 3.25 percent). That means for the first time since the projections were introduced in 2012, the forecast for the following year is higher than officials’ estimate of the longer-term neutral rate at 2.875 percent.
It should come as little surprise then that Treasury yield curves flattened to the lowest levels since 2007 after the Fed’s decision. The spread between two- and 10-year maturities fell to 39 basis points and the gap between five- and 30-year securities dropped below 25 basis points. That’s only logical, considering that central bankers see short-term rates as higher than the current yield on long bonds by the end of 2019.
Enough Fed officials have expressed concern about an inverted yield curve and what it signals for the economic outlook over the past few months that it’s surprising how willing they are to bring about that scenario. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said last month that inversion was bearish for the U.S. economy and that “you could be talking about it in September. I don’t think it’s likely to happen that fast.”
Well, if the Fed follows through with another rate hike that month, a reasonable argument can be made that the yield curve will invert as soon as September. 
“The yield curve is something people are talking about a lot, including FOMC participants,” Chairman Jerome Powell said during his press conference. “That discussion is really about what is appropriate policy and how do we think about policy as we approach the neutral rate?”
Now, an inverted yield curve has been a great tool to predict U.S. recessions, with the yield spread between three-month bills and 10-year notes falling below zero before each of the past seven slowdowns. But it doesn’t usually happen immediately. That means a recession could come in late 2019, in 2020, or even later. That probably doesn’t come as a surprise to most investors after one of the longest economic expansions in history.
But it does signal that this Fed, under Powell, is much different from its predecessors. It’s not going to go easy on monetary policy. It’s not going to be ultra-cautious. There will be a press conference after every meeting, starting in January. Treasuries knew what to do upon that realization, selling off across the curve, with 10-year yields topping 3 percent for the first time since May 24.
Stocks, on the other hand, weren’t so sure. The S&P 500 Index hit session lows, then rebounded, then hit new lows, then rebounded once more. But, in the grand scheme of things, they’re little changed.
It’s the yield curve, then, that sticks out. On the one hand, it confirms the bias among bond traders for flattening. But, as Bloomberg News’s Cameron Crise put it, it’s also a realization that “this isn’t your older sibling’s Fed anymore.” 
Interest rates are headed higher, and it’s going to take more than a little turbulence— or fear of an inverted yield curve — to knock the Fed off course."

1. Jobless Claims, Retail Sales Eyed 
Following the Federal Reserve's hawkish tilt Wednesday, investors will likely turn attention to U.S. retail sales and labor market data for further clues the U.S. economy remains solid footing to sustained a faster pace of rate hikes.
Retail sales growth data due 8:30AM ET is forecast to show a 0.4% increase for May, up from a 0.2% rise the prior month. The retail sales control group growth – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP – is expected to slow to 0.4% from 0.5% the previous month.
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance due 08:30 am ET for the week ended May June 8, expected to show jobless claims rose to 223,000 from 222,000 the prior week.
The duo of reports come as the Federal Reserve policymakers on Wednesday appeared to warm up to the idea of a faster pace rate hikes, raising their outlook on the rate hike path for this year and 2019.
The export price index and import price index data due 8:30am ET are also expected garner investor attention.
The dollar retreated Wednesday, pressuring by a rise in the EUR/USD as traders upped their bets the European Central Bank would adopt a more hawkish stance on Thursday, when it is widely expected the central bank will signal an end to its massive bond-buying programme.

Natural gas prices rose sharply on Wednesday a day ahead of data expected to show an increased in natural gas storage.
The Energy Information Agency’s weekly natural gas storage report is expected show gas storage rose by 90 billion cubic feet last week, adding to the above-forecast build seen in the prior week.
Crude oil prices will also remain in focus as investors assess whether the massive drop in U.S. crude supplies will support further gains in oil prices.
Crude futures settled 28 cents higher at $66.64 a barrel.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) are winding down a joint venture formed to develop automotive fuel cell technology, Ford said on Wednesday, as both companies plan to take their respective fuel cell technology development in-house.
The Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation Corp venture, based in Burnaby, British Columbia, will close this summer, Ford said in response to an inquiry by Reuters. 
Despite years of research and investment by major automakers and startups, vehicles powered by fuel cells remain a tiny niche in the global vehicle market. 
Honda Motor Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) are collaborating on fuel cell development, and Toyota Motor Corp is ramping up efforts to mass-produce fuel cell stacks. Earlier this week, Ballard Power Systems Inc extended a contract with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG's Audi unit to work on fuel cell development.
Ford ""will take fuel cell stack development in-house, as well as leverage the supply base, and close Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation Corp. by summer 2018,"" the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker said. ""Both companies will continue to explore ways to cooperate on developing fuel cell stack modules.""
Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche earlier this year indicated that the German automaker was shifting its focus toward battery-electric vehicles.
The venture employed about 200 people, according to its website.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 04:21PM ET</span>","UAW elects new leader to face contract talks, federal probe","By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - The union that represents factory workers at the Detroit Three automakers elected regional director Gary Jones as its new president on Wednesday, ahead of tough 2019 contract talks likely to coincide with declining U.S. sales of new vehicles.
United Auto Workers officials gathered in a balloon-filled convention hall in Detroit elected Jones, head of the union's Region 5 covering 17 western and southwestern states, to a four-year term as UAW president. 
Jones, a certified public accountant, will have to lead the once powerful union through an expanding U.S. Justice Department investigation into alleged misspending at UAW union training centers, as well as contract negotiations next year with General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) NV (MI:FCHA). 
The UAW represents around 140,000 workers at the Detroit automakers.
In March, in a major embarrassment for the union, a former official on the UAW committee that negotiated a 2015 labor agreement with FCA was charged with accepting illegal payments from a senior executive of the automaker.
Federal prosecutors also alleged in a May 25 court document that top FCA and UAW officials conspired to violate U.S. labor laws, saying a former FCA executive knew bribes paid to union leaders were designed to ""grease the skids"" in labor negotiations.
Jones, 60, joined the UAW in 1975 when he was hired at a Ford Motor Co plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. He has worked for the union in various roles since 1990.
UAW membership has crept up since the end of the 2007-2009 recession, but is about half of what it was in 1998 and well below a peak of 1.5 million members in 1979. 
The UAW said in March that its membership rose 35 percent in 2017, but union dues payments slipped 4 percent from 2016.
The Detroit automakers and their suppliers have slashed workforces at UAW-represented factories over the past 30 years as they have automated and lost sales to European and Asian rivals.
Outgoing UAW President Dennis Williams has expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump's moves to restrict imports of vehicles from Mexico and other low wage countries.
The UAW's effort to win higher wages and stronger job guarantees in a new contract next year could run into rising costs and falling sales for the Detroit automakers. After a boom running from 2010 to record annual sales of 17.55 million units in 2016, new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017, with further decreases expected this year and in 2019.

The union has also struggled to organize workers at major foreign automakers. It is currently trying to organize workers at Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) in Fremont, California, and has joined an unfair labor practices complaint against the luxury electric car maker.

A firm offer from Comcast, widely expected later in the day, could upend Fox's $52 billion all-stock deal to be bought by Walt Disney Co. 
U.S. District Judge Richard Leon on Tuesday approved AT&T's buyout of Time Warner, rebuffing an attempt by U.S. President Donald Trump to block the takeover and potentially clearing the path for more such deals in a rapidly changing media industry. 
Fox shares rose 7 percent in afternoon trade. Shares of other telecom and media companies such as Sprint Corp, CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS) and Discovery Inc were all up between 1 percent to 3 percent. Time Warner rose almost 3 percent, while Disney was up 2 percent. 
While the judge's approval of AT&T's deal for Time Warner may embolden Comcast, it does not guarantee clear passage for its acquisition of Fox's entertainment business, according to antitrust lawyers. 
Henry Su, an antitrust expert with Constantine Cannon LLP, said that Comcast already owns significant amounts of content because it bought NBC Universal. 
Both companies operate television and film studios, have a stake in streaming service Hulu and own regional sports networks. 
Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, said Judge Leon's opinion will be seen as a green light for Comcast to bid for Rupert Murdoch's Fox, but tipped Disney as the potential winner in a bidding war.
""We continue to believe that Disney has the superior balance sheet, cost of debt, equity and rationale to emerge victorious over Comcast in a bidding war,"" Moffett said.
Comcast said in May it was in advanced stages of preparing a higher all-cash offer for Fox's assets but did not indicate the value of its bid. Reuters reported last November that both Comcast and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) had expressed interest in buying Fox's assets.
The move by media companies to consolidate highlights the threat from online players such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, which sell content online directly to consumers, without requiring a pricey cable subscription.
AT&T's stock, however, was down 5 percent, with analysts raising concerns about the debt the company would absorb. Research firm MoffettNathanson said AT&T will carry $249 billion of debt after the merger.
Cowen and Co analyst Gregory Williams played down the drop in AT&T's stock price.

""Once technically driven volatility wears off we expect the stock to move higher as closure will likely provide a new investor catalyst including about $1.5 billion in anticipated cost synergies,"" Williams said.

807,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 03:41PM ET</span>",Volkswagen fined one billlion euros by German prosecutors over emissions cheating,"By Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz
BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) was fined one billion euros ($1.18 billion) over diesel emissions cheating in what amounts to one of the highest ever fines imposed by German authorities against a company, public prosecutors said on Wednesday. 
The German fine follows a U.S. plea agreement from January 2017 when VW agreed to pay $4.3 billion to resolve criminal and civil penalties for installing illegal software in diesel engines to cheat strict U.S. anti-pollution tests. 
""Following thorough examination, Volkswagen AG accepted the fine and it will not lodge an appeal against it. Volkswagen AG, by doing so, admits its responsibility for the diesel crisis and considers this as a further major step toward the latter being overcome,"" it said in a statement.
The fine is the latest blow to Germany's auto industry which cannot seem to catch a break from the diesel emissions crisis. Germany's government on Monday ordered Daimler to recall nearly 240,000 cars fitted with illicit emissions-control devices, part of a total of 774,000 models affected in Europe as a whole.
Munich prosecutors this week widened an emissions cheating probe into VW's luxury brand Audi to include Chief Executive Rupert Stadler among the suspects accused of fraud and false advertising.
The prosecutor's office in Braunschweig imposed the fine against VW on Wednesday for organizational deficiencies which failed to prevent ""impermissible software functions"" from being installed in 10.7 million cars between 2007 and 2015.
The fine did not address any civil claims or claims by vehicle owners, the prosecutor's office said in its statement. It does, however, end regulatory offence proceedings against Volkswagen, which the Wolfsburg-based carmaker said would help to settle further administrative proceedings against VW in Europe.
STRONG CASH POSITION
VW shares closed 0.1 percent higher at 159.78 euros.
VW is far from being out of the woods. The carmaker's new chief executive, Herbert Diess, and the group's chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch are still being investigated by Braunschweig prosecutors for suspected market manipulation.
Poetsch, also CEO of VW's majority stakeholder  Porsche  SE (DE:PSHG_p), is separately being investigated by prosecutors in Stuttgart over the same suspicions.
""Courts will now hardly be able to dismiss consumer complaints,"" said Jan-Eike Andresen of platform MyRight which has mandated U.S. law firm Hausfeld to pursue civil claims.
Hausfeld represents aggrieved VW owners and shareholders on both sides of the Atlantic.
Wednesday's fine was not included in the 25.8 billion euros of provisions that VW set aside for the diesel cheating scandal, and would hit earnings, analysts at Evercore ISI said. 
Volkswagen said it held a management board meeting to discuss the latest development in its emissions crisis with members of the supervisory board also being informed.
Further steps would be taken to overcome the diesel cheating scandal and to restore trust in the company, Diess said.
Finance chief Frank Witter will update investors on Aug. 1 on the implications of the fine for the carmaker's cash position, alongside its second-quarter results, VW said.

""Paying out 1 billion euros is extreme painful but in the broader context it isn't a material number,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said, citing VW's 24.3 billion-euro net cash position after the first quarter.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",Madoff customers' recovery tops 75 percent with Merkin settlement,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The court-appointed trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff's firm on Wednesday announced a $280 million settlement with one of the swindler's earliest investors, enabling customers to recoup more than 75 percent of the principal they lost.
The accord with hedge fund manager Ezra Merkin also resolved claims against Ascot Partners LP, a ""feeder fund"" he ran that sent customers' money to Madoff, often without their knowledge, as well as his management company Gabriel Capital Corp.
Upon receiving court approval, the accord would boost recoveries for former customers of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (BLMIS) LLC to $13.26 billion.
That is nearly 76 percent of the $17.5 billion that the trustee Irving Picard said was wiped out in Madoff's fraud, which was uncovered in December 2008. A New York state judge appointed a receiver for Ascot the following July.
""Mr. Merkin is pleased that the receiver has settled the trustee's lawsuit on terms that will result in a significant recovery for Ascot's investors,"" Merkin's lawyer Andrew Levander said in a statement.
The settlement allows Ascot to file a claim in the Madoff firm's liquidation. But any payouts must go to its investors, not to Merkin, who also lost money with Madoff.
In a filing in Manhattan bankruptcy court, Picard's lawyers called the settlement ""a fair and reasonable compromise of the trustee's claims against the defendants and the related customer claim against the BLMIS estate.""
Merkin in June 2012 had reached a separate $410 million settlement with Eric Schneiderman, then New York's attorney general.
Schneiderman accused Merkin of ""recklessly"" feeding $2.4 billion of investor cash to Madoff, while falsely claiming he had been actively managing the money.
Picard challenged that settlement, saying it infringed his right to recoup money for Madoff customers. But U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said the trustee took too long to get involved.
Schneiderman's predecessor Andrew Cuomo, now New York's governor, had sued Merkin in April 2009.
Feeder fund investors normally cannot recoup money from Picard's efforts because they did not invest directly with Madoff.
A separate, more than $4 billion fund created by the U.S. government allows recoveries by such investors. Roughly $1.28 billion has been distributed from that fund.
Madoff, 80, pleaded guilty to fraud in March 2009 and is serving a 150-year prison sentence.

PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) boss Carlos Ghosn faces another nail-biting salary vote when the French government, the carmaker's largest shareholder, is expected to oppose his 7.4 million euro ($8.7 million) 2017 payout at Friday's annual shareholder meeting.
Ghosn, who lost a vote on pay in 2016, is also up for renewal as chairman and CEO for another four-year term in which he has pledged to pursue closer consolidation with alliance partners Nissan (T:7201) and Mitsubishi (T:7211).
The French state holds a 15 percent Renault stake with double voting rights, capped at 18-20 percent for votes on remuneration and other ordinary business.
The Renault-Nissan chief, 64, secured government support for his renewal - likely to overcome some investor misgivings over his accumulation of senior roles - after agreeing to cut this year's overall pay package by about 30 percent.
But the government has told Renault it will oppose Ghosn's 2017 pay, in line with its policy, company and official sources said, raising the prospect of a second negative vote in two years. French ""say on pay"" votes have become binding since the last rejection.
This time Ghosn may squeak through with the backing of influential proxy advisor ISS, which recommended in a May 22 report that shareholders back a 2017 package that ""does not raise any significant concern"". Early investor soundings suggest razor-thin majority support at the June 15 meeting.
However, Paris-based Proxinvest, another advisory firm, recommended a ""no"" vote on grounds that Ghosn's additional 9.2 million euros in Nissan pay was poorly disclosed and bonuses too high. ""The pay structure remains defective"", it said.
A Renault spokesman declined to comment.
A surprise rejection could cancel Ghosn's 1.45 million euro variable pay and affect 4.6 million euros in long-term performance shares, despite record Renault earnings last year. That would deal a significant blow to the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance's main architect just as he explores politically sensitive tie-up options.
Renault currently owns 43.4 percent of Japanese affiliate Nissan, which in turn holds 34 percent of Mitsubishi and 15 percent of Renault but no voting rights in its French parent.
MULTIPLE ROLES
Besides heading Renault, Ghosn serves as chairman of all three carmakers and is described as CEO of their expanding alliance, piloted by a Dutch-registered management company with no direct shareholder oversight or independent administrators - a sore point for some investors.
Government backing will likely be enough to secure Ghosn's renewal despite negative voting recommendations from ISS and Proxinvest, which both oppose the combining of chairman and CEO roles.
In a letter urging Renault shareholders to approve Ghosn's new term, lead independent director Philippe Lagayette and two other longstanding board members cited his ""track record of high performance"" and increased operational delegation to Thierry Bollore, recently promoted to chief operating officer.
And with the pay vote looking tight, the carmaking alliance brought forward its annual synergies disclosure - usually made in July - to announce 5.7 billion euros in performance savings for 2017, a 14 percent year-on-year gain.
""Deeper convergence and increased synergies will cement the sustainability of the alliance for the long term,"" Ghosn said in the companies' statement.

(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. homebuilders dropped on Wednesday after data showed mortgage applications decreased in the latest week, at a time when concerns of a slowdown in the housing industry is already worrying investors.
Shares of D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI),  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN), PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM),  Toll Brothers  Inc (N:TOL) fell about 4 percent while those of KB Home (N:KBH) and  Meritage Homes Corp  (N:MTH) fell about 5 percent, ahead of a Federal Reserve statement widely expected to raise interest rates.
The Fed has raised rates three times last year and once this year.
U.S. mortgage applications decreased 1.5 percent in the week ended June 8 as 30-year home borrowing costs rose to near seven-year peaks prompted by a selloff in the U.S. bond market, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.
A shortage in supply of homes has already been steadily lifting home prices, in turn dampening affordability, especially for the first time buyers who form a significant chunk of the housing market.
""Home affordability in a lot of U.S. markets is already at levels where there is some concern (among investors). When you add in higher interest rates that can add to that,"" Morningstar analyst Brian Bernard said.
An increase in lumber costs as well as that of land and labor is also a concern - spurring a prolonged squeeze on profit margins that is forcing builders to increase home prices.
""New home orders are not breaking new highs, which may lead to lower revenue growth for homebuilders in second half of 2018 and 2019,"" CFRA analyst Ken Leon wrote in note published last week, adding that the spring selling season was off to a weak start.
However, analysts remain bullish on demand for new homes as mortgage rates hover around historical lows and job market improves.

822,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Etihad Airways in talks to cancel, defer Boeing 777X orders - sources","By Alexander Cornwell and Stanley Carvalho
DUBAI/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Etihad Airways is exploring options with Boeing (NYSE:BA) to cancel or defer orders for 777X jets worth billions of dollars in a fresh sign of the carrier's financial strains and potentially squeezing Boeing's newest model, four sources familiar with the matter said.
Etihad, owned by Abu Dhabi, has been reviewing its fleet plans as part of a strategy overhaul launched after a nearly $2 billion loss in 2016.
The airline's management believes it no longer needs all of the 25 777X twin-engined jets and may be willing to incur penalties for cancellations rather than be saddled with future recurring losses stemming from overcapacity, the sources said.
Etihad and Boeing declined to comment.
Etihad is a launch customer of the 777X: an upgrade to Boeing's successful mini-jumbo series that includes plans for the world's largest twin-engined jetliner, the 406-seat 777-9 which is due to enter service in 2020.
Cancelling or deferring orders for jets earmarked for production at such an early stage of the ambitious new program could create a headache for Boeing as it switches to the new model.
Although twinjets like the 777X have prevailed over larger and less-efficient four-engined aircraft like the A380 and Boeing 747, analysts say demand for such aircraft remains relatively thin due to cost and size. The 777-9 version has a list price of $426 million.
SHRINKING BUSINESS
Finding alternative airlines to fill Etihad's production slots in time for the launch phase may not be easy, they say, though Boeing has said it is confident in demand for the 777X and that development of the plane is on schedule.
Rivals Emirates and Qatar Airways are also launch customers of the 777X, whose features include a sleek new wing with folding wingtips to allow it to fit in parking stands.
Other buyers include Cathay Pacific (HK:0293), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), Japan's ANA (T:9202) Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL). Turkish Airlines (IS:THYAO) has also expressed interest.
Few details of the fleet review have been made public but Etihad's new Group Chief Executive Tony Douglas said in April it aimed to develop in ""a sustainable way"".
The airline has been shrinking its business, including cutting routes and retiring some aircraft without replacements.
Reuters reported in May that planemakers were preparing for possible changes to dozens of plane orders from Etihad as it pressed ahead with its review.
It remains unclear to what extent suppliers will be willing to accommodate such requests, with the Gulf making up a significant portion of wide-body jet demand.
Etihad has outstanding orders worth tens of billions of dollars for over 160 Airbus and Boeing aircraft, including the new 777Xs.
The bulk of the aircraft were ordered when Etihad was pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy to keep pace with Emirates and Qatar Airways.
Etihad said then that under the agreements with Airbus and Boeing it could transfer orders to airlines it had invested in. 

But the airline investment strategy seemingly collapsed last year when minority-owned Air Berlin and Alitalia filed for insolvency. Etihad currently holds stakes in four other airlines, half as many as it once held.

LONDON (Reuters) - Trading in European shares was hesitant on Wednesday as investors awaited guidance from the Federal Reserve on future U.S. interest rate rises, while  Inditex  rose after results and  Just Eat  was bruised by intensifying competition.
Benchmarks barely budged, with all the action at the stock level. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) ended up 0.2 percent while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) added 0.4 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) ended flat. 
Just Eat (L:JE) fell 4.7 percent as investors priced in heightened competition after rival Deliveroo said it would let restaurants use their own riders for orders placed through its app.
Inditex (MC:ITX) rose 3.5 percent after the world's biggest clothing retailer reported improved first-quarter profitability despite the dampening impact of a strong euro.
Shares in the owner of fashion brand Zara had opened lower on profit taking and concerns around the quality of its results but later recovered with traders citing strong sales of its summer collections. 
Tech stocks (SX8P) were the best-performing, up 1.7 percent after shares in Dutch fintech firm  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN_w) rocketed up 90 percent in its first day of trading following an initial public offering.
Peers also involved with payments processing technology got a boost.  Ingenico  (PA:INGC) led the way with a 6.7 percent gain, while Wirecard (DE:WDIG) also rose 3.7 percent. 
Dixons Carphone (L:DC) shares fell 2.7 percent after the company announced a data breach in which 1.2 million records of non-financial personal information had been accessed.
Paris airports operator ADP (PA:ADP) rose 6 percent after the government said it would prepare the legal ground for a sale of some of its corporate assets.
Overall European equities have been searching for direction and are around flat for the year so far. 
""I would expect a lateral, flat market from now through the summer with some rotation,"" said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor SIM. 
""Cyclicals have been the best year to date so I would expect some recovery from the staples.""
In regional benchmarks, Italy maintained its outperformance with a 0.4 percent gain after the country's new EU affairs minister Paolo Savona said the euro was ""indispensable"".

""Now we are seeing that all the interviews made by politicians are going in the right direction,"" said Meda.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Wine shipments from Pernod Ricard's (PA:PERP) Australian business have been held up at Chinese ports, two sources told Reuters, the first foreign company to be harmed by a deterioration in relations between Australia and China.
Six Australian wine companies have faced delays at Chinese customs since Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull complained of Chinese political interference late last year, straining ties between the two trading partners, a senior government official said this month. 
The listed French company  Pernod Ricard  owns the big-selling Australian wine brand Jacob's Creek. 
Australia has accused China of meddling in its domestic affairs and is introducing foreign interference laws. China has denied any such activity.
""Pernod Ricard through its ownership of Jacob's Creek has been impacted by China's restrictions,"" said a government source briefed on the issue, who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to talk to the media. 
Pernod Ricard's head office in France acknowledged that there had been an impact but declined to go into details. 
""We experienced some delays in China and we are actively working to resolve the issue,"" a spokesman said. ""Our business performance in the country is not impacted by this minor incident.""
In recent months,  Treasury Wine Estates Ltd  (AX:TWE) and McWilliams Wines disclosed they were experiencing problems at Chinese customs. 
They and Pernod Ricard joined several other companies for an emergency meeting with government officials last week, a government source said, to urge the government to break the impasse with China over trade restrictions. 
China's customs have not responded to faxes requesting comment on the Australian complaints of delays. 
Pernod Ricard, which manufactures and sells various alcoholic drinks including Absolut Vodka and Martell cognac, does not publish sales records of Jacob's Creek wines to China. 
But this month, it said China accounted for about 9 percent of its global sales of 9 billion euros ($10.57 billion). 

The Chinese delays have cast a shadow over an otherwise golden period for Australian wine exports, which are forecast to be worth more than A$1 billion in 2018, government figures show, compared with A$848 million ($641.43 million) last year.

831,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 12:27PM ET</span>","H&R Block's heavy investments to weigh on future profits, shares sink","(Reuters) - Shares of H&R Block Inc (N:HRB) fell as much as 21 percent on Wednesday, after the tax preparer said it expected profit margins to shrink as it invests heavily in technology to lure clients who do their own taxes.
H&R, which helps corporations and individuals prepare their tax filings, might also see fewer clients using its services because the recent tax overhaul has made it simpler for people to file their taxes.
The company is investing heavily in technology, changing pricing plans and will consolidate 400 offices to cut costs.
Analysts believed it would take several years for those initiatives to take hold.
""H&R's spend could be multi-year and visibility into payback metrics on the initiatives appears low currently,"" said Hamzah Mazari, an analyst with Macquarie in a note entitled 'The good, the bad and the outlook'.
On a post-earnings conference call on Tuesday, the company said it expects full-year 2019 EBITDA margin to be between 24 percent and 26 percent, down from 29.8 percent in 2018.
The company also sees revenue of between $3.05 billion and $3.1 billion in 2019, down from $3.16 billion it earned in 2018.
The outlook overshadowed the company's better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, typically the busiest period for tax preparers due to the U.S. tax filing deadline.
""Given a volatile track record of results and lack of visibility into if management's initiatives will pay off, our expectations come down,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s Thomas Allen said in a note.

Shares of the company were down 19 percent at $23.93 in morning trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks across the globe wavered on Wednesday on fears of trade tensions and questions about U.S. interest rates, while lower-than-expected inventory data sent oil prices into the black after morning losses.
Investors are awaiting the U.S. Federal Reserve's 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) decision on monetary policy, with the year's second interest rate hike almost certain. 
But market participants are keen to know how many times the Fed will raise rates in 2018, with market pricing ""fairly split between three and four hikes,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid wrote in a note to clients.
Amid the uncertainty, Wall Street opened slightly firmer, buoyed by a jump in media stocks after Tuesday's court ruling allowing AT&T's $85 billion take over of  Time Warner  - a move expected to trigger a wave of corporate mergers. 
Shares of the HBO channel owner (N:TWX) jumped about 3 percent after the approval, while AT&T (N:T) dropped 1.6 percent.
Overall, stock markets were moving up, but tepidly.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) rose 0.19 percent, and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS), which has been stagnating near one-month highs for about a week, gained 0.09 percent.
Equity markets are ""finding it difficult to make upward progress despite reasonably good economic data"", said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
Along with the Fed and other key central bank policy meetings this week, fresh fears of protectionism are weighing on stocks and currencies as the U.S. prepares to unveil more tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Emerging market stocks lost 0.37 percent, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) closed 0.58 percent lower. 
Trade tensions pressured the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, which gained 0.46 and 0.35 percent, respectively, versus the greenback.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of others, fell 0.2 percent, with the euro (EUR=) up 0.29 percent to $1.1777.
CRUDE INVENTORY LOWER
Oil prices, which had started the day in the red, rose after a report by the Energy Information Administration indicated U.S. crude inventories fell more than anticipated last week and while gasoline and distillate stocks surprised with unexpected declines.
U.S. crude  was up 0.36 percent to $66.60 per barrel and Brent  was last at $76.36, up 0.63 percent on the day. Gasoline futures (RBc1) were up 1.1 percent to $2.1124 a gallon.
""You tend to want to see draws in gasoline early in the summer with driving season, and this is the first number that actually does that ... in three weeks,"" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. 
In government bonds, U.S. Treasury yields were flat on Wednesday, moving in narrow ranges, with investors firmly focused on the Fed meeting.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.9535 percent, from 2.957 percent late on Tuesday.

Italian government bonds were in demand, as well, after Paolo Savona, the country's new EU Affairs Minister, said the euro was ""indispensable."" 
The comments by Savona, who has previously expressed hostile views on the euro, followed statements earlier in the week by Italy's new coalition government that it had no plans to leave the euro zone.

In another reminder of the danger of trade disputes, shares in Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE Corp (HK:0763) fell as much as 41.5 percent, wiping $3 billion off its market value, as it resumed trade after agreeing to pay up to $1.4 billion in penalties to the U.S. government.

841,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 11:46AM ET</span>",Italian bond market cheers as Savona calls euro 'indispensable',"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Italy's borrowing costs dropped sharply on Wednesday after its new European Union Affairs Minister Paolo Savona said the euro was ""indispensable"", helping to bolster demand at a government bond auction.
The country sold 5.63 billion euros of bonds against a planned issuance range of 4.25-5.75 billion euros, though the borrowing costs were still the highest since before the European Central Bank began its 2.55 trillion euro bond-buying scheme.
Savona has previously expressed hostile views on the euro, and the 81-year-old's proposed appointment as economy minister for the anti-establishment coalition last month provoked a market selloff. President Sergio Mattarella vetoed his appointment to that role but he later took the EU affairs portfolio.
At a meeting with foreign press on Tuesday, Savona stressed he fully backed the euro and did not want to prepare for Italy to quit the single currency. 
This soothed worries about the euro membership of the bloc's third largest economy under the coalition of the 5-Star Movement and the League. 
""It wouldn't be a surprise for other people in the government to make these comments, but from him it's significant,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Christoph Rieger. ""Perhaps they are recognizing that they can get more out of the EU if they at least commit to certain key principles."" 
The yield on Italy's two-year government bond (IT2YT=RR), the asset through which market fears about any Italian currency redenomination and debt default have largely played out, dropped well below 1 percent and was last down 5 basis points at 0.83 percent.
This is below where it started the week -- 1.13 percent -- and far from a peak two weeks ago of 2.73 percent when the market concerns were at their most intense. 
Italy's 10-year government bond yield (IT10YT=RR) was 5 bps lower at 2.82 percent, while the closely-watched spread over German yields was at 235 basis points, well below the 268 bps level at the start of the week. (DE10IT10=RR) 
Rieger warned that words alone would not be enough to keep Italian borrowing costs lower in the long term, particularly given the high-spending plans of the government. 
""In the longer term they need to do something different to bring the deficit under control, not just pay lip service toward the euro,"" he said. 
Other euro zone bond yields were flat to 3 basis points lower as data showed euro zone industrial production fell in April.
But investors are largely hesitating to take any strong views before two key central bank meetings. The U.S. Federal Reserve ends its policy meeting later on Wednesday while the European Central Bank meets on Thursday. 
""The Fed meeting tonight is a big factor and Treasury yields could have an overriding impact on European bond markets from tomorrow,"" said ING strategist Martin van Vliet. 

The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond (DE10YT=RR), the benchmark for the region, was down 1.5 bps at 0.48 percent though some others, such as the French equivalent (FR10YT=RR), were as much as 4 bps lower.

Oberbank signed a deal with Iran in September, enabling it to finance new ventures there. It was one of the first European banks to do so since Tehran struck a nuclear deal with six major powers in 2015 and many sanctions were lifted. 
However, the outlook has changed after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the pact last month and said he would reimpose sanctions.
Although the European Union signatories have said they want to keep the deal in place, many companies have voiced their concern over the increased risk of conducting business in Iran.
""Oberbank has supported numerous clients and their Iran business in the past two years,"" Oberbank said on its website. ""The threat posed to European companies by U.S. secondary sanctions is forcing us to retreat.""
The lender had already taken the precautionary measure of placing its Iranian financing projects on hold. It now says that transactions and letters of credit related to Iran will be provided exclusively for contracts signed before May 8.
The bank said it advises its customers to conclude Iran-related transactions promptly and that payments are likely to be impossible from Nov. 4.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 11:15AM ET</span>",Bankers to ask Theresa May why they should stay after Brexit,"By Andrew MacAskill and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The bosses of some of Europe's biggest banks will ask Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday to give them a reason to stay in the City of London after Brexit now that hopes are fading for a generous EU trade deal.
May will dine with bank and insurance chiefs who are members of the European Financial Services Round Table and discussions could shed light on what the government wants from Europe for financial services. This group includes banks and insurers from around Europe, such as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  Barclays  (L:BARC) and  Aviva  (L:AV).
Barclays' Chairman John McFarlane is hosting the dinner near the Houses of Parliament where executives will push May and finance minister Philip Hammond for details of their financial services plans. 
""We are expecting her to make a statement about why we should stay here,"" said one executive who will be attend. ""We need clarity, they are not thinking enough about sector and we need to change that."" 
Brexit poses the biggest challenge to the City of London's finance industry since the 2007-2009 financial crisis as it could mean banks and insurers will lose access to the EU, the world's biggest trading bloc.
For months the government, financial regulators and major banks in Britain have been unified in backing a ""mutual recognition"" blueprint for two-way market access after Britain leaves the EU next March.
This involves Britain and the EU accepting the broad thrust of each other's rules, a flexible but largely untested approach in trade compared with the bloc's current more narrow and demanding mechanism for granting foreign companies access to its markets.
But facing scepticism from Brussels, senior financial executives now say they no longer believe that mutual recognition is realistic, casting a shadow over Britain's biggest economic sector.
Reuters spoke to senior executives at 12 of the largest banks in London, including the five biggest British banks, and found not one of them privately thought the plan would ever be accepted by the EU. They are resigned to a deal that will give more limited access.
""I don't know anyone who really thinks this has a realistic chance, the EU has made it clear they won't accept it. It is now time to be more realistic about what we can negotiate,"" a senior executive at one of Britain's biggest banks said.
If the finance industry does abandon mutual recognition this would mark its second major climb-down. Banks have already given up on efforts to keep full ""passporting"" in financial services that they currently enjoy as part of Britain's EU membership.
Against this uncertain backdrop, banks, insurers and asset managers, have been moving activities and hundreds of staff from London to new EU hubs to they can ensure continuity with customers when Britain leaves the EU in March, irrespective of the trading terms agreed with Brussels.
ALMIGHTY ROW
Britain is due to publish a white paper formally setting out what sort of future trading terms it wants with Europe - and this should signal to bankers if mutual recognition is still the preferred option.
A banking industry official said there appeared to be an ""almighty row"" over the wording covering financial services in the white paper, suggesting that the proposal will be ""far less ambitious than mutual recognition"".
Bankers are also toning down talk of mutual recognition, saying that it was outcomes rather than terminology that mattered.
One senior executive said it was not clear if the government was still willing to back the proposal.
A government document on its EU proposals for a financial services deal published last month failed to mention mutual recognition.
""Part of the problem for the City is that the government hasn't come clean yet. Until you know what the government settles for, it's difficult for the City to move forward,"" the executive said.
The mutual recognition blueprint was drawn up by TheCityUK, which promotes Britain's financial services sector, and banking lobby UK Finance.
They persuaded the government to back the idea as a template that could be included in a bespoke UK trade deal with Europe.
But finance industry officials say banks have painted themselves into a corner and are unable to ditch the blueprint until there are signs the government has moved away from it.
""TheCityUK and UK Finance came up with this mutual recognition idea and sold it to the government as doable, but the EU has said it's crazy,"" said Graham Bishop, a consultant who has advised EU institutions on financial services.
""The City is now afraid of saying it's not feasible so nobody senior in financial services is prepared to say its unworkable."" 
TheCityUK said mutual recognition remains the best option currently on the table, while UK Finance said it could be implemented based on trust built up between UK and EU regulators over decades.
But financial services companies without an EU base may now have to fall back on the EU's current market access system known as equivalence, which banks and the British government have already rejected as unworkable.
Under equivalence, only Brussels would grant market access unlike mutual recognition in which Britain and Brussels would both have a say.

""The majority of clients think equivalence is most likely as the EU side has been very clear,"" said John Liver, a partner at EY which is advising banks on Brexit issues.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest advertising agency WPP (L:WPP) faced a shareholder revolt on Wednesday over its handling of the departure of former CEO Martin Sorrell, who quit under a cloud but is still entitled to share awards worth millions.
The most famous advertising executive in the world, Sorrell left the marketing giant he built from scratch following an allegation of personal misconduct in April. 
In a sign of investor concern, nearly 30 percent of WPP shareholders failed to back the group's executive pay proposal at its annual meeting, while almost 17 percent of shareholder votes declined to support the re-election of Roberto Quarta as chairman.
Under Quarta's watch, Sorrell, 73, was allowed to leave with share awards worth millions of pounds intact and without a non-compete clause.
The departure of one of Britain's best known businessmen has rekindled arguments that have dogged previous WPP annual meetings - that WPP paid Sorrell too much and did not prepare for his succession.
The nature of the complaint against Sorrell has not been disclosed by either Sorrell or the company. Sorrell - who has already launched a new venture - has denied any wrongdoing, and the chairman said there was nothing more he could say on the issue. 
""I know that questions remain, but there is simply nothing further we can legally disclose,"" Quarta said at the start of a meeting that lasted little more than an hour. 
NEW HEART
Trying to refocus the meeting on the future of the business, Quarta told investors that the hunt for a new chief executive was well advanced and moving ahead rapidly. 
As well as anger about Sorrell, investors also had questions about the group's strategy after performance disappointed in 2017, when it delivered its worst annual sales performance since the financial crisis.
The two chief operating officers currently running WPP, Mark Read and Andrew Scott, are reviewing its strategy, and Read, seen as the leading candidate to replace Sorrell, said he was confident about the future.
""I think the business can succeed without him (Sorrell),"" Read said.
""People inside the company have every confidence that we can do that. We need to find a new beating heart for the group,"" he told investors. 
TRADING IMPROVES 
WPP is the world's largest ad group, employing more than 200,000 staff in agencies including JWT, Ogilvy and Finsbury to serve clients such as Ford,  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) and P&G.
The group has recently been hit by the might of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in online advertising, the advance of consultants like Accenture in the sector and by pressures on big ad spenders such as P&G and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) which have all hit the bottom line. 
But in a trading update published to coincide with the annual meeting, WPP reported four-month net sales which were marginally up, an improvement on the 0.1 percent fall in net sales in the first quarter.
Liberum analysts said the improvement should give investors confidence that the company can meet its guidance for flat sales and margins this year. 
""The statement today should reassure that this is more than achievable especially as WPP is expecting a pick-up in the second half and the comparisons, particularly in North America, get easier,"" they said in a note.
WPP shares were little changed at 12.45 pounds at 1310 GMT, having gained an initial boost from the update. 
MIXED VIEWS
Quarta defended the company's response to the allegation against Sorrell, saying it was robust from a governance and legal perspective.
While he accepted criticism from investors over future share awards due to Sorrell, he noted that these pre-dated the current board's involvement.
It is not the first time investors have expressed opposition to WPP's pay proposals. Sorrell has earned around 200 million pounds ($268 million) in the last five years alone, and in 2016, a third of WPP's investors refused to back his 70 million pound pay package. 
Sorrell's last award scheme could potentially pay out 20 million pounds, but it is expected to come in well below that due to the recent underperformance of the group. 
Nearly every question asked at the meeting, which was packed with shareholders, was about Sorrell and his departure, and not everyone was critical.
One investor asked why the chairman hadn't started by leading a tribute to a man who had built the company from scratch.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Wednesday Dhivya Suryadevara, currently vice president of corporate finance, will succeed Chuck Stevens on Sept. 1 as chief financial officer of the No. 1 U.S. automaker. 
Suryadevara, 39, has played an integral role in some significant deals GM has made as it has restructured operations over the past several years, including the divestiture of the company's European arm Opel and the acquisition of self-driving vehicle startup Cruise. She played a role in securing earlier this month a $2.25 billion investment in GM Cruise by Japanese tech giant SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), GM said in a statement.
During her 13 years with the Detroit-based company, Suryadevara helped achieve ratings upgrades from all three credit ratings agencies, completed $2 billion in notes issuance to fund discretionary pension contributions and upsized and renewed GM's $14.5 billion revolving credit facility, the company said.
She was named vice president, corporate finance, in July 2017, a job that included overseeing investor relations. 
Stevens will remain with the company as an adviser until his retirement in March, the company said. Stevens has worked at GM for 40 years and became CFO in January 2014. 
""We expect a smooth transition and status quo on the strategy,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) sees second-quarter markets revenue coming in ""flattish"" compared to a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said on Wednesday.
Speaking at an investors conference, Gerspach said the equities portion of total markets revenue will likely be stronger than that from fixed income and commodities trading.
His outlook for markets revenue was similar to assessments given two weeks ago by executives of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (N:BAC)
Gerspach also said the company could see more cost savings in its consumer banking operations in 2019 and 2020 than executives had projected in July 2017 at the bank's investor meeting. ""In consumer, there is likely to be some upside,"" he said.
""More and more customers, they really want to interact with us digitally from mobile platforms,"" which reduces the cost to serve accounts, he said.

Citigroup has said it will use a smartphone app to offer ""national digital banking"" accounts to expand its reach beyond the six cities in the United States where it has branches.

Citigroup in March put restrictions on new retail business clients that sell guns to require that customers pass background checks after the deadly Parkland, Florida high school shooting, drawing the ire of the U.S. gun lobby. 
""Recent news reports indicate that the Commissioner 'castigat (ed) them for straying into social policy' while 'glowering and speaking emphatically' about guns,"" the senators said in a letter.
""Most concerning are reports that Commissioner Piwowar delivered a 'thinly veiled threat' by suggesting that the Commission would withhold support for Citigroup’s regulatory request due to the company's unrelated and entirely lawful corporate practices relating to firearms.""
The SEC did not immediately return a request for comment.
The letter was signed by Democratic Senators Chris Van Hollen, Kamala Harris, Christopher Murphy, Richard Blumenthal, Robert Menendez and Dianne Feinstein. 
Weeks after Citigroup's decision, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said it would no longer lend to companies that make military-style firearms for civilians. The banks soon came under attack from Gun Owners of America and the National Rifle Association. 
Piwowar made the ""troubling remarks"" to Citigroup executives during an April 24 meeting to discuss derivatives regulation, according to the letter, released by Van Hollen's office.

""While we are not advocating for or taking a position on the regulatory matter that was the subject of the meeting, we do have concerns that Commissioner Piwowar may have abused his government position in an attempt to unduly influence Citigroup to reverse a business decision that conflicts with his personal and political views,"" it said.

The sheer fact that the hike has been so well telegraphed by the Fed suggests that market moves will be minimal. But that won't necessarily apply to bank stocks, which have historically moved 1.3% on Federal Open Market Committee meetings, according to Goldman Sachs data.
In fact, Goldman has studied price fluctuations around FOMC meetings over the past seven years and found that traders of bank stocks are woefully unprepared for the volatility that may ensue.
The chart below shows this dynamic in play. It compares the total return for exchange-traded funds tracking financial firms in the S&P 500 and the KBW Bank indexes and finds that both have underperformed over the past two months, controlling for moves in macro assets.
Coupled with its findings around FOMC-driven volatility, Goldman concludes that investors are underestimating the possibility of a relief rally in financial stocks — particularly banks. It makes sense when you consider that higher interest rates are widely expected to boost interest income for banks, which then filters down to their respective bottom lines.
So what's a trader to do? Take long positions on large-cap US banks, Goldman recommends.
""Based on the significant underperformance over the past month in the XLF and BKX, it appears investors have broadly exited positions in large-cap financials,"" a group of Goldman strategists wrote in a client note on Tuesday, before the start of the two-day meeting. ""Bank investors are underpositioned ahead of FOMC."""

Cable network owner Discovery Inc saw shares increase 3.2 percent while mobile providers, Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc, which are waiting for a government approval of their own, also saw a bump following the decision.
AT&T said that controlling Time Warner's cable brands will help it craft new types of content to retain its customers as web-based rivals like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) woo audiences away from traditional pay-TV subscriptions. 
For cable companies feeling the pain of cord-cutting, similar deals for coveted media brands could help them build out new content offerings and offset expected declines in revenues, analysts and dealmakers told Reuters. 
The Justice Department had argued that AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner would allow it to charge premium prices to rivals who relied on its Turner and HBO channels to woo customers to their cable plans, potentially giving it an unfair advantage in the pay-TV market. Now this will be a less of a concern for companies. 
""This decision could serve as a 'green light' for other potential M&A, including Comcast's ongoing pursuit of FOX,"" said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS, in a note. 
Regulators will still likely scrutinize similar deals, and there is no guarantee that the district court's approval of AT&T's merger with Time Warner means that other major media acquisitions would be approved, several antitrust attorneys told Reuters. 
Still, at least one company, Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, had been waiting for the court decision before making any large M&A moves in media, sources have said.
Rival cable company Comcast is now likely to go ahead with its planned attempt to woo Fox away from Walt Disney Co, which said it would acquire most assets of the media company for around $50 billion last year. 
""Regardless of what happens on the appeal front, expect Comcast to put forth an all-cash bid in the next day or so at a premium to Disney,"" said Mary Ann Halford, senior adviser to OC&C Strategy Consultants.
Comcast is aiming to gain control over Fox assets such as its Twentieth Century Fox Film and TV studios, which includes brands ranging from X-Men to The Simpsons, as well many of its cable networks.
The court ruling could also open the door for Verizon, AT&T'S main rival, to bid for a media company, UBS' Hodulik added. 
However, in Verizon's most recent quarterly earnings call, executives said they would rather sit out the current consolidation, and instead build out its content offerings through partnerships with independent media companies. 
It also appointed a new chief executive officer earlier this month, Hans Vestberg, the company's chief technology officer, in a move that signaled Verizon would likely double down on its existing telecommunications business.
Still, one potential target for Verizon would be a combined CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom Inc, analysts have said, assuming that on ongoing legal battle between CBS's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, and the company's board, is resolved.
In a recent court filing, Redstone said her long-term plan was to create a combined company, which would unite media assets including CBS' broadcast networks, Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, and then sell it. 

Halford, from OC&C added, ""All I know is that this will be a blockbuster summer for media mergers!""

868,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Growing Islamic finance firms lobby Britain for tax relief,"By Bernardo Vizcaino
(Reuters) - Firms involved in Islamic finance are lobbying the British government for tax reforms, arguing that the treatment of some sharia-compliant structures is hindering their growth.
Britain has actively pursued Islamic finance to become the Western world's biggest hub for it and banks are now seeking to ensure tax parity in areas such as mortgage refinancing as they compete head-on with their conventional peers.
Islamic finance forbids interest payments and transactions often require multiple title transfers of underlying assets, which can trigger double or even triple tax charges.
More than 20 firms, including Gatehouse Bank, Bank of London and The Middle East , Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (AD:ADIB) and Qatar Islamic Bank (AD:QISB), offer Islamic financial products in Britain.
The country has previously addressed the adverse tax treatment for Islamic bonds and residential mortgages, helping Islamic banking assets reach more than $5 billion pounds in 2016, while London has attracted over 65 listings of Islamic bonds worth a combined $48 billion, lobby group TheCityUK said.
But this has created concerns over refinancing mortgages or switching them from a conventional to an Islamic bank, which can trigger capital gains taxes, said Samir Alamad, head of sharia compliance and product development at Birmingham-based Al Rayan Bank, which is owned by Qatar's Masraf Al Rayan (QA:MARK).
""This is the more pressing issue as it is affecting Islamic banks and their customers,"" said Alamad, one of those lobbying British tax authorities. Taxes on investment property and commercial finance also need clarification, he added.
In the short term, the government could amend the Finance Act, but a longer-term solution may require a broad framework to address all types of Islamic transactions, Alamad said.
MATTER OF TIME?
The British tax authority, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, told Reuters it wanted to ensure that tax consequences of refinancing Islamic mortgages are not disadvantageous when compared to standard mortgages and that work was ongoing.
The Chartered Institute of Taxation, a British professional body, has also presented a submission to authorities which some think could open the way to change on Islamic finance.
""It may only be a matter of time before current legislation is amended to provide further express reliefs and clarity,"" said Imam Qazi, partner and Islamic finance lead at law firm Foot Anstey.
Taxation is becoming more pressing because their product range has expanded and now includes savings accounts, home purchase plans, a pension scheme and business start-up financing, said Qazi.
Gatehouse recently introduced buy-to-let finance and plans to offer home owner finance through brokers, Qazi said.
Rosette Merchant Bank, a sharia-compliant firm, plans to diversify its client base beyond the Gulf to tap southeast Asian markets such as Malaysia, said chief executive Sam Broadhead.
The firm closed around 200 million pounds of investment deals in the past 12 months, he said.
""We are looking to expand outside our core real estate offering into other innovative sharia-compliant investment areas, for example a fintech supply chain finance solution and several capital markets projects.""
Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank is working on a new home finance product, while Bank of London and The Middle East is expanding its wealth management business.
There are concerns that future changes could also have an impact on the sector.
The government's 2017 budget has proposed changes starting from 2019 to the tax status of non-resident investors and the way they are taxed on real estate disposals.
Law firm Ashurst says such changes could affect many Middle East Islamic investors who buy into real estate through unit trusts and offshore funds.

869,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",UK proposes governance code for private companies after BHS collapse,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's accounting watchdog has proposed its first code to improve how big unlisted companies run themselves and pay top executives, acting on lessons learned from the collapse of retailer BHS.
After the collapse of BHS in 2016 the British government called on the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) to put together corporate governance code for private businesses that make up the bulk of the country's companies but are not covered by the FRC regulations that apply to their big listed counterparts.
James Wates, head of family-owned construction company Wates Group, chaired a panel that has come up with six principles that the FRC put out to public consultation on Wednesday.
""Private companies are a significant contributor to the UK economy, providing tax revenue and employing millions of people,"" Wates said in a statement.
""They have a significant impact on people’s lives, and it is important they are well-governed and transparent about how they operate.""
While the code for listed companies is focused on how shareholders are treated, the proposed code for private companies looks at broader issues, such as the treatment of staff and other stakeholders such as suppliers.
The principles include promoting executive pay structures that contribute to the long-term success of a company, taking into account pay and conditions elsewhere in the business.
""A board has a responsibility to oversee meaningful engagement with material stakeholders, including the workforce, and have regard to that discussion when taking decisions,"" the Wates proposals say.
The new code will go live next January on a so-called ""apply and explain"" basis, targeting businesses with more than 2,000 staff or turnover above 200 million pounds ($267 million) and a balance sheet of more than 2 billion pounds.
A company that adopts the principles is expected to apply them fully, the consultation document said.
""I am under no illusion that these principles will cure all the ills in the business world,"" Wates said. ""These principles are about fundamental aspects of business leadership and performance, which every company must interpret and apply for itself.""
Separately, Britain's Investment Association (IA) trade body for investment managers called for a single authority to be responsible for punishing errant company directors.
The IA said the current fragmented system of company director sanctions should be replaced with a single body to provide better scrutiny over punishment for rule and code breaches.
""The current system of sanctions is fragmented between many different authorities, and often directors are only sanctioned as a result of investigations after a company goes into insolvency,"" said Andrew Ninian, the IA's director of stewardship and corporate governance.
Separately, the FRC said it was fining PwC 10 million pounds after a two-year inquiry into the accounting firm's audit of BHS.

876,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Nissan doubles down on emerging markets as U.S. sales slow,"YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) said on Wednesday it expects vehicle sales in some markets to beat industry growth, driven by countries including Saudi Arabia - crucial for the Japanese firm that is struggling with slowing sales in the United States.
Nissan, Japan's second-largest automaker, focused on the United States for the past few years, and roughly doubled car sales there since 2010, as it aimed to corner a 10 percent share of the market.
But that ambition came at a cost: hefty discounting led to the company's North American operating profit falling by nearly a third in the year just ended.
Nissan is now looking to China, the world's biggest car market, and other regions such as the ones it clubs as Africa, Middle East and India, to boost growth while trying to improve profitability in North America.
Moreover, the company is entering new markets including Pakistan and Turkey and plans to expand its affordable Datsun brand, Peyman Kargar, chairman of Nissan's operations in Africa, Middle East and India, told reporters at a briefing to discuss the company's mid-term strategy.
""Today we have 3.7 percent market share (in the region). The industry sees a 40 percent rise in total sales volumes, and we are going to be much above the market trend,"" said Kargar.
""We're talking about big growth in the region,"" he said, declining to give detailed regional sales targets.
He expects overall industry sales to climb to 12.1 million units in 2022 from 8.8 million in 2017.
Kargar, who joined Nissan last year from automaking partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) where he led sales and marketing for the same region, added that he expected to double market share in Saudi Arabia to 14 percent in 2022, from 7 percent last year when roughly 800,000 vehicles were sold in the country.
Kargar said Nissan is also betting on more Nissan-branded sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and cheaper Datsun-branded cars to shore up sales in India, where it is struggling to expand and is far behind market leader  Maruti Suzuki India  Ltd (NS:MRTI). It has focused on selling more SUVs in India, where SUV sales are fast climbing, fueled by rising consumer spending power.

It also expects to raise its market share in South Africa to ""more than 15 percent"" by 2022, from 10 percent in 2017, Kargar said, by selling fewer pick-up trucks and more passenger cars.

The value of six-year-old Grab will be just over $10 billion after the investment, said a person familiar with the matter.
The deal comes as the auto industry faces a spike in the need for technological prowess with the advent of features such as autonomous driving, while app makers offer passengers the option to forgo car purchases by connecting them with drivers.
Some automakers have responded by partnering with makers of ride-hailing apps which dominate the fast-growing field of mobility services, in anticipation of a future of reduced car ownership.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has invested in U.S. ride services firm Lyft, whose rival Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] is also backed by Toyota. Meanwhile Japan's SoftBank Group Corp - also an investor in Grab and Uber - last month said it would invest $2.25 billion in GM's autonomous vehicle unit Cruise.
Toyota's trading arm invested an undisclosed sum in Grab last year. This time, the automaker is lead investor in a financing round launched after Grab acquired Uber's operations in Southeast Asia, a region of 640 million people.
Grab called it the largest-ever investment globally by an automotive manufacturer in the ride-hailing sector.
The Singapore-headquartered firm did not disclose how much fresh capital it aims to raise. It raised $2.5 billion in its last round in July, resulting in a reported value of $6 billion.
Grab said it logs six million rides a day via apps downloaded onto over 100 million mobile devices. The firm also offers online to offline services, such as food delivery and digital payments, which it aims to expand deeper into the region using funds from its latest financing round.
""We will work with partners like Toyota to continue to transform transportation in Southeast Asia,"" Grab said in an email. ""We want to be the one-stop mobility platform for users.""
It also said Toyota will appoint an executive to Grab's board of directors while a dedicated Toyota team member will be seconded to Grab as an executive officer.
Toyota said it aimed to offer financing, insurance and maintenance services to drivers based on data collected through recorder devices already installed in some Grab vehicles.
""Going forward, together with Grab, we will develop services that are more attractive, safe and secure for our customers in Southeast Asia,"" Toyota executive Shigeki Tomoyama said in a statement.
The data could also help Toyota develop its own next-generation mobility services, including a self-driving electric vehicle aimed at companies for use in tasks such as ride hailing, package delivery and mobile shops.
Other Grab investors include Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd, South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co and Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing. Uber acquired 27.5 percent of Grab in exchange for the U.S. firm's Southeast Asian business earlier this year.

Grab's main rival is now Indonesia's Go-Jek which last month said it would invest $500 million to begin expanding abroad.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors wiped about $3 billion off embattled Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE (HK:0763) Corp's market value as it resumed trade on Wednesday after agreeing to pay up to $1.4 billion in penalties to the U.S. government.
China's No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker was crippled when the United States imposed a seven-year supplier ban on the company in April after it broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea.
The ban, which has prevented ZTE from buying the U.S. components it relies on to make smartphones and other devices, will not be lifted until ZTE pays a fine and places $400 million more in an escrow account in a U.S.-approved bank. It was also ordered to radically overhaul its management.
""While the nightmare is now over, ZTE will likely have to deal with many changes,"" Jeffries said in a research report, adding that it expects significant near-term selling pressure on the company's shares. 
Confirming details of the U.S. deal, ZTE said late on Tuesday it would replace its board of directors and that of its import-export subsidiary ZTE Kangxun within 30 days of the June 8 order being signed by the United States.
All members of its leadership at or above the senior vice president level would be removed within the 30-day period, with a commitment that they would not be re-hired, along with any executives or officers tied to the wrongdoing, it said.
The U.S. commerce department can exercise discretion in granting exceptions.
According to a Reuters estimate based on company filings and a source with knowledge of the matter, that could result in about 40 senior executives being replaced including its 14-person board, based on its current management structure. 
ZTE has more than a dozen senior vice presidents, which is a level below executive vice president, said the company source who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
As part of the U.S. order, the Commerce Department also will select a monitor, known as a special compliance coordinator, within 30 days to report on compliance by ZTE and its affiliates worldwide for 10 years. The coordinator will have a staff of at least six employees funded by ZTE. 
""The compliance monitor will be on the same level as ZTE's CEO and board on compliance matters. The new governance structure will pose challenges for the company's management in the future,"" Zhongtai Securities said in a note.
SHARES PLUNGE
The Hong Kong-listed shares of ZTE slid as much as 41 percent to HK$14.98, their lowest in a year, following a two-month trading suspension. Its Shenzhen shares fell by their 10 percent limit to 28.18 yuan after it confirmed details of the agreement publicized by the U.S. government on Monday. 
Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index was down 0.6 percent by the midday break. 
During its trading halt, fund managers cut their valuations of ZTE shares, with some lowering valuations of its A-shares to 20.04 yuan per share, or a 36 percent discount to the closing level on April 16.
ZTE also said in filings on Tuesday that it would work to resume operations as soon as possible after the ban gets lifted, and would republish its first-quarter financial results after assessing the impact of the ban and the settlement agreement.
Jeffries said it expected ZTE to pay its penalty in a few days and resume operations next week. 
The case has become a focus of bargaining talks as Washington and Beijing look to avert a trade war.
U.S. lawmakers have attacked Washington's agreement with ZTE and plan legislation to roll it back, citing intelligence warnings that ZTE poses a national security threat.

ZTE, with a market value of about $20 billion before its shares were suspended in April, is the world's No.4 telecom equipment maker after Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA).

884,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 03:52AM ET</span>",AT&T wins court approval to buy Time Warner over Trump opposition,"By Diane Bartz and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) won court approval on Tuesday to buy  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX) for $85 billion, rebuffing an attempt by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to block the deal and likely setting off a wave of corporate mergers. 
The deal, which could close next week, is seen as a turning point for a media industry that has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google which produce content and sell it online directly to consumers, without requiring a pricey cable subscription. Cable, satellite and wireless carriers all see buying content companies as a way to add revenue.
Trump, a frequent detractor of Time Warner's CNN and its coverage, denounced the deal when it was announced in October 2016. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon found little to support the government's arguments that the deal would harm consumers, calling one position ""gossamer thin"" and another ""poppycock.""
The ruling could also prompt a cascade of pay TV companies buying television and movie makers, with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's bid for some Twenty-First Century Fox Inc assets potentially the first out of the gate. 
The merger, including debt, would be the fourth largest deal ever attempted in the global telecom, media and entertainment space, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would also be the 12th largest deal in any sector, the data showed.
In a scathing opinion https:// Leon concluded that the government had failed to show competitive harm and urged the U.S. government not to seek a stay of his ruling pending a potential appeal, saying it would be ""manifestly unjust"" to do so and not likely to succeed.
""That's a legal shocker,"" said J.B. Heaton, an attorney and consultant on litigation and regulatory proceedings. ""I think we'll see now that companies will be much more confident about vertical mergers,"" he added, referring to deals where a company merges with a supplier.
Shares of AT&T fell about 1.3 percent in after-hours trade following the decision, while Time Warner rose more than 5 percent. 
Twenty-First Century Fox jumped 7 percent in extended trade after the ruling on expectations that Comcast and Walt Disney Co could start a bidding war to acquire its media assets. Comcast and Walt Disney dropped 4.3 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. 
Shares of other media and telecom companies also rose, including T-Mobile US Inc, Sprint Corp, CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS), Dish Network Corp, Discovery Inc and Viacom Inc.
""This will be a blockbuster summer for media mergers,"" said Mary Ann Halford, senior adviser to OC&C Strategy Consultants.
Shares of Express Scripts Holding Co, which is set to be bought by  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) for $52 billion, rose 4.8 percent, while shares of health insurer  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET), due to be acquired by CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) for $69 billion, rose 3.6 percent.
Opponents of the AT&T decision also predicted more deals.
""Consumers should fear a cascade of unchecked mergers and acquisitions to further consolidate the telecom industry resulting in less choice, fewer competitors and higher prices,"" Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement.
The Justice Department filed a lawsuit to stop the deal in November 2017, saying that AT&T's ownership of both DirecTV and Time Warner would give AT&T unfair leverage against rival cable providers that relied on Time Warner's content, such as CNN and HBO's ""Game of Thrones.""
Leaving the courtroom, Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice department’s antitrust division, said that he would read the judge’s opinion before making a decision on an appeal.
The Justice Department is not likely to be put off by the loss, said Amy Ray of the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, noting it had prevailed in stopping other mergers between rivals.
""Put me on the side of the fence of thinking that AAG (Makan) Delrahim is interested in challenging the next problematic vertical transaction,"" she said.
Cornell law professor George Hay added that the ruling found the government's evidence lacking, rather than a broader determination of how vertical mergers affected competition.
AT&T in a six-week trial argued that the purchase of Time Warner would allow it to gain information about viewers needed to target digital advertising, much like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google already do.
AT&T can use the content from Time Warner to fill its streaming services DirecTV Now and soon-to-be-launched AT&T Watch, which are cheaper online video packages with fewer channels. That could give it a leg up over rival live streaming platforms that do not own content, media analysts have said.
AT&T applauded the court’s decision and said it expected to close the merger before the June 21 contractual deadline.
The government estimated costs to industry rivals, such as  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR), would increase by $580 million a year if AT&T owned Time Warner.
Before the trial started, AT&T lawyers said the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for government enforcement but the judge rejected their bid to force the disclosure of White House communications that might have shed light on the matter.
The deal cost AT&T's top lobbyist, Bob Quinn, his job in May after it became public that AT&T had paid Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen $600,000 for advice on winning approval.
Burns McKinney, a portfolio manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors who owns AT&T, said he would not say the telecoms company had won a huge victory.

""It's more that they just didn't lose. You always wonder in these cases if there's a winner's curse, given the risk (AT&T) can't get the desired synergies and they're taking on a lot of debt with the merger,"" he said.

Its announcement on Wednesday that about 700 billion yen ($6.33 billion) of its shares will be repurchased allayed concerns Toshiba may keep more of its cash, given its uncertain outlook after the disposal of the chip unit and other assets.
Toshiba had promised to reward shareholders after the sale of the chips unit to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital closed earlier this month.
Investors, including activist hedge funds, were expected to press the company at its annual shareholders' meeting on June 27 to share the cash raised from the unit's sale.
""The scale of the buyback exceeds what some in the market expected, which was around 600 billion yen. The timing of the announcement is earlier than we had expected, so the first impression is positive,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Takeshi Tanaka said in a note to clients.
Toshiba shares hit an intra-day high of 351 yen on Wednesday, before erasing some of the gains to be up 6.7 percent at 337 yen. 
The company had in recent years canceled dividend payments and came close to a delisting following an accounting scandal and massive cost overruns at its U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse. 
It avoided the delisting with a $5.4 billion share issue to overseas investors, including activist funds, late last year. 
The company said it was considering dividend payments and the possibility of further moves to bolster shareholder returns.
Toshiba said it will carefully consider the timing and method of the share repurchases but aimed to carry them out as soon as possible.

892,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 13, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>",Fed Dots in Focus as Market Awaits Rate Hike: Decision-Day Guide,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly played down the central bank’s “dot plot” as a guide to future interest rates, but Wall Street just won’t take the hint.
While the Federal Open Market Committee is almost certain to raise rates a quarter point at the close of a two-day meeting Wednesday, investors are focused on whether the panel will signal one or two additional 2018 hikes when it releases updated interest-rate forecasts with the policy decision at 2 p.m. Powell will begin his press conference 30 minutes later.
The FOMC was about evenly split in March when it projected three hikes this year, so just one participant switching to four hikes could shift the median of the committee. Accelerating growth and inflation rising to target might argue for a more aggressive tightening, while lackluster wage increases and fragile emerging markets would suggest caution.
“The market will be focused on 2018 dots,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). “It is a close call. I’m leaning toward four but without much conviction. The FOMC is really focused on the language but I think that will be overshadowed by the dots.”
Powell advised investors in his March press conference not to focus too much on the dots. Asked about its projections for 2020, he said policy makers “don’t have the ability to see that far into the future.” That echoed his 2016 view when he pointed to “shortcomings” in the dot-plot.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the FOMC will stick with its March prediction of three hikes this year in the updated quarterly forecasts.
Even so, “there is a risk that the dots go up a tad, not down,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist at Mizuho Securities. “All you need is for one to change. There has been enough strength in the economy” to tilt to more tightening.
The Summary of Economic Projections could see other changes that reflect mostly upbeat economic data since March. Forecasts could show higher 2018 growth, lower unemployment rates and possibly slightly higher inflation, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC.
The committee will also debate the language in its policy statement. Minutes to the last two FOMC meetings showed officials have begun to discuss changes reflecting that policy is moving closer to neutral rather than still being characterized as “accommodative.”
“I’d expect this part of the statement to be softened to something like ‘somewhat accommodative’ or perhaps even dropped,” said Jonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and a former Fed economist.
In the press conference, journalists are likely to ask Powell about softening global growth and emerging markets struggling with higher U.S. rates. Currencies of such nations have been hammered in a spreading selloff amid worries that their economies won’t cope with higher U.S. borrowing costs.
“The tone of the press conference will be important,” and Powell will likely strike a balance, “not eager to raise faster or slower,” said Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington.

Investors quickly turned their attention from Tuesday's historic U.S.-North Korea summit to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting that ends on Wednesday.
U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but their joint statement gave few details on how the goal would be achieved.
""The outcome was in line with what the market had expected. Few people expected that there would be details on denuclearization from this summit,"" said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities.
He said that while the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year at the policy meeting, the market is watching how U.S. yields move after the announcement.

894,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 09:52PM ET</span>",Asian Equities Fall After U.S.-North Korea Summit ,"Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly lower in morning trade on Wednesday after a historic U.S.-North Korea summit held in Singapore, as markets shift focus to the upcoming Federal Reserve policy decision that may offer some clues on future rate hikes.
U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed a document on Tuesday that said the U.S. President would provide “security guarantees” to Kim in exchange for the North Korean leader’s “unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
The document also specified that Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a “relevant high-level” North Korean official will meet “at the earliest possible date.”
“He trusts me, I believe, I really do,” Trump said of Kim in an interview with the ABC News, adding that he would have “many meetings” with Kim in the future. “I think he trusts me, and I trust him.”
Investors’ attention now turn to the upcoming Federal Reserve policy decision, where the Fed is expected to raise interest rates for second time this year.
In Asia, China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were both down 0.4% at 9:50PM ET (01:50 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.5%.
China's ZTE (HK:0763) Corp’s trading resumed in Hong Kong on Wednesday and plunged as much as 38 percent after it agreed to pay up to $1.4 billion in penalties to the U.S. government.
The telecommunication company also agreed to overhaul its management in order to resume business after a two-month hiatus.
ZTE would pay $1.4 billion in total penalties, including a lump sum payment of $1 billion and a suspended penalty of $400 million, according to a filing, which added that the company would replace the entire boards of both parent ZTE and subsidiary ZTE Kangxun, as well as terminating all current members of senior leadership at both companies.

895,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 09:40PM ET</span>",Korean Markets Show the Shift From War Threats to Peace Talks,"(Bloomberg) -- After a year filled with “Rocket Man” insults and threats of a nuclear war, President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un pledged to work toward peace negotiations.
And the measures of volatility in South Korea’s financial markets reflect the shift away from conflict.
“The easing in geopolitical tensions in the Korean peninsula has helped support Korean assets and reduced volatility further,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “Volatility in global markets had fallen to low levels last year amidst ample liquidity and an improving global economy.”
While the historic agreement signed in Singapore on Tuesday set no deadline and left the path to disarmament undefined, it is a stark improvement from a year ago when the two leaders called each other “Rocket Man” and “dotard.”
Here are charts showing how volatility has evolved in South Korea over the past 12 months:
The Kospi 200 Volatility Index, a gauge of investor expectations for future price swings, has tumbled 46 percent since jumping to a two-year high in February at the start of the Winter Olympics in South Korea as investors watched for provocative activity from North Korea. The Kospi 200, which includes Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. and SK Hynix Inc. among its largest members, has since advanced 3.9 percent.
One-month implied volatility for the South Korean won has also been on a downtrend since peaking in 2017, and a more recent spike early this year -- again coinciding with the start of the Winter Olympics in South Korea. Volatility levels have ebbed from the February high. And the cost of insuring South Korean sovereign debt against non-payment continues to slide, now down more than 30 basis points from a September 2017 high.
“The world had very low expectations going in, and according to them something ‘historic’ was signed,” said Olivier d’Assier, Singapore-based head of applied research for Asia Pacific at Axioma Inc. “But as everyone knows, whether this is a success or just another failure, will only be known years later. So, while the summit seems to have eliminated any downside for now, the peace dividend upside potential remains unknown and speculative.”

The directors of IOF manager Investa Listed Funds Management said they unanimously recommend the offer, which equates to a distribution adjusted price of A$5.15 per unit.
Blackstone had made an unsolicited and non-binding offer last month, two years after IOF shareholders rejected a A$2.5 billion bid from Australian firm DEXUS (AX:DXS).
Shares of the Australian firm had surged more than 10 percent after the offer announcement. 
Blackstone's move is a bet on the future of commercial property across Australia's east coast, where analysts expect strong demand to support yields even if interest rates rise from their current historic lows.

In May, Blackstone struck a NZ$635 million ($439.4 million) deal to buy an office portfolio in Auckland, New Zealand, which was co-held by Goodman Property Trust (NZ:GMT) and Singaporean investor GIC.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares edged slightly lower on Wednesday as investors looked to the Federal Reserve policy decision and any clues it might give on future rate hikes, shifting focus away from the historic U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) dipped 0.15 percent in early trade, giving up the slim gains they made following Tuesday's meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) eked out gains of 0.10 percent.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.17 percent, led by a continued rally in technology shares. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.57 percent, to finish at record low of 7,703.
""The agreement at the summit lacked details. There was no clear roadmap to denuclearization. So that wasn't something that makes markets 100 percent risk-on,"" said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy group at HSBC Securities in Japan.
With the U.S.-North Korea summit out of the way, market focus is quickly shifting to the Fed's two-day policy meeting ending on Wednesday.
The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates for second time this year after a move in March, but the bigger question for investors is the outlook of the Fed's future monetary tightening amid an ongoing economic expansion. [nL1N1TD1NR]
""With a rate hike almost fully priced in, the focus is on how many times the Fed will raise rates this year and next and how much beyond the levels it considers as neutral to the economy, or what they call the longer-run rates,"" said HSBC's Shirota.
Projections from the Fed's March meeting suggest a benchmark rate of 2.1 percent at end of 2018, based on the median forecast of central bank policymakers, which would mean three rate hikes in total this year.
In the currency market, the dollar was relatively well bid ahead of the Fed's meeting.
The euro traded at $1.1744 (EUR=), off last week's high of $1.1840 touched on June 7 though it was underpinned by expectations that the European Central Bank may drop a hint of winding up its stimulus after its policy meeting on Thursday.
The dollar stood at 110.50 44 yen <JPY=>, near its highest levels in about three weeks.
Some emerging market currencies stayed under pressure on worries higher U.S. rates could prompt fund outflows from emerging markets to the United States.
The Mexican peso <MXN=D2> hit a 16-month low of 20.724 peso to the dollar while the South African rand <ZAR=D3> dropped to a six-month low of 13.345 per dollar, extending its decline, triggered by disappointing GDP data last week.
Oil prices dipped after data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a surprise build of 833,000 barrels in U.S. crude stockpiles. Analysts had expected a decline of 2.7 million barrels. <API/S>
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) traded at $65.83 per barrel.

Elsewhere, bitcoin fell to a 2-1/2-month low of $6,461 at Bitstamp exchange (BTC=BTSP) on Tuesday on mounting regulatory and security concerns after the weekend hacking of South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinrail.

898,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>",Takeda CEO Speaks Out on Selling Japan's Biggest Overseas Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Christophe Weber says growth and innovation are the metrics to success in Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.’s $62 billion purchase of  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP). The first order of business is bringing global shareholders around to Japan’s biggest-ever outbound takeover.
The Takeda chief executive officer is facing a 21 percent drop in the stock price since the company disclosed its interest in March, while Shire is trading 9 pounds ($12) below the offer price of roughly 49 pounds a share. He’s also contending with some domestic shareholders who are averse to expansion as Weber looks to create a global pharmaceutical giant.
In an interview at Takeda’s new Tokyo headquarters, the French-born CEO discusses his push to sell the deal overseas -- and in Japan -- and plans to integrate the 237-year-old drugmaker with a London-listed company with mostly U.S.-based operations.
The following excerpt has been edited for clarity and brevity.
Bloomberg: Is there a difference dealing with investors in Japan vs. the U.S.?
Weber: They all want to better understand our vision for the combined company -- what the new business will look like, when it will be combined. I think investors are starting from very different points. In Japan, many didn’t know Shire at all; it’s more difficult for them to understand the combination of the two. In the U.S., many people in the health-care investment sector know about Shire; some of them know about both companies.
Q: Shire still trades below the offer price. What is the market missing?
A: It’s not that they don’t see the benefit of the combination, it’s that there is no precedent. And so people don’t know exactly how it will happen. For example, there is no precedent for a Japanese company buying a foreign company with its own shares. There is no precedent for de-listing, so U.K. shareholders will have to exchange its shares with either Japanese shares or an ADR in New York.
Q: How are you approaching the issue of integration?
A: This is an area we’re quite comfortable with, otherwise we wouldn’t have done the deal. My team is truly global. There are eight nationalities and a majority of my team is not based in Japan. The other element is that Shire’s operational headquarters are in Boston and in Zurich, where we have our two hubs outside of Tokyo. So I think this proximity will help greatly. It will not be easy but we really analyze that, because most mergers are not super successful because of integration.
Q: What will be the hardest part of integration?
A: I think M&A or integration in the pharmaceutical industry is often highly disruptive for R&D. And this is where we have a big advantage because Shire has not invested strongly in research. We don’t have to go through the disruption of closing a research site or merging a research site, which takes a long time and has some impact on the pipeline and is so complicated. The R&D integration is relatively simple because of that.
Q: What do you need to do to bridge the cultural gaps?
A: We’ll have to build a new business organization and we’re actively starting to work on that. Takeda has a much longer history and stronger culture in terms of value system. We are very patient-centric -- it’s do the right thing for the patient, reinforce trust with society, develop the reputation of the company and develop the business, in that order. I think Shire is also patient-centric because in rare diseases you need to have this mindset. I think their business organization is not too dissimilar from Takeda’s.
Q: How will you determine if integration has been a success?
A: In three years we will have to look at Takeda and where it is positioned in the global pharma market. We’ll look at what type of pipeline and science it is generating, the type of resilience the company has, its growth and its ability to innovate. ... We will design a new company which will be very R&D driven, very very science driven. But also very fit for the future environment that we will face.
Q: Many say your legacy will hinge on the success of the Shire deal.
A: I don’t have any personal agenda. I don’t have any ego to feed. I’m doing this deal because I think this is a unique opportunity for Takeda to be much more competitive. And this is a unique opportunity for Japan, because Japan doesn’t have a global champion and might never have one if we don’t do this deal. The countries that have one, they all built it by M&A -- GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi (PA:SASY). It’s easy to say their M&A has been bumpy along the way, but what would those companies be if they had not done it?

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The recent selloff in emerging markets has provided investment opportunities not seen in years, Jeffrey Gundlach, executive of DoubleLine Capital, said on Tuesday, and he urged moving at least some money into emerging market bonds.
""I think it is excellent time - if you haven't been in emerging market bonds or high-yield bonds - to contemplate at least a partial shift based upon the level of the dollar and valuation,"" Gundlach said in an investor webcast, as he noted his bearish view on the greenback. 
Gundlach, known as Wall Street's ""Bond King,"" cited a sell-off stemming from Argentina, Brazil and Turkey, and said that emerging market dollar bonds are now yielding more than U.S. high-yield bonds. 
U.S.-based stock funds invested in emerging markets gathered just $4.8 million during the week ended June 6, a week after the largest withdrawals in more than 18 months, while their debt counterparts posted $521 million in outflows, the most since February.
Gundlach, who oversees $120 billion at DoubleLine, said he believes the U.S. dollar will weaken again because of the ""ridiculous"" expansion of federal debt against the backdrop of rising interest rates. He characterized the explosion of the federal debt and the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increase cycle as a ""suicide mission.""

Gundlach said he expects oil to rise toward $80-$90 a barrel, and said he would be a buyer of gold and continues to be bullish on commodities. Overall, Gundlach said, there is ""no U.S. recession in the offing,"" but he does see slower global growth.

Speaking at a conference hosted by the Wall Street bank in New York, Gorman said that in 2015, he thought that the fixed income division, one of the bank's smallest, was its ""most attractive business"" because it stood to see rapid growth if interest rates rose and there was more volatility in markets. 
""I thought actually fixed income is the most exciting business if (those) two things happen,"" Gorman said. 
Indeed, Morgan Stanley's fixed income group has seen positive returns in recent quarters. Last year, the bank set a target to produce $1 billion in quarterly fixed-income revenue, on average, each year.

Gorman, who is also chairman of Morgan Stanley, added the U.S. bank will move 400-500 employees out of the United Kingdom to other European nations as a result of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended slightly higher on Tuesday, boosted by gains in technology and utilities shares, though investors were cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy decision.
The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year when it concludes its policy meeting on Wednesday. 
Investors are focused on how the Fed characterizes its monetary policy, looking for hints if it would move to raise rates three or four times this year.
But shares of S&P 500 utilities, up 1.3 percent, and technology, up 0.6 percent, helped to lift the S&P 500.
Investors also awaited a court ruling, which was expected after the closing bell, that would decide the fate of AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's $85 billion offer for Time Warner. Shares of AT&T ended up 0.5 percent, while Time Warner was flat and  Charter Communications  (NASDAQ:CHTR) gained 2.8 percent.
""The Time Warner ruling has ramifications for other potential deals, so I think people are gearing up for that,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Investors appeared to shrug off a historic U.S.-North Korea summit. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but their joint statement gave few details on how the goal would be achieved.
While defense stocks such as Raytheon,  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) dipped, the broader markets saw little impact from the summit.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.58 points, or 0.01 percent, to 25,320.73, the S&P 500 gained 4.85 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,786.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 43.87 points, or 0.57 percent, to 7,703.79.
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer prices rose marginally in May as gasoline price increases slowed and the underlying trend continued to suggest moderate inflation in the economy. 
""There's a little bit of hesitancy going into the Fed meeting. People are unsure what the Fed is going to say,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. 
""I don't think they're going to say anything particularly related to a rate hike in December. If they say a little too much about inflation, that's going to give the market a reason to get concerned.""
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares were up 3.2 percent after it said it is cutting several thousand jobs across the company.
Twitter gained 5 percent after J.P. Morgan raised its price target on the stock by $11 to $50, saying it was confident about the company's advertising revenue growth.

907,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. All Eyes on Fed's Rate Hike Outlook, Powell 
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) releases its decision on monetary policy, accompanied by its Summary of Economic projections on interest rates, inflation, unemployment and economic growth (GDP) at 2:00 p.m. ET.
Investors expect the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will raise rates by 0.25% to 1.75% to 2.00%.
The “dot plot,” – which shows where each FOMC member in the meeting thinks interest rates are heading at the end of the year for the next few years and in the longer run – is expected to garner the most investor attention.
In March, the Fed’s “dot plot” indicated the median forecast was for a total of three rate hikes in 2018, however, a recent string of bullish economic data has raised the prospect of a fourth rate hike for 2018.
RBC said it expected the Federal Reserve median forecast to shift to four rate hikes in 2018.
Investors are also expected to carefully monitor comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell press conference for further clues on monetary policy.
Ahead of the FOMC decision on interest rates, the dollar inched higher against its rivals.
2. U.S. Crude Oil Stockpiles in Focus
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday at 10.30 a.m. ET is expected to show crude supplies fell last week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 2.744 million barrels in the week ended June 8.
Crude oil futures settled 36 cents higher at $66.10 on Tuesday despite reports showing OPEC increased output in May, led by a ramp up in output from Saudi Arabia.
3. AT&T,  Time Warner  Merger Ruling Gets Green Light
U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon ruled in favour of the AT&T and Time Warner merger, ending a prolonged period of uncertainty as to whether the deal would go through.
With the deal approved, AT&T is expected to wrap up its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner in less than a week.
The approval of the merger will likely spark action across the media sector amid a number of merger and rumoured mergers in the pipeline including  Disney  's deal for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc A (NASDAQ:FOXA).
Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) bid for Fox's assets, however, is expected to come under pressure as Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reportedly plans to start a bidding a war.

(Reuters) - Electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) is cutting several thousand jobs across the company as it seeks to reduce costs and become profitable without endangering the critical production ramp-up for its Model 3 sedan.
In an email he said had been sent to staff, billionaire Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Tuesday that the cuts were part of a simplification of Tesla's management structure promised last month. 
""As part of this effort, and the need to reduce costs and become profitable, we have made the difficult decision to let go of approximately 9 percent of our colleagues across the company,"" the email read.
""These cuts were almost entirely made from our salaried population and no production associates were included, so this will not affect our ability to reach Model 3 production targets in the coming months.""
Tesla has been trying to hit a 5,000 per week production target of its Model 3 sedans after facing initial production hiccups. Last week, Musk said the carmaker should achieve its target by the end of June.
Shares rose as much as 7 percent and were last up 3.6 percent at $344.18. 
The layoffs mean there likely will not be more job cuts in the near-term, said Efraim Levy, analyst at CFRA Research, adding that Tesla will likely raise capital early in 2019. 
""I don't think if Tesla becomes profitable in Q3 and Q4, that will be sustainable because of ramping up of the production. The layoffs may help them to achieve profitability in the near-term but not sustain it."" 
Tesla has been burning through cash as it continues to spend on its assembly line and prepares for new investments on projects such as the Model Y crossover and its Gigafactory.
Free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, widened to negative $1 billion in the first quarter from negative $277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business.
Several Wall Street analysts anticipate a capital raise this year despite Musk's statements that it will not be necessary due to profitability and positive cash flow in the third or fourth quarters. 
Tesla said it began notifying impacted workers on Tuesday and would continue to do so throughout the week. A spokesman said it would reduce overall employment back to around 37,000 - roughly in line with numbers at the end of last year.
Musk also said that Tesla had decided not to renew a residential sales agreement with  Home Depot  (N:HD), and would focus instead on selling its solar products through its own stores and website. The company will seek to re-employ most Tesla employees at Home Depot stores at its own locations.
Musk told employees in May that the company was undergoing a ""thorough reorganization"" as it contends with production problems, senior staff departures and recent crashes involving its electric cars.

At the start of April, the company's shares had fallen by around 35 percent from a peak hit last September but signs that it is on course to meet an output target of Model 3 cars have wiped out almost all of this year's losses.

But behind the scenes, traders were scurrying to move money amid the geopolitical noise, sending flows to some Asia exchange-traded funds. Volumes for U.S.-listed ETFs on Monday were almost 20 percent below their daily average over the past 20 days, according to an analysis by Josh Lukeman of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
The iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex-Japan ETF, or AAXJ, absorbed trades worth $195 million, the most for a single day since April and more than double the average daily turnover in the past year. Most of the fund’s investments are in China, but almost 17 percent of its exposure is in South Korea, with Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. its third-largest position.
Fixed-income ETFs saw action as well, as investors traded close to $30 million of the SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Emerging Markets Local Bond ETF, or EBND, on both Monday and Friday. That’s about five times the daily average volume for the fund in the past year. EBND’s largest holding is South Korean sovereign debt.
Silver Spoons
Funds tied to silver also saw an uptick in volume on Monday, as the price of the metal rose nearly 1 percent. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV), or SLV, had more than 10 million shares trade, the most in about a month and close to double the 15-day moving average over the past year. Similarly, investors moved more than $7 million worth of the Global X Silver Miners ETF, or SIL, about twice its average daily turnover this year.
“Tensions in the G7 could be putting pressure on the dollar and that could have lent support to the silver market,” said Phil Streible, a senior market strategist at RJO Futures.
About 40 percent of the the mining companies held by SIL are in Canada, 15.6 percent in Mexico, 12.7 percent in Russia and 11.7 percent in South Korea."
919,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 03:27PM ET</span>",New York top court narrows Martin Act in $11 billion Credit Suisse case,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's highest court on Tuesday curbed the state attorney general's ability to fight fraud on Wall Street, awarding a victory to  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) as it tries to end an $11 billion lawsuit over risky mortgage securities.
By a 4-1 vote, the state Court of Appeals said New York's top law enforcement officer has just three years to bring claims under the Martin Act, a 1921 law granting that office broad power to pursue civil and criminal cases over securities fraud without having to prove intent to defraud.
Two lower courts had agreed with the attorney general that the deadline should be six years, and rejected Credit Suisse's arguments that the state sued too late. Tuesday's decision overturned those findings.
""The Martin Act imposes numerous obligations - or 'liabilities' - that did not exist at common law, justifying the imposition of a three-year statute of limitations,"" Chief Judge Janet DiFiore wrote.
The decision could doom a November 2012 lawsuit brought by then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman accusing Credit Suisse of lying about the quality of loans underlying residential mortgage-backed securities it sold in 2006 and 2007, resulting in steep investor losses during the global financial crisis.
But the appeals court said current Attorney General Barbara Underwood deserved a chance to show a lower court that Credit Suisse committed fraud under common law, subjecting it to a six-year statute of limitations under the state's Executive Law.
Underwood took over the case after Schneiderman resigned last month.
""We don't anticipate this impacting our cases in any significant way,"" said Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Underwood. ""This decision will have no impact on our efforts to vigorously pursue financial fraud wherever it exists in New York. That includes continuing our case against Credit Suisse.""
The lawsuit had accused Credit Suisse of concealing known defects in home loans underlying its securities in a bid to sell more securities and generate higher fees.
""This will significantly constrain the NY AG's reach,"" John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia Law School, said in an email. ""Yes, the AG can sue on a common law fraud theory and have six years, but then it must prove much more, including an intent to defraud.""
Coffee noted that the three-year deadline is shorter than the five years that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has to pursue securities fraud claims.
Credit Suisse spokeswoman Nicole Sharp said the Swiss bank was ""extremely pleased"" to defeat the Martin Act claim, and that the three-year statute of limitations was significant ""for all future industry proceedings.""
The bank will keep defending itself against the attorney general's ""unfounded and meritless allegations,"" she said.
Judge Jenny Rivera dissented from Tuesday's decision. She called on New York's legislature to restore the six-year statute of limitations ""before significant damage is done to the state's securities markets.""
The Martin Act gained new life under former Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who invoked it in 2005 when he sued American International Group Inc's (N:AIG) longtime chairman Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg over two alleged sham reinsurance transactions.
Schneiderman also invoked it when he began probing whether  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) misled the public about climate change.

The case is People v Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, New York State Court of Appeals, No. 40.

The pressure can be seen in the depreciation of their currencies, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index dropping 3.54 percent from its high this year in early April. 
Countries that feasted on the cheap money that resulted from the quantitative easing and near-zero interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve almost a decade ago are now suffering from a withdrawal of global liquidity. The correction in emerging-market currencies, debt and equities has further to go with the Fed poised to raise interest rates on Wednesday for the seventh time since December 2015, and as global trade tensions boost investor demand for currencies such as the dollar that are considered havens.
Central banks in developing countries have had to adjust domestic policies in response to these external pressures. The Reserve Bank of India boosted a key interest rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent on June 7, its first increase since January 2014. Perry Warjiyo, the new Governor of the Bank of Indonesia, complained last week that the Fed was considering only domestic U.S. objectives in setting policy rather than the impact of its measures on foreign economies.
The current complaints are a stark contrast to earlier this decade. Back then, officials in emerging markets complained that the Fed's decision to cut rates near zero and pump liquidity into the global markets through its quantitative easing program was intended to weaken the dollar and help the U.S. gain a competitive advantage in international trade. In September 2012, then Brazil’s Finance Minister Guido Mantega famously labeled the moves nothing less than a ""currency war"" with emerging markets getting the short end of the stick.
A quintupling of the Fed’s balance-sheet assets from about $900 billion in September 2008 to a peak of $4.52 trillion in 2015 helped spark a surge of capital into emerging markets to take advantage of higher rates. Emerging-market governments and companies borrowed at yields that averaged a mere 2.42 percentage points more than U.S. Treasuries in April 2010, down from 8.90 percentage points in October 2008. Spreads remained narrow for the next four years.
But emerging-markets officials can't have it both ways by complaining about a weak dollar, as Mantega did in 2012, and seek relief from a strong dollar, as Warjiyo did recently. The fortunes of the dollar will wax and wane over economic cycles, so medium-term global investors should look to two sovereign risk indicators to provide some guidance.
Those indicators are the deficit in the current account of the balance of payments, and annual inflows of foreign direct investments. The current account measures the balance on merchandise trade (exports less imports) as well as services. A deficit would have to be financed by capital inflows from abroad or by running down foreign-exchange holdings by that particular emerging nation’s central bank. The smaller the shortfall, the less the country would need to depend on debt or equity inflows.
By that measure, Turkey is in a deeper hole than Mexico. Foreign investors have to reckon that with a current-account deficit equivalent to 6 percent of gross domestic product, Turkey may need to maintain higher interest rates for longer, despite the negative impact on economic growth and its equity markets.
The second indicator, inflows of foreign direct investments, refers to capital inflows that go to building plant and equipment, rather than to portfolio investments. FDI flows are unlikely to reverse in a hurry, unlike speculative investments in short-term debt instruments or in the equity market. They provide confidence to new investors that there would be stability in a country’s capital structure to support their own investments.
Brazil does well on this basis while South Africa performs poorly. Even though both countries had net FDI inflows equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP in 2010, the figure has since more than doubled in Brazil while it is less than half that level for South Africa. This may reflect the judgment of foreign investors on the stability of the countries’ economic policies.
The correction in emerging markets is not a reason to avoid them. Rather, in following selected sovereign risk criteria, investors could profit over the longer term by making intelligent country allocations at attractive valuations."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Union leaders plan to meet with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Wednesday in a bid to avert closure of a Virginia factory that makes controls for GE's power plants, the company and the union said on Tuesday.
General Electric said last week that it intends to cease manufacturing at the facility and eliminate about 265 jobs because of declining power plant orders. The work will be moved to outside vendors and companies in India and China, the union said. GE said the changes will take 12-to-24 months. 
The Boston-based industrial conglomerate is under pressure to generate growth and profit in its $35 billion power business after steep declines last year. 
Low cost wind and solar electricity are slowing construction of new fossil-fuel power plants and forcing closure of old ones.
GE's stock has fallen 44 percent since John Flannery became chief executive in August. The company said in December it would eliminate 12,000 jobs in its power unit.
""Based on the ongoing challenges in the power industry and a significant decline in orders at this facility, we announced our intent to close our manufacturing facility in Salem, Virginia, and move the remaining work to other GE locations or to supplier partners,"" GE said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Tuesday.
A GE email sent to the union last week said volume at the plant had fallen 35 percent in the past two years and that the facility was operating at about 40 percent of capacity.
The email also cited price competition in the shrunken power-plant market. ""Product cost continues to be a major influencer when customers are selecting their next controls solution,"" it said. GE competes with  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Mitsubishi and others.
Prior efforts to downsize and cut costs at the factory, including layoffs and not filling vacant positions, ""have not been enough,"" the email said.
About 200 workers will remain at the facility, including engineers for GE's power plant control systems.
GE spokesman Greg Gibbons said a small training center at the site will be run by ABB Ltd after it acquires GE's Industrial Solutions business. GE plans to sell the building and lease it back, he said.
Wednesday's meeting will allow the union to begin talks on how to save the plant, Vicky Hurley, president of IUE-CWA Local 82161 told Reuters. 

The union has 60 days to propose an alternative to closure of the factory, which opened in 1955 and employed thousands.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>","Wells Fargo workers push for more board access, so far in vain","By Ross Kerber and Imani Moise
(Reuters) - A labor-backed group is stepping up pressure on  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) to add an employee to a council that has the ear of the bank's board and management, arguing workers deserve a voice as Wells Fargo works to get past a damaging scandal over sales practices.
This raises the sensitive issue of how much of a voice the fourth-largest U.S. bank is prepared to give to its roughly 265,000 workers, some of whom were excessively pressured by managers to sell products to customers, and whose support the bank may need to repair relations with U.S. regulators.
Wells Fargo has not definitively answered the requests from the union-backed Committee for Better Banks for a worker representative to be added to Wells Fargo's recently formed Stakeholder Advisory Council. The committee, which also includes consumer and community advocates, first made the request privately to management last June and repeated it in a May 29 letter seen by Reuters. 
The May letter, sent to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan, called for another meeting with management and the committee says it has so far gone unanswered. 
At Wells Fargo's annual shareholder meeting in April, Sloan said the idea of adding a worker to the council was ""a fair one"" but also highlighted other efforts to connect with employees. 
The council's current members include consumer and community groups such as the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which earlier this year persuaded Wells Fargo to undertake a review of its governance and risk management lapses. 
Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said the stakeholder council reviews employee feedback and noted other worker-outreach initiatives such as internal message boards. He declined to comment on whether the bank was working on adding an employee to the council. 
Cornelius Hurley, a Boston University law professor, said it makes sense for a stakeholder council to have a workers' representative but bank leaders might be shy of union ties at the CBB. The group is backed by community, consumer and labor groups including the Communications Workers of America and has called for changes at other banks including the U.S. operations of Spain's  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN). 
""Bankers go apoplectic when you talk about organized labor,"" he said. 
Erin Mahoney, an organizer for the CBB and the Communications Workers of America labor union, said the lack of a worker on the council stands out considering the other reforms put in place by bank leaders over the past year, under pressure from regulators.
""I'd have to agree that so far it has been a missed opportunity,"" she said.
The bank named its stakeholder council in late 2017 to advise on a range of topics as it works to improve oversight and governance to show that it has rooted out any customer abuses.
Its scandals erupted in 2016 after employee whistleblowers helped reveal customer abuses involving workers opening potentially millions of unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets. That led to hefty fines and a cap on assets until the bank proves to U.S. regulators its governance has improved.
The stakeholder council meets with Wells Fargo's management and board, which is chaired by Elizabeth Duke, a former Federal Reserve governor who once headed the U.S. central bank's consumer and community affairs committee. 
NEXT STEPS
The bank has already taken other steps aimed at rebuilding the trust of employees and, in turn, investors, including eliminating product sales goals for retail workers, granting stock and raising wages. 
Sloan said last fall the bank had hired back nearly 2,000 workers who quit or were fired.
At the same time Wells Fargo is under investor pressure to improve expenses per dollar of revenue. One of the CBB's requests is for all Wells Fargo employees to be paid at least $20 an hour, up from a base wage of $15 an hour.
No Wells Fargo employees are labor union members. Just 46,000, or 1.1 percent, of U.S. finance workers were union members, Labor Department statistics for 2017 show, the lowest percentage of any U.S. industry workforce.
Alex Ross, a Wells Fargo bankruptcy specialist in the Minneapolis area and a CBB member, said several dozen colleagues got in touch after he raised the group's issues with Sloan at the April meeting. 
""I think for organized labor to survive, it needs to start looking to organize people in un-organized sectors,"" Ross said. A seat at the council would let workers speak without fear of manager retaliation, he said. 
However, bank leaders could be wary of giving workers more influence as a digital banking push changes its workforce needs, said Ben Bystrom, instructor at the Shidler College of Business in Hawaii. 
Some members of the stakeholder council said they would be open to the idea of adding a worker. 

""Mr. Sloan seemed amenable. I hope it will happen soon,"" said member Nora Nash, who is also director of Corporate Social Responsibility for the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia.

A proprietary indicator from BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s analysis unit shows investors perceive the world as riskier than the all-time average, but not at levels seen during the invasion of Crimea or the Arab Spring.

The BlackRock Geopolitical Risk Indicator tracks volume and sentiment of analyst reports, financial news stories and influential tweets to gauge how much investors are focused on geopolitical risks. A score of zero on the index represents the average BGRI level since its origin in 2003, while a score of one means it’s one standard deviation above the average.
Emerging-market assets performed far better in the one-to-three year horizon after events that scored low on the risk gauge than those that scored high.
Of all the risks today, Russia-NATO tensions possess the greatest potential market impact, according to BlackRock. That score is currently negative and far below its peak in 2014. The next two most influential risks, U.S.-China relations and European fragmentation, have climbed in recent months with the China score reaching a a six-year high.
The CBOE Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index fell to a four-month low on Tuesday.
Here’s what else Mateos y Lago had to say on geopolitical risks:
On vulnerable countries
On how investors can capitalize on changing political risks
On removing personal biases from geopolitical risk assessments
On rising geopolitical risks
On positive developments
On buying opportunities

928,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 01:29PM ET</span>","As millennials age, more U.S. companies look ahead to Generation Z","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a decade of focusing on the so-called millennial generation, some U.S. companies are starting to look ahead to what’s next. 
 Target  Corp (N:TGT) is introducing new in-house brands of shoes, apparel and accessories this year, geared toward customers who may not be old enough to drink legally. Apparel company Abercrombie & Fitch Co (N:ANF) launched a YouTube show hosted by online celebrity Hunter March rather than spending on television commercials to promote its Hollister brand of clothes. And pizza chain Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA) is investing more in online ordering, trying to catch up to Domino's Pizza Inc's (N:DPZ) lead in catering to a demographic that does not want to speak on the phone. 
It is all part of an effort to reach so-called Generation Z, the moniker given to the 68 million Americans born after 1997.
For companies, the focus on the youngest generation is not just about selling toys or video games. Instead, they are reworking their marketing and technology in order to appeal to a customer base that is more diverse than any other U.S. generation and grew up with streaming services like Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) that make watching television commercials seem foreign. 
Overall, Gen Z alone spends $44 billion a year, and influence an additional $600 billion in household spending, according to research firm Mintel. 
""There's a tendency to keep brands for life and you're seeing more companies trying to find themes that will speak to their future customers,"" said Bill Smead, a portfolio manager at Seattle-based Smead Capital who holds positions in companies like  American Express  Co (N:AXP) and Discovery Inc (O:DISCA) in part due to their success in marketing to Gen Z. ""Whoever wins this generation will be rich for a long time.""
Taken together, Millennials - those born between 1981 and 1996 - and Generation Z will form the largest population cohort in 2019, according to Pew Research. While both generations grew up with computers in their homes, members of Generation Z were too young to remember the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and were 10 or younger when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched its first iPhone, making mobile devices their primary means of connecting to the Internet and each other. 
That focus on mobile devices presents a special challenge to marketers, said Stefan Pollack, a public relations professor at the University of Southern California. ""While millennials share this trait, they straddle the world where traditional channels and messaging can still resonate,"" he said. 
As a result, companies that focus most directly on Gen Z have already had to change their marketing.  Education Realty Trust Inc  (N:EDR), which develops and manages college housing, upped its marketing budget by 19 percent in areas such as Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and is now emphasizing value over luxury to appeal to students who came of age during the Great Recession. 
""Our millennials have aged out and our Gen Z has come in, and so that’s a strategy adjustment,"" Christine Richards, the company's chief operating officer, told analysts in February. 
INVESTING IN 'SAVVY MARKETERS'
Matthew Litfin, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said that he has been adding to positions in software companies such as  Q2 Holdings  Inc (N:QTWO) and  Mindbody Inc  (O:MB) that make it easier for small companies like banks and yoga studios to have robust online apps that are similar to their larger competitors. 
""This is a gaming generation and they do not like to have to talk to somebody. If you can make day-to-day commerce more like a game they can play on their phones, they are more likely to engage,"" he said, citing Domino Pizza's early investments in online ordering - a category that now constitutes more than 60 percent of its sales.
""Our focus on digital efforts (is meant to) make certain that we are appealing to younger audiences, which will be the future of the overall business,"" Papa Johns chief executive Steve Ritchie said on the company's May 8th earnings call. 
Litfin, the Columbia fund manager, said that a company's plans for mobile apps is now becoming a litmus test for potential investments. 

""We favor companies that are savvy marketers,"" he said. ""The management teams that say that people don't care about mobile we quickly remove from our list.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Bill Gross' bond fund posted $300 million in withdrawals in the month of May, when it turned in its worst single-day performance since launching in 2014, data from research service Morningstar Inc showed on Tuesday.
Gross runs the Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, which had assets of $2.1 billion at the end of April, and was hit by sharp declines last month when bond market volatility surged on Italian political concerns.
Low-cost shares of the fund are down 4.25 percent this year through Monday, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit, near the bottom of its peer group.
Investors have fretted over Italy's difficulty installing a government, especially concerned that leaders of the euro zone country would try to leave the single-currency bloc or massively increase fiscal spending. Investors have fled Italian debt and flocked to safe-haven German bonds.
Yields on benchmark 2-year Italian bonds spiked from below zero percent on May 15 to as high as 2.7 percent by the end of the month, while the same type of German bonds moved from a high of negative 0.52 percent to as low as negative 0.85 percent during the month.
When investors clamor for more bonds, they bid up prices and yields fall. The opposite is true when investors rush to sell, sending yields higher.
Earlier this month, Gross told Bloomberg News that he has been betting that German government bond prices would fall while positioning for U.S. Treasuries to rise, adding that he expects to recover from what he described as a ""bad trade.""
""Investors in bond funds do not like such volatility particularly in a bond fund that is expected to generate stable income streams,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at New York-based CFRA Research.
A Janus Henderson spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Gross, once considered Wall Street's ""Bond King,"" co-founded Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management Co in 1971 but left abruptly in 2014 after a management rift and moved over to Janus. Gross is worth $2.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine.

937,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",China's ZTE to resume trading after $1.4 billion U.S. settlement,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063) said trading in its shares would resume on Wednesday, ending a two-month suspension, after the Chinese telecommunications giant agreed to pay up to $1.4 billion in penalties to the U.S. government and radically overhaul its management.
China's No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker was crippled when a seven-year ban was imposed on the company in April for breaking a 2017 agreement reached after it was caught illegally trading with Iran and North Korea. 
Last week, Reuters reported a preliminary deal included a $1 billion fine and $400 million to be paid by ZTE in escrow to cover any future violations.
As part of the deal, ZTE promised to replace its board and executive team within 30 days, open itself up to U.S. inspections of its sites and improve public disclosure of its supply chain. 
The ban, which traced back to a breach of a U.S. embargo on trade with Iran, had prevented ZTE from buying the U.S. components it heavily relies on to make smartphones and other devices. 
Confirming details of the agreement publicized by the U.S. government on Monday, ZTE said it would replace its board of directors and that of its import-export subsidiary ZTE Kangxun within 30 days of the June 8 order being signed by the United States. 
All members of its leadership at or above the senior vice president level will be removed within the 30-day period, with a commitment they will not be rehired, along with any executives or officers tied to the wrongdoing, it said. The U.S. commerce department can exercise discretion in granting exceptions. 
According to the agreement, ZTE will pay the $400 million in escrow into a U.S. bank account for 10 years, and hire an independent special compliance coordinator to monitor the company's activities during that period on behalf of the U.S. government.
ZTE, with a current market value of around $19.28 billion, is the world's fourth-largest telecom equipment maker after Huawei Technologies, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA). 

It also said in filings on Tuesday that it would work to resume operations as soon as possible after the ban gets lifted, and would republish its first-quarter financial results after assessing the impact of the ban and the settlement agreement.

938,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 12:42PM ET</span>",Your Money: Join the great chase for cheaper 'runcations',"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - For some people, the ideal vacation involves a lounge chair, a stiff drink with an umbrella in it and a whole lot of nothing.
Then there are people like Nick Smith.
The 34-year-old writer lives in Vienna, Austria with his wife and daughter, and when he goes on a trip, he does not like to just lay around. He runs a marathon.
The most recent: Florence, Italy. “One thing that's nice about combining running with vacations is seeing everyone else with the same idea,” said Smith, who just published his first book, ‘Kicks: The Great American Story of Sneakers’ and enjoyed visiting the Uffizi Gallery with other people in running gear after the race. 
Outside the running community, the idea might seem quirky, or even masochistic. But in running circles, the practice is extremely common, and even has its own name: Runcations.
Anyone who has been to a big running destination event, like marathons in Boston or New York City, knows how popular runcations can be. Almost 7,000 of Boston Marathon’s 2018 runners came from outside the United States, many of them staying in town three or four nights, according to the Boston Athletic Association.
Even Disney is in on the fun, offering a dedicated website (runDisney.com), and package deals to participate in themed events like the Princess Run or Star Wars Run. 
Of course, these trips do not come cheap. Although the Florence marathon entry fee was only $55, when you add in train tickets for a family of four in an overnight cabin, an Airbnb, entertainment and meals, Smith ended up being out $1,300 for the weekend.
“For runners, travel destinations' appeal can be greatly enhanced based on a popular race,” says Leah Etling, marketing director for trade group Running USA. “I'm a lifelong runner and traveler who never goes anywhere without going for a run -- and just got back from a trip to Molokai where I did just that.”
Like any activity (read: addiction), costs can spiral out of control if you are not careful. 
At the top end: Boston's Marathon Tours & Travel recently booked a trip for three generations of a single family who traveled to the Amazing Maasai Marathon in Kenya to celebrate a 50th wedding anniversary, which cost around $80,000.
The firm also offers an Antarctica Marathon and Half Marathon adventure, which costs between $8,000-$11,000 per person, depending on the type of cabin you want to book.
So how do you sign up for runcations, without running your family into the poorhouse?
* Make it a group event
If you are footing the bill alone for rental cars and hotel rooms, the totals can get uncomfortably high. The solution: Get some running buddies involved (not that hard, if you belong to a local running club).
That is what Florida financial planner Thomas Balcom has done for the last five years for “Tough Mudder” half-marathons in places from Las Vegas to Tampa to Phoenix, cutting his costs to around $650 a pop.
* Look for discounts
When Birmingham, Michigan financial advisor Michael Palazzolo goes on a runcation, he keeps an eye out for cut-rate deals for runners, which have been negotiated by race organizers.
“Many runs post a list of approved hotels where you can get discounts,” said Palazzolo, whose next runcation is a 7-miler though wine country in northern Michigan called the ""Harvest Stompede.""
* Make sure it works for the family
A destination marathon may be a once-in-a-lifetime accomplishment for you – but there are other people involved in the equation, too. And they may have very different ideas of what a vacation involves.
That is what Nick Smith learned during the Florence marathon. His dreams may have included jogging merrily across a sun-dappled Ponte Vecchio, but it ended up pouring the whole time, on runners and spectators alike.

“After the rain in Florence, my wife mandated that all future runcations either include an extra adult to help with childcare - or that the kids race with me,” he said.

The case is one offshoot of a long-running row that has also sparked litigation in the United States.
Olaplex, a firm based in California, argues L'Oreal infringed the UK patent for its ""Bond Multiplier"" products - a treatment mainly for use in salons which protects bleached hair and proved a hit with celebrities such as Kim Kardashian. 
L'Oreal, which at one point in mid-2015 was in takeover discussions with Olaplex, later launched a competing product, Smartbond, which the U.S. start-up claims dented its sales. 
The French beauty group denies accusations it had access to confidential information during the acquisition talks, and says no formal due diligence that would have given it greater access ever took place.
The UK High Court dismissed 10 out of 11 claims in the case filed by Olaplex, according to its ruling on Monday, but upheld one claim related to the ingredients in Olaplex's formula, marking a setback for L'Oreal.
Judges will later decide whether to grant an injunction against further sales of L'Oreal's Smartbond products, Olaplex said.

L'Oreal said it strongly disagreed with the court decision, adding: ""We will be applying for permission to appeal.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two large investors in Ranger Direct Lending Fund, Oaktree Capital Management and LIM Advisors, said they would continue a push to elect their board nominees at the closed-end fund that announced it was winding itself down.
Ranger Direct Lending is listed in the U.K. but is a mostly North American credit portfolio. A wind-down means Ranger will close down its investments and return its more than $200 million assets to shareholders.
On Monday, Ranger said it would abandon its plan to bring aboard Ares Capital Management as its investment manager, following pushback from activist shareholders who wanted the fund shut down instead. 
Ranger added that it would appoint additional independent directors to its board after consulting with shareholders to help shut down the fund, but does not support any board nominees selected by Oaktree, or another dissident shareholder that has nominated directors, Hong Kong-based investment adviser LIM Advisors.
Rangers' earlier plan to appoint Ares and continue to trade publicly was opposed by Oaktree, a Los Angeles-based alternative asset manager with $121 billion under management and the second-largest shareholder in the company.
Ranger did not respond to a request for comment on Oaktree's letter.
LIM Advisors is the third-largest investor in Ranger and also supports the shutdown. Together, the duo owns about 30 percent of Ranger's stock as of Monday. LIM said in a statement that Ranger's move to wind down the fund was a positive outcome, but urged shareholders to vote out the fund's chairman and to support the nominees proposed by both LIM and Oaktree.
While Oaktree supports Ranger's shutdown, it said in its letter Monday that the nominees it proposed, Dominik Dolenec and Greg Share, would help Ranger wind down the fund in an efficient manner.
A shutdown of the fund will see it halt investing in new loan portfolios and allow existing ones to mature, thereby returning cash to investors over a period of up to 18 months or so, according to a previous Oaktree letter.
Shareholders votes are due before this Friday, ahead of Ranger's annual general meeting on June 19. 
Ranger had a market capitalization of 129.95 million pounds ($173.86 million) on Monday.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's (N:BAC) co-head of consumer and business banking said on Tuesday he expects the consumer banking unit's efficiency ratio to remain flat or improve further as it cuts more costs tied to moving physical checks and cash. 
Speaking at a conference, Dean Athanasia said the closely watched figure measuring expenses per dollar of revenue would remain below 50 percent for the unit but did not provide a specific time frame for the outlook. 
The unit's efficiency ratio fell to 49.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared to 51.5 percent for full-year 2017 and 61.1 percent in full-year 2014.
The company earlier this year launched an artificial intelligence-based virtual assistant and plans to renovate 1,500 of its branches to include more automation. Athanasia said higher volume through the Zelle digital payment system launched in July 2017 would also help continue to improve costs. 
Athanasia also noted that consumers have been spending more and ""levering up"" following the U.S. tax code overhaul in December, and that Bank of America has been monitoring the borrowing of its clients across other banks but so far has not seen any issues in terms of credit quality. 
""Right now they're at a pretty good level,"" he said. ""We just watch diligently.""

957,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",U.S. tax reform reenergizes equity markets for utility companies,"By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. utility companies in 2018 are selling new stock at the fastest clip in at least a decade after tax reform passed last year left many with a cash-flow shortfall they needed to plug. 
By the start of June utility companies had issued almost $10 billion of common stock, by far the largest amount for this point in the year since the financial crisis, Thomson Reuters data showed. 
The need to issue equity highlights how tax reform, viewed by many as a giveaway to corporate America, has come at a price for certain utility companies, diluting the holdings of some shareholders and delivering a hit to credit positions.
""In the short term, tax reform has been viewed as credit negative for the utility industry,"" said Ann Bulkley, senior vice president at Concentric Energy Advisors, an energy consulting firm.
The tax bill, enacted in December, tightened the pace at which some firms can write down past investments. State governments meanwhile responded to the bill by ordering utilities to pass on the tax cuts to customers.

Both resulted in less cash on hand for some companies to pay for new projects to replace aging infrastructure, industry experts said.
""Tax reform turned the industry on its head,"" said Ray Craig, head of JP Morgan's (N:JPM) power and utilities equity capital markets.
""We've seen discrete equity issuance in the sector around M&A activity in the past. This is the first time in years where there have been discrete equity offerings to strengthen the credit metrics and strengthen the balance sheet.""
Equity raisings have come so far from the likes of Dominion Energy (N:D),  Duke Energy  (N:DUK) and  Entergy Corp  (N:ETR).
""Given that tax reform has changed the cash flow dynamic, more of the capital expenditure needs will have to be funded by equity than they had previously thought,"" Craig said.
Not all companies have sold shares to meet cash flow needs. Southern (N:SO) had the chance to sell some utilities at an attractive price, which had the ancillary effect of boosting cash flow.
To be sure, utility companies have welcomed the lower corporate tax rate and the continued ability to deduct an uncapped amount of interest payments from taxable income. 
Southern Chief Executive Tom Fanning said tax reform overall is a boost. 

""It gave us a need to raise equity,"" said Fanning. ""But it's still great for everybody, it's great for the customer base, it's great for the company.""

Morgan's stock price target for Micron is among the more conservative on Wall Street. Several other firms have the stock rising to $100 or more."

960,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",VW board to discuss prosecutors' probe into Audi CEO on Monday,"HAMBURG/BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) supervisory board will on Monday discuss German prosecutors' investigation into the head of its Audi brand, as the carmaker weighs up how to tackle the latest fallout from its 2015 emissions scandal, sources said.
Munich prosecutors said on Monday Audi (DE:NSUG) Chief Executive Rupert Stadler and another member of Audi's top management were being investigated for suspected fraud and false advertising and had their apartments searched.
Stadler has been under fire since Audi admitted in November 2015 - two months after Volkswagen - that it used illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests on diesel engines. 
The 55-year-old has held onto his post mainly thanks to the backing from members of Volkswagen's (VW) controlling Porsche-Piech families.
VW's supervisory board, which includes representatives of the ruling families, labor leaders, shareholders and officials from the group's home state of Lower Saxony, want to hear from the carmaker's lawyers what evidence the prosecutors have against Stadler, sources close to VW said on Tuesday.
Next Monday's board meeting was arranged a while ago and was not triggered by this week's move by the prosecutors to widen their probe into Audi, one source said.
News of the probe has come just as VW's new group CEO Herbert Diess is trying to introduce a new leadership structure and speed up the group's costly shift towards electric vehicles in the wake of its emissions scandal.
But recurring problems at Audi, the group's main profit engine, continue to pose distractions. Last month, the Ingolstadt-based luxury brand said it had discovered emissions-related problems with a further 60,000 cars.
An expert committee set up by VW's supervisory board in 2015 to lead internal investigations is due on Monday to brief the 20-strong board on its progress, another source said.
Munich prosecutors accuse Stadler of taking no action in late 2015 to stop deliveries of manipulated Audi models in Europe, a person familiar with the matter said. Stadler could not be reached for comment.
A source close to VW's supervisory board said support for Stadler from the Porsche and Piech families could dwindle if the probe found strong evidence of wrongdoing against him. For the time being, however, the families were still backing Stadler, he added. 

Before becoming Audi CEO in 2007, Stadler was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-VW chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of the group's controlling clan.

Christian Sewing, the new CEO of Germany's largest bank, said that the German and European markets were too fragmented, with disparate rules on insolvency, consumer protection, and mortgage securities. 
""We don't have a single market,"" Sewing told politicians in Berlin. ""At the moment, we have 28 individual markets.""
Sewing said that large banks are a ""gigantic advantage"" and needed to compete with financial institutions in the U.S. and China. But it doesn't make economic sense to create European champions at the moment, he said.
""Even if a lot has already happened in Europe, we are far from reaching our goal of building a common banking and financial market,"" Sewing said in prepared remarks.
Sewing's remarks appear to pour cold water on the idea of big cross-border mergers anytime soon.
Last week,  Deutsche Bank  downplayed the idea that a deal with cross-town rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) could materialize soon, after Bloomberg reported that top shareholders had been consulted about a potential tie-up.
""We will need strong international banks in Germany and Europe,"" Sewing said. ""And therefore the conditions for more consolidation must be created.""
""We call for a common European market and an end to the fragmentation of the banking system. Only then will we be able to stand up to non-European competition in the long run - at least in our home market of Europe.""

Ahead of the ruling, AT&T was up about 1% in early trading while Time Warner was higher by about 0.9%.
The merger, if permitted by Judge Richard Leon, is widely considered to be a harbinger of future media mergers that could radically shift how Americans consume television and movies going forward. Most notably,  Disney's ongoing offer to buy 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion, which Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is expected to compete against.
In its suit against AT&T, the Department of Justice alleges the merger would ""greatly harm American consumers"" through ""higher monthly bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy,"" Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said when announcing the suit last year.
President Donald Trump voiced opposition to the merger back in November on the day after the suit was announced by his administration. He said the deal is ""not good for the country,"" echoing similar statements he made on the campaign trail throughout 2016.
AT&T rebuffed those claims made by the Justice Department and Trump, saying  similar mergers are ""routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market.""
The merger is considered ""vertical"" because it would combine Time Warner, which makes programming, with AT&T, a distributor of that content, which  would then have access to more Time Warner brands like HBO, TNT, TBS, and CNN.
""Everything's on the line now for the Department of Justice,"" Gene Kimmelman, a former DOJ antitrust official who now runs a consumer advocacy group,  told the Washington Post. ""They either come out as enormous victors … or they’ll face an avalanche of new transactions if they lose this case."""

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said on Tuesday the No. 1 U.S. automaker currently has no projects underway with ride-sharing company Lyft, in which it has a 9 percent stake.
Rival automaker  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said last year it will collaborate with Lyft to deploy large numbers of Ford self-driving vehicles on Lyft's network by 2021.
Speaking to reporters ahead of GM's annual shareholders meeting in downtown Detroit, Barra said it could take several years for Japan's SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) investment in GM's autonomous vehicle unit Cruise to bear fruit.
Softbank said last month it will invest $2.25 billion in Cruise, one of the largest and highest profile investments to date in self-driving technology.
When asked about the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on steel and aluminum imports and ongoing efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, Barra said the issue was ""exceptionally complex.""
""We need to let negotiations continue and be completed,"" she said.

But Barra added that ""continued uncertainty (over trade) will eventually have an impact.""

973,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Tudor Jones Says Trading in Second Half to Be `Phenomenal',"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones said the second half of the year is going to be a “phenomenal” trading time when interest rates will move “significantly” higher as will stocks.
Jones said in an interview on CNBC Tuesday that if he ran the Federal Reserve it would increase rates by 150 basis points.
Jones, whose Tudor Investment Corp. has for years struggled to generate profits and keep investors, said that he doesn’t have many macro trades on now because the “reward and risk have diminished at this point in time.”
“I don’t like having positions -- and this is probably a fault of mine at times -- because I think ultimately interest rates are going up or I think the dollar’s going to go higher,” he said. “I much prefer to be leveraged right at that point when they move so I’m not subject to unexpected events overnight or over the course of weeks or months.”
Tudor’s main fund rose 1.2 percent last month, bringing returns this year to 7.6 percent, according to an investor document. It’s the biggest year-to-date return since 2013. One of Jones’s traders, Dharmesh Maniyar, posted a 13 percent gain this year in his new fund that uses machine-learning algorithms to help make macro trades. The fund, which started in October, got off to a poor start, slumping 8 percent in its first three months.
Trade Issues
Jones, 63, said discussions between global powers on tariffs needed to be put into perspective, describing the issue as a “trade irritant” rather than a trade problem.
“It’s a $40 to $50 billion problem in an $87 trillion world economy,” he said. “The danger is that he’s trying to do away with the bilateral trade deficits country by country,” Jones said, referring to President Donald Trump. “And there’s a problem with that because we are running a structural deficit.”
Jones described the outcome of the summit between Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as anti-climactic for markets. But he said an eventual deal may be Trump’s “crowning achievement” more than his tax cuts.
Jones was interviewed by CNBC to promote an exchange-traded fund that  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is starting with him that only invests in U.S. companies that engage in “just business behavior” as defined by his non-profit organization JUST Capital Foundation. The ETF will begin trading Wednesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are overweight U.S. equities for the first time in 15 months, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's latest monthly survey of funds showed on Tuesday, identifying global trade-war fears as a key factor hitting emerging market and European allocations.
The June survey of 235 participants managing a total of $684 billion showed that allocation to U.S. stocks rose 16 percentage points over the month to a net 1 percent overweight. Sixty-four percent of respondents thought U.S. companies had the best outlook for profits, the most in 17 years. 
All other regions had negative profit outlooks.
The increased U.S. allocation came at the expense of emerging-market and European equities, BAML said, adding that survey respondents expected an average 9 percent upside to the U.S. S&P500 index from current levels (SPX).
""Investors have their eyes on the U.S. this month with a record high favorable outlook for profits and a return to U.S. equity allocation,"" Michael Hartnett, BAML's chief investment strategist, told clients.
For graphic on month-on-month changes to positioning click https://reut.rs/2JDG15P
That rise in U.S. allocation came even though so-called FAANG and BAT (LON:BATS) technology shares were identified as the most ""crowded"" trade for the fifth month in a row. 
The FAANG category includes Facebook (O:FB), Apple (O:AAP), Amazon (O:AMZN), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google (O:GOOGL). BATs refers to China's Baidu (O:BIDU),  Alibaba  (K:BABA) and Tencent (HK:0700)
The BAML survey has been fairly prescient in spotting which popular trades could be about to unravel, ""short"" dollar being the most recent example earlier this year. 
Investors continued nevertheless to pile into tech, making the sector the biggest crowded trade since an overwhelming ""long"" dollar position in early 2017, BAML added.
Shorting U.S. Treasuries and going long on the dollar were the other two most crowded trades, at 16 percent and 9 percent respectively.
Meanwhile, allocation to commodities rose to a new eight-year high, with a net 7 percent overweight.
GRAPHIC - Tail risks : https://reut.rs/2JwGkDG
TRADE WAR FEARS PREY
There was no shortage of worries, however: cash holdings were 4.8 percent, above 10-year averages. Markets have been pressured by the prospect of increased U.S. tariffs on imports and also by politics in Italy, where two anti-establishment parties have formed a coalition government.
Survey participants' most commonly cited tail risk was trade war, identified by 31 percent of respondents. Twenty-six percent cited a hawkish policy mistake by the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank. Another 23 percent cited the risk of an emerging-market or euro debt crisis. 
For graphic on European autos earnings growth expectations click https://reut.rs/2JBTMSE
The Fed and the ECB both meet this week. The former is expected to raise interest rates; the latter to signal the timing of an exit from its stimulus program. 
With rates rising, concerns are also growing about corporate debt. A record-high net 32 percent of polled money managers considered balance sheets over-leveraged.
""June rotation shows investors are selling cyclical plays (such as) banks, emerging markets and euro zone equities in favor of defensive sectors and U.S. equities,"" BAML said.
Investors retained their European equity overweight but cut allocations to 18-month lows, citing trade-war fears and slower growth.
Among European funds, the trade threat drove the biggest- ever drop in allocations to auto stocks in the history of the poll, reflecting growing anxiety about potential U.S. tariffs on carmakers, the majority of which are listed in Europe. 
Positioning fell in June to its lowest in seven years, down to a net 15 percent underweight from a net 21 percent overweight last month. Banks were also cut to a net 3 percent underweight, with positioning down 20 percent from January peaks.
European funds' sentiment about their region's growth also reached its lowest ebb since the Brexit vote two years ago, according to the poll. A net 9 percent of European fund managers saw Europe's economy weakening over the next 12 months.
The market has flatlined in 2018, with a pan-European index (STOXX) down 0.3 percent year-to-date. Auto stocks (SXAP) such as Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have been especially vulnerable to trade tensions, having drawn the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump. Their expected earnings growth has slowed over the past year.

U.S. stocks, on the other hand, are up 4 percent this year, after robust economic growth and large corporate tax cuts.

LONDON (Reuters) - WPP's (L:WPP) decision to allow founder Martin Sorrell to quit with share awards worth millions of pounds faced fresh opposition on Tuesday as Hermes EOS advised shareholders to vote against the advertising giant's remuneration report.
Anger over the handling of Sorrell's departure is set to dominate WPP's annual meeting in London on Wednesday where investors will target the one issue that caused uproar during Sorrell's tenure - the amount he was paid.
WPP's incentive plans have led to opposition in the past, with Sorrell earning around 200 million pounds in the last five years alone. A third of WPP's investors refused to back his 70 million pound ($94 million) pay package in 2016. 
Sorrell's last award scheme could potentially pay out 20 million pounds but it is expected to come in well below that due to the recent underperformance of the group. 
Other shareholders are set to target the re-election of the WPP's chairman, Roberto Quarta, after Sorrell quit the world's biggest advertising firm following an inquiry into allegations of personal misconduct. Some investors have expressed concern about the handling of Sorrell's exit.
Neither Sorrell or the company have given any details of the complaint and the 73-year-old has since set up a rival ad firm. 
""Given the lack of confirmed information about the reasons for the former CEO's departure, we do not believe we can assess whether his termination package is appropriate,"" Hermes EOS' Pauline Lecoursonnois said in a statement. 
But in a boost to Quarta, two major shareholders, including WPP's biggest, told Reuters they still backed him. 
The Hermes decision to oppose the pay report, which governs executive pay in the year just gone, sees it break ranks with the world's biggest adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services, which last month said it would support it. 
The firm is readying for a sizeable rebellion against the remuneration package, with concerns within the company that more than a quarter of investors could vote against it. 
Investors are targeting the pay awards after WPP agreed Sorrell could leave with his long-term incentive plan intact, meaning his share awards will vest over the next five years as company targets are met.
CLARITY CALL
Hermes, which advises pension schemes and other institutional investors on how to vote at corporate meetings, said it backed all other agenda items. 
It also supported the re-election of Quarta, who, it said, had overseen an improvement in the board's effectiveness since taking over in 2015. 
Hermes said given the structural challenges facing the industry, the board needed to make the right CEO appointment and ensure all strategic options for the company were considered.
""We will be asking the chair for clarity on the key criteria the new CEO needs to meet, whether a formal review of the strategic options and of the portfolio has already commenced, how much can be done before the appointment of a new CEO and how the board is involved,"" Lecoursonnois said.
David Herro, Chief Investment Officer of international equity at WPP's (L:WPP) top fund investor Harris Associates told Reuters he also backed the re-election of the board.
""(We support WPP on) board re-election. I want to make sure on the rest,"" Herro said in an email.
Harris has a 7.5 percent WPP stake, according to Thomson Reuters data.
A second top-20 investor, who wished to remain anonymous, said he also backed Quarta.
""We are supportive of the chairman who has handled a very difficult situation well in circumstances neither of his making or choosing.""

The projection by researcher LMC Automotive assumes automakers would absorb at least half the cost of a tax on imported vehicles, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting. If companies pass the full 25 percent cost on to consumers, it could snuff out about 2 million sales, or more than 10 percent of annual U.S. deliveries, he said.
President Trump’s order last month to investigate auto imports for potential trade penalties on national security grounds came as a surprise and quickly drew criticism from automakers, dealers and Republican lawmakers. While some analysts discounted it as a negotiating tactic to pressure Canada, Mexico and the European Union on trade, Trump has since attacked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau following the G-7 summit in Quebec.
Trump’s statements may merely be “chest thumping,” Schuster said. But after the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from countries including Canada and Mexico, the threat of new levies must be taken seriously. “The escalation is starting to happen,” he said.
If Trump follows through with the 25 percent tariff, Schuster said U.S. consumers would likely react in three ways. Some would look to the used car market, especially lightly used cars coming off lease. Others would shift to domestically produced vehicles with cheaper price tags. And a third group might just postpone buying a new car, under the assumption that the tariffs are the result of a temporary political spat.
Trump ordered the investigation into auto imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the same power he used to impose global tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.
While U.S. metal producers have been ravaged by global overproduction and depressed prices, the car market is much healthier. Sales have been slipping from a record of almost 17.6 million units in 2016, but LMC predicts a still-strong 17.1 million deliveries this year, and vehicles sold at record average prices approaching $33,000 last month."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks slipped on Tuesday and the dollar retreated from a three-week high after a U.S.-North Korea summit aimed at the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, while Washington committed to providing security guarantees for its old enemy.
The MSCI All-Country World index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell nearly 0.1 percent on the day. The dollar (DXY) slipped into negative territory in morning trade in Europe after earlier reaching a three-week high. It was last flat on the day.
Investors had mixed reactions to the summit, which ended with the signing of a joint statement that gave few details on how the goals set by both sides would be achieved. 
""Any de-escalation is good, because in the background you always have worries about these situations,"" said Old Mutual Global Investors European fund manager Ian Ormiston, adding trade conversations over the weekend at the G7 summit were more concerning.
Others, such as RBC Capital Markets' head of Asia FX strategy Sue Trinh said there was ""nothing particularly game-changing"" about the summit and both sides stood far apart on what denuclearization means.
""To the U.S., it means North Korea must deliver complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. To Kim, it means North Korea suspends nuclear and missile tests in exchange for major economic concessions and the U.S. stepping back as torchbearer for the Asian region.""
In Asian equity markets, trading was volatile with Japan's Nikkei (N225) paring early gains to close 0.3 percent higher after earlier rising as much as 0.9 percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) seesawed between positive and negative, and was last up 0.15 percent. South Korean shares (KS11) were weaker while Chinese shares were buoyant after starting in the red. The blue-chip CSI 300 index (CSI300) jumped about 1.3 percent.
Europe had a muted open, with the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index last up less than 0.1 percent (EU). Futures indicated a lower open on Wall Street. (ESc1) (NQC1) (N)
FOCUS SHIFTS TO CENTRAL BANKS
Investor focus was shifting to the two major central bank meetings later this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, where it is widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year.
Futures contracts indicate a 96 percent probability the fed funds rate will be raised a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, according to CME Group (NASDAQ:CME).
Investors are focused on how the U.S. central bank characterizes its monetary policy as borrowing costs return to normal amid an economic expansion. The Fed may signal whether it feels the era of loose money is, in effect, over.
U.S. inflation data due later in the day will also add to speculation over the path for U.S. interest rates later this year. Markets now are pricing in slightly more than one chance in five rates will be raised for a fourth time this year.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank meets, and some expect the Bank to provide guidance for an ending of its bond-buying program at the end of this year.
The spread between Italian and German 10-year borrowing costs narrowed as the U.S.-North Korea summit drew to a close, adding a relief rally on reassuring comments from Italy's new economy minister [GVD/EUR].
In currencies, the dollar was 0.1 percent lower against a basket of its peers. (DXY) [FRX/] It jumped to a three-week top  against the yen of 110.49 and was last at 110.25.
The British pound was up 0.1 percent  as a crucial parliamentary debate began on amendments to Britain's European Union withdrawal bill. [GBP/]
The euro (EUR=) was flat.
In commodities, U.S. crude (CLc1) was down 0.3 percent to $65.94 per barrel. Brent crude (LCOc1) fell half a percent to $76.07.

982,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Shareholder pushes for changes at flavor maker Senomyx: letter,"By Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - A shareholder is calling on flavoring company  Senomyx  Inc (O:SNMX) that works with PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) to drop its current chairman, to sell itself and add a new board seat, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters.
One of the company's large shareholders, Matthew Turk, who said he owns 4 percent of shares, or more than 1.9 million shares of common stock, is skeptical of the San Diego company's announced plans to explore a strategic review, and hopes to turn around its fortunes after its stock has lost 78 percent of its value since it went public in 2004, the investor said in the letter on Tuesday.
The flavors and ingredients space has been undergoing consolidation and growth as food multinationals, facing slowing growth for legacy food and drinks brands, adjust their offerings to appeal to new and healthier tastes. Last month, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (N:IFF) agreed to buy Israeli flavors and ingredients maker  Frutarom  Industries Ltd (TA:FRUT) for $7.1 billion in cash and stock.
""There must not be a slow liquidation of Senomyx, but rather a complete sale either in whole or in parts as quickly as possible to preserve remaining shareholder value,"" Turk said.
Senomyx, which had a market capitalization of $62.8 million at the close of trading on Monday, could not immediately be reached for comment.
The company has seen its stock decline since Pepsi stopped a trial partnership involving using Senomyx ingredients in drinks such as Mug Root Beer ahead of what was widely expected to be a U.S. nationwide rollout in late 2016.
The company still has a non-exclusive agreement with Pepsi that runs until 2019, where Pepsi has access to natural flavor ingredients and sweeteners that were developed during their partnership, according to a news release. Pepsi could not be reached for comment.
Since changing the terms of its deal with Pepsi, the management team has not set up any new commercial partnerships despite claiming to have interest from at least 25 companies, Turk said.

Moller-Maersk, to replace outgoing financial boss Chris Lynch when he retires in September, the Anglo-Australian mining company said on Tuesday. 
Lynch’s retirement was announced last September, triggering a search for a replacement to maintain the financial strength of a company with the strongest balance sheet of the major miners. 
Stausholm stepped down as CFO at Moller-Maersk in March after the company decided to separate the finance role from its IT and digital transformation function.
His former boss said he had been one of the drivers of the Danish company's strategic transformation from a broader conglomerate including an oil business to a more focused shipping company. 
From 2008 to 2011 Stausholm, 49, was CFO of facility services provider  ISS A/S  (CO:ISS). 
Before that, he worked in the oil industry with jobs at  Statoil  (OL:EQNR), Woodside Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa). Rio CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a statement that Lynch left Rio Tinto a stronger company than when he began in 2013. 
Commodity markets crashed in 2015-16, dragging down mining companies, and have since recovered, with Rio Tinto standing out for its shareholder returns.""Chris has helped embed a disciplined focus on costs and capital allocation,"" Jacques said in a statement. 
Rio Chairman Simon Thompson said Stausholm’s experience would enrich Rio Tinto's board discussions and ensure the continued focus on ""disciplined capital allocation and the pursuit of superior shareholder value"". 
Analysts are unanimous that Rio Tinto has a very strong balance sheet, but some bankers say the company is under increasing pressure to buy assets and diversify its portfolio after a series of sales and a mounting pile of cash. 
Following Tuesday's announcement, Rio Tinto shares were down 0.5 percent at 4,397 pence on the London Stock Exchange.

Overall, markets were largely unmoved by a promise by the United States and North Korea made at a historic summit to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

BMW said plans to retool its China factory to produce the X3 locally, rather than importing it from the United States, had hurt availability of this volume model in the world's largest car market.
Furthermore, customers in China have held back orders after the country announced it will lower tariffs on imported cars from 25 percent to 15 percent from July 1 onwards.
Pieter Nota, BMW's board member for sales, said: ""In the second half of the year, the X3 will once again become fully available worldwide, bringing increased sales momentum in the third and fourth quarters.""

Meanwhile in Germany, several bank holidays in May caused fewer working days compared with last year, and Hamburg said it will ban the most polluting diesel vehicles from two streets, hitting demand for such cars.

OAKLAND, Calif (Reuters) - A Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) employee organizing a union was asked by a supervisor and company security guards to leave the factory after handing out pro-union flyers, the worker said at a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) hearing on Monday over whether Tesla had violated federal safeguards for employee activity.
The NLRB general counsel brought the case before a board administrative law judge after receiving complaints from three Tesla workers and the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW).
If Tesla loses, the company could be required to notify its employees that it was found to be committing unfair labor practices, a victory for union organizers.
The case comes as Tesla has struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3, a sedan intended for volume production that is key to the company achieving long-term profitability.
Edris Rodriguez Ritchie, an attorney for the NLRB, said Tesla asked workers to sign confidentiality agreements that were ""overly broad"" in preventing them from publicly discussing their working conditions.
Tesla has denied the allegations and described them as an effort to make Chief Executive Elon Musk look bad.
Michael Sanchez, who has worked at Tesla since 2012 and is currently on medical leave, said he was asked to leave by security guards and a supervisor while handing out leaflets to colleagues outside a Tesla facility in February 2017.
""What we see is a very heavy-handed, anti-union campaign that's affected all levels of workers' everyday lives,"" said Margo Feinberg, attorney with Schwartz, Steinsapir, Dohrmann & Sommers in her opening remarks for the UAW, which supports the NLRB counsel in the case.
Speaking on behalf of Tesla, Mark Ross of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP listed about two dozen other allegations against the company that were found to be without merit and dismissed.
""The fact of the matter is that Tesla is a company that values its employees,"" Ross said in his opening remarks.
In a series of tweets in May, Musk said he had not done anything to prevent unionizing efforts by workers. ""Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted,"" Musk tweeted on May 20.

Hearings for the case are scheduled to continue through Thursday and resume in late September. Judge Amita Tracy is expected to deliver her judgment sometime after that.

1018,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>",U.S. Lawmakers Seek to Restore ZTE Penalties in Defense Bill,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Senate plans to advance legislation to restore penalties on ZTE Corp (HK:0763)., after President Donald Trump drew sharp criticism for easing restrictions to get the Chinese company back in business.
The Senate is voting late Monday to start debate on the defense authorization bill for fiscal 2019, and Senators said the ZTE measure has been included.
“Great news! Our bipartisan amendment restoring penalties on #ZTE is included in the #NDAA bill the Senate will be advancing to later this evening,” Rubio said in a Twitter post.
Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, is co-sponsor of the amendment, with Senators Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, and Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last week announced the U.S. reached a deal with ZTE that includes a record fine, changes to the company’s board and management and U.S. compliance officers.
The U.S. blocked ZTE’s access to U.S. suppliers in April, saying the company violated a 2017 sanctions settlement related to trading with Iran and North Korea and then lied about the violations. The telecommunications company announced it was shutting down just weeks after the ban was announced.
Broad Deal
Trump has said he reviewed the penalties as a personal favor to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Lifting the sales ban on ZTE was a key demand China made in the broader trade talks with the U.S. to avert a trade war between the world’s two-largest economies.
The deal has sparked bipartisan pushback, with many lawmakers citing national security as their main concern.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Sunday likened the deal to “three strikes you’re out,” referring to two prior violations ZTE committed under the sanctions agreement with the U.S.
Ross was planning to brief senators on the ZTE deal Monday, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said.
Van Hollen said the move is a very good sign for stopping the ZTE deal. “What you are seeing is a bipartisan reaction against letting ZTE off the hook” he said.
The quick action to stop Trump from rolling back the ZTE penalties shows the seriousness of the issue, Senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
“The fact that a bipartisan group of senators came together this quickly is a testament to how bad the Trump administration’s ZTE deal is and how we will not shy away from holding the president’s feet to the fire when it comes to keeping his promise to be tough on China,” Schumer said."
1019,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 06:03PM ET</span>","Quebec offers C$100 million in loans, guarantees to firms hit by U.S. metals tariffs","By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - The Canadian province of Quebec will offer C$100 million ($77.1 million) in loans and guarantees on loans to steel and aluminum companies hit by recent U.S. tariffs, the province's economy minister said on Monday.
Companies that transform the metals will benefit from the program after the United States recently slapped a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports.
Economy Minister Dominique Anglade told reporters in Montreal that the program came after aluminum and steel companies received feedback from clients who are not willing to pay the tariffs.
“What they’re telling us is some of their contracts were canceled,"" she said, adding some had already slowed down production.
Anglade said the impact of the tariffs on metals had been felt quicker than when the United States announced tariffs on softwood lumber in 2017.
""The value of the impact is hard to assess,"" she added. ""We’re seeing something that we haven’t seen in softwood lumber.“
She said the industries generated about 30,000 jobs in the mostly French-speaking province.
Large Quebec aluminum producers, which have higher margins and benefit from greater economies of scale, did not ask for such a program and would not have access to it, Jean Simard, president of the Aluminum Association of Canada, told reporters in Montreal.
Anglade said her government would meet next week with industry to reassess the program.

1021,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>",Trade Risks Are Evident in Markets If You Look Hard Enough,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Following the disastrous Group of Seven summit this weekend, where President Donald Trump upended a carefully crafted effort at unity among the world's top economic powers, it's safe to say that most investors were probably expecting equities to stumble Monday. Instead, the MSCI All-Country World Index of global stocks closed at its highest level since March 14.
A sign of complacency? Perhaps, but digging a little deeper beyond the market headlines reveals a good amount of jitters over the potential for a budding trade tiff to devolve in a legitimate trade war. That can be seen in the performance of the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 Index, whose constituents are mainly domestic companies with hardly any international operations that would be exposed to tariffs and a higher dollar. The gauge closed at a fresh high on Monday, extending its gain this year to 11.2 percent. By contrast, the S&P 500 Index, which is chock full of companies with international exposure, is up only 4.05 percent this year. That marks a reversal from 2017, when the S&P 500 gained 19.4 percent while the S&P SmallCap rose just 11.7 percent. Here's another way that investors are putting a greater premium on companies that might be insulated from a trade war: At 20.3 times expected earnings, small-cap stocks are more expensive than bigger peers in the S&P, which has an average price-to-future-earnings ratio of 17.5 times. The gap of 2.84 times has expanded from 2.16 at the end of March.
""The idea that small caps might provide a ‘trade war hedge’ or ‘dollar hedge’ is preposterous, but it’s one that many investors may have accepted as an excuse to rotate into small cap risk,” Peter Cecchini, the global chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, wrote in a research report at the end of May and repeated on Monday. ""We continue to feel strongly that equity markets broadly will soon respond to building global risks, just as Treasuries and volatility markets have.""
THE EURO IS SAFE — FOR NOW
The Great Italian Debt Crisis of 2018 is over. Maybe. If you blinked, you may have missed it. The Bloomberg Euro Index was poised to close Monday at its highest level in almost three weeks after Finance Minister Giovanni Tria made assurances that the country would stay committed to the shared currency. Tria told the Corriere della Sera newspaper over the weekend that there was “no discussion” to leave the common currency and that the government would also block any market conditions that would “push toward an exit.” The Bloomberg Euro Index fell to its lowest since July at the end of last month on just such a possibility, while Italian stocks and bonds tumbled. But Tria's comments show that — once again — betting on a member of the euro leaving the currency bloc is a fool's errand. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi didn't even have to reassure markets that he would do ""whatever it takes"" to make sure the euro didn't break up, as he did in 2012 when Greece was on the precipice. Italy's benchmark FTSE MIB Index of stocks surged 3.42 percent Monday in its biggest gain since April 2017. Italian 10-year bond yields fell 29 basis points to 2.84 percent. While that is still far above the 1.71 percent level from where they traded in late April, recall that they had reached 3.44 percent at the end of May amid concern about the country’s future in the euro area after the Five Star Movement and the League — two euro-skeptic parties — formed a coalition.
VOLATILITY RULES EM FXOne of the biggest laments of investors has been the lack of volatility in financial markets globally. Maybe they should look at emerging-market currencies, where the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Emerging-Market Volatility Index has just jumped to its highest since March 2017. By contrast, the CBOE Options Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures equities, is at about its lowest since January, and the Merrill Lynch MOVE Index covering bonds is well below its highs for the year. It certainly has been interesting times for emerging markets. Last week featured two surprise interest-rate hikes, a market meltdown in Brazil, Argentina’s $50 billion International Monetary Fund loan rescue, rising fears of a trade war and the realization that the end is nigh for stimulus in Europe, according to Bloomberg News. The currencies of Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and South Africa are experiencing the world’s biggest increases in their implied volatility gauges this quarter amid the worst period for developing-nation currencies since China’s shock devaluation in the third quarter of 2015, according to Bloomberg News's Srinivasan Sivabalan. The worst-hit is Turkey’s lira, whose measure of one-month implied volatility jump 159 percent and is near its highest level since January 2009.
 
OPEC FISSURES
The coming meeting between OEPC and its allies in Vienna on June 22-23 is shaping up to be a can't-miss event.

Although the report suggests a potential schism in Russia's alliance with OPEC to curb production, it's notable that Saudi Arabia raised production last month to the highest since October, Bloomberg News reported, citing a person familiar with the kingdom’s disclosures to the cartel. President Vladimir Putin of Russia said last month that the “arrangements were never intended to remain in force forever.” “Russia’s key argument would be that the deal has reached its goal -- the market is balanced -- and now it’s time to think of a supply increase,” Andrey Polischuk, an energy analyst at Raiffeisen Centrobank in Moscow, told Bloomberg News. Hedge funds cut their net-long position in West Texas Intermediate — the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a drop — by 3.3 percent to 313,450 futures and options during the week ended June 5, the least since October 2017, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. WTI has closed below its 50-day moving average every day since the start of the month, a bearish signal, according to Bloomberg News's Jessica Summers.
SOUTH KOREAN RISKSMany pundits will certainly opine on whether the historic summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a success and which side came out on top. For a more impartial view, keep an eye on markets, specifically the market for credit-default swaps tied to South Korea government bonds. A rise in the cost of the derivatives could signal that investors think the U.S. failed to make much headway in getting Kim to give up his nuclear weapons; a decline the opposite. Regardless of the outcome, investors might want to consider betting on a rise in the swaps, according to  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management. Prices of the swaps are hovering near the lowest in more than a decade, suggesting investors see little risk in owning the underlying government debt. “It’s very attractive to buy protection,” said Jean-Charles Sambor, the deputy head of emerging-market fixed income at BNP Paribas Asset, who oversees the equivalent of $671 billion globally, told Bloomberg News. “The risks are asymmetric. That’s a good way to hedge your portfolio.” Five-year credit-default swaps on Korean notes have fallen nine basis points this year to 43.5 basis points amid easing tensions in the Korean peninsula, according to Bloomberg News's Lilian Karunungan. It’s the cheapest among the contracts offered by seven major emerging markets in Asia based on data compiled by CMA.
TEA LEAVESIt's a big week for global geopolitical and economic news. Besides the Trump-Kim summit, the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan will hold policy meetings with big implications. But there's no shortage of investors who feel that biggest news of the week will be Tuesday's U.S. inflation report. The report could either fuel or damp concerns that i nflation is accelerating and help determine whether the Fed raises rates three or four times this year. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is that the U.S. will say its consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in May, excluding food and energy costs, compared with a gain of 1 percent in April. That translates into a 2.2 percent increase from a year earlier, the most since February 2017. Recall that April's CPI report fell below forecasts, spurring a rally in stocks and bonds while causing the dollar to drop. Even so, ""a significant share of policy makers opined at the May (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting that the underlying inflation trend may not have actually changed; rather, it might merely have been lifted temporarily by transitory factors, such as financial services costs,"" Bloomberg Intelligence economists Carl Riccadonna and Niraj Shah wrote in a preview report published Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - All three major U.S. stock indexes closed slightly higher on Monday as investors eyed the looming United States-North Korea summit on Tuesday in Singapore while shrugging off the weekend's factious meeting of the Group of Seven nations.
President Donald Trump announced the United States' withdrawal from the G7's joint communique following a series of bellicose tweets aimed at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after the Canadian leader announced retaliatory tariffs on goods imported from its ally to the south.
The markets seemed to take the trade row in stride and looked instead to the impending summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, an historic effort to bridge differences and avoid nuclear confrontation on the Korean peninsula.
""With the G7 everyone knew there were issues going into it and probably nothing would get done,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. ""The focus is on the possibility of something good coming out of the Singapore summit."" 
""There's been a net improvement in the minds of investors in terms of international security, (and) there seems to be a willingness to talk on the part of North Korea.""
Investors are also anticipating this week's meetings of three of the world's top central banks: the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. 
The Fed is widely expected to raise key interest rates on Wednesday, and on Thursday the ECB is seen moving toward a roll back of its crisis-era stimulus scheme.
""With the (Fed's) rate increase we're going to get on Wednesday, we're going to be close to the core inflation rate,"" Hellwig said. ""On the other hand, economic numbers look great."" 
Yields of U.S. government bonds rose as the Treasury Department saw solid demand at auctions for $54 billion in new three and 10-year notes ahead of the Fed meeting.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 5.78 points, or 0.02 percent, to 25,322.31, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 2.97 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,782 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 14.41 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,659.93.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, four closed in negative territory, including real estate <.SPLRCR>, utilities (SPLRCU), technology (SPLRCT) and financials (SPSY).
 Sempra Energy  (N:SRE) was the biggest percentage gainer of the S&P 500, ending the day up 15.5 percent on the news that activist investors urged a strategic review and recommended new directors for the company's board.
Boston Scientific Corp (N:BSX) helped boost the healthcare sector as its shares advanced 7.4 percent following a Wall Street Journal report that rival  Stryker  Corp (N:SYK) had made overtures to acquire the medical device maker.
AT&T Inc (N:T) closed 1.0 percent higher, a day ahead of a court decision regarding its proposed merger with  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX). 
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) gained 1.3 percent after Keybanc analysts said Instagram could be the company's primary growth driver.
UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH) climbed 1.2 percent, providing the biggest boost to the Dow.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 170 new highs and 26 new lows.

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",VW's Skoda says might outsource production to meet demand,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Czech brand Skoda said on Monday it might outsource some production to a contract manufacturer as the division looks to respond to booming demand.
Already grappling with stretched capacity at its Czech plants, demand for its new sport-utility vehicles could lead production at Skoda to surge to 2 million cars by about 2025 from 1.2 million currently, the automaker has said.
VW's labor boss Bernd Osterloh last week told Reuters that shifting some production to Germany by 2019 will not solve bottlenecks at Skoda, which has passed Audi (DE:NSUG) to become the second-most profitable unit at VW group after sports-car brand Porsche.
""There is a wide range of options to cover order peaks,"" Skoda said in an emailed response to a question from Reuters, adding that taking advantage of unused capacity within the multi-brand VW group will not do the trick.
""For that reason we keep looking into alternatives that also include possible contract manufacturing,"" Skoda said. ""Demand is exceeding our production capacities also in 2018."" 
Major carmakers including Germany's big three BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and VW routinely use contract manufacturers such as Magna (TO:MG) or Finland's Valmet Automotive to outsource production, earning them greater flexibility while saving investments in their own facilities and resources.
Valmet is hiring up to 1,000 new staff this year to help build the Mercedes GLC sport-utility vehicle and the new A-Class compact.

Osterloh said a decision on how to boost Skoda's output will likely be reached by November when VW's supervisory board, of which he is a key member, is due to ratify the German group's rolling budget on capacity, technology and equipment.

Most of the advertising giant's shareholders vote ahead of time, so the company knows the results in advance, although they are not announced until the day. A spokesman for WPP could not be reached for comment.
The AGM has received much media attention because of the high-profile departure of Sorrell, the architect of WPP's success and a titan of the industry over decades.
Up to 20 percent of shareholders oppose the re-election of WPP chairman Roberto Quarta to the board, Kleinman tweeted, without citing sources.
He said some investors were unhappy about remuneration arrangements that Sorrell will continue to enjoy after he has left.
Sorrell quit WPP after the board opened an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct.

The company has not given any details and Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing. He told staff he had stepped down because the disruption of the investigation was putting too much pressure on the business.

1027,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 04:27PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. U.S. Inflation Data on Tap
As the Trump-Kim summit is expected to dominate news flows, the release of core inflation could steal some of the spotlight ahead of Wednesday's widely expected Federal Reserve rate hike.
Economists expect the core consumer price index (CPI) due 08:30am ET, to show unchanged growth of 0.1% for May, while core year-on-year CPI is expected rise 2.2% from 2.1% in April.
An uptick in the pace of inflation has reignited investor expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes, as analysts at Goldman Sachs claimed the market was not fully pricing the prospect of more aggressive rate hikes.
The Fed hike path is much more hawkish than futures market pricing, Goldman Sachs said, forecasting three and four rate hikes in 2018 and 2019, respectively, with the risk of four rate hikes in 2019 skewed to the upside.
The dollar made a subdued start to the week despite bouncing off session lows which followed a retreat in the EUR/USD.
2. API Data, OPEC Monthly Report Eyed
The monthly OPEC report due Tuesday is likely to garner special attention after WSJ reported Friday Saudi Arabia had increased production by more than 100,000 barrels a day in recent weeks.
OPEC's estimate on non-OPEC output will also be closely watched after the oil-cartel in its previous report predicted non-OPEC supply would rise by a further 80,000 barrels per day this year to 1.71 million barrels.
On the domestic front, a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) due Tuesday will also be in focus as recent data on weekly crude supplies has contrasted from the Energy Information Administration's report – released a day later Wednesday.
The American Petroleum Institute reported last Tuesday crude oil stockpiles fell by 2.028 million barrels. That was in sharp contrast to the Energy Information Administration report showing crude supplies rose by 2.9 million barrels.
Oil prices pared losses Monday as Iraq's oil minister warned producers against easing limits on production curbs.
Crude oil futures on Monday settled 36 cents higher at $66.10 a barrel.
3. Trump-Kim Face-to-Face Looms
U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea Chairman Kim Jong Un are slated for a historic face-to-face meeting in Singapore on Monday 9PM ET.
Ahead of the meeting, preliminary talks between the two nations were making quick progress, the White House said.
Following the initial greeting, President Trump and Chairman Kim will participate in a face-to-face meeting, an expanded bilateral meeting, and a working lunch.
The United States is seeking a firm commitment from Kim Jong Un for complete denuclearisation. While Kim reportedly wants the United States to loosen its crippling economic sanctions against North Korea.
Trump's expectations for a prolonged meeting with Kim were unexpectedly cut short, however, after the North Korean leader set a deadline for ending talks in Singapore.
Any potential signs of a setback in talks could pressure risk appetite, stoking demand for safe-havens such as the yen, Swiss franc and Gold Futures."

The cyber heist is the latest in a string of such attacks, including one in May in Mexico in which thieves used phantom orders and fake accounts to steal hundreds of millions of Mexican pesos out of the country's banks, including Banorte. 
Shares in the Bank of Chile, which is controlled by the Chilean Luksic family and  Citigroup  (N:C), were down 0.47 percent at 100.4 Chilean pesos ($.16) in mid-day trading.
Bank CEO Eduardo Ebensperger told Chilean daily La Tercera in an interview on Saturday that hackers had initially used a virus as a distraction, prompting the bank to disconnect 9,000 computers in branches across the country on May 24 to protect customer accounts. 
Meanwhile, the hackers quietly used the global SWIFT bank messaging service to initiate a series of fraudulent transactions that were eventually spotted by the bank and canceled but not before millions were funneled to accounts abroad.
""The [attack] was meant to hurt the bank, not our customers,"" Ebensperger said.
Ebensperger said a forensic analysis conducted by Microsoft (O:MSFT) had determined the attack was the work of a sophisticated international group of hackers, likely from eastern Europe or Asia, and that the bank had filed a criminal complaint in Hong Kong.
The bank said in a May financial statement that it would work with insurers to recoup the lost funds.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",U.S.-bound flight diverted to Ireland after security scare,"By Alana Wise and Graham Fahy
NEW YORK/DUBLIN (Reuters) - A United Airlines flight from Rome to Chicago was diverted to Ireland's Shannon Airport on Monday after a message perceived as a potential security concern was discovered on board, Irish police and airline officials said.
The message made reference to a bomb on the plane, a source with knowledge of the investigation told Reuters. 
The 207 passengers and 11 crew members disembarked from the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 767-330 at Shannon Airport at 2:15 p.m. local time, according to Jim Molloy, a representative of Ireland's police force.
The passengers of flight UA971 were in the process of being searched, he said in an emailed statement, but gave no further details about the nature of the threat.
United said in a statement that the landing was due to ""a potential security concern,"" but declined to comment further.
""After assessing the situation, our crew made the decision to divert to the nearest available airport,"" it said. ""Additional security screenings will be performed on all customers and baggage.""
The airline said on Twitter that the flight was now canceled and would depart for Chicago on Tuesday.
The U.S. government was aware of the incident and seeking to establish whether there was any violent intent behind the threat, a U.S. government source familiar with the investigation told Reuters.
A second U.S. government source said similar incidents involving threatening notes found on airplanes happen about once a week. 
The handwriting on the note was being analyzed to see if it matched with any other such notes, which are periodically found on aircraft, one of the sources said. It was not clear whether the note was posted in the bathroom prior to takeoff or during the flight. 
Police were also taking handwriting samples from the passengers, the Irish Times reported. The message was found in the plane toilet, it said, without citing sources.
The United jet completed its descent after jettisoning some of the fuel loaded for its transatlantic crossing, according to recordings on air traffic control site LiveATC.net.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) shareholders have endured a painful year amid worries about prospects for its many businesses, but investors capitalizing on the stock's relatively cheap valuation may be set to apply a Band-Aid to the declines.
Shares of J&J, the largest U.S. healthcare company by market value, had slumped 11.2 percent this year as of Friday's close, although recent gains may indicate the start of a rebound. The stock's year-to-date decline compares to more than 2 percent gains for both the S&P 500 healthcare sector (SPXHC) and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), of which J&J is a member. 
If J&J ends the year with its current 11.2 percent decline, 2018 will be the worst calendar-year performance in 25 years for the stock, a bellwether for the healthcare sector and one traditionally considered a safe-haven investment during periods of market uncertainty.
The diversified company, whose products include Band-Aid bandages, Tylenol pain reliever, replacement knees and cancer and immunology medicines, faces concerns in all three of its main segments - pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer. 
But the stock's swoon makes it look particularly cheap, based on its price-to-earnings ratio of 14.8 times forward earnings estimates, which is enticing investors, along with the stock's above-market dividend yield of 2.9 percent.
""We are much more upbeat about J&J today than we were six months ago,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York, as the stock traded just above $120 a share. 
""We definitely think it’s an attractive investment opportunity,"" Katz said.
J&J shares are up more than 3 percent in June, following five straight months of declines, the stock's longest such losing streak in over a decade.
J&J's pharmaceuticals segment, roughly half of company revenue, saw sales jump by 19 percent in the first quarter. But concerns about generic-drug competition eroding sales of prostate cancer medicine Zytiga, a standout in the first quarter, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade have investors leery about the segment's future performance.
Pharmaceuticals has been the strongest segment of J&J's businesses, but ""the ability to sustain an above-average growth rate has been a question,"" said Dean Dillard, senior research analyst at USAA Investments in San Antonio.
J&J's medical devices segment including its orthopedics business has been losing market share, said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager focusing on healthcare for Gabelli & Co. 
Performance in J&J's consumer segment has been ""pretty lackluster for a few quarters,"" Jonas said. The division also may be subject to weak investor sentiment in general for consumer brand companies, amid fierce competition and other concerns.
“There is concern around all three of the businesses,” Jonas said.

J&J shares may also be suffering from concerns about scrutiny over prescription drug costs that are undermining pharmaceutical shares broadly.
""Sentiment remains fairly negative for the group, so that by and large does not help Johnson & Johnson,"" said Kevin Gade, a portfolio analyst, who follows pharmaceutical stocks at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati.
VALUATION ATTRACTIVE
The stock's recent valuation at 14.8 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months is its lowest since late 2015 and well below its five-year average of 16.5 times, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.
J&J is also trading at a nearly 10 percent discount to the S&P 500 (SPX), compared to the slight premium it has held over the benchmark index on average over the past five years.
Also appealing, investors said, is J&J's dividend yield of 2.9 percent compared to 1.9 percent for the S&P 500, as well as the company's track record of consistently raising it.
Aside from paying its dividend, some investors want J&J to use its cash for a stock buyback or for an acquisition to improve its growth prospects. 
J&J is ""capable of doing 10 $5 billion transactions. We don't have to do a $50 billion transaction,"" Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso told an investor conference last week.
J&J's broad healthcare portfolio, which offers products that people will require even in economic down times, helps position it as a safe-haven stock in the event of market volatility or an increasingly uncertain economy. 

“If and when the economy sees negative growth,"" Gade said, ""relative to the market, Johnson & Johnson is the type of company and business model an investor would want to hold.""

1039,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Gaming the Fallout from a Trade War on the Fed's Rate Plans,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. economy is charging through the second quarter at a growth rate that currently looks to be faster than 3 percent, and I have argued that an interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve this week and in September are basically a lock. What could go wrong with this forecast? Plenty. 
For example, there's the potential contagion from either an emerging-market or European financial crisis. Also, the economy faces an imminent threat from the Trump administration’s decision over the weekend to escalate an already ill-advised trade war. These events could roil the Fed’s plans, possibly leading to an early pause in the tightening cycle. 
But we can’t rule out the possibility that a trade war has the opposite effect on monetary policy with toxic outcomes for financial markets. Currently, the Fed looks on course for three --and maybe four -- rate hikes in 2018 of 25 basis points each. With economic growth sufficient to put downward pressure on an already low unemployment rate, central bankers will seek to push policy rates to a neutral level. Otherwise, the Fed believes the economy faces a risk of overheating.
Escalating trade battles potentially impact this forecast by causing demand to contract and supply shocks. An example of negative demand shocks are retaliatory tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods and farm products. If America’s trading partners focus primarily on tariffs that narrowly target firms in Republican leaning states, such as levies on Tennessee whiskey, Harley-Davidson motorcycles and cheese, the overall impact on economic activity will be fairly minimal. 
Narrowly targeted retaliation by our trading partners will thus induce more political and local pain than aggregate weakness. And note that some of the overall damage on manufacturing will be mitigated by the rebound in oil prices and associated increase in drilling activity. If the overall economic impact of such retaliation is minimal, so too will be the Fed’s response. To be sure, if the negative demand shock is stronger than I expect, the Fed will see diminishing risk of overheating and change policy in a more dovish direction.
More interesting than demand shocks, which have straight forward implications for policy, is the possibility that the Trump administration’s approach yields an escalating supply shock that restricts the productive capacity of the U.S. Such shocks both constrain economic activity and raise prices. The U.S.-imposed tariffs on steel are a perfect example. Indeed, the possibility of a broad-based disruption from such tariffs is exactly why a nation should be wary of targeting intermediate goods in a trade war.
It is tempting to conclude that the Fed will react to a negative supply shock via tighter policy, especially when central bankers already face the prospect of an overheated economy. This, however, will not be the case as long as the Fed believes inflation expectations remain well-anchored. Rather than shift to a more hawkish stance, the Fed will look through any spike in prices as temporary and instead focus on the negative impacts on economic activity. If they conclude that those negative impacts will continue even after the price shock fades, central bankers might even shift to a more dovish stance.
The Fed would be driven in the opposite direction if the economy faced a series of negative supply shocks, global trade conflicts escalate and those shocks trigger a change in consumer behavior such that inflation expectations become tilted to the upside. That kind of shift occurred in the late 1960’s, leading to the Great Inflation period. With that episode still looming large in the Fed’s psyche, policy makers would respond with a more hawkish policy stance.
The last case represents a worst-case scenario for financial markets, in that it's a toxic combination of faster inflation, weaker growth and tighter monetary policy. It would also put the Fed in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. I very much doubt President Donald Trump would sit quietly and respect the Fed’s independence if economic growth faltered. To be clear, this is not my baseline scenario. My baseline is that the scope of the trade impacts in aggregate are too limited to change the direction of policy. But market participants should remain wary of risks to this baseline. "
1040,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 01:51PM ET</span>",KKR to take Envision private for $5.57 billion in healthcare push,"By Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) - KKR & Co (N:KKR) said on Monday it will buy Envision Healthcare Corp (N:EVHC), one of biggest U.S. providers of physicians to hospitals, in a deal valued at $5.57 billion as it builds up its healthcare portfolio.
The private equity firm beat peers  Carlyle Group  (O:CG), TPG Global and others as it sealed the deal for $46 per share - a premium of 5.4 percent to Envision's last close on Friday.
Envision's shares rose 2.5 percent to $44.76, their highest in nearly eight months. Including debt, the deal is valued at $9.9 billion.
KKR already owns Envision's ambulance unit AMR, which it bought for $2.4 billion last year and merged with its helicopter ambulance service. The firm also took WebMD Health Corp  private for about $2.8 billion.
Private equity firms, armed with a record $1 trillion in cash, are investing more in public companies than at any time since the financial crisis.
Take-private deals worldwide reached a decade-high of $109 billion last year, according to data provided to Reuters from industry tracker Preqin.
KKR itself said last month it would buy business software company BMC Software, in a deal that could be worth about $8.5 billion with debt, according to Reuters' sources.
As of March 31, KKR had $176 billion in assets under management. It held $1.88 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to its latest earnings report.
The Envision deal is the latest in a spate of mergers and acquisitions among physician networks, a business that has struggled in recent years to adapt to changes in how U.S. health insurers reimburse providers.
The deal marks an end to Envision's plan to find strategic options, which the company launched after posting disappointing third-quarter results last year.
The company has been hit by lower patient admissions at hospitals - a trend that has plagued healthcare services providers in the United States.
As part of its strategic review, Envision had reached out to around 25 potential buyers over the last seven months.
UnitedHealth Group Inc's (N:UNH) OptumCare had also expressed interest in the company, Leerink analyst Ana Gupte wrote in a note.
""We see the arms race for ambulatory care delivery continuing and likely to remain a strategic focus for OptumCare, HCA ... as well as not-for-profit hospital and health systems, and private equity,"" Gupte said.
Ryan Daniels, an analyst with William Blair, said the purchase price was a fair multiple for Envision given a number of headwinds facing the industry. Daniels also said there was little to no possibility of other bidders emerging.
Reuters reported the deal on Sunday, citing a source. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.

It was advised by J.P. Morgan, Evercore and Guggenheim Securities.

LONDON (Reuters) - Italian borrowing costs fell sharply on Monday, narrowing the gap over German peers after the economy minister said the new coalition government had no intention of leaving the euro zone and planned to cut debt levels.
In his first interview since taking office a week ago, Giovanni Tria told the Corriere della Sera newspaper on Sunday the coalition was committed to remaining in the single currency and wanted to boost growth through investment and structural reform.
Tria also distanced himself from calls within the coalition for the government to issue securities to pay individuals and companies owed money by the state - a measure seen in markets as first step to exiting the euro.
""Maybe Tria's comments are a bit more blunt and reassuring than markets were expecting and that explains the move in Italian bonds, but we are still in an illiquid market for BTPs (index-linked Italian government bonds) and that's illustrated in the market reaction,"" said ING senior rates strategist Martin van Vliet. 
Italy's two-year bond yield tumbled 60 basis points to 1.08 percent (IT2YT=RR) in volatile trade. Ten-year bond yields fell 30 bps to 2.83 percent (IT10YT=RR), their biggest one-day fall in six years, squeezing the gap over benchmark German Bund yields to 235 bps from 268 bps late on Friday. 
Tria's comments provided some reassurance for investors, rattled in the past month by fears that the coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star and far-right League would embark on a spending splurge. 
One of the most radical proposals was the issuance of ""mini-BOTs"" - securities to pay individuals and companies who are owed money by the state as payment for services or as tax rebates.
""The mini-BOT proposal is inflammatory, so he (Tria) is saying the right things,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research and Daiwa Capital Markets. 
""However you have to question how much influence he will have on the new government. The range of issues he is talking on raises question marks about the agreed program between 5-Star and League,"" he said.
As Italian bond prices rose, pushing yields down, demand for safe-haven German bonds waned.
Germany's 10-year Bund yield was up 5 basis points at 0.50 percent (DE10YT=RR).
""I would say we'll see some choppiness in the next few months because of uncertainty over what direction the (Italian) coalition will take,"" said Mike Stritch, chief investment officer for BMO Wealth Management. ""But we are in an environment of relatively strong global fundamentals and in the EU specifically we are continuing to get relatively positive momentum on the economic front.""
The rise in safe-haven German bond yields came as fears of a global trade war weighed on broader markets after U.S. President Donald Trump backed out of a joint Group of Seven communique over the weekend.
Thursday's European Central Bank meeting also loomed. 
With the bank set to debate whether to end massive bond purchases this year, and a policy shift anticipated either on Thursday or in July, a key gauge of the market's long-term inflation expectations - the five-year breakeven forward rate - rose to four-month highs.

""June or July, the bottom line does not change: net asset purchases are set to end soon,"" said Luigi Speranza, head of European economics at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).

(Reuters) - Sheetrock maker  USG Corp  (N:USG) accepted a $7 billion cash offer from German construction products maker Gebr Knauf KG on Monday after three months of back-and-forth negotiations that began when longtime USG shareholder Warren Buffett teamed up with the German bidder to sell his stake.
The companies agreed to a $44 per share deal, a bump from the $42 initially offered by the private German family-owned company in late March. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc had a 31 percent stake in USG and has said previously it would offload its stake. 
USG shares rose about 3.7 percent on Monday to $42.98.
USG opened the door to private talks after weeks of public resistance in early May ahead of its annual shareholder meeting, when proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co sided with Buffett's push to engineer talks.
USG had called the initial takeover offer “wholly inadequate, opportunistic” given the company's improving fortunes under a turnaround plan. 
USG CEO Jennifer Scanlon said on Monday that her company's board had evaluated all strategic options to maximize value for shareholders and believes the deal will benefit employees and create new opportunities for both companies' customers. 
The price represents a premium of 31 percent to USG’s closing price of $33.51 before the talks started and a 36 percent premium to the $32.36 average closing price for the preceding 12-month period as of March 23, according to a statement.
The Berkshire Hathaway investment dates back to 2001, when Buffett helped the company out of bankruptcy with a loan that was later converted to a stake in the company's equity so large that a wholesale acquisition of the entire company remained one of the few ways for Berkshire to exit the investment without pushing down the share price. 
Knauf said the company will keep USG's headquarters in Chicago.

 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) was Knauf's financial adviser, while JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) advised USG. Baker McKenzie LLP, Shearman & Sterling LLP and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer were Knauf's legal advisers, while Jones Day was legal counsel to USG.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 12:41PM ET</span>","With assembly team and samosas, IKEA lays ground for India debut","By Subrat Patnaik and Anna Ringstrom
MUMBAI/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA is set to open its first store in India next month, and the world's biggest furniture retailer is localizing its offering - from the food menu to its ""do-it-yourself"" (DIY) assembly model - to ensure success in the country.
IKEA, which aims to soon open a 400,000 square feet (37,160 square meter) store in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, is setting up its first ever in-house assembly team and offering local delicacies such as samosas to woo shoppers, at a time when growth in some of its more established markets is slowing.
""The entry point has been that the identity was going to be the same,"" said IKEA's finance head Juvencio Maeztu. 
""But, for example, Indians like firm mattresses so you need to adapt the mattress offering. And we are developing a mattress that has a coconut layer because it is cooler for the summer,"" said Maeztu, adding such customization would be seen in items ranging from cutlery to showroom layouts.
India's furniture market is largely dominated by unorganized retail and local vendors, and consumers are used to enjoying the comfort of made-to-order or fully assembled furniture delivered to their doorsteps.
The ""do-it-for-me"" culture is very prevalent in India, said Sowmya Adiraju, an analyst at research firm Euromonitor, adding IKEA would have to look into delivery and assembly needs to woo Indians.
While IKEA's popular DIY furniture is well known, it is also sometimes parodied as shoppers are at times overwhelmed by the task of assembling intricate units. 
The Swedish retailer is setting up a 150-member team to help assemble furniture and is also partnering with UrbanClap, an app-based service that connects people with everyone from tutors to carpenters.
The IKEA in-house assembly team will be more a little more expensive than UrbanClap's services, said Patrik Antoni, IKEA's deputy head in India.
The companies both declined to reveal pricing details, but currently UrbanClap charges customers about 250 rupees ($3.73) for a 30-minute carpentry job, such as installing IKEA's popular Billy bookcase. In comparison, TaskRabbit, the services platform acquired by IKEA in 2017, charges U.S. shoppers a minimum of $36 for any installation job.
LOCAL TASTES
IKEA has visited more than 800 homes in India to see how people live across the country, said Maeztu, who led IKEA's India team before moving to take on his new global role earlier this year. 
While the Hyderabad store will have spacious room designs, its Mumbai store will pack a lot more product into a smaller space to reflect the city's apartment sizes. 
""You need to understand what life's about and then the range is presented to give solutions to the needs and frustrations,"" Maeztu said.
Like many international restaurant chains in India, IKEA is also changing parts of its menu to suit local palates.
To cater to Hindu sensitivities it will not sell its beef meatballs in the country, but serve chicken and veggie balls instead, while also offering shoppers biryani, samosas and veggie hotdogs, said IKEA's Antoni.
One winning formula that IKEA plans to stick with is low price points, by offering 1,000 products priced under 200 rupees ($2.97), said IKEA Group CEO Jesper Brodin, adding it was keen to avoid missteps made in Australia and China, where its initially higher pricing discouraged potential customers. 
Although IKEA plans to gradually ramp-up local sourcing, one challenge to keeping prices low will be taxes, said Brodin. ""I'd say the biggest challenge for us is (import) duties. That's not something we can do something about.""
BIG BET, BIGGER RISKS
The foray into India comes at a time when IKEA's growth has slowed in some of its established markets, pushing it to enter new markets such as Chile and India, while developing its digital offering and smaller city center store formats.
IKEA Group's company-owned stores in 2017 grew retail sales by 4 percent. In comparison sales in India's homeware and home furnishing stores grew some 9 percent, according to Euromonitor.
Still, IKEA, which has already sunk about $670 million into India, will face stiff competition in the Indian market from a slew of online furniture start-ups such as Pepperfry, UrbanLadder and FabFurnish, so success will come at a price.
IKEA's Antoni said the company, which had initially expected to invest $1.56 billion to set up 25 traditional stores by 2025, was already looking to spend more than originally planned and eyeing experimenting with non-traditional formats too.
CFO Maeztu said some of the initially planned 25 stores would likely be in new formats. The first four would however be the classic giant out-of-town warehouse stores to cement the image.
The company, which has bought land in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai and Gurugram is also looking to expand into five other markets - Surat, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai and Pune, said Brodin. 

""This is our next really big market,"" said Brodin, while warning it would take years for the company to see major profits from the market.

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",U.S. embassy warns citizens to consider leaving district in north Mozambique,"By Manuel Mucari
MAPUTO (Reuters) - The U.S. embassy in Mozambique said Americans should consider leaving a northeastern district close to a major gas field as imminent attacks are likely after suspected Islamist militants beheaded 10 people and killed seven others since May.
Any sign of militant activity is a concern for the country's fledgling gas industry and the area around the town of Palma near the Tanzanian border where the attacks took place is close to one of the world's biggest untapped offshore gas fields.
""We strongly advise American citizens in the district headquarters of Palma to consider departing the area immediately,"" the embassy said on its website, warning of the ""likelihood of imminent attacks.""
More than $30 billion is expected to be invested in Mozambique's natural gas sector to build capacity to produce 20 million tonnes per year of LNG, with the first exports from the fields discovered seven years ago due to start after 2021. 
Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) is seeking to raise a record $14-$15 billion from banks and export credit agencies for its huge liquefied natural gas (LNG) project there, sources close to the matter said in May.
""We take very seriously any potential threat to the safety of our employees and we continue to closely monitor the situation in the Palma area,"" Anadarko said in an email reply to questions.
The company declined to comment on reports it had suspended work on its massive LNG project in the war-scarred southeastern African country. 
The Interfax Global Energy website, citing local sources, said militant attacks had caused work at the LNG site in Palma to be suspended. 
Six men wielding machetes killed at least seven people and injured four others this month in the predominantly Muslim region close to the Tanzanian border and 10 were beheaded last month.
Mozambique has not been a focal point of Islamist militant activity in the past and police have been reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists.
Mozambique has little history of militant activity and police are reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists.

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Two ex-Penn West executives must face U.S. SEC fraud charges,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has ordered two former finance executives at  Penn West Petroleum  Ltd, now known as Obsidian Energy Ltd (TO:OBE), to face regulatory charges that they helped engineer a multi-year accounting fraud to reduce the Canadian company's operating expenses.
In a decision made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan said the Securities and Exchange Commission's complaint raised a ""strong inference"" that Todd Takeyasu and Jeffery Curran intended to defraud investors.
Prior to being terminated in 2014, Takeyasu had been Penn West's chief financial officer, and Curran reported to him as vice president of accounting and reporting.
The SEC accused them of helping to move hundreds of millions of dollars to capital expense accounts from operating expense accounts, reducing reported operating costs and making oil extraction activities appear more profitable and efficient.
""In light of all of the facts alleged, the SEC sufficiently pleads that Takeyasu and Curran were at least aware of improper accounting practices and did nothing to correct them or to otherwise ensure the strength of Penn West's internal controls,"" Woods wrote, without ruling on the merits.
Richard Albert, a lawyer for Takeyasu, said his client ""looks forward to the substantial factual record refuting the SEC's claims coming to light, and to ultimately prevailing.""
Helen Gredd, a lawyer for Curran, said the portrait of her client in the SEC complaint ""bears no resemblance to him,"" and that Curran looks forward to showing the regulator's allegations are meritless.
Both lawyers commented in emails. Woods' 42-page decision is dated June 9.
Obsidian agreed in November to pay an $8.5 million civil fine to settle related SEC charges.
The Calgary-based company did not admit or deny wrongdoing. It paid about C$53 million (US$41 million) in 2016 to settle related shareholder litigation.
Penn West was once among Canada's largest oil and gas producers, producing around 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but downsized by selling most assets.
Its adoption of the Obsidian name was an effort to distance itself from Penn West's past, including a September 2014 restatement of more than two years of financial statements.

The case is SEC v Takeyasu et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-04866.

LONDON (Reuters) - European banking stocks and Italian shares jumped on Monday after Italy's new economy minister promised to keep the country in the euro, dissipating investors' fears of a euro zone break-up and boosting sentiment after a fraught G7 summit.
Euro zone banks (SX7E) rose 3 percent, helping the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) gain 0.8 percent while Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) jumped 3.4 percent and Spain's IBEX (IBEX) 1.6 percent.
Italian bank stocks (FTIT8300) climbed 5.9 percent, their biggest one-day gain in more than 13 months, as bond yields fell, with relieved investors buying back into Italian assets after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria vowed on Sunday to stay in the euro and cut debt levels.
Traders said Tria's comments sparked short covering, exacerbating the move.
Italian banks Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) led the European index, both up more than 6 percent. Italgas (MI:IG) and Poste Italiane (MI:PST), which had been weighed down by political uncertainty, also made strong gains.
Swiss voters' rejection of a campaign to radically alter the banking system also helped boost sentiment. Switzerland's stock index (SSMI) was up 1.3 percent with banks  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and UBS (S:UBSG) leading gains.
Swiss consumer goods heavyweight Nestle (S:NESN) rose 1 percent.
Optimism over European politics helped investors shrug off a fractious G7 summit marked by stark divisions between the United States and allies over trade. 
U.S. President Trump backed out of a joint G7 communique and fired off a volley of angry tweets after the summit.
""Ostensibly this should not be good for risk, though markets appear deaf at present to such rumblings,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com. 
The only sign of concern around trade was in the autos sector (SXAP) which was the worst performing, down 0.5 percent. 
""Countries need to wake up to the fact that Trump is going to deliver on trade,"" said a trader at a German bank. ""He will tax German autos.""
Politics aside, merger and acquisition news drove the biggest moves in individual stocks. 
Top of the STOXX 600 was  Inmarsat  (L:ISA), surging 12.7 percent to a five-month high after rejecting a takeover offer from U.S. firm Echostar (O:SATS). 
Bid speculation over the British satellite company had driven the shares up on Friday but the company's confirmation came only after the market had closed. 
""Echostar's approach puts Inmarsat clearly into play,"" said RBC analysts, pointing to SES (PA:SESFd), Eutelsat (PA:ETF), ViaSat, mobile operators and private equity as potential counter-bidders for the company. 
Ocado (L:OCDO) shares rose 11.1 percent after Bernstein analysts gave the British online grocer a double upgrade to ""outperform"" and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts upgraded it to a ""buy"". 
The stock is already up more than 150 percent this year, boosted most recently by a distribution deal with U.S. supermarket Kroger (NYSE:KR).
""Ocado's announced partnership with Kroger was transformational in our opinion,"" wrote GS analysts.
""Though the stock price moved materially to reflect this, our analysis at a local market level points to a U.S. opportunity more than double Kroger's initial commitment.""

LONDON (Reuters) - London's status as Europe's leading hub for the tech sector will help it weather Brexit despite the best efforts of Paris, Berlin and others to compete, the British capital's mayor Sadiq Khan said on Monday.
Britain has for years been the top European destination for foreign investment, but a survey by accountancy group Ernst & Young (E&Y) on Monday showed Germany and France closing the gap.
According to 450 global investors surveyed by E&Y, Germany was considered the most attractive place in Europe for future investment, with France second and Britain third. Paris was named the most attractive city for investment, overtaking London for the first time since the survey began in 2004. 
But Khan said investments in London's tech sector, from the likes of Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Google (O:GOOGL), plus the city's strength in new technologies including artificial intelligence, gave him hope that London would keep on attracting entrepreneurs and funding from around the world. 
""Berlin and Paris start from a low base, and frankly speaking can only go one way,"" Khan told Reuters on Monday at the London Tech Week conference. 
""London is different to the rest of the UK. Our underlying strengths - we're the financial capital of the country, the cultural and political capital - that's not going to change.""
Britain is due to exit the European Union on March 29, 2019 but with a transition period to ease the process.
A survey released last week by London's promotional agency showed Britain remains the leading European destination for international tech investors, attracting almost three times more venture capital investment than any other European country over the past two years.
UNCERTAINTY
But Khan, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU, said he worried about the rest of the country and whether it could attract foreign investment at a time of such uncertainty. 
Campaigners for remaining in the EU warned before the referendum that investment in Britain would fall if it voted to leave the world's biggest trade bloc.
While some international finance jobs have moved to Europe, Khan said investment in new technologies gave him faith for the future. 
But Khan added that he would continue to hold tech companies to a high standard, demanding that social media groups take responsibility for the content that appears on their site. 
Khan has also previously backed transport officials in their move to strip the ride-hailing company Uber of its license. 

""Social media companies ...need to do more,"" he said. ""They need to make sure that they themselves take responsibility for these problems rather than regulation being imposed on them.""

1071,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Moody's cites 'positive' moves in new Illinois budget,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The fiscal 2019 Illinois budget enacted last week includes a voluntary pension buyout plan and a boost in school funding, which are credit-positive moves for the relatively low-rated state and its school districts, Moody's Investors Service said on Monday.
The $38.5 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1 incorporates $423 million in savings that would be generated by current or former public-sector workers choosing to accept a buyout of their pensions or a retirement benefit in exchange for cash raised by the sale of up to $1 billion of state general obligation bonds.
""The state’s buyout offer is credit positive because it will generate significant pension liability savings to the extent that employees accept the offer,"" Moody's said, adding that actual savings could fall short if participation fails to meet targets of 22 percent of vested former workers and 25 percent of retiring current workers.
Moody's is the second major credit ratings agency to weigh in on aspects of Illinois' new budget. Last week, S&P Global Ratings, which rates the state one notch above junk at BBB-minus with a stable outlook, said the new budget does little to tackle Illinois' financial problems.
Illinois' adjusted net pension liability for its five retirement funds was $201 billion in fiscal 2016, the highest on a revenue and gross domestic product basis among the 50 states, according to Moody's.
Moody's, which also rates Illinois a notch above junk at Baa3 with a negative outlook, said actuarial projections for the State Employees' Retirement System indicate the buyout plan could result in significant present-value savings.
It added that the actual impact on the budget and the state's pension funding requirements will not be known until late in fiscal 2019. 
""As a result, the state faces a risk that the plan will either increase its underfunding of pension contributions or add to a backlog of unpaid bills,"" Moody's said.
Meanwhile, the budget's $350 million funding increase for primary and secondary public schools is credit-positive for the districts ""because it increases funding consistent with last year’s change to the state aid formula,"" according to Moody's. 
It added that schools continue to face risks due to Illinois' history of delaying grant payments for transportation and other costs and from a possible future shift onto districts of pension costs currently paid by the state.

Vehicle platforms make up 60 percent of the material costs for a new car, and PSA platforms come with modules for engines, seats, restraints, cockpits and infotainment systems that can be used by various brands, Opel said in a statement.
""Thanks to the jointly used platforms we will, depending on the programs, save between 20 percent and 50 percent of the development costs of every new Opel/Vauxhall model compared to its predecessor,"" Opel Chief Executive Michael Lohscheller said.
The new Corsa, which will make its world premiere next year, is currently being developed on PSA's compact platform, Opel said. The Grandland X SUV and the family-friendly Combo Life leisure activity vehicle (LAV) are based on the EMP2 platform, Opel said.

PSA last year bought loss-making Opel and British sister brand Vauxhall from General Motors (N:GM) in a $2.6 billion deal.

The Swiss bank asked each of its analysts to round up their top three stock picks for the next six to 12 months, resulting in a massive list of 94 equities, or about 15% of the stocks covered by its research department.
""These should not be viewed as portfolios,"" the bank warns. Rather, it says, ""they are simply a current snapshot of the analysts' top picks in their coverage universes."" So if you're looking to dive into a particular sector, these may be the places to start.
We've rounded up Credit Suisse's top pick for each sector and included the bank's take on why it's worth investing in. Scroll to check out the full list:
Ticker:  FMC
Sector: Chemicals & Agricultural Science
Year-to-date performance: -6.89%
Credit Suisse’s take: ""We see significant opportunities for growth in the ag business while the current pullback in the stock due to market concerns around lithium have created a compelling value opportunity.""
Ticker:  X
Sector: Metals & Mining
Year-to-date performance: -1.86%
Credit Suisse’s take: ""The US flat rolled market is firing on all cylinders, as (a) seasonally demand is accelerating and peaks in 2Q, (b) scrap prices recover from historically low levels at the start of winter, and b) S/D fundamentals benefit from limited imports and a strong US/global economy. We like X for its strong leverage to the cycle, accretion from its Granite City BF restart, and likely asset sales as the company refocuses on its core steelmaking operations.""
Ticker:  SEE
Sector: Paper & Packaging
Year-to-date performance: -12.2%
Credit Suisse’s take: ""We believe recent share price weakness offers an attractive entry point. In part, we believe weakness has been driven by near-term resin cost headwinds that we view as passing. We believe SEE has entered a period of strong EPS growth."""

It's a sentiment Goldman Sachs seems to have taken to heart when compiling its forecast for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which is set to kick off on June 14.
The firm used machine learning to run 200,000 models, mining data on team and individual player attributes, to help forecast specific match scores. Goldman then simulated 1 million possible variations of the tournament in order to calculate the probability of advancement for each squad.
The tournament bracket below shows how Goldman sees the World Cup unfolding. Note that the numbers next to each nation — which dictate whether they advance over their opponent — represent the predicted, unrounded number of goals scored in each possible iteration of the tournament, based on machine learning results applied to countless scenarios.
""We are drawn to machine learning models because they can sift through a large number of possible explanatory variables to produce more accurate forecasts than conventional alternatives,"" a group of strategists from Goldman's international research team wrote in a client note.
Here are the key takeaways from Goldman's data:
With all of that established, football (soccer) remains a highly unpredictable sport, with many more variables in play than even Goldman could assess. Which is why the authors of the report offer this disclaimer at the end:
""We capture the stochastic nature of the tournament carefully using state-of-the-art statistical methods and we consider a lot of information in doing so,"" they said. ""But the forecasts remain highly uncertain, even with the fanciest statistical techniques, simply because football is quite an unpredictable game. This is, of course, precisely why the World Cup will be so exciting to watch."""

1092,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",German Carmakers Caught in the Middle of Looming Tariff Threats,"(Bloomberg) -- BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) face a double whammy of trade risks in an intensifying spat between the European Union and the U.S. Both carmakers ship significant numbers of vehicles from the E.U., and also export from U.S. plants.
U.S. president Donald Trump renewed threats to impose tariffs on auto imports, hitting out at the bloc’s standard 10 percent import tariff on cars -- higher than a 2.5 percent American duty on auto imports and 25 percent on sport utility vehicles. With Trump extending tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to include the EU on June 1, and a heated meeting of G7 leaders in Canada over the weekend, Germany said Monday that retaliatory action on U.S. products could be ready by July 1.
As a result, German carmakers have to worry not only about the potential for higher costs when they ship cars to the U.S., but also any retaliatory measures that affect the cars they produce in North America and send to the EU.
The manufacturers are already rethinking the way they produce in the U.S. BMW, which exports SUVs made at its plant Spartanburg plant in South Carolina, said the company could switch to making sedans there instead in the case of tariffs, purchasing chief Markus Duesmann told German magazine Automobilwoche.
Doing so would be “complex, but doable,” Duesmann said in the interview. BMW is the leading U.S. car exporter by value, shipping vehicles worth some $10 billion last year.
Mercedes produces the GLE, GLS and GLE Coupe SUVs and C-Class sedans at its Tuscaloosa plant in Alabama, while Audi in 2016 opened a plant in Mexico.
The consequences of auto tariffs would be “significant” as carmakers sell regionally, but compete globally, Joe Hinrichs, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.’s head of manufacturing, said in speech reported by the Financial Times.

1093,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",`This Is the Uber Market': Tech IPOs Soar Past Their FAANG Peers,"(Bloomberg) -- While the titans of technology are feeling the pain of a possible sector rotation, a more youthful class of stocks in the sector are beating the market at a 16-to-1 pace this year.
Successful initial public offerings by closely watched companies like Dropbox Inc. (up 43 percent through June 8) and Spotify Technology SA (up 30 percent) have helped boost excitement for U.S. tech debuts of all sizes and from all regions. And the momentum may continue into Uber Technologies Inc.’s expected offering next year.
The group’s best-performing stock is Guangzhou, China-based Huya Inc., which operates a live-streaming game platform and has risen 191 percent since its May IPO. Other top performers include Internet security firm Zscaler Inc. (up 153 percent), digital subscription billing platform Zuora Inc. (up 109 percent), electronic signature firm DocuSign Inc. (up 100 percent), and Chinese video streamers iQiyi Inc. (up 82 percent) and Bilibili Inc. (up 65 percent).
These fledgling IPOs have risen 66 percent on average, weighted by offering size, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Listings in other sectors have returned an average of 11 percent. While a volatility bomb could rattle these relatively high-risk investments at any time, momentum could continue for another year until Uber Technologies possibly goes public, Triton Research CEO Rett Wallace said on Bloomberg TV.
""Some people think this is the Uber market, that we’re just going to run until the Uber IPO happens,"" he said last week. ""People get excited for the big ones.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) did this, Snap did this. The market opens up getting ready for a big one -- and then it will change its nature.""
In total, 80 percent of 2018 U.S. tech listings are trading above their respective IPO prices. ""There seems to be no differentiation between the good ones and the bad ones,"" said Wallace, whose firm analyzes Silicon Valley companies preparing to go public. The deals have raised about $8 billion so far this year.
While Uber looms over the market, other tech companies are looking to capitalize on the rampant buying right now. Web-based sales tax management company Avalara Inc. is scheduled to price its IPO this week, while financial planning software maker Adaptive Insights Inc. had expected to do the same before it was unexpectedly bought by Workday Inc. for $1.55 billion on Monday.

1096,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 09:03AM ET</span>","Rolls-Royce, preparing to cut thousands of jobs, says engine problem has spread","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR) said a costly compressor problem that had grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) planes had now been found in a different type of engine, compounding pressures on a group that is due to cut more than 4,000 jobs this week. 
Britain's best known engineering company has been hit by a problem with a compressor in the Trent 1000 package C engine that is not lasting as long as expected, grounding planes, forcing inspections and angering airline clients.
The engine powers Boeing's 787 Dreamliner jet. 
On Monday it said it had now found the same issue on a ""small number of high life Package B engines"", requiring a one-off inspection of the B fleet and sending its shares down 1 percent.
The news, which will not affect Rolls' full-year free cash flow target, comes as the group embarks on the latest stage of a major restructuring program under Chief Executive Warren East that is designed to boost profitability.
On Friday the group will host a capital markets day where, according to a person familiar with the situation, it will announce more than 4,000 job cuts, mostly in Britain and affecting support and management roles.
The group, which employs 50,000 people in 50 countries, is also expected to set out how it will make a return on the investment made in recent years and the expected drivers of cash flow beyond its medium-term horizon. 
The news about the compressor issue will not help however as Rolls has been fighting to show it has a lid on a problem which has forced airline customers to lease alternative planes to fly in the busy summer holiday period.
The existing package C issue had led to about 30 of the affected aircraft being grounded at any one time for checks. They were flown by airlines including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR). 
Air New Zealand said earlier this month it would lease two Boeing 777s to cover for 787-9s that are affected by the Rolls engine issue.
Airlines that use the package C engine tend to also take the package B engine. According to Rolls some 380 package C engines are in service while there are 166 package B engines in service. 
Rolls said that while this new problem would incur some additional cost, it did not expect it to affect its free cash flow guidance for 2018.

Analysts welcomed the fact the group did not revise the target and noted the comment that the package B issue only affected a ""small number"" of engines.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A group of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (T:4502) shareholders is trying to build support to block the $62 billion acquisition of London-listed  Shire  Plc (L:SHP) at an extraordinary general meeting, a leading member of the group told Reuters on Monday.
Takeda will hold the shareholder meeting later this year or early next year to approve an issue of new stock to help fund the Shire deal, making it a de facto vote on the deal itself.
The 130 member group formed by ex-Takeda employees holds one percent of the drugmaker's shares, and needs to secure a third of shareholder votes.
It is ""working steadily to increase support"" for blocking the deal among domestic retail investors and overseas institutional investors who own 25 percent and 35 percent of Takeda shares respectively, the person said on condition of anonymity.
The group includes members of the founding Takeda family, Nikkan Yakugyo reported last month. The family owns about 10 percent of Takeda shares, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Last year, the same group attempted to prevent the appointment of outgoing Chairman Yasuchika Hasegawa to an advisory position at the company. Although the proposal was defeated at the company's annual general meeting, it gained 30.5 percent of votes. 
The group has a proposal at this month's annual general meeting too, arguing that deals worth more than 1 trillion yen ($9.1 billion) should be put to a shareholder vote.
It does not expect that proposal to pass either, but hopes it will help draw attention to ""what an irrational deal"" the Shire transaction is, the group member said.
The group argues Takeda is taking on too much financial risk with the acquisition and says Shire's haemophilia franchise is threatened by Roche Holding AG's (S:ROG) new haemophilia drug Hemlibra.
Takeda Chief Executive Christophe Weber has expressed confidence shareholders will vote in favor of the deal. 
Shares at the drugmaker have fallen more than 20 percent since it first said it was considering bidding for Shire.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 07:45AM ET</span>","Stocks, euro climb as calm in Italy overshadows chaotic G7","By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks climbed on Monday, shrugging off the weekend's fractious G7 summit as investors looked forward to a week packed with diplomatic, policy and political events while reassuring comments from Italy pushed the euro up.
A summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday will be followed by meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank plus a Brexit bill vote in the British parliament.
But risky assets were well supported on Monday as comments from Italy's new coalition government saying it had no intention of leaving the euro zone and planned to cut debt levels pushed Italian stocks (FTMIB) up more than 2 percent and a wider gauge of European stocks <.MSER> up 0.6 percent.
""Markets are focused on the headlines from Italy and that has calmed investors as they believe the threat of confrontation with the EU has dropped significantly,"" said Mike Bell, a global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in London.
U.S. stock index futures (ESc1) were flat after dropping as much as 0.3 percent in early trading, indicating a cautious start for Wall Street. The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent.
With no top level U.S. economic data due for release on Monday, all eyes are on the summit in Singapore and the Fed, which is almost certain to raise interest rates on Wednesday.
Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria soothed investors' nerves on Sunday. In his first interview since taking office a week ago, Tria told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that the new coalition was committed to remaining within the single currency and wanted to boost growth through investment and structural reforms.
Bond yields tumbled by 25-50 basis points across the board in Italy while the euro firmed, nearing a recent three-week high. 
The single currency (EUR=EBS) rose nearly half a percent to $1.1821 in early trading before trimming some gains to stand 0.2 percent up on the day.
Trump's rejection of a previously signed G7 communique separates the United States from its traditional global economic allies and underlines trade tensions. 
However, it had little impact on global markets with investors taking the news in their stride in a week when the world's top central banks - the Fed and the ECB - are set to tighten policy. 
""Though the latest headlines are definitely not positive for global trade, risk appetite is broadly firm across the board as investors are of the view it might force the ECB and the Fed to take a cautious approach,"" said Neil Mellor, a senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in London. 
G7 ""MESS""
Stocks wobbled and the dollar edged higher in initial reaction to the G7, which  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) termed as a ""mess"". However, markets quickly recouped losses, with stocks firmer across the board on expectations that any withdrawal in policy stimulus would be very gradual against the backdrop of the rising trade tensions.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) slipped early but was last up 0.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) also gained 0.3 percent while the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) fell 0.5 percent. 
The Fed is inching closer to a neutral policy stance, while the ECB is likely to signal on Thursday that its 2.55 trillion euro bond purchase scheme will end this year, a major move in dismantling crisis-era stimulus.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.1 percent up at 93.67 (DXY).
Oil prices slipped on rising Russian production and increasing U.S. drilling activity. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) fell 1.1 percent to $75.66 a barrel and U.S. crude futures (CLc1) slipped more than 1 percent to $64.93 a barrel.

Spot gold , which tends to do well in times of market stress, was down 0.2 percent on the day at $1,295.21 per ounce.

1100,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",House panel questions FDA's track record combating illegal opioids,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers fear the Food and Drug Administration is not doing enough to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the United States as the country works to combat the opioid epidemic. 
Republican and Democratic members on the House Energy and Commerce Committee questioned whether the FDA's criminal investigators are effective at blocking illegal drugs at U.S. ports of entry, in a letter seen by Reuters.
""We have concerns about whether the FDA is appropriately devoting its resources to prioritize these efforts against unapproved opioids,"" wrote the lawmakers, including the panel's Republican Chairman Greg Walden and leading Democrat Frank Pallone, in a letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb.
Lyndsay Meyer, a spokeswoman for the FDA, confirmed the agency had received the letter and plans to respond.
The FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) is responsible for launching criminal probes into counterfeit, adulterated and mislabeled and unapproved drugs.
It has been under scrutiny by the committee after Reuters published a series of articles in 2016 about the office’s approach to criminal investigations and controversies surrounding its spending, personnel matters and use of resources.
In those articles, federal agents complained that OCI managers forced them to pursue toothless cases involving mislabeled foreign-imported injectable drugs such as Botox, at the expense of cases with more potential to protect the public health.
In interviews, some agents complained the FDA was not pursuing cases involving dangerous opioids and drugs such as Kratom, a plant used as an alternative to opioids, despite the growing public health epidemic.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2016 there were 63,632 drug overdose deaths, and opioids accounted for 66.4 percent of them.
In testimony in March, Gottlieb talked about efforts at the FDA to combat the crisis, including stopping the importation of dangerous non-FDA approved opioids by last year tripling the number of FDA investigators at U.S. mail facilities and doubling the number of agents stationed at U.S. ports of entry to prevent illegal drugs from hitting the streets.
From the end of September 2017 through January 2018, of about 5,800 suspicious packages that FDA inspected through its port of entry initiative, 376 were controlled substances such as opioids, and were referred back to Customs and Border Patrol for seizure.
However, one source familiar with the effort told Reuters on Sunday the initiative is not generating many new investigative referrals that could help lead to prosecutions, and added that it duplicates efforts by investigators in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The committee is asking the FDA to provide statistical data about the cases being generated through the port of entry initiative and its prosecution track record by June 22.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC will invest $15-17 billion in the next three years in areas including technology and China as it swings from a strategy of cost-cutting to growth, new CEO John Flint said on Monday, while keeping profitability and dividend targets little changed. 
In a first public outline of his strategy at the helm of Europe's biggest bank by market capitalization, Flint set out ambitions to grow its return on tangible equity to 11 percent, in line with previous targets, from 6.8 percent in 2017. 
The update marks a shift in HSBC's (L:HSBA) post-2008 crisis attitude from cost-cutting and restructuring to investment and growth, but analysts said the focus on China and technology were familiar themes.
HSBC shares fell by 0.7 percent amid some disappointment the bank said it would keep its current levels of dividends rather than the increase some investors had hoped for. 
""The early read is that this is not a revolutionary strategy review - rather accelerating growth (particularly in Asia) as well as driving better value creation,"" analyst Joseph Dickerson at Jefferies International in London said. 
BACK INTO GROWTH MODE
The main points of the bank's refreshed strategy will come as little surprise to HSBC investors, with the focus squarely on further expansion in China and its prosperous southern Pearl River Delta region in particular.
The bank will also seek to expand further in the British mortgage market as one of eight new strategic targets, it said. 
""After a period of restructuring, it is now time for HSBC to get back into growth mode,"" Flint said.
The bank has found no silver bullet for its underperforming U.S. business, the strategy update showed, with HSBC set to focus on trying to grow its market share among internationally-focused mid-sized companies.
The bank will also resume unsecured lending in its retail bank, taking on the riskier but more profitable segment of the consumer market that drives the higher profits achieved by its domestic rivals in the United States. 
Flint in February said the bank was reviewing its U.S. franchise, which has suffered from lack of scale and the consequences of its disastrous $15 billion acquisition of consumer lender Household in 2003.

Few of the bank's identified areas for growth focused on its investment banking business, which has suffered an exodus of high-profile dealmakers in Europe in recent months amid frustration at a lack of clear strategy.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Biotech's Soon-Shiong hiring bankers for Nant cancer drug IPO,"By Deena Beasley
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong plans to take an experimental cancer treatment company public this year and has begun hiring bankers, the biotechnology entrepreneur told Reuters.
The former surgeon said in a recent interview that the new company, to be called Nant, would use most of the money raised from the initial public offering to develop a pipeline of cancer drugs, although the amount of financing has yet to be determined.
Soon-Shiong made billions by founding and selling an injectable drugmaker, followed by a company that developed a way to make a chemotherapy drug more effective.
Later, he founded Culver City, California-based NantWorks, from which he has spun off two publicly traded companies – cancer-testing company NantHealth Inc (O:NH) and immunotherapy developer  NantKwest  Inc (N:NK).
Shares of both have fallen sharply and losses have mounted amid questions over whether funds from his charitable foundation have been used to drive sales. Soon-Shiong called allegations of donations being tied to sales of a cancer diagnostic test ""completely untrue.""
Earlier this year, he agreed to buy the Los Angeles Times and other California newspapers for $500 million, but the deal has not yet closed.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has been hired to work on the Nant IPO, and Soon-Shiong said he was in talks with two other investment banks. Credit Suisse declined comment.
Nant's portfolio includes six compounds in clinical trials against nine tumor types. The pipeline includes versions of existing chemotherapy drugs designed to make tumors more recognizable to the immune system, methods of delivering cancer-fighting cells to tumors, and immunotherapies.
Soon-Shiong believes a multi-drug regimen could help cancer patients achieve long-term remission.
""Everybody is focusing on one little piece of the puzzle,"" he said. ""But the tumor is too smart. It has too many fail safes. We need to attack the entire tumor system.""
At least two of Nant's drugs are in late-stage trials: Ganitumab, an antibody licensed from  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN), blocks a receptor linked to cell growth and is being tested in combination with chemotherapy for advanced sarcoma patients.
Another compound, N-803, targets a protein involved in activating immune system cells and is in late-stage development for bladder cancer.
NANTHEALTH AND NANTKWEST
Shares of NantHealth have fallen to $3.41 from their IPO price of $14 in 2015. The company reported a first-quarter loss of around $22 million.
NantKwest trades at $3.66, down from $25 when it debuted in 2016, and reported a quarterly net loss near $27 million.
Jefferies analyst Biren Amin rates shares of NantKwest as ""hold."" Citi Research has a ""sell"" rating on NantKwest and estimates the company has enough cash for two years of operations. Soon-Shiong said NantKwest was exploring ""strategic partnerships"" to fund clinical trials. He owns controlling stakes and holds the chief executive office of both companies, and will be a majority shareholder in Nant.
Health news website STAT reported last year that Soon-Shiong and his charitable foundations in 2014 gave the University of Utah $12 million for disease research, and the university later paid NantHealth $10 million for testing services.
Utah's legislature determined that the university should have sought competitive bids for the testing, but said the donation was not tied to the purchase.
Soon-Shiong said of the Utah case: ""That was a donation our foundation made to the University of Utah. They had an opportunity to go to any vendor, and they came to us.""

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 07:07AM ET</span>",Audi CEO named as suspect in German emissions probe,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors on Monday widened an emissions cheating probe into Volkswagen's luxury carmaker Audi to include the brand's Chief Executive Rupert Stadler among the suspects accused of fraud and false advertising.
Almost three years after Volkswagen admitted to falsifying U.S. diesel emissions tests, the Munich public prosecutor's office said it was now probing 20 suspects, and had on Monday searched the apartment of Stadler and one other board member.
The news came after Germany's Bild am Sonntag reported up to a million Daimler cars had been found to contain illegal emissions devices, showing how the fallout from Volkswagen's scandal continues to dog the industry.
""Since May 30, 2018 the chairman of the board of Audi AG Prof. Rupert Stadler as well as a further member of the management board are now named suspects,"" the Munich prosecutor's office said.
The probe could trigger a leadership crisis at Audi and its parent Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) where Stadler was in April elevated to the post of head of group sales.
Volkswagen declined to comment. Audi said it was fully cooperating with prosecutors. Stadler was in a board meeting and unavailable for comment.
Munich prosecutors said the two suspects were being investigated for suspected fraud and false advertising and for their alleged role in helping to bring cars equipped with illegal software on to the European market.
Stadler has been under fire ever since Audi admitted to using cheating software in November 2015 - two months after Volkswagen - but has enjoyed backing from members of the Porsche and Piech families who control Volkswagen and Audi.
Before becoming Audi CEO in 2007, Stadler was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of the group's controlling Piech clan.
Audi, the biggest contributor to Volkswagen's profit, admitted in November 2015 its 3.0 liter V6 diesel engines were fitted with a device deemed illegal in the United States that allowed cars to evade emissions limits.
In March, Audi's 20-strong supervisory board recommended that shareholders endorse Stadler as chief executive even as prosecutors raided Audi to investigate who was involved in the use of any illicit software deployed in 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche cars in the United States.

Audi said last month it had discovered emissions-related problems with a further 60,000 cars.

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 06:12AM ET</span>","Fed up with rising costs, big U.S. firms dig into healthcare","By Caroline Humer
SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - At its Silicon Valley headquarters, network gear maker Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) is going to unusual lengths to take control of the relentless increase in its U.S. healthcare costs. 
The company is among a handful of large American employers who are getting more deeply involved in managing their workers' health instead of looking to insurers to do it. Cisco last year began offering its employees a plan it negotiated directly with nearby Stanford Health medical system.
Under the plan, physicians are supposed to keep costs down by closely tracking about a dozen health indicators to prevent expensive emergencies, and keep Cisco workers happy with their care. If they meet these goals, Stanford gets a bonus. If they fail, Stanford pays Cisco a penalty.
At the center of it all is a spacious clinic inside Cisco's San Jose campus, the first point of contact for many employees and their families. They often see Dr. Larry Kwan, a Stanford Health general physician who rubs shoulders with workers in the cafeteria and company gym.
""I'm in their space. I'm actually where they work,"" Dr. Kwan said. ""I'm a bit of a village doc."" 
Cisco said costs for Stanford plan patients are 10 percent lower than conventional coverage still used by most of its employees. Chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) told Reuters it is saving 17 percent on its workers enrolled in a similar plan, known as Connected Care. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the world's largest retailer, have likewise hammered out health plans directly with providers.
The movement is small, just a few very large U.S. corporations that have signed up tens of thousands of workers so far. Their early efforts show the challenges of changing behaviors among patients and doctors. 
But they speak volumes about corporate America's frustration with inexorably rising medical costs and the traditional insurers that sell them coverage. 
""Before they were simply saying 'Okay, our vendor is going to help us with this,'"" said John Jackson, who handles corporate programs like Cisco's for Stanford Health. ""Many are no longer willing to do that.""
Corporations help pay for healthcare for more than 170 million Americans, in most cases working with an insurer to handle everything from the price of treatments to medical claims. 
These employers will spend an estimated $738 billion on health benefits in 2018, a figure that has been rising about 5 percent annually in recent years, according to federal data.
CUE AMAZON
Other big firms are watching closely. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said in January they will form an independent company to improve healthcare for their roughly 750,000 U.S. employees, prompting speculation that they would displace health insurers and other industry ""middlemen"".
Amazon and partners say they will use big-data analysis and other high-tech tools to improve care and cut wasteful spending. The trio will study the new plans coming from Intel and other pioneers, a source close to the venture told Reuters.
If they do, they will find plenty of hurdles. Reuters interviews with executives at Cisco, Intel and Boeing and their health partners revealed similar challenges.
Chief among them is habit. Many workers will not stray from conventional plans because they like their doctors or worry about access to the best specialists.
To boost enrollment, all three companies have dangled sweeteners such as extra money for health savings accounts or lower monthly premiums and co-pays. The approach also requires employers to take a more hands-on role.
""It's not something that you just turn the switch and not manage,"" said Katelyn Johnson, Cisco's senior integrated health manager for global benefits.
Cisco's experiment began in 2008 when it opened the campus clinic for all of its employees there. Designed like a spa, the facility offered primary care in new-age sounding treatment areas: body, mind, heart and spirit.
The savings were notable: about 30 percent compared to an offsite doctor's office. Cisco later brought in Stanford to develop a full-blown medical plan, which took effect in 2017. Stanford operates the clinic and provides more specialized services through Stanford University's medical system.
Like a health maintenance organization, the plan requires enrollees to stick to a closed network of doctors. There is emphasis on primary care and fewer referrals to specialists. Treatment for back pain, for example, often begins with physical therapy at the clinic.
Cisco also mandates that Stanford track a dozen health measures, including glycemic levels for diabetics and blood pressure for those with hypertension.
Johnson said fewer than 1,000 people are enrolled, below Cisco's goal of 1,300 for 2018. The plan has yet to make a dent in Cisco's $500 million annual healthcare tab, which has been rising by 3 percent to 4 percent in recent years.
Still, Cisco is encouraged enough by the savings that it may expand the program to the company's second-largest U.S. center, in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park.
""What we were doing in the past wasn't really working,"" Johnson said. ""So this model ... is worth it.""
CHIPPING AWAY AT CHALLENGES
Experts warn Cisco's approach is not suitable for most employers.
For starters, companies need thousands of employees in one place, usually a city, said David Muhlestein, Chief Research Officer at healthcare consultancy Leavitt Partners in Washington D.C. Then their healthcare partner needs to be committed to improving patient health, rather than just offering a discount to win a big client.
""There are not a ton of providers who are really well positioned to make those changes,"" Muhlestein said. 
Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel says it has found such partners since it launched its Connected Care health plan five years ago. About 38,000 employees and dependents are now enrolled in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Oregon.
Technology is critical to curbing costs. In Oregon, patients are encouraged to use video conferencing to speak with physicians when appropriate. At $49, the cost is one-third of an office visit.
Jennifer Leo, a 41-year old Intel project manager in Hillsboro, Oregon, chose Connected Care mainly because it covers 100 percent of her husband's insulin, a drug whose U.S. retail price has more than doubled over the past five years.
Hospital network Providence Health & Services tracks her husband's condition closely. But Leo said she, too, got personal attention when she came down with a sinus infection on a weekend.
She booked a quick video appointment with a doctor, who prescribed an antibiotic. The next day, the office of her primary care physician reached out to ""check that everything got taken care of,"" Leo said.
Such follow-through has led to high patient satisfaction; Connected Care boasts a 95 percent enrollee retention rate, says Angela Mitchell, Intel's head of U.S. healthcare delivery.
And it has curbed costs and boosted patient health, she said. Last year, for example, 78 percent of diabetics on the plan had their sugar levels under control, up from 69 percent in 2016, Mitchell said. Spending on people with the most complex health conditions was about 10 percentage points lower than on those with comparable issues outside the plan.
Intel spent nearly $700 million on healthcare last year, up about 1 percent from $690 million in 2016.
Still, Intel employees will sometimes ask Mitchell for help when they cannot see specialists quickly enough. In some cases, she will intervene and call the health system directly to make it happen.
""There are thousands of doctors in these networks. We're not trying to act like it's perfect every single time,"" Mitchell said.
Boeing, too, has hit some snags with plans it negotiated directly with hospitals in four states covering 15,000 employees plus family members.
Doctors have willingly prescribed cheaper generic drugs, says Boeing global healthcare head Jeff White. But getting them to commit to, say, physical therapy first before scheduling a costly knee replacement has been harder, he said.
White said direct arrangements have boosted quality and saved Boeing money; he declined to provide exact figures. The aircraft maker spends about $2.4 billion annually on healthcare for more than 120,000 U.S. workers and their dependents.
Some healthcare experts point to the inherent conflict for providers: If they prevent expensive health crises through better care, they also lose out on more profitable services, such as hospital admissions.

""That's the challenge of trying to ask the health system to save money,"" said Jack Hoadley, a health policy expert at Georgetown University.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 06:08AM ET</span>",Austria's Voestalpine sees U.S. delays over steel tariff exclusion requests,"By Maytaal Angel
LONDON (Reuters) - Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine (VI:VOES) said it expected prolonged delays from Washington in dealing with thousands of applications for exclusions from steel tariffs it has received from companies in the United States.
The steelmaker, which last week reported bumper annual profits, said about a third of its U.S. sales would be impacted by Washington's steel import tariffs, adding that it was talking to its customers about who would bear the cost.
Voestalpine generates about 10 percent of its revenue in the United States, while about two thirds comes from Europe and 8 percent from Asia.
""As far as we know, none of these (tariff exclusion) applications have been answered. We have received no reply,"" outgoing Voestalpine CEO Wolfgang Eder told Reuters.
He said the application process was so cumbersome that the U.S. Commerce Department might not get round to responding to the bulk of the 10,000 or so exclusion requests it had received. 
The U.S. tariffs of 25 percent on incoming steel and 10 percent on aluminum came into effect on March 23. They have been imposed on Europe, Canada and Mexico since Friday, June 1, after their temporary exemptions expired.
Companies operating in the United States can apply to the U.S. Commerce Department for tariff exclusions for product grades they might struggle to source locally.
U.S. authorities previously said the process for dealing with such requests would not normally exceed 90 days.
Eder said that out of a total of 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of U.S. sales, Voestalpine expected 400 million euros worth would be subject to tariffs because they involved products imported into the United States rather than produced there.
Although there tend to be no set agreements in contracts between steelmakers and their customers as to who pays in the event of a tariff, industry experts expect that at present most U.S. customers will agree to pay the cost.
This is because the premium for U.S. versus global steel prices is so wide that even after paying a 25 percent tariff, imported steel might still be cheaper than locally sourced steel.
The European steel industry says an 8 percent surge in EU steel imports this year is due to Washington's import tariffs, which have caused trade flows to be deflected to Europe's shores.
The EU has said it could impose preliminary measures, in the form of tariffs or quotas, to safeguard its steel and aluminum industries as early as July, mainly to prevent Asian producers flooding the European market.
The U.S. tariffs have fanned trade war fears, with countries the world over poised to retaliate in products beyond steel. Critics also says the tariffs are inflationary for the U.S. consumer, and will result in critical product shortages.

1116,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Trade tensions drive Chinese auto investors from U.S. to Europe,"By Esha Vaish
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Chinese auto investors are increasingly pouring money into Europe rather than the United States because of intense U.S. scrutiny of their deals under the Trump administration, according to industry sources and M&A data. 
More than a dozen leading M&A bankers, lawyers and consultants told Reuters the number of mandates from Chinese clients to make investments in the European auto sector were increasing, while those for the U.S. sector were declining. 
""Given the way that things are tightening up in the United States, Europe for China is the most obvious non-domestic market that they're pushing into,"" said Charlie Simpson, who specializes in the auto sector for consultancy KPMG's global strategy group.
The trend, which comes as Washington is locked in a trade battle with Beijing, is supported by an analysis of data of auto sector investment in the U.S. and European markets.
The United States accounted for 26 percent of the total number of Chinese deals in either of the markets in the first five months of this year, according to the figures from Thomson Reuters and research group Dealroom. That is down from 31 percent in the same periods of 2017 and 2016.
There have been 19 deals in total across both markets so far this year, worth more than $10 billion, according to the data.
At the center of the trade dispute are U.S. allegations that China has stolen American intellectual property. There has been increased scrutiny of investments in sectors including autos, where companies are developing technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and robotics. 
Washington says it is looking to broaden the reach of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which examines deals for national security risks, to further limit Chinese efforts to acquire U.S. technology.
Thirteen of the 17 bankers, lawyers and consultants interviewed by Reuters, based in Europe, the United States or China, said their Chinese clients were increasingly choosing Europe over the United States because of growing difficulties with CFIUS.
This means a large group of investors are hunting assets in Europe, mainly Chinese state-owned auto firms, listed carmakers and private equity funds, the industry sources said. 
They include state-owned SAIC Motor Corp, BAIC Group and FAW Group Corp; and listed players Guangzhou Automobile Group (SS:601238), and Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (SS:600699), the people said.
Samson Lo, head of Asia M&A at UBS, said all big Chinese carmakers who wanted to do overseas deals were steering clear of the United States. 
""The immediate reaction is: 'I don't think in the current environment it is for me',"" he added.
FAW Group Corp and Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp could not be reached for comments, while SAIC Motor Corp, BAIC Group and Guangzhou Automobile Group did not respond to emailed request for comments. 
MORE CHINA DEALS BLOCKED
American officials say CFIUS reviewed about 250 foreign deals in total across all industries last year, an increase of 40 percent on 2016. 
During the roughly 14 months of the Trump Administration to March 1, the committee has blocked 12 Chinese deals, or nearly half of the 27 transactions it has completed reviews of, and the fate of nine more are still undecided, according to an analysis https:// by the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. 
By contrast, in 2016 only four Chinese deals were blocked out of 26 that were reviewed, partner Tom Shoesmith told Reuters.
Many more would-be investors are being deterred before the review stage, according to a lawyer who represents a major Chinese carmaker that has been investing in Europe.
He said a lot of deals were being ditched after informal talks with CFIUS officials who made it clear they would not pass muster. He declined to be named as this could identify his client and breach confidentiality.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has made the auto industry central to its ""America First"" trade agenda. It cited national security concerns last month when it launched an investigation into vehicle imports that could lead to tariffs similar to those imposed on steel and aluminum.
This year, CFIUS blocked U.S. semiconductor testing company Xcerra's (O:XCRA) purchase by China-based Sino IC Capital, which had expected the $580 million deal to help it benefit from automotive opportunities. State-owned China Heavy Duty Truck Group and UQM Technologies (A:UQM) was also forced to scrap a deal that would have hiked its stake in UQM to 34 percent from 9.9 percent and given it three out of eight board seats.
By contrast in Europe, even though Geely's [GEELY.UL] recent purchase of a stake of almost 10 percent in  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) raised fears among some politicians in Germany of its expertise falling into Chinese hands, the deal is unlikely to be challenged.
Europe does not have a common position on screening foreign investments - some countries are pushing for talks to broaden checks on foreign investments, others oppose such plans that would reduce access to Chinese cash.
While individual countries do examine transactions, the depth and the number of reviews was negligible compared with the United States, according to the bankers, lawyers and consultants. 
INVESTORS CHANGE TACTICS
However, some Chinese buyers are beginning to change investment tactics, even in Europe, as they look avoid political and regulatory complications, according to the industry sources. 
They are ditching their favored ""direct"" M&A model - buying a company and gaining total control over the technology - for other access routes such as joint ventures, patent purchases that raise less political and public concern.
Other options being explored also include licensing deals - where they could gain the ability to use, modify and resell the target's technology - and bringing on a local banking or automotive or private equity player as co-investors.
In many cases, these investment avenues may not be subject to a CFIUS or European review, the sources said.
""They are working on situations that is either more flexible, partnership based or less overtly Chinese branded,"" said KPMG's Simpson, adding that he was working on such deals but could not discuss specifics due to confidentiality.
Swedish manufacturing trade group FKG, whose members visited Geely in China in May, said the Chinese carmaker's focus was shifting toward ""partnerships"" and it had proposed deals to some of its members. 
""There was no talk about buying a company... instead they were looking for joint ventures,"" said FKG's senior advisor Peter Bryntesson.
Geely, which owns Swedish carmaker Volvo and recently bought a stake in truckmaker AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb), declined to comment on its future business plans.
Michael Dunne, president of investment advisory firm Dunne Automotive, said he had recently worked on deals where instead of acquiring companies, Chinese buyers had established licensing agreements as a workaround.
Sweden-China Trade Council Vice Chairman Frederic Cho said Chinese investors had realised they could gain access to a company's technologies without full ownership.

""It also sends a message to the market that: We are not here as predators. We're here for the long term.""

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Daimler shares drop on report up to one million cars contain defeat device,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) shares fell following a report that up to a million Daimler cars contained illegal defeat devices as Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche prepared to meet the transport minister on Monday.
German weekly Bild am Sonntag said up to 1 million cars contained software to cheat emissions tests on diesel vehicles.
Carmakers use software to manage exhaust emissions filtering and engine performance. A device can be classified as illegal if exhaust filtering systems are deactivated too early or without good reason.
At 0836 GMT, Daimler shares were trading 1.76 percent lower, at 61.19 euros, underperforming the Stoxx 600 Automobile index which was 0.48 percent lower. 
German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer summoned Zetsche after the country's KBA Motor Vehicle Authority discovered ""inadmissible defeat devices"" in Mercedes-Benz engines, even as Daimler disputes they were illegal. 
Daimler declines to comment on the 1 million vehicles figure, but said it is cooperating fully and transparently with the KBA and Germany's Transport Ministry.
Daimler, like other car manufacturers, uses urea nitrate liquids to neutralize nitrogen oxide emissions in exhaust fumes. However, Germany's road vehicle authority, the KBA, has taken issue with the emission control features amid suspicion they allow vehicles to emit excess pollution without detection.
The emissions scandal has hung over the German car industry since September 2015, when Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted to using software that could tell when a diesel vehicle was being tested and temporarily lower its toxic emissions to pass U.S. regulations.

The ""Dieselgate"" scandal has cost VW about $30 billion in fines and other costs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's accounting watchdog fined KPMG 3.2 million pounds ($4.3 million) on Monday for failings in its audit of Quindell Plc, after the legal services firm twice restated its accounts leading to heavy losses.
KPMG and its employee William Smith, who was fined 84,000 pounds, both failed to ensure that Quindell's financial statements for 2013 and 2014 were free from material mis-statement, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said.
KPMG apologized in a statement on Monday for failing to press Quindell's management harder over the company's accounts.
""We accept the FRC's findings that in two specific areas of the audit, our challenge for the year ended 31 December 2013 should have gone further,"" a spokesman for KPMG said.
The fine in Britain comes as the global network of accounting firms that make up KPMG is under pressure. It is facing an inquiry in Britain over its audit of failed outsourcer Carillion and scrutiny of its South African arm's work for a company owned by the Gupta family.
The 'big four' accounting firms, including KPMG, are facing calls to break up into smaller parts from lawmakers in Britain who allege their dominance of the market means they do not sufficiently challenge clients' claims about their accounts.
THe FRC is also investigating KPMG's auditing of the collapsed construction and outsourcing firm Carillion.
Once close to being one of Britain's blue chip financial firms, the AIM-listed Quindell saw its market value collapse in 2015 after regulators launched probes into its financial accounts.
Quindell, which has since been rebranded as Watchstone, is still being probed by Britain's Serious Fraud Office and the FRC over its business and accounting practises.
KPMG's fine was discounted from an original 4.5 million pounds and Smith's from 120,000 pounds because they chose to settle the case, the FRC said.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>",Major Australian adviser network to shut amid regulator scrutiny,"By Alison Bevege
SYDNEY (Reuters) - A major Australian financial planning network has closed after being told its license could be suspended or canceled, the corporate regulator said on Monday, becoming the latest casualty in the country's scandal-plagued financial sector.
The 400 adviser-strong Dover Financial Advisers, with about $2.3 billion in assets under management, had been under investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission since 2017. It came under additional scrutiny at a public inquiry into financial sector behavior earlier this year.
The regulator on Monday said Dover and owner Terry McMaster decided to cease operations after receiving notice of a hearing into suspending or cancelling its license.
""The matter has not gone to hearing but as a result of this notice, Dover & Mr McMaster have advised that, amongst other things, Dover will cease providing financial services,"" a regulator spokesman said via email.
Dover did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on Monday, a public holiday in the state of Victoria where it is based.
The closure comes amid a government-ordered inquiry into financial sector wrongdoing. So far, the inquiry - dubbed the Royal Commission - has led to high-profile resignations, class action lawsuits, and share sell-downs at some of the country's biggest companies, including fund manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP).
The inquiry is also forcing change to long-standing industry practices, with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) last month announcing it would cease paying bonuses to financial planners for selling its products.
In April, the inquiry scrutinized Dover's practices and found the firm employed several advisers dismissed by other groups, and allowed advisers to audit their own advice. McMaster collapsed at a hearing while giving evidence.
Research by Adviser Ratings ranked Dover as Australia's 11th largest planning firm with 401 advisers across 250 practices, making it one of the biggest networks not operated by one of the country's big banks.
It had A$3 billion ($2.28 billion) in funds under management, according to its website on Monday.

In a statement, Mitsubishi Materials said its president Akira Takeuchi will step down from that role and assume the position of chairman after an annual shareholders meeting on June 22. Current executive vice-president Naoki Ono will take over from Takeuchi as president, a role that carries responsibility for executing strategy at Mitsubishi Materials.
The boardroom shake-up comes a few days after the firm said it had found fresh cases of misconduct at its Naoshima copper smelter and refinery in western Japan. The plant's Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) certification has been revoked.
That finding followed a company announcement a month earlier that it had found new cases of improper action at a small number of its group firms, widening the number of affected customers from 762 to an undisclosed figure.
The scandal is one of a series of quality assurance frauds to rock Japanese manufacturers. Since October, Japan has seen revelations of data tampering and compliance failures at Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406), Toray Industries Inc (T:3402), Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) and Subaru Corp (T:7270).

(Reuters) - Authentic Brands Group LLC won the auction on Sunday for the intellectual property of bankrupt U.S. shoe and accessories company Nine West Holdings Inc with a revised bid of about $350 million, people familiar with the matter said.
Authentic Brands, a brand development and marketing company, was bidding against shoe retailer  DSW Inc  (N:DSW) for the well-known Nine West brand, found in department stores, the sources said. Authentic Brands had submitted an initial offer for the Nine West and Bandolino brands of $200 million, according to court papers.
The proceeds from the sale will go toward paying down some of Nine West's approximately $1.5 billion in debt.
Nine West filed for bankruptcy in April, after missing an earlier interest payment. Many U.S. retailers are struggling, with more than 15 filing for bankruptcy last year as shoppers buy online.
Nine West, its private equity owner Sycamore Partners, Authentic Brands and DSW did not immediately return requests for comment.
DSW submitted a bid for Nine West last week, and was interested in the brand for its own stable of private label lines, sources said. The retailer has over 500 stores in the U.S.
Nine West's creditors plan to take ownership of the company's remaining assets, including its jeanswear business, through a restructuring proposal.
Authentic Brands owns brands including women's wear line Juicy Couture and high-end cowboy boot label Frye.
A group of creditors in Nine West are looking into legal claims against Sycamore Partners, seeking greater recovery on their investment, according to court papers. The creditors have claimed in court documents that Sycamore may have acquired some of Nine West's assets, such as the high-end Kurt Geiger and Stuart Weitzman shoe businesses, for less than their true value, according to the papers.
Sycamore acquired the Jones Group Inc, then the parent of Nine West, in a deal valued at $2.2 billion in 2014.
The company has proposed giving the creditors more money from its bankruptcy loan to look into the claims, according to a court document. A U.S. bankruptcy judge must approve the loan.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese stocks rose on Monday but gains were limited as investors focused on the U.S.-North Korea summit, while Tokyo Electric soared as the outcome of a local election was seen to be positive for one of the utility's nuclear power plants.
The Nikkei share average (N225) edged up 0.2 percent to 22,740.40 in midmorning trade, after opening slightly lower.
Defensive sectors such as food and pharmaceuticals outperformed, while investors remained risk-averse amid major economic and political events around the world.
U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in Singapore on Sunday for a historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that could lay the groundwork for ending a nuclear stand-off between the old foes.
""The market should be quiet this week because after the summit is over, there are Fed, ECB meetings so investors are likely to remain cautious this week,"" said Masashi Oda, general manager of the strategic investment department at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate hike on Wednesday while the European Central Bank will debate whether to end bond purchases later this year.
""If U.S. yields soar sharply after the Fed meeting, the stock market may be hit,"" Oda said.
Traders also said that global trade war worries will likely persist after Trump threw the G7's efforts to show a united front into disarray after taking aim at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Food and drugmaker stocks staged a rally, with Ajinomoto Co (T:2802) rising 1.7 percent and Kikkoman Corp (T:2801) advancing 1.0 percent, while Astellas Pharmaceutical (T:4503) added 0.7 percent.
Tokyo Electric Power Co (T:9501) jumped as high as 8.8 percent after Hideyo Hanazumi, a candidate backed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling coalition, was elected governor of Niigata prefecture.
Traders saw the vote as positive for Tepco's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant, which was shutdown during the Fukushima disaster in 2011.
Japanese media had reported in April that the previous governor had opposed restarting the site's seven reactors, which is crucial to Tepco's recovery plans.

The shares began their descent in January and the decline continued after a passenger died when an engine broke apart during a flight in April. 
Fewer people are now booking on the Dallas-based carrier, a slowdown Southwest said stemmed mainly from its own reduction in advertising after the tragedy, the first U.S. airline death since 2009, Barron's said.
Rising fuel prices and planned expansion by some rivals that could mean more competition have stoked fears about the sector, helping sending Southwest stock down 24 percent this year, the paper reported.
But some analysts think Southwest's strong business model merits a price-earnings ratio in the mid-teens, compared with the current 11.3 times 2018 earnings estimates, Barron's said.
The paper said Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker sees a price-earnings multiple of 15, which implies a 25 percent rise in the stock to $63 from its close of $50.48 on Friday.
United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL), which plans an aggressive capacity expansion, has told investors it sees room for airfares to rise substantially. 

Southwest also stands to benefit from U.S. corporate tax cuts, Barron's said. Analysts on average expect its earnings per share to rise 25 percent this year and 18 percent in 2019, Barron's said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Contract manufacturer Foxconn said on Sunday it is investigating a plant in China that makes devices for Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), after a U.S. watchdog group criticized what it described as harsh working conditions at the factory.
A 94-page report by New York-based China Labor Watch that followed a nine-month investigation cited excessive hours, low wages, inadequate training and an overreliance on ""dispatch"" or temporary workers in violation of Chinese law at the Hengyang Foxconn plant in Hunan province, which makes Echo Dot smart speakers and Kindle e-readers.
""We are carrying out a full investigation of the areas raised by that report, and if found to be true, immediate actions will be taken to bring the operations into compliance with our Code of Conduct,"" Foxconn Technology Group said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
Taiwan-based Foxconn, known formally as  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317), is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and employs more than a million people.
Foxconn, which also makes Apple Inc (O:AAPL) iPhones, came under fire in 2010 for a spate of suicides at plants in China. Foxconn pledged to improve working conditions. 
China Labor Watch said its investigation found that about 40 percent of workers at the plant were dispatch workers, far exceeding the 10 percent limit under Chinese law. Dispatch workers were paid at the same rate for regular and overtime hours, rather than time and a half as required, said China Labor Watch Program Officer Elaine Lu. 
""They were underpaid,"" Lu said. ""That's illegal.""
Dispatch workers earned 14.5 yuan ($2.26) per hour, the report said. Workers also put in more than 100 overtime hours per month during peak season, far more than the 36 hours allowed by law, and some worked for 14 consecutive days. 
Amazon said it audited the factory in March and found overtime and use of dispatch workers were ""issues of concern."" 
""We immediately requested a corrective action plan from Foxconn,"" Amazon said in a statement. It said it is monitoring Foxconn's response and ""compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. We are committed to ensuring that these issues are resolved.""
Foxconn said in an earlier statement that it ""works hard to comply with all relevant laws and regulations"" where it operates and conducts regular audits. ""If infractions are identified, we work to immediately rectify them,"" it said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's biggest asset manager wants to remove the chairmen of the board at eight companies worldwide, which it says have failed to confront the threats posed by climate change.
Legal & General Investment Management, the fund arm of insurer Legal & General (L:LGEN), has been among the most vocal asset managers on the topic, recently writing to some of the world's top companies calling for more action.
On Monday, it said it would vote against the chairs of China Construction Bank (SS:601939), Dominion Energy (N:D) and Japan Post Holdings (T:6178), as well as Occidental Petroleum (N:OXY), Rosneft Oil (MM:ROSN) and Subaru (T:7270). The other two companies on its list were Loblaw Companies (TO:L) and  Sysco Corp  (N:SYY).
As well as demanding the removal of the companies' chairmen, LGIM also said it would sell any shares of the eight companies held in its 5 billion pounds ($6.7 billion) Future World Funds index funds range.
After spending a year engaging with 84 of the world's biggest firms over their climate strategies, LGIM, which manages nearly 1 trillion pounds ($1.3 trillion) in assets, said some were not doing enough to prepare for a low-carbon economy.
While some companies were ""excelling"", others were ""failing to do the bare minimum"", with a number not even responding to requests to engage, LGIM said.
""We're going to keep ratcheting up the minimum standards and our expectations from the companies; it's not a finished business,"" said Meryam Omi, head of sustainability and responsible investment strategy at LGIM.
FULL VOTING POWER
LGIM said it had already begun to use the full voting power of all of its shares to vote against the re-election of the chairmen of each of the eight companies at their annual meetings.
""We are doing this on behalf of all our clients in terms of voting... so the voice from LGIM to the company is one,"" Omi said.
The asset manager will, however, continue to invest in the companies across its other funds.
In response, Occidental Petroleum said: ""We had positive engagements with our shareholders and other stakeholders while developing our 2018 Climate Report, and these engagements have continued to be valuable and positive after publishing it in March.""
It said it continued to aim to be ""a global leader in CO2 emission reductions through geologic sequestration"" and had a long history of reporting its greenhouse gas emissions.
Loblaw said it believed LGIM was referring to a mid-May request for information about its environmental commitments to which it had yet to reply. The Canadian firm said it intended to do so, highlighting commitments including a detailed plan to reduce its carbon footprint by 30 percent by 2030.
Sysco said: ""We have a long standing commitment to energy and waste management and sustainable agriculture practices, with continual enhancements to the programs.""
Emailed requests for comment to Dominion, Rosneft and Subaru were not immediately returned. 
China Construction Bank and Japan Post Holdings could not be reached for comment outside of business hours.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Indonesia tries to get companies to hold more rupiah to stem weakness,"By Cindy Silviana and Gayatri Suroyo
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Over the past couple of decades, Indonesian companies have developed a tried and tested strategy to cope with the periodic plunges in the rupiah: retain dollars to protect their profits. 
But their behavior can add to downward pressure on the currency, exacerbating problems for policymakers in southeast Asia’s biggest economy, especially given its relatively open nature compared to neighbors with more restrictive currency regimes.
The rupiah has been one of Asia’s worst performing currencies this year and hit its lowest level since late 2015 at one point last week after being caught up in an emerging market selloff. 
Bank Indonesia (BI), the nation’s central bank, has taken various measures to try to boost rupiah use and it is once again prodding firms to sell dollars, but companies surveyed by Reuters are maintaining U.S. currency holdings and only meeting minimum hedging requirements. 
Many companies say that with a lot of their costs in dollars and their revenue largely in rupiah they can’t risk getting caught by a slide in the local currency. They also point out that hedging can be very expensive. Vidjongtius, the president director of Indonesia’s biggest pharmaceutical company, Kalbe Farma (JK:KLBF), said that every percentage of rupiah depreciation raised its production costs by 0.35 percent.
Having “cash on hand” dollars has been a strategy for Kalbe for a long time because “hedging with a banking product is relatively more complex and sometimes hard to monitor, plus there is a cost for that,” he said.
The pharmaceutical industry is particularly exposed to exchange rate risks as its raw materials are mostly imported and it only exports a small part of its production. 
CAPITAL OUTFLOWS
New BI Governor Perry Warjiyo told a media gathering last Wednesday that forcing exporters to keep earnings onshore for longer or making companies convert dollar holdings was not currently an option under Indonesia's laws. 
That is in contrast to tougher foreign exchange systems in existence in places like Malaysia, which since 2016 has made exporters convert 75 percent of their earnings into ringgit. 
Indonesia is also vulnerable because unlike some countries in the region, it runs a current account deficit. In addition, foreigners own nearly 40 percent of the government’s bonds, so its currency can be hit by outflows from the bond market. 
Warjiyo said there was a misperception among some companies about the cost of hedging and some alarmism over how low the rupiah might go.
He has pledged to communicate more on hedging and to provide ""a rational expectation"" of where the rupiah is heading after he cited market talk suggesting it could pass 16,000 per dollar. It currently trades around 13,900. Some market participants have began to urge policymakers to reconsider Indonesia’s liberal rules on capital movement. 
In a parliamentary hearing this week, Kartika Wirjoatmodjo, chief executive of Bank Mandiri, one of the largest banks in the country, suggested that after the period of volatility passes, the rules be changed to accommodate some sort of capital management. 
“A softer approach would be to give exporters an incentive. So if they convert (earnings in dollars) to rupiah, maybe the tax on their deposit can be reduced,” he said.
If BI goes down that kind of road it would be the latest in a series of incremental steps it has taken in recent years to try to pressure companies into embracing the rupiah. 
In 2012, it ordered exporters to receive their payments through local banks, in the hope that some of the money would stay in the country and be converted into rupiah.
Two years later, the central bank made it mandatory for companies with liabilities in foreign currencies to hedge a quarter of their short-term foreign currency exposure. 
And in 2015, BI moved to enforce rules that mean all domestic transactions should be in rupiah, outlawing, for example, landlords charging rents in dollars. 
But this all clearly isn’t enough to make a big difference. 
And company executives say that hedging doesn’t always make sense. 
Dendy Kurniawan, chief executive of Indonesia AirAsia, which gets about half its revenue in rupiah and half in dollars, said if, for example, the rupiah fell 5 percent and it cost 6 percent to hedge it was pointless to hedge. 
""It does make more sense if the rupiah falls really deeply,” he said. 
Jahja Setiaatmadja, president director of Indonesia's Bank Central Asia, said banks typically only took 20 to 25 basis points of profit margin for a simple foreign exchange hedging product, but because it was priced off the rupiah interbank market it could carry a 5.95 percent rate for a one-year contract. 
It's not only exporters, but also companies with little or no dollar earnings that hold onto the American currency. 
Animal feed company Charoen Pokphand Indonesia (JK:CPIN), which mainly sells domestically but imports some raw materials, has sought to limit its dollar exposure by buying local corn and limiting its foreign debt, director Ong Mei Sian said.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2018 07:13PM ET</span>","Indian billionaire jeweler Nirav Modi flees to UK, claiming political asylum: FT","(Reuters) - Nirav Modi, the billionaire jeweler at the heart of a more than $2 billion fraud case in India, has fled to the UK, where he is claiming political asylum, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing Indian and British officials. 
Britain's Home Office said it does not provide information on individual cases. Nirav Modi could not be contacted by Reuters for comment on the FT report. 
 Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK), India's second-largest state-run bank, said earlier in 2018 that two jewelry groups headed by Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi had defrauded it of about $2.2 billion by raising credit from overseas branches of other Indian banks using illegal guarantees issued by rogue PNB staff at a Mumbai branch over several years.
Nirav Modi is in London trying to claim asylum from what he calls ""political persecution"", the FT reported.
India's ministry of external affairs told the FT the Indian government was waiting for the country's law enforcement agencies to approach them before pushing for an extradition, which had thus far not happened. The ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular working hours.
India is already seeking the extradition of Vijay Mallya, a liquor and aviation tycoon, over unpaid loans to his defunct  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines after the businessman and co-owner of the Formula One Force India team moved to Britain in March last year.
Indian federal police filed charges against more than 25 people in May including Modi, Choksi, former PNB chief Usha Ananthasubramanian, two of the bank's executive directors and three companies belonging to Nirav Modi.
Modi and Choksi have denied any wrongdoing. 
Last month, senior executives at the bank were accused by the Indian police, in a charge sheet filed in court, of misleading the central bank in late 2016 over the lender's handling of the financial messaging system and credit guarantees that were at the center of the fraud.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>",Batteries hasten winds of change for electricity stocks: Barron's,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bigger, better batteries are speeding up change in the U.S. electricity sector and could help power a rally in  Xcel Energy  Inc (O:XEL),  American Electric  Power Co Inc (N:AEP) and other utility and renewable energy stocks, Barron's reported.
After a decade of steep cost declines, wind and solar installations, often paired with battery storage, are increasingly displacing older coal and gas-fired power plants, benefiting battery makers and some utilities, the Barron's cover story said. 
Batteries can now store enough electricity to help power small towns when wind and solar supplies ebb, Barron's said. The United States is expected to install more than 35 megawatts of battery storage through 2025, which could save more than $4 billion in annual operating costs, Barron's said, citing the Washington-based Energy Storage Association trade group.
Minneapolis-based Xcel plans to draw 45 percent of its power from renewables by 2027, up from 23 percent currently. While the stock is down 11 percent this year, its performance has beaten the S&P 500 Index over the past 10 years, Barron's said.
American Electric is reducing its reliance on coal and holding gas generation steady, while ramping up wind and solar, in part through the $4.5 billion Wind Catcher project in Oklahoma, which claims to be the largest U.S. wind farm, Barron's said. The Columbus, Ohio-based company aims for low double-digit stock returns, Barron's said.
The paper also said  NextEra Energy Inc  (N:NEE), of Juno Beach, Florida, was combining 100 megawatts of solar capacity with 30 megawatts of battery storage at a project in Arizona. 
Investing in battery makers directly is complicated, since Panasonic Corp (T:6752), Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and other big makers come with a range of revenue streams. 
Utility stocks are under pressure as rising bond yields steal some of the appeal of dividend yields. But the outlook is improving for many companies in the Utilities Select Sector (P:XLU), Barron's said.
Reuters recently reported that a growing number of U.S. utilities are shutting fossil-fuel plants and have no plans to build combined-cycle natural gas power stations, because renewables are so much less expensive, posing problems for power plant makers such as  General Electric  Co (N:GE).

(Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co (N:KKR) is nearing an agreement to acquire U.S. physician services provider Envision Healthcare Corp (N:EVHC) for $46 a share, or about $5.5 billion, a person familiar with the deal told Reuters on Sunday.
A deal could be announced as soon as Monday, the source said. 
A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment. Envision did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. 
The agreement will come less than two weeks after KKR said it will buy U.S. business software company BMC Software in a deal which sources valued at $8.5 billion, including debt, making it the buyout firm's largest acquisition since the 2008 financial crisis.
Reuters reported last month that KKR and U.S. hospital operator HCA Healthcare Inc (N:HCA) had joined forces to make an offer for Envision, with the move aimed at giving HCA and KKR an edge over buyout firms, which were also pursuing Envision.
Other private equity firms competing for Envision included a consortium of  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) and TPG Global, sources told Reuters in May.
Envision said in 2017 that it was reviewing a range of strategic alternatives after reporting disappointing third-quarter earnings, which were attributed partly to the impacts of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, along with a slowdown in the growth of patient demand.
The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported that KKR is nearing a deal to buy Envision. 
KKR had agreed last month to acquire BMC from private equity companies Bain Capital and Golden Gate Capital, which bought BMC for $6.9 billion in 2013.
KKR had a successful year for fundraising in 2017, with the private equity firm's fund closings including a $13.9 billion North America private equity fund and a $1.45 billion healthcare fund.

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2018 01:28PM ET</span>",White House's Navarro says 'three strikes you're out' for ZTE,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese technology company ZTE Corp (HK:0763) will be ""shut down"" in the United States if it engages in one more bad activity, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro warned on Sunday. 
ZTE last week agreed to pay a $1 billion fine to the United States and to overhaul its leadership in order to end a crippling ban on the Shenzhen-headquartered firm from buying parts from U.S. suppliers and allowing it to get back into business. 
The ban, which traces back to a breach of the U.S. embargo on trade with Iran, had prevented China’s second largest telecoms equipment maker by revenue from buying the U.S. components it relies on to make phones and other devices.
""It's going to be three strikes you're out on ZTE. If they do one more additional thing, they will be shut down,"" Navarro told Fox, adding that everyone within the administration understood this was the policy. 
Navarro was speaking as President Donald Trump arrived in Singapore for a historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose regime is heavily dependent upon neighboring communist ally China.
The United States introduced the ban in April because ZTE broke the terms of an agreement it had entered into with the U.S. government after pleading guilty last year to conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by shipping U.S. goods to Iran.
The ZTE sanctions became a key focus in trade talks between Washington and Beijing, and a deal to lift the ban was struck as Trump sought concessions from China in order to avoid a trade war between the world's two largest economies.
Prominent U.S. Democratic and Republican lawmakers last week introduced legislation to try to overturn the deal, saying ZTE posed a threat to America's national security. 
On Sunday, Navarro said Trump's decision to allow ZTE to continue operating in the United States was a gesture to help build goodwill with China.
""The President did this as a personal favor to the president of China as a way of showing some good will for bigger efforts such as the one here in Singapore,"" said Navarro, referring to the summit between Trump and Kim.

He added that ZTE was a ""bad actor"" but that the deal included safeguards, such as requiring the company to retain a compliance team selected by the Commerce Department for 10 years. The company already has a U.S. court-appointed monitor.

The authority said it suspected the emissions control devices were being used in the bulk of Daimler's new Euro 6 diesel car fleet, encompassing some 1 million vehicles, according to the report.
A Daimler spokesman said he would not comment on the BamS story, adding, ""We are cooperating to a full extent and transparently with the KBA and the federal transport ministry.""
He reiterated previous Daimler comments objecting to the KBA stance that switch-off devices were in breach of regulations.
Daimler, like other car manufacturers, uses urea nitrate liquids to naturalize nitrogen oxide emissions in exhaust fumes. However, the KBA has taken issue with the emission control features amid suspicion they allow vehicles to emit excess pollution without detection.
Daimler said last month it would appeal against an order by the KBA to recall the Mercedes van Vito 1.6l Diesel Euro 6 model, following a transport ministry investigation.
Since rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. emissions tests, German carmakers including VW, Daimler and BMW (DE:BMWG) have faced a backlash against diesel technology in which they have invested billions of euros.

Daimler boss Dieter Zetsche is set to meet with German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer on Monday, after they met last week to discuss diesel emissions.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2018 03:52PM ET</span>","With sales boom in mind, Gucci tightens grip on suppliers","By Sarah White
FLORENCE, Italy (Reuters) - Kering's (PA:PRTP) fashion powerhouse Gucci is bringing more manufacturing in-house, as luxury firms step up efforts to meet rampant demand from Chinese shoppers with slicker operations. 
Gucci, which said this week it could one day overtake LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton as the world's top luxury brand by sales, also outlined plans at its strategy update to almost halve its reliance on independent leather goods suppliers. 
The step comes as labels including Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and France's Vuitton begin to levy greater control over their production or invest in speeding up internal processes to ride a rebound in luxury goods sales.
Gucci, one of the fastest-growing fashion brands in 2017 following a flamboyant design makeover, plans to cut its use of independent suppliers to 40 percent of its leather goods production over the long term, from 75 percent now. 
The Italian brand aims to halve the turnaround time between a product's conception and delivery in store as a result, CEO Marco Bizzarri said, as well as secure the production capacity it needs to match its punchy sales ambitions. 
""We want to reduce the lead time, and it's not possible if you're too scattered with small suppliers,"" Bizzarri told reporters, speaking at Gucci's new ""ArtLab"" site outside Florence, where it will do prototypes of bag and shoe designs. 
""We also need to make sure other brands are not stealing supply. Because of the growth that we're having we need to protect our artisans,"" Bizzarri added. 
Italian brands have traditionally worked with an external network of dozens of local artisans on items such as handbags, when French peers Hermes  and Vuitton almost exclusively use their own workshops. 
Gucci has bought out 10 local suppliers and said it was closing in on another 10, though the shift to what the brand considers internal production will for the most part involve creating joint ventures with external workshops or giving them exclusive contracts.
FAMILY WORKSHOPS
Even that can help to stabilize production, however, when some manufacturers in Italy are vulnerable.
Some are ""tiny, almost family-like workshops which have know-how but where there are often questions over whether they are sustainable, or regarding succession,"" said Olivier Salomon, managing director at consultancy Alix Partners in Paris.
Other brands with a big focus on leather goods like Milan-based Prada (HK:1913) are grappling with these issues too as they also consider taking more production in-house, partly to help nurture new generations of skilled workers. 
""One of the problems with outsourcing is one of quality. You need artisans ... and the problem with craftsmanship is one of training, you can't find these kind of people everywhere,"" Prada Chairman Carlo Mazzi told Reuters, as the label inaugurated a new industrial site in eastern Tuscany on Friday.
While traditional skills are in demand, fashion brands are also seeking to build-up internal expertise at a time of radical innovations in the materials used in fashion. 
Gucci's Bizzarri cited leather grown in laboratories as one potential industry game-changer, albeit a far-off one. 
Part of Gucci's ArtLab remit is research and development, as the brand seeks to perfect production methods new and old.
At the site on Thursday, workers buffed python skins dyed orange and blue for use in samples; elsewhere, a robot stress-tested sneakers, rhythmically bending them back and forth. 

""If you internalise production you are able to experiment much more in terms of innovation,"" Bizzarri said.

The comments come as Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo is due to meet on Monday with representatives from carmakers PSA,  Renault  (PA:RENA), BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) as well as start-ups involved in car-sharing to discuss potential alternatives to Autolib, the electric car-sharing scheme run by the Bollore group.
A row has erupted between the city of Paris and the Bollore group, which is asking the city and local authorities to contribute 46 million euros ($54 million) a year to help pay off debt the scheme has run up.
""Paris is the kind of city that interests us ... Free floating can be viable in Paris as there is a strong density of potential clients. We are in contact with the municipality. We could start rapidly,"" Brigitte Courtehoux, head of PSA's new mobility unit, told Les Echos.
PSA already operates free floating car-sharing services in Madrid and Lisbon.
""Free-floating is a flexible scheme. As there are no (specific) car stations, the perimeter can be easily extended depending on demand, even if in the end it must be profitable,"" Courtehoux added.
The contract for the Paris Autolib car-sharing scheme, which was launched in 2011, expires in 2023.
In 2015, PSA and the Bollore group signed a strategic cooperation agreement on developing car-sharing solutions using electric vehicles.

Bank of Baroda, which is winding down its operations in South Africa, was thrust into the spotlight two years ago when it started working with the Guptas, a family of Indian-born businessmen who are at the center of an influence-peddling scandal surrounding Zuma.
Zuma and the Guptas deny wrongdoing.
Police raided Bank of Baroda branches in Johannesburg and Durban and took documents showing bank transactions involving South African state firms, Hangwani Mulaudzi, a spokesman for the police's elite ""Hawks"" unit, said.
""We are of the view that Bank of Baroda was used as a conduit for the transfer of illicit funds. The raids are happening as part of 'state capture' investigations,"" Mulaudzi said, using a phrase coined to describe alleged influence-peddling under Zuma.
A Bank of Baroda employee in Durban who picked up the telephone confirmed the Hawks had visited the bank's premises on Friday.
""This search and seizure operation is not for investigation on Bank of Baroda. This requisition by the Hawks is in relation to the continuing ongoing investigation of the Gupta family,"" the bank said in a statement on Saturday.
The bank has been cooperating with investigating agencies and has shared relevant documents with them, it said.
An inquiry into allegations surrounding Zuma and the Guptas will begin formal public hearings in August and could take two years or more, officials have said.
Police earlier this year raided the compound of the Guptas in Johannesburg as part of an investigation into theft, fraud and money laundering at a state-backed dairy project in the Free State province that was meant to benefit the local community.
The whereabouts of the Gupta brothers is not publicly known. One of the brothers, Ajay Gupta, was declared a ""fugitive from justice"" after leaving South Africa for Dubai in February.
Gupta family representatives in South Africa could not be reached for comment.

Zuma was in court on Friday for a separate hearing relating to a $2.5 billion arms deal from the 1990s. He faces 16 charges of fraud, racketeering, corruption and money laundering in that case.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Probe finds PG&E power lines sparked deadly 2017 California wildfires,"By Steve Gorman
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A dozen of the wind-driven blazes that swept northern California's wine country last fall, killing 46 people in the deadliest firestorm in state history, were sparked by PG&E-owned power lines, state officials said on Friday.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CalFire, also said its investigators had found ""evidence of alleged violations of state law"" by Pacific Gas & Electric Company and referred those cases to county prosecutors for further review.
PG&E issued a statement in response saying the company looked forward to reviewing the CalFire reports, adding, ""We continue to believe our overall programs met our state's high standards.""
The findings could have tremendous implications for the San Francisco-based utility company in terms of potential legal liability for one of California's most lethal and costly disasters.
PG&E shares were down 0.6 percent in after-market trading following the CalFire statement.
The agency's investigation covered 12 individual blazes accounting for much of the conflagrations that erupted the night of Oct. 8 and raced across several counties north of San Francisco, collectively dubbed the North Bay Fires, or the October 2017 Fire Siege.
The firestorm claimed 46 lives, scorched at least 245,000 acres (99,148 hectares), and incinerated 8,900 homes and other structures, including entire subdivisions in the Sonoma County town of Santa Rosa. An estimated 100,000 people were placed under evacuation orders and the region's renowned wine-making region was thrown into turmoil.
The state's insurance commissioner put insured losses from the tragedy at $9 billion. 
Causes cited by CalFire included downed power lines and trees blown into electrical wires -- all equipment owned by PG&E -- during the course of fierce winds that roared through the region to spread the resulting flames with unprecedented speed.
Code violations were alleged in eight of the 12 fires under examination, CalFire said.
A CalFire spokesman, Michael Mohler, said agency officials looked for specific lapses ranging from maintenance and equipment failures to improper vegetation clearance, but he declined to discuss specific findings because the matter remains under investigation.
Last month, the agency similarly issued findings for the first four fires it examined from the North Bay incident, concluding those, too, were triggered by trees falling into PG&E power lines. Alleged clearance violations were cited in three of those instances. Mohler said investigations were still under way for several remaining fires from last October's outbreak.
PG&E said it meets or exceeds regulatory requirements for maintaining its utility poles, inspecting every electric transmission and distribution line at least once a year and pruning or removing some 1.4 million trees annually.
The company cited the ""new normal"" of heightened year-round wildfire hazards created by years of prolonged drought and millions of dead trees. 

In the case of last year's disaster, PG&E also pointed to the confluence of an unusually wet winter spurring heavy growth in vegetation, which dried out in record-setting summer heat to set the stage for explosive fire activity when a high winds struck that fall.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>","Verizon names tech chief CEO, prioritizes 5G network over content","By Supantha Mukherjee and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) named Chief Technology Officer Hans Vestberg as its new CEO on Friday, surprising analysts and signaling the largest U.S. wireless company's priority is building the next-generation 5G network, not expanding further into media content.
Vestberg, 52, joined Verizon a year ago after being fired as chief executive at communications equipment maker Ericsson (ST:ERICb) (O:ERIC) in 2016, following years of dismal growth and weak earnings.
At Verizon he headed a team building out Verizon's fiber network infrastructure, and he will lead Verizon in a strategy that differs markedly from wireless rival AT&T Inc (N:T) which is battling with the U.S. Justice Department to acquire media company  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) in an $85 billion deal.
Current Verizon CEO, Lowell McAdam, said in an interview it was the perfect time to hand the reins to Vestberg, with Verizon at an ""inflection point"" holding all the pieces it needs for 5G, such as fiber and spectrum.
Some analysts had expected John Stratton, Verizon's president of global operations, to succeed McAdam. Instead Stratton will retire.
Vestberg said in an interview Verizon would keep pursuing its current 5G strategy but he did not ""see anything new on the horizon"" to pursue media content. 
Under McAdam, Verizon expanded into content when it bought media sites AOL and Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA), creating a media division called Oath last year, which also owns sites like Tumblr and HuffPost. 
Vestberg was CEO of Sweden's Ericsson for six years, focusing on growth over profit. He spent some 28 billion crowns buying companies to boost Ericsson's position in other fields than its mainstay mobile network gear equipment, such as media assets.
That left Ericsson with costs that were too high and put it into a slump as rising competition hit the network gear market.
Lars Soderfjell, a portfolio manager at Finnish bank Alandsbanken, which owns Ericsson shares, said Vestberg pushed to expand the company's services unit, which included managing networks for mobile operators. He said that could make Vestberg a good fit for Verizon as it focuses on building its 5G network.
Nomura analysts described the common understanding of Vestberg's Ericsson tenure as ""stock flat, fired"" but wrote in an note that he had served during a period of intense competition in an industry that then consolidated. Nomura expected other executives to leave Verizon after the appointment. 
Until he retires at year end, McAdam will serve as executive chairman, then become non-executive chairman, the company said in a statement.
Verizon has gained about 40 percent of its $202.5 billion market value since McAdam took charge of the company on Aug. 1, 2011.

By early afternoon, Verizon shares rose 0.3 percent to $49.18 each, on a day that other tech shares fell on reports Apple (O:AAPL) expects to cut iPhone production this year.

""Following his sabbatical, John Lasseter will assume a consulting role at The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) until December 31, 2018, at which time he will be leaving the company,"" Disney said.
Disney did not announce a replacement but Chief Executive Bob Iger noted in the statement that Lasseter had assembled ""a team of great storytellers and innovators with the vision and talent to set the standard in animation for generations to come.""
Lasseter, 61, said in the statement that ""the last six months have provided an opportunity to reflect on my life, career and personal priorities.""
""While I remain dedicated to the art of animation and inspired by the creative talent at Pixar and Disney, I have decided the end of this year is the right time to begin focusing on new creative challenges,"" he added.
Lasseter joined the company in 2006 when Disney bought Pixar Animation Studios.
A pioneer in computer animation, Lasseter was the driving creative force behind Disney's success in animated films over the past decade. He is chief creative officer of Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios. 
Disney animation and Pixar films have sold roughly $14 billion worth of tickets worldwide since Lasseter joined Disney, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the Box Office Mojo website.
Lasseter took his leave after a report in the Hollywood Reporter last November that said some women at Disney had been made uncomfortable by physical contact from him.
He apologized in November in a memo to employees who felt ""disrespected or uncomfortable,"" but said his intent was ""benign."" 
Multiple accusations of sexual misconduct against entertainers, businessmen and politicians in the past year have led to many being fired or to resignations. The scandal inspired a widespread #MeToo social media movement by victims of sexual harassment or abuse. 
Lasseter was absent earlier this week from the world premiere in Hollywood for Pixar's next release, ""The Incredibles 2"" on June 15.

Online ticket seller Fandango said this week that the movie is on pace to become its biggest animated pre-seller ever.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge will decide next week whether AT&T (N:T), which owns DirecTV, will be allowed to buy  Time Warner  (N:TWX), home to CNN and March Madness basketball, for $85 billion.
Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia oversaw a six-week trial where the government argued the deal was illegal because it would give AT&T the power to withhold HBO and Turner channels from DirecTV's smaller pay TV rivals and cheaper online competitors.
The Justice Department focused on Time Warner's Turner assets, saying cable networks needed Turner channels like CNN and live sports to survive.
AT&T said it would not withhold shows because the licensing revenue from Time Warner was too valuable to pass up. It offered an arbitration agreement to small pay TV companies and promised not to black out Turner channels if conflicts arose over pricing Turner content for seven years. 
UBS said in a June 6 research note that Time Warner's share price shows about a 50 percent probability of the deal closing.
Neither the Justice Department nor AT&T will say if they would appeal a loss in court.
Here are some of the scenarios for a ruling on June 12:
DEAL APPROVED, NO CONDITIONS
This is obviously the outcome that AT&T seeks, and would allow it to add content sales to its revenue stream, which now depends on wireless sales in a maturing market, landlines and the shrinking pay TV market.
""AT&T clearly is looking for a diversification strategy from a revenue perspective. DirecTV is under strain. This (deal) was a hedge against content costs,"" said Mike McCormack, a senior analyst for telecom services at Guggenheim.
This ruling would embolden other pay TV companies or internet platforms -- like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- to buy content. 
Comcast said in May it was preparing an all-cash offer of more than $50 billion for most of Fox's media assets, competing with a Disney offer. Sources say it will only go forward if the judge allows the AT&T merger with Time Warner.
DEAL BLOCKED ALTOGETHER
If the deal is stopped, AT&T, in particular, would need a new strategy.
Time Warner is in a stronger position to go it alone, and has had a string of solid quarterly earnings reports with unique content like HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" CNN, and Turner Sports' March Madness basketball.
In contrast, AT&T's quarterly reports have been up and down over the past two years; with the ups attributed to stronger wireless subscriptions in some instances and the downs often blamed on lost DirecTV subscriptions.
That said, while AT&T has fought tooth and nail to save this deal, one industry analyst argued that losing Time Warner might be good for AT&T. 
""I think AT&T would probably be better off if the deal fell through. The value it gets for it (Time Warner) doesn’t generate a sufficient return to justify the cost of the deal,"" said Allan Nichols at Morningstar.
DEAL ALLOWED WITH DIVESTMENT OF DIRECTV OR TURNER
The companies may decide to appeal a ruling that requires AT&T to sell DirecTV, with 20 million subscribers, or orders Time Warner to sell Turner to get the deal done.
When the government suggested at trial that AT&T sell DirecTV as an alternative to stopping the deal entirely, Daniel Petrocelli, speaking for the companies, objected strongly, saying: ""That is an effort to kill the deal.""
DEAL ALLOWED WITH NEW CONDITIONS, NOT DIVESTITURES
During the trial, Leon asked few questions but many of them focused on the adequacy of the arbitration proposal.
AT&T offered last year to submit pricing disputes with other pay TV companies over Turner's CNN, sports and other channels to third-party arbitration. The companies offered not to black out programming during arbitration for seven years.

In a court filing, cable provider RCN and others urged the judge to include all Time Warner assets, especially HBO, in the offer and to allow broadcasters to learn what other distributors paid for content as part of the process.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Elon Musk's multi-billion dollar compensation package should be rescinded and the board of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc should be overhauled to better protect investors in the electronic car company, according to a law suit filed by a shareholder on Thursday. 
The lawsuit accused the board of corporate waste and Musk, the company's chief executive officer and chairman, of unjust enrichment.
The lawsuit is seeking class action status.
Tesla said in a statement that the lawsuit ""seeks to take the power from our shareholders and instead give it to plaintiffs lawyers. We will respond accordingly.""
Musk received the support of the company's shareholders in March for a package that Tesla estimated to be worth $2.6 billion.
A  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst estimated the package could be worth up to $70 billion if the company continues to grow quickly. While the award of the pay package cooled speculation that Musk might be planning to quit, it was also criticized for its unprecedented size. 
Proxy advisory services ISS and Glass Lewis both had recommended shareholders reject the package.
""The new E. Musk compensation plan is so large it dwarfs the pay package of every other public company CEO,"" said the complaint by Richard Tornetta that was unsealed on Thursday in Delaware's Court of Chancery.
Tesla's statement noted that Musk gets nothing unless the company's market value doubles and continues to increase until it becomes one of the world's most valuable companies.
Much of the complaint describing the how the pay package is unfair was redacted. 
The complaint said Tornetta obtained corporate records from Tesla as permitted under Delaware corporate law. Companies sometimes provide that information only if a shareholder signs a non-disclosure agreement.
The lawsuit was unsealed days after shareholders rejected a shareholder proposal to strip Musk of the chairman role.
That had represented the strongest challenge yet to Musk's grip on the Silicon Valley car maker, which also faces production setbacks and expectations by many analysts that it will need to raise new cash.
The case was assigned to Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights. In March, Slights ruled against Tesla's request for an early dismissal of a shareholder class action challenging the company's acquisition of SolarCity Corp, a renewable energy company.
The lawsuit alleged that Musk used his power over Tesla's board to buy SolarCity at a price that unfairly benefited Musk, a large shareholder in SolarCity.
The SolarCity deal closed in November 2016.

That case is proceeding to trial.

1161,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 04:57PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week
1. Trump's Tangle With Allies Keeps Lid on U.S. Equity Rally 
U.S. stock markets rose more than 1% this week but gains were held back in the latter part of the week somewhat as focus shifted to escalating trade tension between the U.S. and its key allies as the G7 summit got underway.
U.S. President Trump refused to back down from his tough stance on tariffs, as he vowed to ""fight"" for the United States, and criticised allies, accusing them of imposing massive tariffs and creating non-monetary barriers.
Tech was also one the stories of the week after coming under pressure on Thursday and Friday as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell.
Apple fell nearly 1% Friday on reports the iPhone maker warned its supply chain to make fewer parts for iPhones in the second half of 2018 amid expectations for lower sales.
Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rallied sharply this week after CEO Elon Musk said it is ""quite likely"" Tesla will hit a weekly Model 3 production rate of 5,000 cars by the end of June.
The S&P 500 closed more than 1% higher for the week at 2,779.03.
2. Crude Oil Prices Post Third Straight Weekly Slump
Crude oil prices posted a third straight weekly loss after settling lower Friday on concerns about ongoing U.S. output after data showed the number of U.S. oil rigs continued to climb.
Oil price action was choppy for most of the week as OPEC members attempted to allay fears the oil cartel would lift limits on production curbs at its June 22 meeting.
U.S. oil output, meanwhile, continued to rise as the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday U.S. oil output rose to a record 10.8 million barrels per day.
Oil prices were also limited by a weekly Energy Information Administration report showing U.S. crude supplies unexpectedly rose by 2.072 million barrels in the week ended June 1.
Crude futures settled 22 cents lower on Friday as data showed U.S. oil rigs continued to climb, pointing to signs of growing domestic output.
3. Dollar Suffers Weekly Loss; Emerging Market Currencies Swing Violently
The dollar posted its first weekly loss in four weeks despite expectations the Federal Reserve will hike rates next week for the second time this year.
The Federal Reserve will also release its summary of economic projections outlining expectations for key measures of the U.S. economy including inflation, interest rates, unemployment and GDP.
The dollar was held back by a resurgent euro as European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers stoked expectations the ECB would tighten monetary policy sooner rather than later.
ECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday the central bank would next week debate whether to cut bond purchases gradually, Reuters reported.
The dollar rose 0.12% to 93.54 against a basket of major currencies on Friday.
Emerging market currencies were also in focus this week as Brazil's real and the Turkish lira made sharp moves.
Brazil's real rallied sharply Friday as positive inflation data lifted expectations for a rate hike, sending the USD/BRL tumbling more than 5%.
4. Gold Notches Weekly Win in Narrow Trade
Gold prices bounced back from a weekly slump as dollar weakness encouraged buying, which was tentative, however, with a widely expected Fed rate hike on the horizon.
Gold prices were unable to capitalise on rising geopolitical tensions as U.S. President Donald Trump went into the G7 meeting expecting a frosty reception after lashing out at Canada and the European Union.
Gold appeared to be in 'wait-and-see' mode through the week as trading was restricted to a narrow range ahead of the Fed rate decision and the release of the central bank's economic estimates.
According to investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, 33.8% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to hike rates for a fourth time at its December meeting, up from under 30% last week.
5. Bitcoin Ignores Wall Street Attention 
Bitcoin seesawed its way to end the week roughly unchanged as regulatory uncertainty continued to weigh on sentiment despite signs of increasing institutional demand for the popular cryptocurrency.
A report this week that Wall Street giant Fidelity was eyeing a move into the crypto space, planning to create products that would push the market for bitcoin to the ""next level,"" attracted a muted reaction.
Bitcoin rose to a high of $7,777.4, testing a price level which some have identified as resistance – price levels that trigger selling – before paring gains.
On the regulatory front, SEC chief Jay Clayton said this week, bitcoin was not a security, and further clarified the U.S. financial watchdog's position on initial coin offerings, or ICOs.
Clayton said the SEC would not bend the rules when it comes to ICOs, which he identified as a security.
""If you have an ICO or a stock, and you want to sell it in a private placement, follow the private placement rules,"" Clayton said.
Demand for cryptocurrencies modestly improved as data showed the total crypto market cap rose to about $342 billion, at the time of writing, from about $329 billion a week ago.
Over the past seven days, Bitcoin rose 2.36% on the Bitfinex exchange, Ethereum rose 4.28%, while Ripple XRP rose 9.97% on the Poloniex exchange."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Friday as investors shrugged off concerns about global trade tensions but trading volume was relatively light ahead of a busy week of central bank meetings. 
The S&P 500 stayed in positive territory in the afternoon after reversing losses in the early afternoon with its biggest boosts coming from the health care and consumer staples sectors.
Investors appeared to put aside worries about U.S. relations with its biggest trading partners. G7 major nations started what was expected to be a tense meeting after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, the European Union and Mexico.
Expectations for any breakthroughs at the two-day meeting in La Malbaie, Quebec, were low. ""It's highly unlikely there will be a final communique,"" a G7 official said on condition of anonymity.[nL2N1TA0IJ]
But some investors appeared hesitant ahead of U.S. and European central bank meetings and a North Korea-U.S. summit set for June 12. 
""There's a lot for investors to digest but when you parse through the noise there's still a lot of strength in the economy and that's what investors keep gravitating to,"" said Carol Schleif, Deputy Chief Investment Officer, Abbot Downing in Minneapolis.
Specifically investors were focused on expectations for strong growth among U.S. corporations, according to Katrina Lamb, head of investment strategy and research at MV Financial, in Bethesda, Maryland. 
She cited expectations for sales growth of more than 7 percent this year. Wall Street estimates 2018 earnings growth of 22.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""The math looks really good in terms of the relation between price and earnings and sales,"" said Lamb. ""This is a perfectly good time to be long the market."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 75.12 points, or 0.3 percent, to 25,316.53, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 8.61 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,778.98 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 10.44 points, or 0.14 percent, to 7,645.51.
For the week, the S&P rose 1.62 percent while the Dow added 2.76 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1.21 percent.
The consumer staples index (SPLRCS) was the biggest percentage gainer of the S&P's 11 major sectors, with a 1.3 percent advance. Its biggest drivers were Procter & Gamble which continued its rally from the previous day, rising 1.9 percent, and Philip Morris (N:PM), which rose 2.6 percent after it announced a 6.5 percent dividend hike.
 Monster Beverage  (O:MNST), another staples company, rose 4.7 percent after the energy drink maker said it was ""highly likely"" it would raise prices later in the year.
The Healthcare index (SPXHC) was the S&P's boost with a 0.7 percent gain and its biggest driver was Allergan (N:AGN), which rose 4.3 percent. 
The technology sector was barely positive with a 0.03 percent gain. Dragging on the sector was Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and its suppliers which were down following a report that the iPhone maker was planning to produce fewer phones this year. Apple was last down 1 percent.
In the quietest trading day since May 25, 6.05 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Friday, compared to the 6.6 billion average for the last 20 days.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an increase interest rates in its post-meeting statement on Wednesday and investors will be watching for signals from the U.S. central bank on its plans for the rest of the year.
U.S. investors are also keeping an eye on Europe as the European Central Bank's chief economist has said policymakers meeting on June 14 will debate whether to end bond purchases this year.
An unprecedented meeting between Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un is also scheduled for June 12 in Singapore. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 143 new highs and 20 new lows.

The name, announced by Chief Executive Oliver Blume at Porsche's 70th anniversary celebration on Friday, means ""lively, young horse"", reflecting the iconic rearing black horse on Porsche's coat of arms.
The four-seater electric sports car due to roll off production lines in 2019 has so far been known as Mission E.
Porsche has said it plans to double its investment in hybrid and fully electric vehicles to more than 6 billion euros ($7.06 billion) by 2022 as parent Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) seeks to overcome an emissions-cheating scandal and tap into growing demand for greener transportation.
Porsche has said battery-only vehicles could account for a quarter of its sales by 2025.

With the Taycan, the company aims to tap consumer demand with powerful engines and batteries. The company says the Taycan will be able to go from 0 to 100 kph in 3.5 seconds and will have a range of 500 km and rapid 800-volt charging.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. cable company Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is set to gain unconditional EU antitrust approval for its bid to buy European pay-TV company Sky , two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The world's biggest entertainment company is battling Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox for Sky. The media mogul bid's to buy all of Sky has been delayed by politicians and regulators worried about the power of the enlarged media group.
The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on Comcast's offer by June 15, did not respond to a request for comment by email. It cleared without conditions Fox's bid for Sky in April last year.
Comcast declined to comment.
Earlier this week, Britain gave the green light to Fox's bid to acquire all of Sky on condition it sold off its TV news business. Fox now owns 39 percent of Sky, which has operations in Germany, Austria, Italy and Britain.
Sky's 23 million customers makes it an invaluable asset to any media group seeking to better compete against online groups Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 

Murdoch has already agreed to sell many of his TV and film assets, including Sky, to Walt Disney Co in a separate $52 billion deal.

The Milan-based firm is run by the husband-and-wife team of Patrizio Bertelli and designer Miuccia Prada, whose grandfather founded the label in 1913. 
The couple's eldest child Lorenzo, 30, joined Prada to run its digital communications last year, the company confirmed this week following a Bloomberg report. Bertelli said his son was being prepared to take over. 
""Lorenzo is getting ready to become one day - if he wants to - the head of Prada,"" Bertelli said, at the inauguration of a production site in Italy, although 72-year-old also said it was ""too early to retire.""
The succession question comes as Prada looks to cement early signs of a turnaround following several years of falling sales. 
Chinese consumer demand rebounded in the past 18 months, fuelling rapid growth for some rivals like Kering's Gucci (PA:PRTP) or LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton, but Prada was slow to catch on to trends such as the rise of high-end streetwear like sneakers. 
It is also playing catch up with online sales, and trying to build a bigger digital presence by forging ties with influential fashion bloggers, especially in China. 
Sales trends improved in the second half of 2017.
Other famed Italian fashion houses such as Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) are also in the midst of a turnaround, as some brands struggle more than others to grab younger shoppers' attention with new products and eye-catching looks. 
That has sparked speculation that names like Prada or Ferragamo could become takeover targets, though both are tightly controlled by families seen as unlikely to let go easily.
""We're not selling, we'll never sell,"" Prada's Bertelli said, adding that there were no acquisitions in sight either because of ""really crazy"" prices.
The luxury industry's biggest, cash-rich players - French conglomerates  Kering  and LVMH - have succeeded in picking up some Italian family brands in recent years, however. 

LVMH grabbed jeweler Bulgari in 2011, while Kering bought into smaller Italian jewelry brand Pomellato in 2013.

“The scary thing is there seems to be a lot of conversation around import-based companies and not even much realization that there’s a huge amount of vehicles produced here by international companies,” Brian Smith, Hyundai Motor America’s chief operating officer, said in an interview. “The whole tariff conversation isn’t around, ‘Well, we’ll produce here in the United States and everything’s fine.’ It’s more about, the international companies seem to be being targeted.”
Smith was among 10 auto executives who met with the president in the White House last month to discuss issues including trade. Within weeks, the Commerce Department began investigating whether imported cars are threatening U.S. national security, and the administration is said to be considering tariffs of as much as 25 percent.
President Trump travels to Canada on Friday for a Group of Seven meeting after having stoked trade tensions with U.S. allies. Hyundai produces more than half the models it sells in America, including the Sonata sedan and Santa Fe sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Alabama that employs 2,700 full-time workers."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is considering asking the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) to get Goldman Sachs (N:GS) to return nearly $600 million in fees it earned from bonds raised for scandal-tainted 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Malaysia is scrambling to bring home billions of dollars allegedly siphoned off from 1MDB, a state fund founded by ex-premier Najib Razak, who lost a general election last month. 
His successor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, said Malaysia is also seeking to arrest financier Low Taek Jho, a central figure in the scandal who advised on investments and negotiated deals for 1MDB.
Malaysian authorities want to ask the DoJ, which is pursuing a corruption and money laundering probe at 1MDB, to get Goldman to disgorge profits it made from the sale of the bonds, after which Malaysia would claim the money, the two sources familiar with the matter said.
No formal request has been made to the DoJ on the Goldman fees, but top officials are actively discussing the plan within the government, they said.
""There have been no official requests yet, but this is being discussed,"" said a Malaysian government source.
A financial industry source in Malaysia, who is aware of the discussions, said back channel talks between the government and the DoJ were under way.
How Kuala Lumpur would go about claiming the funds, and the legal hurdles in the process were not immediately made clear by the sources. 
A spokeswoman for Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said the minister had no comment on the matter.
The DOJ and a spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
The U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur directed Reuters to the DoJ for comment. 
Goldman raised nearly $6.5 billion in three bond sales between 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB.
More than $2.5 billion raised from these bonds was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB officials, their relatives and associates, according to DoJ civil lawsuits filed in a U.S. court in 2016.
The U.S. bank earned almost $600 million for the three deals – an amount critics say is far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent fees a bank could expect for helping sell bonds.
A special task force set up after the election to look into 1MDB met officials from the DoJ and the U.S. FBI to discuss the probe in late May, including the process of returning the funds to Malaysia, the government has said.
WARRANTS ISSUED 
Mahathir told reporters the government was trying to arrest Low, popularly known as Jho Low, but he was not in the country. ""We don't have extradition rights in the country where he is staying,"" he said. He did not say which country Low was in.
Low was regarded as close to Najib and his family.
The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) had issued an arrest warrant for Low, as well as for Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, a director of former 1MDB unit SRC International, a source familiar with the matter had earlier told Reuters.
It was also preparing an arrest warrant for Roger Ng, a former Goldman banker, the source said.
Singapore authorities said on Friday they had issued arrest warrants in 2016 for Low and his associate, Tan Kim Loong, and requested an Interpol notice. It was the first time Singapore has acknowledged it was seeking Low's arrest.
Low and 1MDB have denied any wrongdoing. Tan Kim Loong could not be reached for comment.
Low advised on investments and negotiated deals for 1MDB, though he never held any official role in the fund.
1MDB is the subject of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.
Najib has denied any wrongdoing, but has been questioned by government investigators after the election. He and his wife have been barred from leaving the country.
Goldman has always maintained that it did nothing wrong and that it had no visibility into whether some of the funds raised may have been subsequently diverted to other purposes.
In civil lawsuits filed by the DOJ to seize assets bought with misappropriated 1MDB money, U.S. authorities say investors were not properly informed about the use and nature of the bonds that Goldman helped sell for 1MDB.
The Wall Street bank however was not accused of any wrongdoing in the lawsuits.
Goldman has come under scrutiny for its involvement in the 1MDB affair, with U.S. and Singapore authorities looking into its role in helping raise funds for 1MDB through the bonds. 
Goldman's former Southeast Asia chairman, Tim Leissner, was issued a 10-year prohibition order by Singapore last year and was also barred from the U.S Securities industry.
Leissner was responsible for managing Goldman's relationship with 1MDB and had helped arrange the sale of U.S. dollar bonds for 1MDB, sources have said.

Leissner, who took over the role in mid-2014, resigned in 2016 after he had allegedly violated the firm's internal rules, a source has told Reuters.

1185,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",Corporations Hurry to Sell Bonds Before Central Banks Shift,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. companies are rushing to sell bonds to try to outrun potential market turmoil that could come when central banks tighten policies.
Corporations have already issued $34 billion of high-grade debt this month, mostly from rate-sensitive financial and utilities firms. That puts companies on pace for an estimated $95 billion of issuance, which would be the most in June since 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This is happening as spreads in the secondary market reach the widest levels in more than a year.
“Early summer may be busier than usual, because some participants are expecting volatility to pick up through the late summer and fall,” said Zachary Chavis, a portfolio manager at Sage Advisory Services, which has $12 billion in assets under management. “There are several question marks out there, such as the possibility that global monetary policy may begin its transition from QE into quantitative tightening.”
The big push by corporate borrowers highlights the amount of concern that has spread into the market amid a growing list of risks, which includes the European Central Bank tightening monetary policy faster than expected and the Federal Reserve increasing the amount of bonds it rolls off its balance sheet, according to Chavis.
“These issues may spark some volatility, as we’ve never had to go through a credit cycle like this before,” he said.
Companies also boosted bond sales this week because of last week’s Italian turmoil and next week’s Fed meeting.
Borrowers are trying to get to market before issuance becomes more expensive, according to Tim Ng, chief investment officer at New York-based Clearbrook Global Advisors, which advises on $28 billion of assets.
“Not only will the Fed raise interest rates at least two more times this year, but as the Fed continues to unwind its balance sheet, you have a natural buyer coming out of the market,” Ng said. “Investors may ask for a premium to take on this increase of issuance that will happen as the deficit continues to increase.”
But so far, there’s no sign that investors’ appetites are shrinking. For example, tech company Trimble Inc.’s sale this week of BBB rated bonds was more than three times oversubscribed.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Private matters: state funding weighs on Russian soccer,"By Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber
MOSCOW (Reuters) - When soccer World Cup hosts Russia open the tournament on June 14 they will be fielding the team ranked lowest at the finals, three places behind their first opponents Saudi Arabia.
There is no single explanation for what ails Russian soccer, but one of the origins of the woes of the national team may rest in a trait of Russia's economy: heavy state involvement.
With a couple of notable exceptions, private investors have snubbed Russian soccer so most top-tier clubs are bankrolled by regional authorities and state-owned companies, leaving teams vulnerable to budget cuts and shifting political priorities.
The uncertainty has seen many state backers shun investment in grassroots player development, instead bringing in expensive foreign stars in a race for results when times are good, and cutting back when budgets are tight.
""Everyone wants to be a sprinter. No one wants to invest in the long term,"" said Anatoly Vorobyov, the former general secretary of the Russian Football Union http://www.rfs.ru.
""Instead of investing in schools, in the grassroots, a huge portion of the state budget is spent on foreign players, on players' very large contracts,"" he told Reuters.
In the Soviet era, the national team reached the World Cup semi-finals in 1966, was crowned European champions in 1960 and came second three times afterwards. But the sport suffered when the Soviet Union collapsed as training camps fell into disuse at a time of sweeping social and economic transformation.
Since 1990, Russia has only played in three World Cup finals and won just two games. This time Russia qualified as host but is ranked by FIFA http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/index.html at an all-time low of 70th, between Guinea and Macedonia.
LITTLE INCENTIVE
Leonid Fedun is one of the few private owners of a top-tier Russian soccer club. The billionaire deputy head of oil giant Lukoil bought Spartak Moscow in 2004 when it was in serious financial difficulty.
Fedun created a youth academy and built a 45,000-seat stadium that will be one of 12 World Cup venues. Russian Premier League runners-up five times since Fedun took over, Spartak finally became champions last year after a 16-year drought.
But he worries that Russian state involvement in soccer, and the economy in general, is becoming ever greater and that this is detrimental to the development of the sport.
""State money is there and there is no escaping it,"" he told Reuters. ""Soccer cannot be outside this system. I don't like this. But at the moment there is no alternative.""
""Most directors at the league have other interests,"" Fedun said. ""They need to spend the budgets they are given by the state or sponsors, and not work on developing soccer.""
Public sector activities accounted for 46 percent of Russia's gross domestic product in 2016, up from 39.6 percent a decade earlier, according to the Russian-based Centre for Strategic Research.
In its 2030 development strategy, the Russian Football Union calls for the gradual substitution of state funding in professional soccer with private investment.
But the strategy concedes there is little incentive to invest in the sport in Russia given meager revenues from ticket sales, television broadcasting rights and merchandise. 
""There are no conditions in place for significant growth in these revenues in the short term,"" the strategy said.
Ticket sales and match-day revenue accounted for less than 5 percent of Russian Premier League clubs' revenue in 2016, while broadcasting rights brought in 4.1 percent, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers http://www.pwc.com (PwC) study that cites data from the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). 
In contrast, broadcasting rights in Europe's top 10 leagues, excluding Russia, accounted for 38.7 percent of clubs' revenue on average, while match-day revenue and ticket sales made up 15.5 percent, the study said.
FILLING THE VOID
As the state has expanded its influence over key sectors of the economy in the last two decades, that has paved the way for state-run giants such as VTB bank, Rosneft and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) to leave their mark on Russian sport.
""Television and advertisement account for only a few percent of revenue,"" said former soccer official Vorobyov. ""This has to be compensated by big sponsorship contracts with companies like Gazprom, VTB and Russian Railways.""
Sponsorship and other commercial revenue accounted for 60.6 percent of Russian Premier League clubs' revenue in 2016, according to PwC, almost double the European average.
But the investment can be unpredictable.
Zenit St Petersburg, bankrolled by Gazprom, signed Brazil's Hulk and Belgium's Axel Witsel for 80 million euros ($94 million) in 2012 but has since cut back on big transfers as global oil and gas prices slumped. 
The club signed Italian manager Roberto Mancini last year - paying him 4.5 million euros a year, according to a source - but he left after Zenit finished fifth in the league, their worst performance in a decade.
Little private investment is not the only reason Russian soccer is struggling. Insiders cite a dearth of quality coaches and poor coordination among soccer authorities as contributing factors. Few Russian players have sought experience in more competitive leagues abroad because they are cocooned at home. 
The 16-team Russian Premier League limits clubs to a maximum of six foreign players on the pitch at one time, a measure designed to give home-grown talent a chance.
But the move has artificially increased the value of Russian players, leading them to remain in a league where their wages can far exceed what they might make elsewhere. 
Only two players in Russia's 2018 World Cup squad play outside the country. All members of Russia's 2014 World Cup team - which failed to win a match at the finals - were from Russian Premier League teams.
BUILD FROM THE BOTTOM
One up-and-coming team, FC Krasnodar, is very much focused on Russian players. But its billionaire founder Sergei Galitsky says he wants Krasnodar's squad to be composed mainly of graduates from the club's youth academy https://fckrasnodar.ru/en/academy/history.
Founder of the supermarket chain Magnit, Galitsky's goal is not just to achieve success for Krasnodar but also to revive Russian soccer by changing the approach to the game and building from the bottom up.
Galitsky sold most of his stake in the retail chain this year to state bank VTB for $2.5 billion and said he would indulge his love of soccer at the youth level.
In its decade of existence, Krasnodar has yet to win the Russian league but has shown promise on the pitch, making it to the last 16 of the Europa League in 2017. The top scorer in the UEFA Youth League this season was its 19-year-old Ivan Ignatyev. 
Some other clubs in smaller Russian cities have not been so fortunate. Several teams receiving state support have dropped out of the top division or, like Alania Vladikavkaz, simply folded when government priorities changed.
""There was no financing (from the regional government) for seven months,"" said former club president and coach Valery Gazzaev. ""It was at that point impossible to maintain the club."" 
Gazzaev, now a lawmaker, is drafting legislation to give companies and private investors tax benefits for investing in professional sport in Russia. 
Spartak's Fedun said there were at best 12 clubs in the Russian Premier League that could actually attract a large enough crowd for them to function.

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>","VW says 250,000 cars could be delayed by new testing rules","BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said production of up to 250,000 cars from its group brands in the second half will be delayed because of effects from new mandatory lab tests for emissions and fuel economy.
Implementation of the so-called Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) on Sept. 1 for new cars will temporarily restrict the availability of some models and could affect working capital by driving up first-half inventories, Volkswagen (VW) said on Friday, without being more specific.
Carmakers are facing bottlenecks as they rush to get models through the more complex WLTP tests on a limited number of exhaust emissions test benches as they won't be able to sell new vehicles after Sept. 1 without the new carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption readings.
""Because of the introduction of the new WLTP testing procedure, we expect in the second half of 2018 an effect at the VW group of around 200,000 to 250,000 vehicles that we will build later than originally planned,"" VW said.
Although effects on sales cannot be ruled out from the launch of WLTP which replaces the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and aims to better reflect real-driving data, VW on Friday reaffirmed its goal for group deliveries to moderately exceed last year's record 10.7 million units.
""We are working at high pressure on further measures to keep the effects on our production as low as possible,"" VW said.
Porsche, the second-biggest contributor to VW group profit said last week it would temporarily limit the number of models it sells in Europe because of the implications of WLTP.
Wolfsburg-based VW had no comment on potential costs from the disruptions. Citing unnamed sources at VW, German magazine Der Spiegel on Friday reported that the risk for VW could run into billions as the bottlenecks mean a mid-level, six-digit number of cars could hit dealerships late or not at all.

On Wednesday, new Chief Executive Herbert Diess told a staff gathering at the main Wolfsburg plant that production there will be halted on certain days in August and September as VW will only build models that fulfil the new standards.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Vanguard Group Inc raised a profit-sharing dividend for employees by 16.5 percent for 2017, the largest increase since 1997, an investment adviser who follows the largest mutual fund company said on Friday.
Daniel Wiener, who also runs a newsletter for Vanguard investors, said via e-mail that payouts made under the Pennsylvania company's Partnership Plan are based largely on assets under management, which have risen sharply in recent years.
Vanguard's well-known passive funds such as its Vanguard 500 Index Fund together received $329 billion in net deposits from investors last year, according to researcher Morningstar, the most of any firm in the industry and helping drive the company's total assets above $5 trillion.
A Vanguard spokesman, John Woerth, declined to confirm the figures obtained by Wiener. Referring to its workforce, Woerth said via e-mail that the Partnership Plan ""aligns the interests of the crew with those of Vanguard’s clients.""
Woerth also declined to disclose the pay of top executives including CEO Tim Buckley, which the closely-held company does not describe in filings.
Wiener said partnership dividends account for most of top executives' compensation and that the best way to estimate the pay of leaders like Buckley is to compare it to what the plan would have produced for past leaders for whom disclosures are available.
As an illustration, he estimated the latest dividends would have produced payouts of about $24 million and $14 million for two past Vanguard leaders, although they would no longer receive the partnership dividends.
For current executives, Wiener wrote, ""It may not be hedge-fund money, but for a low-cost indexing shop it ain't peanuts either.""

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Chinese nuclear plant developer will not seek UK state investment,"By Susanna Twidale
LONDON (Reuters) - A planned nuclear plant to the east of London will not require state investment, the Chinese company building it said after the British government was criticized for helping another project.
""It is not our plan to seek direct investment from the UK government for Bradwell B,"" Robert Davies, chief operating officer of CGN UK, a UK subsidiary of China's General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN),  told Reuters.
After saying it did not want to directly invest in new nuclear plants, Britain's government made a U-turn this week, saying it could take a stake in Hitachi's (T:6501) near $20 billion Wlyfa project in Wales,
CGN's Davies said it was too early to discuss funding in detail but, but the fact that the Chinese-owned firm said it will not need such direct investment shows it is confident of funding the project itself, or being able to raise the cash.
The British government also faced protests over its decision to offer a guaranteed power price to the Hinkley Point project being built by France's EDF (PA:EDF), Britain's first new nuclear plant in more than twenty years. 
Britain says it needs a new fleet of nuclear plants to replace aging coal and nuclear reactors set to close in the 2020s as well as to cut the country's carbon emissions.
But large new nuclear power plants costing several billion pounds have struggled to secure financing, with the cost of lending higher than traditional infrastructure projects due to concerns over future potential liabilities. 
This raised the possibility that it would also need to provide similar assistance for other new plants to be built.
Hinkley got the final go-ahead from EDF's board in 2016 after several years of delay, and only after securing backing from the French government.
When announcing the possible Hitachi deal, Britain's business minister Greg Clark said it hoped future nuclear projects ""should be financed by the private sector.""
SUBSIDY 
Hinkley was also awarded a subsidy minimum price guarantee from the British government of almost double current electricity prices, which the National Audit office said could cost consumers 30 billion pounds ($40 billion).
Davies said CGN's Bradwell project would expect a much lower minimum guarantee price.
""We know we have to get within a realistic range of (the cost of) offshore wind,"" he said.
Some offshore wind projects were awarded a minimum price as low as 57.50 per megawatt hour (MWh) in the latest round of subsidies, compared with the 92.50 pounds per MWh guaranteed for Hinkley.
CGN owns a third of EDF's Hinkley project and will also help it develop another new plant in Suffolk, Sizewell C.
The Chinese company will also lead construction of the plant in Bradwell, Essex, using a Chinese-designed nuclear reactor which needs to gain approval from Britain's nuclear regulator.
""We expect to complete the second phase of the GDA (generic design approval) by the end of the year and final approval by the end of 2021. The target is for the final investment decision to be made shortly after that,"" Davies said. 
The HPR 1000 nuclear reactor CGN plans to use at Bradwell is capable of generating 1000 megawatts (MW) but no decision has been made yet about how many reactors would be deployed.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 11:56AM ET</span>",Julius Baer looks to fixed price system to bolster returns,"By Angelika Gruber
ZURICH (Reuters) - (This version of June 7's story refiles as the bank corrects breakdown of its mandates business to read 34 percent(not 50 percent)advisory mandates, 16 percent discretionary mandates & 50 percent(not 30 percent) remianing business.)
Swiss private bank  Julius Baer  (S:BAER) is shifting more customers to a pricing system that charges them a fixed fee for its services as part of a wider industry effort to buffer against choppy revenues.
In the past, Swiss private banks did not put a fixed price tag on their advisory services for wealthy clients, but charged fees based on transactions carried out for them. 
These transaction fees were once the primary source of income for many wealth managers, but banks are now moving away from setting fees for individual transactions in the wealth management business. This is partly to meet new European Union rules known as MiFID II but also to protect them from times when clients are reluctant to commit to transactions.
""We are replacing volatile transaction fees with more stable advisory fees, and that certainly also benefits shareholders,"" the group's head of advisory solutions, Philipp Rickenbacher, told Reuters in an interview. 
Switzerland's third-largest listed bank is seeking to shift more customers over to the fixed fee pricing scheme introduced in 2015. This is known as a mandate model, which replaces the previous system that was based on the frequency of transactions undertaken for customers.
""We want to shift our customers worldwide over to mandate models,"" Rickenbacher said. ""Probably not 100 percent (of clients), but certainly above 80 percent. Even 90 percent would be very feasible in the future."" To date the share of customers in the new system has increased to around 50 percent.
Commission and fee income now contributes around 60 percent of the bank's operating income.
At larger rivals such as UBS (S:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) which have a higher proportion of ultra-wealthy clients, mandate penetration stands at roughly a third of wealth management business, according to the banks' financial statements.
Thirty-four percent of Julius Baer's clients have advisory mandates which provide the customer with the final say on whether to proceed or not with an investment.
A further 16 percent are signed on to discretionary mandates, in which they delegate final investment decisions to the bank, to be executed based on their general preferences. 
Its remaining 50 percent of customers either operate largely independently, with the bank acting as executor of requested trades, or hold contracts predating the launch of Baer's new mandates model in 2015. 
The mandate structure, in which customers' rights and obligations are clearly set out, has also eased implementation of new investor protection rules under MiFID II, Rickenbacher said. 

""The contractual framework allows us to implement requirements under MiFID II in our advisory process and ensure we meet the obligations,"" he said.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","Kia recalls 507,000 vehicles in U.S. for air bags that may not deploy","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) said on Friday it is recalling more than 507,000 vehicles in the United States because an electronic glitch may prevent air bags from deploying in the event of a crash.
The recall follows an announcement in March by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that it was investigating why some air bags had failed to deploy in Kia vehicles and its affiliate  Hyundai Motor  Corp (KS:005380) after crashes in which four people were killed and another six injured involving the two automakers' vehicles.
In total, the two Korean automakers have now recalled nearly 1.1 million U.S. vehicles to address the issue. NHTSA said in March it was aware of six serious crashes in which air bags failed to deploy in frontal crashes, including four in 2011 model Hyundai Sonatas and two in 2012 and 2013 Kia Forte vehicles. The crash of the 2013 Forte occurred in Canada.
Kia's recall issued on Friday covers 2010-2013 Kia Fortes, 2011-2013 Kia Optimas and 2011-2012 Kia Optima Hybrid and Sedona vehicles. The company said the air bag control unit may short circuit because they may be susceptible to electrical overstress, preventing the frontal air bags and seat belt pretensioners, which pull the driver and front seat passenger firmly back into their seats, from deploying.
The company said it does not yet have a fix, but is working with its supplier on the issue.
Hyundai in February issued a recall for 154,000 U.S. Sonatas after non-deployment reports were linked to electrical overstress in the air bag control unit. In April, Hyundai recalled an additional 425,000 U.S. vehicles to address the same issue.
Hyundai said in March it was aware of reports of two deaths in its vehicles, which occurred in head-on collisions at extremely high rates of speed.
NHTSA said the air bag control module under investigation was built by ZF Friedrichshafen AG, a German auto supplier. The company said in March it was working with NHTSA.

The safety agency also said that electrical overstress appeared to be the root cause in a 2016 recall by  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) of 1.4 million U.S. vehicles for air bag non-deployments in significant frontal crashes.

(Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) has finalized a rescue deal for Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) CSeries jet and is expected to flex its marketing and cost-cutting muscle to revive the loss-making Canadian venture.
Bombardier agreed in October to sell Airbus a 50.01 percent stake in its flagship commercial jet for a symbolic Canadian dollar, after sluggish sales and low production rates prevented it from keeping a lid on costs. 
Airbus, by contrast, will be able to offer airlines deals by packaging the CSeries with its own jets in a challenge to Boeing (N:BA) and is expected to use its industrial power to slash the price of parts, along with improving efficiencies internally.
After winning regulatory approvals and agreeing the deal's fine-print in Montreal late on Thursday, the two companies said they were ready to start the new tie-up formally from July 1.
They confirmed outlines of a historic shift in the aircraft industry agreed in October, with Bombardier abandoning its standalone bid to enter the main jet market dominated by Airbus and Boeing, in exchange for a stake in a stronger project.
Bombardier will retain 31 percent and Investissement Quebec, run by the province of Quebec, will hold 19 percent.
Announcing federal government approval, Canadian Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said Airbus had committed to maintaining Mirabel outside Montreal as the primary CSeries industrial site, where more than 2,000 Quebec aerospace workers rely on the jet.
Airbus also plans to expand its Mobile, Alabama, assembly plant to include a new line capable of handling four CSeries a month for the U.S. market. It said work would begin next year.
The first priority will be to secure plans for production increases that include a doubling of deliveries this year. Aerospace supply chains are tight because of high jet demand.
""We will be very focused on having a robust ramp-up and a steep ramp-up in the future years,"" Philippe Balducchi, head of the new CSeries partnership, told reporters.
Bombardier will continue for the time being to fund the investments needed to support the production increase up to certain agreed financial levels, beyond which any cash shortfalls will be shared by the main partners.
""Looking forward, I'm very confident that CSeries is going to contribute positively to the cash generation of Airbus in the future,"" said Airbus Finance Director Harald Wilhelm.
BOMBARDIER UPDATES GUIDANCE
Closing the deal allows Bombardier to shed CSeries losses, while Airbus is betting that its ability to negotiate cuts in the cost of parts will help to put the program in the black.
Bombardier raised its guidance for 2018 consolidated earnings before interest and tax by $100 million to a range of between $900 million and $1 billion, to reflect the separation of the loss-making CSeries.
Bombardier also said it was cutting its revenue target by $500 million to $16.5-17 billion. The CSeries will no longer be consolidated in its results from July 1. 
The deal was first announced at a time when Bombardier was locked in a trade dispute with U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA). 
That dispute ended in March when Boeing said it would not appeal a ruling that overturned plans to impose hefty duties on the CSeries in the United States.
Boeing is now holding its own tie-up talks with Bombardier's Brazilian rival Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3).

The closing coincided with the opening of a G7 summit at which Europe and Canada are expected to take a common stand against the United States on trade, but company officials denied any link between current those tensions and the plane tie-up.

(Reuters) - American craft distiller Adam Spiegel is bracing for a double shot of pain.
An escalating international trade spat is driving up his equipment costs and threatens to cut into his profit from the bottles he exports to Europe, just as business is booming.
U.S. President Donald Trump on June 1 imposed tariffs for aluminum imports from Mexico, Canada and the European Union. As a result, Spiegel expects his bill for recently-ordered steel fermentation tanks, worth several hundred thousand dollars, to be $50,000 to $60,000 higher.
Spiegel will also get squeezed by the tariffs the EU announced in retaliation on U.S. goods, including whiskey, earlier this week. They could put his roughly 58 pounds ($77.83) per bottle of Sonoma Rye and West of Kentucky Bourbon out of reach for some European drinkers unless he swallows some of the cost.
With nearly a quarter of his sales coming in Europe, lowering his prices enough to offset the entire tariff would be too stiff a drink for Spiegel given total revenue only amounts to a few million dollars a year.
""We are not a big company who can absorb such frivolous fluctuations,"" he said, predicting: ""American whiskey will get more expensive.""
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2xXDFx8
To be sure, Spiegel's business Sonoma Distilling Co of California is a tiny fish in the world of spirits. But the multinationals that dominate the American whiskey industry - worth some $5 billion a year to suppliers and triple that at retail - are facing similar questions about an uncertain business climate with proposed tariffs from the EU, Canada, China and Turkey, and Mexico's own tax on U.S. whiskey imports that kicked in earlier this week.
In a letter Thursday to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross arguing these tariffs ""will seriously harm producers,"" the industry trade group Distilled Spirits Council noted that 46 percent of global U.S. spirits and 65 percent of global U.S. whiskey exports are either currently facing - or are at risk of facing - retaliatory tariffs.
It requested a meeting with Secretary Ross to discuss the matter further.
Brown-Forman (N:BFb), the Louisville-based home to market leader Jack Daniel's and higher-end Woodford Reserve, already started shipping more whiskey to its warehouses overseas ahead of the tariffs, CEO Paul Varga told analysts on Wednesday.
Brown-Forman, which also sells tequila and other drinks, generates about half its revenue domestically, a quarter in Europe and a quarter elsewhere.
Beam Suntory (BSI.UL), home to bourbons including Jim Beam, Maker's Mark and Knob Creek, is also ""making contingency plans to manage through all potential scenarios,"" spokeswoman Emily York said. ""We will continue to make our case on both sides of the Atlantic because no one wins in a trade war where consumers, distillery workers, farmers, bartenders and wait staff are among the innocent victims,"" she said.
Those two companies make about 62 percent of all American whiskey, according to researchers IWSR. Other big players include Heaven Hill,  Diageo  (L:DGE) and  Campari  (MI:CPRI).
Ninety-five percent of bourbon, a major American whiskey style, comes from Kentucky. The Southern state, which helped Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election, is also the home state of prominent Republican politicians Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Rand Paul. McConnell has publicly stated his opposition to tariffs.
Kentucky's largest city, Louisville, has benefited from what its mayor Greg Fischer has called ""bourbonism"", or the convergence of bourbon making and tourism.
Bourbon, which can only come from the United States and is often sweeter than Scotch, has been growing beyond its home state, due in large part to a resurgence of cocktail culture.
Exports grew 43 percent to $1 billion over the past decade, according to the Distilled Spirits Council. About 59 percent of exports went to the EU last year.
To meet rising demand and interest, many whiskey producers are expanding, with the help of last year's massive U.S. tax cut that lowered federal excise tax on distillers from $13.50 to $2.70 per gallon for the first 100,000 gallons - but only for two years.
HIGHER PRICES FOR CONSUMERS?
Once the tariffs come into effect, suppliers can choose to swallow the extra cost themselves or they can pass it on to customers. Protecting margins is always a priority, but in this case they risk losing hard-earned market share if drinkers pick cheaper brands.
Generally, if the price of a distilled spirit increases 10 percent, sales volume of that spirit falls by about 5 percent, according to Henry Saffer, a researcher with the National Bureau of Economic Research in New York.
Therefore, if bourbon prices rise in the EU, he says people would just ""buy cheaper versions of something very similar.""
With a recent boom in whiskey, there are more choices than ever - from classic places like Scotland and Ireland, as well as newcomers like Sweden and Australia.
Yet Euromonitor analyst Spiros Malandrakis predicted those alternatives will not see a boost until it becomes obvious that the tariffs are here to stay because suppliers will likely suck it up if the duties are short-lived.
Because the U.S. has shifted positions in the past, several whiskey executives Reuters spoke with displayed a ""wait-and-see"" attitude, hoping that the tension will die down and any tariffs would be temporary.
""It's very hard to predict what will transpire,"" said Mark Brown, chief executive of Sazerac Co, owner of Kentucky's Buffalo Trace distillery. ""There isn't going to be any certainty over whether it's going to be a one-week spat or a two-year spat.""
The tariff may be shared all along the supply chain, from producers to importers and distributors to retailers.
But producers such as Brown-Forman, whose Jack Daniel's sells for about 23 pounds ($30.86) per liter in British supermarkets, tend to have fat profit margins. Its operating margin was 32 percent last year, versus only 16.5 percent for  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and 12 percent for Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International. 
Joseph Magliocco, president of Michter's Distillery, sees the premium price of his bourbon as insulation. The cheapest version can be found in Britain for around 53 pounds ($67.10).
That puts him in prime position to weather the tariff storm, and keep his plans to expand with a new distillery set to open the public in downtown Louisville in September.
""In general if taxes go up, I would think the super-premium products will be affected less,"" Magliocco said. Even though Michter's is available in some 40 countries, international markets are only about 15 percent of sales.
($1 = 0.7452 pounds)

LONDON (Reuters) - The soccer World Cup is a massive money-spinner and stock market players are busy picking brewers, betting firms, pub chains and sportswear brands that will benefit from the associated global spending surge.
The world's biggest sporting event is unlikely to make or break companies but it gives them the chance to reach new customers and showcase new products, potentially locking in revenue streams beyond the end of the month-long tournament that kicks off next week in Russia.
This year's tournament will add $2.4 billion to the global advertising market, according to marketing agency Zenith. 
""For brands, the World Cup offers a unique opportunity to reach these consumers at scale, during shared public occasions they are emotionally involved in,"" said Jonathan Barnard, Zenith's director of global intelligence. 
The tournament is expected to have a broadcast audience of 3.5 billion across the globe.

Investment banks are busy sending clients their World Cup research identifying which shares could win big. The tone is often light and some tips to be taken with a pinch of salt as they piggyback the marketing bonanza.
Brokers also know that investors will themselves be busy watching the games, keeping trading volumes light. 
Studies, including from the European Central Bank have shown that trading volumes drop significantly during World Cup matches with the biggest plunges just after goals and other key moments in a game. 
Monthly volumes for Brazil's benchmark Bovespa equities index reached a two-year low during the last World Cup in June 2014 according to Reuters data. 
FROM BEERS TO BETTING
One certain bet is that beer will be drunk in large quantities to celebrate victories or drown sorrows.
Volumes of beer typically get a 2-3 percent boost in host countries during a World Cup year,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts found looking at the four previous hosts.
Carlsberg (CO:CARLa), the market leader in Russia and Budweiser maker ABInBev, a global sponsor, look to be among the winners from this tournament.
ABInBev has said it expects the World Cup to boost annual sales volumes in finalists Brazil and Argentina by 0.5 to 1 percentage point, thanks to matches driving beer drinking in the normally drier winter months.
""We think the best final to maximize the positive impact for ABInBev would be Brazil vs. Mexico,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.
A spike in consumption around the event likely helped Heineken and ABInBev shares - which are highly exposed to Latin America - outperform peers during 2014's World Cup in Brazil. 
In Britain, pub operators such as Greene King are also likely winners even though progress to the last eight would be seen as an achievement for a young England team.
Morgan Stanley found the pub chain's sales growth jumped by 3.5 percent during the Euro 2016 when the ""Three Lions"" suffered a disappointing loss against Iceland during the knock-out stage. 
The World Cup also usually fuels gambling, with UK-listed bookmakers such as GVC or Paddy Power Betfair seen as good bets, particularly if England do well. 
""A strong showing from England will keep interest and hopes high, and the further the national team progresses, the more punters are likely to bet with their hearts rather than their heads,"" Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves said.
IN IT TO WIN IT
The world's biggest sportswear brands are also vying for dominance on the field with  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) supplying shirts for 10 countries, including Brazil, France and England.
Chi Chan, who oversees investments in euro zone stocks for Hermes Investment Management, has chosen to invest in Nike's arch-rival Adidas (DE:ADSGN) as it spends big to try to retain its leading position in the game.
Nike kitted out more teams for the first time in Brazil in 2014, but Adidas has fought back, this year sponsoring 12 of the 32 participating teams including strong contenders such as Germany and Spain, along with hosts Russia. 
According to Chan, who takes into account the current odds, Adidas has a 52 percent chance of having a team it sponsors win.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog will press ahead with a new premium listing next month aimed at attracting companies like state-controlled Saudi Aramco to London, although the rules have been ""refined"" following investor criticism.
The Financial Conduct Authority's initial proposal last year led to suggestions the British government had influenced the watchdog to try to secure the Saudi energy company's planned initial public offering (IPO).
Saudi Arabia is expected to float up to 5 percent of Aramco in Riyadh and an international venue such as London or New York in what is expected to be the biggest ever IPO and would boost the reputation of its chosen listing venue.
Saudi Aramco had no immediate comment.
The City of London and TheCityUK which promote Britain as a business center, welcomed the new rule as long as strong corporate governance standards are maintained.
Britain is keen to promote London's leading position as a financial center as it leaves the European Union but some lawmakers had questioned if the original proposal for listings by sovereign-controlled firms could weaken investor protection.
The FCA said it was pressing ahead, despite criticism of its plans by major institutional investors when they were first circulated in July last year.
""The FCA thinks there is considerable benefit to investors if corporate issuers agree to meet these additional premium requirements,"" the watchdog said in a statement accompanying an 83-page document outlining the new rules on Friday.
The FCA said it had made some changes following feedback, including the requirement that the election of independent directors be subject to approval from independent shareholders.
There would also be a requirement for ""timely disclosures"" on transactions between the sovereign and the issuer.
But there will not be a requirement for a controlling shareholder agreement, and no need for an advance sponsor opinion or advance approval by independent shareholders of certain transactions with the sovereign or its associates.
""These rules mean when a sovereign controlled company lists here, investors can benefit from the protections offered by a premium listing,"" FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said.
POLARIZED RESPONSE
The watchdog said responses to its consultation were ""polarized"", with big investors mostly against, and all others generally supportive.
The Investment Association, which represents big shareholders, said it was disappointed by the lack of a requirement for independent votes on the changes made. It also wants a review of the new listing category after two years to check for any unintended consequences.
""We continue to oppose the inclusion of companies in this new segment in all major equity indices as this would force UK savers to invest in these companies despite the loss of valuable and hard won investor protections,"" the IA's chief executive Chris Cummings said in a statement.
Nick O'Donnell, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie, said that overall the FCA had stuck to its guns while central planks of corporate governance standards, such as being part of a FTSE index not being automatic, remain intact.
""Although the proposal has often been linked with the possible Saudi Aramco IPO, the reality is this is much wider than that. There are a lot of other companies that have been looking at this segment,"" O'Donnell said.
A premium listing in London would typically require a float of at least 25 percent of a company's shares, but the new category could allow a smaller float, the FCA said.

""Some very large companies can make a credible case for a liquid market at a free float of less than 25 percent,"" it said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Former senior Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and HSBC banker Matthew Westerman is launching a private investment firm alongside a former colleague and a Greek shipping tycoon, he said on Friday.
Westerman will partner his former Goldman Sachs colleague Julian Metherell and Peter Livanos, who owns Greek shipping company Ceres Hellenic, in a new firm called MW&L Capital Partners.
The trio will invest in small-to-medium sized targets based on knowledge built up in their respective careers covering financial services, oil and gas, and shipping, Westerman said.
""We think there is a gap in the market for long-term capital; ours is not '5 year fund money' so we don't have money burning a hole in our pockets and we can afford to be flexible and supportive of management when we see an opportunity,” Westerman told Reuters by phone.
The firm will look to partner with other investors where it makes sense, Westerman said.
Westerman left HSBC in November, just under two years after he was hired from Goldman Sachs with a mandate to shake up the lender's investment banking division and improve performance.
A rare external hire for such a senior role at HSBC, Westerman made sweeping changes after his arrival in February 2016, including cutting dozens of senior bankers and cracking down on staff who did not spend enough time meeting clients.
Metherell was the co-head of Goldman Sachs' British investment banking business when he resigned from the U.S. bank in 2011 to launch Vallares, an investment vehicle focused on the energy sector, with former  BP  (LON:BP) Plc Chief Executive Tony Hayward.
Sky News earlier on Friday reported the launch of the venture, citing an email sent by Westerman to contacts.

1230,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 07:04AM ET</span>",Germany urges European unity in face of trade tensions with U.S.,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier called on Friday for Europe to remain unified in the face of rising trade tensions with the United States, saying it was unclear how a summit of the Group of Seven rich nations would end.
""We have a serious situation, not just since last night or this morning, but rather the entire last few weeks,"" Altmaier told broadcaster ZDF. 
He underlined the importance of European unity on free trade and economic interests, especially since domestic debate was continuing in the United States about punitive sanctions imposed by President Donald Trump on G7 allies like Canada, Japan and the European Union.
Leaders of G7 nations meeting in Canada from Friday are more divided than at any time in the group's 42-year history, with Trump's ""America First"" policies at risk of causing a global trade war and deep diplomatic schisms.
Trump has already imposed hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and threatened to do the same for cars. His decisions to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and a global climate change accord have also fueled tensions.
Altmaier said the EU had long resisted imposing tariffs of its own but had shown it would do so if left with no other choice.
European leaders remained committed to continuing the dialogue with the United States if both sides were willing to make concessions, he said, although there was no sign of that at the moment.
A business leader also expressed concern. Joe Kaeser, chief executive of the engineering group Siemens, warned against deepening the transatlantic trade dispute. ""Escalation was never a good answer. That's why we must try to find areas of agreement,"" he said in Munich.
Germany's BDI industry association said U.S. protective measures could hit exports from Europe's largest economy and so reduce German growth by up to 0.25 percentage points, adding that if the situation escalated, a lot more would be at stake.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the United States remained Germany's closest partner outside Europe. However, there were significant differences that could not be ignored, and Europe needed new partnerships, he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
He took aim at Trump's actions on the Iran deal, trade and climate change, saying the president was willfully ignoring the negative consequences that his decisions would have on Europe and focusing solely on U.S. interests.
""None of that will make the world better, safer or more peaceful,"" he told the newspaper. ""We were used to relying on what had been agreed. That has fundamentally changed.""
Maas called for creation of a European security council, an idea backed by Chancellor Angela Merkel, and said ending the current requirement for unanimous decisions on foreign policy and security issues would make the EU more agile.

Maas also called for Europe to forge alliances with other regions, including countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 06:48AM ET</span>",China's ZTE apologizes after paying 'disastrous price' in U.S. sanction case,"By Sijia Jiang and Sue-Lin Wong
HONG KONG/SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - The chairman of ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) (HK:0763) apologized to staff and customers on Friday after the Chinese technology firm agreed to pay a $1 billion fine to the United States to end a supplier ban that has crippled its business.
The deal allows China's second-largest telecoms equipment firm to restart operations, reaffirm supplier relationships and rebuild trust with global clients, as it works to move on from an episode which it said threatened its very existence.
But industry experts estimate it would take at least a month for ZTE to ship phones again after the ban is lifted, while employees fear job cuts, wage reductions and a potential loss of customers, as the firm is set to reshuffle senior management.
The company agreed on Thursday to pay the fine and overhaul its leadership to lift the ban which has been in place since April.
The ban, which traces back to a breach of a U.S. embargo on trade with Iran, had prevented ZTE from buying the U.S. components it heavily relies on to make smartphones and other devices.
The case has become highly politicized and a key focus of whipsawing talks as Washington and Beijing look to avert a trade war.
In a memo sent to staff on Friday, ZTE Chairman Yin Yimin apologized to employees, clients, shareholders and business partners and said the firm would look to learn from its errors and hold those responsible accountable, a member of staff told Reuters.
""This issue reflects problems that exist with our firm's compliance culture and at management level,"" Yin wrote, according to the staffer, adding the incident was caused by the mistakes of a few ZTE leaders and employees.
""The activation of the denial order has caused huge losses for the company. The firm has paid a disastrous price.""
ZTE did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
""Paying the fine is no problem, the real difficulty lies ahead and getting future business, especially overseas. Market confidence is lost,"" another employee told Reuters.
The person added that staff feared there would be pay cuts and possible job losses. ""Bonuses are bound to be affected.""
Under the deal, ZTE will change its board and management within 30 days, pay a $1 billion fine and put an additional $400 million in escrow. The deal also includes a new 10-year ban that is suspended unless there are future violations.
A third member of staff said all ZTE employees were being called to have group meetings to ""deeply reflect"" on the case, including attending compliance training and writing up reports.
The management shake-up would also likely create instability - at least in the short-term.
""If so many bosses are gone at the same time, what would the succession process be like? There's going to be lots of internal power struggles to come,"" the third employee said.
The employees declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
US HANDSET SHARE THREATENED
ZTE pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to evade U.S. embargoes by buying U.S. components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran. The new sanction in April was because the firm breached terms of an agreement about disciplining executives responsible for the original violations.
Analysts said the fine - after a $1.2 billion settlement last year - would be a heavy burden, but not crippling for the company. ""ZTE can financially handle it,"" said brokerage Jefferies in a report late on Thursday.
The Shenzhen-listed firm had close to 30 billion yuan ($4.7 billion) of cash and short-term investment as at the end of March. Net profit last year was around $795 million.
""We do not believe ZTE will need to immediately raise any debt or equity financing to fund the cash penalty,"" said Jefferies.
At ZTE's headquarters in Shenzhen, most employees Reuters spoke to were reticent to comment on the U.S. deal.
One office worker, who only gave his surname Liu, said he was not worried about the firm making major staff cuts or failing. ""I'm not planning on looking for a new job.""
As a smartphone seller, ZTE was ranked the fourth-biggest in the United States in the first quarter of the year with an 11.4 percent market share, but has since seen sales of its handsets suspended. 
""It will be very difficult for ZTE to keep its position as the fourth-biggest smartphone vendor in the U.S. for 2018"" considering damage to the brand, said Shanghai-based analyst Mo Jia at technology researcher Canalys.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 06:37AM ET</span>",BT boss Patterson steps down after investors lose faith,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - BT Group's (L:BT) Chief Executive Gavin Patterson will step down this year after its chairman said a new leader was needed to restructure Britain's biggest broadband and mobile provider.
Patterson, who has run BT for almost five years, announced 13,000 job cuts last month in an attempt to get to grips with a host of problems including intense competition, an underperforming IT services unit, a huge pension deficit and criticism of its broadband plans.
But a failure to hit a revenue target and a forecast for no growth in profit for the next couple of years sent its shares to six-year lows, putting his position in jeopardy.
Jan du Plessis, former chairman of mining group  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO) who took the same role at BT last November, said the board supported Patterson's strategy but it did not have confidence in his ability to see it through.
""The broader reaction to our recent results announcement has ... demonstrated to Gavin and me that there is a need for a change of leadership to deliver this strategy,"" he said.
A search for Patterson's successor has started, the company said, and it expects to have his replacement in place during the second half of the year. 
BT shares, which have lost nearly 40 percent of their value since Patterson took over, rose more than 2 percent in early trading, before giving up some of the gains by 1030 GMT.
Analysts at Bernstein said it was no secret that Patterson was under immense pressure, but added that the timing of the announcement was ""highly puzzling and worrying"".
""While the markets are likely to receive the news positively (...) it does beg the question as to why the transition was announced after the company launched a fundamental transformation program flanked by a reorganization of the management structure with new appointees,"" they said.
Chief Financial Officer Simon Lowth was a potential successor, they said, but an external candidate was more likely.
Consumer boss Marc Allera would be another possible replacement, having set out plans last month to improve the BT brand. 
REPUTATION TARNISHED
Patterson won plaudits when he took BT into TV sports, going had-to-head with rival Sky (L:SKYB) in Premier League soccer rights, and back into mobile by buying market leader EE, sending shares to a 14-year high in 2015. 
He was ""immensely proud"" of what had been achieved at the former telecoms monopoly, in sports broadcasting, mobile and a hard-won agreement with the regulator to keep hold of its networks business Openreach.
But the victories were eclipsed by problems, led by a fraud had left a 530-million pound black hole in its Italian business. 
The scandal, which came at the same time as a sharp slowdown in demand from public sector and corporate customers, forced the 50-year-old executive to cut profit targets in 2017.
Patterson received a total of 2.3 million pounds ($3.1 million) in the year to the end of March, according to the company's annual report -- basic pay of 997,000 pounds plus a 1.292 million pound bonus. He had missed out on a bonus in the previous year after a number of setbacks.
Patterson was also embroiled in fractious talks with Britain's telecoms regulator Ofcom about the fate of Openreach, which runs the national broadband network.
He managed to avoid a full break-up of the group by agreeing to legally separate Openreach, but he admitted he had been taken aback by the flak BT had received about its customer service and its networks during the bitter two-year battle.
The bad news continued when Ofcom fined BT a record 42 million pounds for service failures.
Under increasing pressure, Patterson announced a radical plan to cut job and save 1.5 billion pounds a year by 2020/21 last month. 
But the subsequent decline in the share price showed investors were not on side.
Analysts at UBS said the fact that the board supported the strategy suggested no significant strategic changes.

But they said the incoming CEO would have to address the pace of rolling out full fiber networks, the BT Sport strategy, the future of its Global Services IT unit and how much of the 1.5 billion pounds of savings should be re-invested in the business.

1236,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>","Mitsubishi Materials finds fresh cases of misconduct, loses certification","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Mitsubishi Materials Corp (T:5711) said on Friday it has found fresh cases of misconduct at its Naoshima copper smelter and refinery in western Japan and the plant's Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) certification has been revoked. 
The finding follows its announcement in May that it had found new cases of improper actions at a small number of its group firms, on top of the five units that had already confirmed falsification of data. The new cases have widened the number of affected customers from 762. 
It is the latest blow to the diversified materials manufacturer, which first admitted late last year that its subsidiaries falsified data about products, including parts for aircraft and automobiles, one more in a series of quality assurance scandals to rock Japanese manufacturers. 
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry separately said the Quality Assurance Organization revoked the JIS certification for the Naoshima plant's copper slag products - used in concrete construction materials - because it had shipped products with a JIS label when they did not meet the criteria or did not conduct required tests. 
A total of five customers have received those slag products and Mitsubishi Materials is making safety checks with these customers, a company spokesman said.

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Foreign investors sell Asian equities for fourth straight month,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Asian equities saw sustained foreign selling in May for the fourth straight month as a firmer dollar and political tensions in Italy kept overseas investors away from regional assets.
Foreigners sold about $4 billion worth of Asian stocks last month to take this year's tally to over $15 billion, data from seven stock exchanges showed. That compares with about $20 billion of inflows in the entire year of 2017.
""The outflows are happening because opportunities are opening up elsewhere, especially in the U.S.,"" said Greg McKenna, Chief Market Strategist at AxiTrader.
Federal Reserve tightening, rising bond yields, and a strengthening dollar have ""all combined to put pressure on EM nations,"" McKenna said.

Political uncertainty in Italy added to the woes of regional markets, already hit by a surge in the dollar and concerns about U.S. protectionist trade policies.
At the end of last week, Italy's anti-establishment parties formed a coalition government, helping to avert potentially destabilizing snap elections that could have turned into a referendum on the country's membership of the European Union.
Thailand saw $1.6 billion of foreign outflows in the last month - the biggest in the region - followed by India and Taiwan. 
CGS-CIMB analysts believe there would be limited further foreign selling pressure as their aggregate holding in Thai equities is now only 30.1 percent, one of the lowest rates in a decade. 
Investors turned cautious on Indian markets after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell short of the required number of seats to form a government in the southern state of Karnataka. 
India faces national elections in 2019 and the Karnataka election was seen as a litmus test for Modi's party. 
Overall, analysts said monetary tightening by major central banks will continue to weigh on Asian markets in coming months. 
The U.S. central bank is expected to raise its policy rate for the second time this year next week, while expectations have increased that Europe's massive monetary stimulus was nearing an end. 
On Wednesday, the European Central Bank's chief economist said the central bank will debate whether to end bond purchases later this year, a hawkish message which hit emerging markets.
The Fed looks set to continue to tighten its balance sheet by cutting back on bond purchases in the year ahead, said AxiTrader's McKenna. 

""The pressure looks set to remain on EM currencies while the confluence of a strong U.S. economy drives the Fed Funds rate and the U.S. dollar higher.""

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 05:09AM ET</span>",Volkswagen labour boss says will block sale of specialist assets,"By Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz
WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) powerful works council will continue to block the potential sale of specialist industrial assets and instead seek to work with the carmaker's new chief executive to develop them, its labour leader told Reuters.
Under former CEO Matthias Mueller, attempts to slim down Europe's largest automotive group - which also includes the MAN (DE:MANG) Diesel & Turbo engineering business and transmissions maker Renk - foundered amid opposition from labour leaders and the controlling Porsche and Piech families. 
But Volkswagen's new boss Herbert Diess said last month that spinning off Diesel & Turbo, Renk or motorcycle brand Ducati was a possibility as the group's top management reviews options for ""non-core"" assets.
""When taking over MAN, (former chairman) Ferdinand Piech and I promised the workforce of Renk and Diesel & Turbo that we will not sell these divisions. The executive board also gave its word,"" works council chief Bernd Osterloh said in an interview.
Diess has pledged to speed up Volkswagen's drive to become more efficient in the wake of its 2015 diesel emissions scandal, as it seeks to fund a costly shift to electric and self-driving cars. Plans include preparing the group's trucks division for a separate listing. 
""We will discuss how we can further develop the engineering operations,"" Osterloh said. ""The business must not stand still. We also agree with Dr. Diess on this.""
The works council controls half of the 20-seats on Volkswagen's supervisory board, which decides on investment, plant closures and executive appointments, and can usually also count on the support of representatives from the group's home region of Lower Saxony. 
Separately, Osterloh said the group's core VW brand was making good progress with cost cuts agreed in its ""future pact"" between management and labour, with 93 percent of planned full-year savings already identified.
""The numbers show that we will achieve the planned efficiency gains from the future pact of slightly more than 2 billion euros for this year,"" said Osterloh, who sits on Volkswagen's supervisory board. 
Designed mainly to make cuts to high-cost operations in Germany, the future pact aims to make 3.7 billion euros in annual savings by 2020 and up to 23,000 job cuts without forced layoffs by 2025.
The plan helped boost profitability at the VW brand last year, though margins continue to lag rivals including  Renault  (PA:RENA), PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203).
Osterloh expects Diess, a proven cost-cutter, to increase synergies between the group's main car brands VW, Seat and Skoda. At VW, synergies should get a particular boost in 2019/2020 when the first electric models roll off a new MEB modular platform and the redesigned top-selling Golf hits dealerships, he said. 
Osterloh also said further steps would be needed to boost output at Skoda to help it keep up with booming demand, even though some production is being shifted to Germany to relieve its stretched Czech factories.
Asked whether a decision in April to move some production of sport-utility vehicles to a VW plant in Osnabrueck had solved the bottlenecks at Skoda, Osterloh said: ""For the moment, yes, but certainly not in a lasting way.""

""We will check overall utilisation across the group. Then we will look at the regions where demand is coming from and will take a decision,"" he said, pointing to the group's budget round in November.

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2018 04:55AM ET</span>",Malaysia seeks to arrest financier Jho Low over 1MDB scandal,"By Joseph Sipalan and Rozanna Latiff
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is seeking to arrest financier Low Taek Jho, believed to be residing abroad, over his involvement in a graft scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Friday.
Low, popularly known as Jho Low, was regarded as close to former premier Najib Razak and his family, and is seen as a central figure in the 1MDB scandal, which is the subject of multi-billion-dollar money laundering investigations underway in Malaysia and around the world.
""We are trying to arrest Jho Low, but he is not in the country, and we don't have extradition rights in the country where he is staying,"" Mahathir told reporters.
He did not say which country Low was in.
The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) had issued an arrest warrant for Low, as well as Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, a director of former 1MDB unit SRC International, a source familiar with the matter had earlier told Reuters.
The MACC was also seeking assistance from authorities in countries where Low was believed to be staying, the source said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Singapore authorities said on Friday they had issued arrest warrants in 2016 for Low and his associate, Tan Kim Loong, and requested an Interpol notice.
""Following investigations, the Singapore authorities issued warrants of arrest in April/May 2016 and at Singapore's request, INTERPOL published Red Notices in October 2016, for Low Taek Jho and Tan Kim Loong, who are suspected to have committed offences in Singapore and cannot be located here,"" Singapore's Attorney-General's Chambers, Singapore Police Force and the Monetary Authority of Singapore said in a joint statement on Friday.
This is the first time Singapore authorities have said publicly that an arrest warrant was issued against Low.
Low and 1MDB have denied any wrongdoing. Tan Kim Loong could not be reached for comment.
Low advised on investments and negotiated deals for 1MDB, though he never held any official role in the fund.
The source said Malaysia is also preparing warrants for Roger Ng, a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) banker, and 1MDB's ex-chief Shahrol Halmi.
1MDB was founded by Najib in 2009 and is the subject of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. 
The U.S. Department of Justice has alleged that more than $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, and about $700 million of that went to Najib's personal bank accounts.
Najib has denied any wrongdoing.
On Thursday, MACC issued a notice for Low and Nik Faisal to contact the commission immediately to help in its investigation. Low, through his lawyers, said he would cooperate.
Empowered by a new government elected last month, the agency has relaunched a probe into why $10.6 million from SRC was transferred into Najib's bank account. 
Anti-graft agents have questioned both Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, following his shock election defeat last month to former mentor-turned-foe Mahathir.
Goldman Sachs had helped 1MDB raise $6.5 billion in three bond sales in 2012 and 2013 to invest in energy projects and real estate to boost the Malaysian economy.

Instead, more than $2.5 billion raised from those bonds was misappropriated and used to buy artwork, luxury properties in New York and London, and to pay off gambling debts in Las Vegas, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Jake Rowinski, a 20-year-old University of Toronto student, buys marijuana every week from one of the many self-described ""medical"" dispensaries in downtown Toronto.
The illegal store sells openly to customers ranging from budget-minded recreational users like Rowinski to silver-haired grandmothers treating legitimate ailments.
""Nobody really cares at this point,"" Rowinski said outside the shop, near the city's financial district.
As Canada's Liberal government prepares to legalize recreational marijuana use this summer, the biggest remaining obstacle to regulated sales will be competition from a thriving black market, according to cannabis investors, researchers, policy analysts and government data.
Many buyers of illegal pot will have little incentive to switch to legal weed, which is expected to be more expensive and less available because of strict regulations on sales, according to hedge fund GTV Capital, which invests almost exclusively in Canadian cannabis stocks, and the Marijuana Policy Group, a U.S. research firm.
As the first major economy to fully legalize cannabis, Canada's regulatory rollout will be closely watched by other nations considering the same path - and by global investors, who have already poured billions into Canadian marijuana firms.
Canada legalized medical marijuana in 2001 but still restricts it to mail-order purchases from licensed providers. That has spurred the proliferation of unsanctioned retailers like the one where Rowinski shops, which recently changed its name to Trees Station Medical Dispensary. 
Employees at the store declined to comment.
Such illicit retailers may soon compete with new legal outlets, and many provinces plan initially to limit the number of government-operated or -licensed stores. Medical marijuana, meanwhile, will remain legal only by mail, despite a push by major pharmacy chains to sell it.
The cautious approach could restrain legal investment in a market estimated by Statistics Canada at C$5.7 billion in 2017. About a fifth of Canadians between 15 and 64 years old used marijuana, spending an average of C$1,200 per person at C$7.48 per gram, the agency found. Ninety percent of that money was spent illegally.
GTV Capital estimates an average pre-tax price of C$8.33 upon legalization, already higher than the average illegal price because of testing, packaging and security regulations. That doesn't include a planned excise tax of $1 per gram or 10 percent, whichever is higher, or sales taxes of 5 to 15 percent.
If the price difference allows the black market to compete, that will hamper the public benefits of legalization - legitimate investment, job creation and tax revenue - and complicate efforts to stamp out crime associated with illegal drug trafficking. Statistics Canada, working with police data in a 2014 study, found organized crime involvement in about a third of marijuana production and trafficking.
""Canada's been brave enough to take the step to make cannabis fully legal, but they've also taken the stance that they don't want to promote it,"" said Steve Ottaway, managing director for investment banking at GMP Securities. ""I can appreciate their intent, but at the same time, this is an adult-use market.""
Mark Ware - a McGill University family medicine professor who served as vice-chair of the federal task force advising on the legalization - said the measured approach aims to curb underage use and install government-controlled supply networks, safety checks and legal processes before further expansion.
""I don't think anybody can be under any illusion that it will happen right away,"" said Ware, who will become chief medical officer of cannabis producer Canopy Growth Crop (TO:WEED) on July 1.
LIMITS ON RETAILING
Most investors and analysts predict legal sellers will be able to compete on price in the next few years as regulations loosen and legal supply networks grow. At least for now, provinces plan fewer stores than needed to meet demand.
Ontario, Canada's most populous province, plans 40 government-run stores at first, rising to 150 by the end of 2020; Quebec, the second largest, will start with 20 stores and decide the pace of expansion later.
That compares to about 1,000 retailers in the U.S. state of Colorado, which legalized recreational marijuana use in 2012 and has seen prices drop from more than $12 a gram to less than $7 with the expansion of retailers, according to research firm BDS Analytics. Today, about 70 percent of Colorado marijuana users buy legally, a state spokesperson said.
In response to questions about their policies, Quebec and Ontario spokespeople pointed to previous statements. Ontario officials have said they looked to their experience with alcohol and tobacco retailers to guide marijuana policy; a Quebec official has said the province will consider as many as 300 retailers in the long-term.
(For details on marijuana regulation in Canadian provinces, see: [L3N1SG6U4])
Patchy availability and higher pricing are likely to reduce provincial tax revenues in the early years of legalization, Moody's Investors Service said in a recent report. It predicted British Columbia, with the most liberal retailing regulations, will collect far more tax revenue, about $50 million, than provinces with tighter rules. The federal government will get 25 percent of the excise tax revenue, with the rest going to the province where any given sale occurs.
'A LOT LIKE PIZZA'
Canada's national legalization of recreational use has little precedent; it will be only the second country after Uruguay to do so. 
But it's clear from smaller-scale legalizations that heavy users drive pot-market economics - an obstacle in converting illegal sales to legal ones.
""Heavy users use more than everyone else combined,"" said Damitha Pathmalal, portfolio manager at GTV. Many will ""stick to the illicit market, given the price difference.""
Daily users are only 14 percent of the total but buy about two-thirds of all pot sold, according to GTV Capital and a 2016 report from the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer.
(For a graphic on Canadian marijuana consumption, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JvANMH ) 
Recreational consumers who don't live near a legal store will be able to buy online. But many customers will turn to local outlets - legal or illegal - rather than wait for mail-order, said Miles Light, co-founder at the Marijuana Policy Group in Denver, Colorado.
""These are comfort goods; they're a lot like pizza,"" he said. ""The model works, but it's got to be pretty local.""
ENFORCEMENT DILEMMAS
Jeremy Jacob, president of the Canadian Association of Medical Cannabis Dispensaries, said availability issues could be solved by giving illicit retailers a path to legal status.
But most provinces want to ""eradicate the existing industry,"" Jacob said.
British Columbia is the exception. It plans to allow some existing dispensaries to apply for licenses, as Jacob plans to do for his Village Bloomery in Vancouver. 
The province also plans to step up raids on shops who continue to sell illegally.
The goal is ""to put a significant dent in the black market,"" said Mike Farnworth, the province's solicitor general and minister for public safety.
Ontario will set aside C$40 million for enforcement after legalization, including policing impaired driving. 
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police plans to add analysts to monitor organized crime in the cannabis industry after legalization and determine what enforcement resources are needed, said the RCMP's Yves Goupil, a director of federal policing.
""If the black market can still operate profitably, there will need to be significant justice resources devoted to enforcement,"" said Rosalie Wyonch, a policy analyst at the C.D. Howe Institute, a nonprofit economic policy think tank.
Canada has no plans to allow storefront access for medical marijuana despite a pharmacy-industry push to dispense it.
Pharmacies including Shoppers Drug Mart - Canada's biggest chain, owned by Loblaw Companies (TO:L) - and PharmaChoice, the country's second-biggest independent pharmacy group, have signed supply agreements with marijuana producers in case rules change. 
A survey by the Canadian health regulator Health Canada last year found that only 29 percent of those reporting medical cannabis use had a medical document from a health professional, a requirement for buying from licensed producers. 
The rest bought illegally.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's automakers association (JAMA) on Friday criticized moves by the United States to explore raising tariffs on Japanese auto exports, just as the two countries plan trade talks in July that may increase pressure on Tokyo to open up its markets.
Washington last month launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports which could lead to new tariffs on one of Japan's major export products to the United States. 
New tariffs on auto imports could raise costs for Japanese automakers doing business in the United States, the world's No. 2 auto market. The probe follows a U.S. decision to slap new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Japan and other countries earlier this year. 
""The investigation launched by the United States Department of Commerce to determine the effects on national security of imports of automobiles ... will create uncertainty among automobile users in the U.S. and people involved in the motor vehicle industry,"" Akio Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and president of Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said in a statement.
He said that if restrictions were implemented, they would raise vehicle prices and reduce available options, penalizing consumers. They could also seriously disrupt the plans of automakers, components makers and dealers, ""with potentially adverse impacts on the U.S. economy and jobs"".
As trade tensions between the two countries heat up, U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday agreed to make preparations to hold trade meetings in July which will be based around a new framework focusing on bilateral trade, Japan's foreign ministry said.
The talks will be led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japan Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.
The United States is a major market for Japan's automakers, which produced 3.8 million vehicles at their U.S. plants in 2017, roughly one-third of the 12 million total units produced in the country each year.
An additional 1.7 million vehicles were exported from Japan last year.
Most of Japan's major automakers operate plants in the United States and top producers Toyota, Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Honda Motor Co. (T:7267) locally produce between roughly half and 70 percent of all vehicles sold in the country.
But they also operate plants in Mexico and Canada, exporting a portion of the output from those plants, along with some vehicles made in other countries, to the United States. 
Analysts say a new trade framework could put Japan under direct U.S. pressure to enter talks for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA).
Japan is wary of entering such talks as they would put it under pressure to open up politically-sensitive markets like agriculture, while policymakers fear that Trump's threat to impose tariffs on Japanese cars, could be more damaging to the economy than metal tariffs.
In a sign of Japan's irritation, Finance Minister Taro Aso used unusually harsh language to criticize Trump's trade policy at a Group of Seven finance leaders' gathering last week.

""It's deeply deplorable,"" Aso told reporters. ""Inward-looking policies involving one-sided, protectionist measures benefit no country,"" he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares stepped back from a 2-1/2 month high on Friday as risk appetite soured on bets that Europe's massive monetary stimulus was nearing an end, compounded by uncertainty over trade relations ahead of a key meeting of global leaders.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 0.5 percent after six straight sessions of gains took it to the highest since mid-March.
Chinese shares slipped, with the blue-chip Shangai-Shenzhen index (CSI300) down 0.6 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) declined 0.7 percent while South Korea's KOSPI was off 0.4 percent.

""Markets are having to rediscover how to price risk amid reduced central bank buying and that adjustment could prove very hard,"" said Matt King, Citi's global head of credit strategy. 
Another major reason for the nerves was the widening rift between the United States and its major trade partners after President Donald Trump imposed import tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last week.
Trump seemed in no mood to reconcile when he tweeted, just one day before a Group of Seven summit, that France and Canada imposed ""massive tariffs"" on their imports from the United States and had non-monetary barriers to trade.
The summit takes place on Friday and Saturday in Charlevoix, Quebec.
""Uncertainly ahead of the weekend's G7 meeting led to a downturn in risk appetite throughout the U.S. session,"" said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Racketing Securities Australia.
""Risk trades were lower across the board in the currency markets as the yen and Swiss francs appreciated against the greenback and on the crosses. We saw more volatility in the emerging markets.""
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended lower on Wednesday while Treasuries (US10YT=RR) gained.
In emerging market currencies, the South African rand , Brazil's real  and the Mexican peso were the worst hit overnight. 
CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES
Risk appetite also waned after U.S. jobless claims pointed to a further tightening in labor market conditions, cementing expectations the Federal Reserve will raise benchmark U.S. rates next week and twice again later in the year.
Investors also looked to a historic U.S.-Korea summit in Singapore on June 12 where the main issue is whether North Korea will abandon its nuclear weapons program.
The U.S. dollar (DXY) inched up a bit from near three-week lows against a basket of currencies, helped by the strong jobless numbers. 
The euro (EUR=EBC) paused at $1.1804 after four straight session of gains took it to the highest level since mid-May.

1258,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>","Second jobs, once rare in Japan, are reshaping attitudes about work","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Kazuhiro Hasegawa has been driving a taxi in Tokyo for three years. It's a job he enjoys, despite 18-hour shifts.
But recently, he said, it has not been enough to make ends meet.
The 4.5 million-4.8 million yen ($41,110-$43,850) a year he makes from his primary job is far short of what he needs to cover a mortgage and university for his son, Hasegawa said. 
""I have no choice but to work two jobs, as income is unstable,"" said Hasegawa, 51, who earns several thousand yen a month from a side job shooting and editing videos for businesses. ""There's no rest. I try to avoid being short of sleep as that would cause trouble driving a taxi."" 
Japanese workers like Hasegawa are signing up for second jobs in record numbers to earn extra cash as wages stagnate, stirring hopes of a rise in consumer spending but adding to fears of overwork in a society notorious for long hours.
Facing a labor crunch, many companies welcome the influx of part-time workers. And the government has loosened rules that banned or discouraged employees from taking second jobs.
The result is that a record 7.44 million Japanese will work at least two jobs this year - or about 11 percent of the workforce - up from 5.33 million in 2015, according to Lancers Inc, which helps freelancers find jobs.
That lags behind countries like the U.S., which have been embracing the ""gig economy"" for longer. About 20 percent of the U.S. workforce had second jobs in 2017, data show.
The shift in Japan aligns with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's goal of creating a workforce that can adapt to economic changes and offer more individual freedom, which he says will promote growth.
Indeed, people working two jobs will contribute an estimated 7.8 trillion yen to the economy, Lancers data showed.
But there is a dark side.
Japanese workers need to put in roughly 11 percent more hours than they did in 1997 to make the same salary. In the meantime, Tokyo's annual cost of living for an average household is about $3,300 a month, government data shows, a 6 percent decrease from 1997.
Working two or three jobs to make ends meet undercuts the government's ""work-style reform"" efforts, including proposed caps on overtime in response to cases of ""karoshi,"" literally death by overwork.
""It could raise the risk that one person ends up working over 100 hours (of overtime) by assuming 50-hour jobs at two firms,"" said Kotaro Kurashige, an attorney of Anzai Law Office, who represents management in labor disputes.
""What the government is trying to do is full of inconsistencies,"" he said. ""Making up for cuts in overtime pay by assuming side jobs elsewhere is like putting the cart before the horse.""
LIFETIME EMPLOYMENT
The emerging trend highlights the decline of Japan's lifetime employment system, in which workers in the decades after World War Two were guaranteed job security in exchange for devotion to their employers.
Such positions are much rarer these days. A large number of workers taking second jobs would traditionally be nearing retirement age; nearly half of Japanese workers with two jobs are older than 50, according to Lancers.
""There's no such thing as lifetime employment anymore,"" said Masaki Shimizu, 32, who on top of his regular job at internet start-up En Factory Inc, runs a coffee shop where patrons can pet live hedgehogs and has two other side jobs.
""I need these side jobs to master new skills and expand my own strengths,"" Shimizu said.
Natsuko Anastasia Ariyama, 25, said she earned about 200,000 yen a month from her full-time job as a university staffer and an additional 20,000 yen from a side job as a writer and translator. She does not get overtime pay, nor has she gotten a raise.
""I have started doing a second job last year to earn spending money,"" she said, adding that the extra work gives her a sense of security as well.
ATTRACTING TALENT
Japanese companies have traditionally demanded that their workers be fully committed to their employers.
But more are softening their views on the subject, including Rohto Pharmaceutical Co, SoftBank Group Corp, photocopier maker Konica Minolta Inc and Shinsei Bank Ltd.
Diaper maker Unicharm Corp in April started letting its 1,500 full-time employees hold second jobs. The decision was made partly to lure workers amid a labor shortage and to encourage current employees to acquire new knowledge and skills.
""We judged that benefits from side jobs outweigh potential risks such as overwork, leakage of information and brain drain,"" said Yukinari Watanabe, a senior human resources manager of Unicharm.
So far only one employee, a man in his 50s, has responded, asking to become a basketball coach for middle and high school students.
""We need to be a company that will attract capable workers,"" Watanabe said. ""We also feel that workers need to acquire skills that can be used anywhere as you never know what may happen in this era of uncertainty.""
NEW RULES 
After Abe called for more labor mobility, the government has tried to clear the way for companies to allow side jobs.
In January, the labor ministry removed a rule banning second jobs without an employer's permission. Now workers must only inform their employer before taking on another job.
But recent cases of people working themselves to death have also led Abe's government to propose labor reforms such as a cap on overtime of 100 hours per month.
Many workers count on overtime pay, however, and caps would reduce that income, said Hisashi Yamada, research director at Japan Research Institute.
So as long as people can skirt that by taking additional jobs, the trend of working for more than one company will probably continue, Yamada said.
But if it spreads workers too thin, it could erode Japanese employment culture, Yamada said. 

""Many Japanese firms still want employees to focus on their main job, so Japan won't turn into a country like America right away, where gig economy jobs are widely available,"" he said.

Merv Gray, plant chairman for Unifor local 112, told Reuters by telephone that the 1,600 workers are looking for greater job security on the company's strong-selling Global 7500 business jet, among other demands.
The long-range jet, which is to enter service this year, is a critical part of the Canadian plane-and-train-maker's strategy to grow business aircraft revenues to $8.5 billion in 2020, up from $5 billion in 2017.
While Gray stressed the union is pushing for a three-year contract to replace the agreement that expires on June 23, failure to reach a deal could lead to a strike that day depending ""on how close we are."" 
Mark Masluch, a spokesman for Bombardier business aircraft said by email that ""discussions are progressing well and we plan to work within the deadline.""
While Masluch said Bombardier wouldn't ""comment on the specifics of our ongoing, active discussions with Unifor, I want to emphasize we see a bright future for our products in Toronto.""
Union workers at Bombardier's Downsview plant in Toronto assemble the Global 7500, the Global 5000 and the Q400 turboprops.
The union talks follow Bombardier's May announcement that it had agreed to sell the sprawling Downsview site, the company's largest land asset, to a Canadian pension fund for approximately $635 million. 

While Bombardier will continue to operate from Downsview for a period of up to three years, with two optional one-year extension periods, the sale has made job security a priority for workers at the factory, Unifor said in a May 31 statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. senator said on Thursday that he has asked Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) for information about any data sharing agreements they have with Chinese vendors, after  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) this week disclosed such partnerships with several Chinese companies. 
Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he had written to the companies on Thursday and made the letters public. 
Facebook said on Tuesday that it had data sharing partnerships with at least four Chinese companies including mobile device manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], the world's third largest smartphone maker, which has come under scrutiny from U.S. intelligence agencies.
Alphabet had previously announced strategic partnerships with Huawei and mobile device maker Xiaomi, as well as with Chinese technology platform Tencent.
Warner said in a statement that since 2012 ""the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and equipment makers like Huawei and ZTE Corp (HK:0763) has been an area of national security concern."" ZTE is China's No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker.
Warner asked Alphabet Chief Executive Larry Page if it had ""third party partnerships"" with ZTE, Lenovo or TCL and if it conducted audits to ensure that the companies were properly handling consumer data. He asked Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey if the company had relationships with Huawei as well. Huawei is the world's third-largest smartphone maker.
Google said in an emailed statement on Thursday, ""We have agreements with dozens of (manufacturers) around the world, including Huawei. We do not provide special access to Google user data as part of these agreements, and our agreements include privacy and security protections for user data."" 
Twitter declined to comment.The New York Times reported on Sunday that Facebook data of users' friends could have been accessed without their explicit consent. Facebook denied that and said data access was to allow its users to access account features on mobile devices.
The revelation drew a firestorm of criticism from members of Congress, including some who said Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg should have disclosed that information in testimony to Congress in April.

Facebook said that Huawei, computer maker Lenovo Group and smartphone makers OPPO and TCL Corp were among about 60 companies worldwide that received access to some user data after they signed contracts.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",U.S. pork exports the lead farm risk in trade disputes: official,"By Tom Polansek
DES MOINES (Reuters) - More than 14 percent of $140 billion in annual U.S. farm exports have been or will likely be hit by retaliatory tariffs in trade disputes with major buyers such as China and Mexico, a top U.S. trade negotiator said on Thursday.
Mexico imposed tariffs on American products including pork and bourbon on Tuesday, striking back against import duties on steel and aluminum imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Republican-led farm states where rural voters helped propel Trump into office in 2016, such as Iowa and Kansas, stand to suffer from the retaliatory tariffs.
Mexico's response raised trade tensions and further complicated efforts to renegotiate the trillion-dollar North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico. 
Mexico is the largest export market for U.S. pork, which is likely being targeted for retaliatory tariffs more than any other commodity, said Gregg Doud, chief agricultural negotiator for the United States Trade Representative.
China has also imposed tariffs on U.S. pork and other products. It was the second-largest destination for U.S. pork by volume last year.
""Let's be frank, the lead tip of the spear in all of this right now is your pork,"" Doud told hog farmers at an agricultural event in Iowa. 
Trump has threatened tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese exports as part of a separate dispute over Chinese intellectual property protections.
Separately, he withdrew last year from the Trans-Pacific Partnership promoted by Japan, the top destination for U.S. beef. The move is expected to help Europe become more competitive for meat sales.
""I am very concerned about the situation with Japan,"" Doud said.
To increase trade, the United States hopes to hold trade talks with the UK after Brexit, he said. An April agreement that allowed U.S. pork exporters to ship meat to Argentina for the first time in 26 years a win, he said.
""These things now that we have to fix are very, very difficult,"" Doud said. ""This is going to get a little more difficult here in the short term.""
Ty Rosburg, who transports hogs in Iowa and heard Doud speak, said he worried that trade disputes could hurt the farmers who are his customers by lowering pork prices. Still, he said he believed U.S. officials were attempting to improve trade.

""I guess at some point you have to trust they're working for the greater good and hope that we don't get bit too bad,"" he said.

An estimated $759 million worth of spirits exports are the target of tariffs from the country's trading partners, which, if imposed, would severely harm producers, farmers and industries associated with the spirits business, the U.S. Distilled Spirits Council said in a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
The trade group estimated that 65 percent of global U.S. whiskey would take a hit if the European Union, Canada, Turkey and/or China retaliated.
""The imposition of tariffs on these products by our major trading partners threatens to seriously impede the export progress that has benefited our sector and created jobs across the country,"" Clarkson Hine, interim president and chief executive officer of Distilled Spirits Council said in a letter.
The United States has placed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from countries including the EU, Canada, Mexico and China.
In response, Mexico on Tuesday imposed tariffs on American products ranging from steel to pork and bourbon.

The trade body represents companies such as  Diageo  PLC (L:DGe),  Pernod Ricard  SA (PA:PERP) and Brown-Forman Corp (N:BFb).

1272,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 04:04PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. G7 Summit in Focus 
A week after the United States' tariff on steel and aluminium imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union went into effect, trade tensions could escalate at the G7 summit, which gets underway on Friday. 
Ahead of the summit, President Trump has not softened his tone, vowing to ""fight"" for the United States, as the country has the ""worst trade deals ever."" 
Trump is expected to receive a tough reception from other G7 members as French President Emmanuel Macron urged other members to confront Trump's trade policies. 
Following the U.S. tariffs, the European Commission's president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said last week that Europe would respond with countermeasures. 
Some fear that the failure for members to find common ground on trade issues at the meeting, which will include leaders from the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Japan, Italy, Germany and France, would raise the prospect of a full-blown trade war, hurting risk sentiment. 
The Dow Jones rallied Thursday as a jump in shares of oil-and-gas companies – following an uptick in oil prices – offset selling across tech stocks. 
2. Wholesale Inventories, Trade Sales Data on Tap
A duo of U.S. economic reports is not expected to garner much attention Friday as investors prepare for a widely expected U.S. interest rate hike next week, when the Federal Reserve concludes its two-day meeting June 13. 
Wholesale inventories growth data for April due 10am ET is expected to remain flat at 0.0%, while wholesale trade sales data are also expected at 10am ET. 
Ahead of the data, the U.S. dollar slipped against its rivals as the euro added to gains on expectations the European Central Bank would announce an end date to its bond-buying programme next week. 
The release of Canada employment change data at 8:30am ET will also be in focus as it could trigger a large reaction in USD/CAD.
3. US Rig Count to Continue Climb?
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand as investors continue to fret the rapid pace of U.S. output. 
Data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs continued their climb, raising the prospect of a continued expansion in U.S. output.
U.S. oil output jumped to a record 10.8 million bpd, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. 
Crude prices rose Thursday as investors cheered comments from OPEC members downplaying the prospect of the oil-cartel easing production curbs at its meeting due June 22.
Crude futures settled 1.9% higher at $65.95 a barrel on Thursday."

The family-owned company said on Thursday it would sell a cold brew, a trendy favorite of young consumers, in its own cafes and other food outlets in Italy.
In the country, the world's fourth biggest coffee market in term of number of cups drunk, several mid-sized domestic roasters including illycaffe sell their coffee mainly through independent cafes and supermarkets.
The arrival of Starbucks, which plans to open its first Italian store in Milan in September, ramps up the competition in Italy as coffeemakers chase the growing number of consumers prepared to pay a premium for quality coffee.
Cold coffee is considered key to attracting new consumers and global maker leader Nestle (S:NESN) signaled the appeal for this product last September when it bought cold-brewed coffees specialist Blue Bottle Coffee in the United States.
Illycaffe's new drink is made through a slow extraction of coffee at a cold temperature.
Illycaffe, which produces and sells only one blend made of nine varieties of Arabica beans, is the third-biggest coffee maker in Italy with sales of nearly 500 million euros ($590 million)last year. 

The group has a network of 244 mono-brand stores and cafes in more than 40 countries around the world.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. bank regulator said on Thursday that an industry-wide review prompted by  Wells Fargo  & Co's (N:WFC) sales practices scandal had uncovered some instances of phony accounts at other lenders but little evidence of a ""systemic"" problem. 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reviewed more than 40 large and midsize banks after Wells Fargo's phony accounts scandal first erupted in 2016, wrapping up the process at the end of 2017. The full findings have not been made public. 
The OCC said in a statement that it had not identified any ""systemic issues"" at the other banks mirroring those at Wells Fargo, where bank employees had created potentially millions of unauthorized accounts in customers' names to meet sales goals.
But the review did uncover ""some weaknesses"" in internal sales practices, the OCC statement said. In particular, few banks had a centralized approach to risk governance over sales practices before the regulatory review. 
The OCC said it had notified banks earlier in 2018 of any particular issues that turned up in the review, and that most banks took ""timely actions"" to address those weaknesses after they were identified by the regulator.
The OCC also found some instances in which accounts were opened without customer consent. It did not specify how many improper accounts it had found at other banks, but said reasons why the accounts were opened had included sales promotions lacking in risk controls or ""isolated"" instances of employee misconduct.
There was no evidence that any of the unauthorized accounts found at other banks had been opened by bank employees in order to meet to sales incentives or quotas, the OCC said.
Those banks have either already addressed any unauthorized accounts or are taking remedial action, including closing the accounts and refunding any improper fees, the OCC said.

A Wells Fargo spokesperson declined to comment.

A spokeswoman for Bosch declined to comment. Audi, the Transport Ministry and the Stuttgart regional court could not immediately be reached for comment outside business hours. Volkswagen declined to comment. 
Shareholders represented by law firm Tilp are seeking compensation from Volkswagen and major shareholder  Porsche  SE (DE:PSHG_p) for not informing markets quickly enough about the scale of potential liabilities VW faced over its use of illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests.

Volkswagen has admitted to deliberately cheating diesel emissions tests but denies it failed to inform investors in a timely fashion about the scope of liabilities being faced by its shareholders.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A top antitrust official at the U.S. Justice Department attempted to reassure investors on Thursday that worries that regulators would crack down on proposed combinations of two companies on a supply chain -- known as vertical mergers -- were overblown.
Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, said that most proposed transactions were either good for consumers or neutral.
But the department's decision in November to sue to stop AT&T Inc (N:T), which owns DirecTV, from buying  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) made investors question whether other vertical deals might also meet with skepticism from antitrust enforcers. 
Delrahim said that was overblown.
""I understand that some journalists and observers have recently expressed concern that the antitrust division no longer believes that vertical mergers can be efficient and beneficial to competition and consumers,"" he said.
Delrahim said that some of these point at the decision to sue to try to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner ""as a supposed bellwether,"" he said. ""Rest assured these concerns are misplaced.""

Two other vertical deals under review are Cigna Corp's (N:CI) plan to buy Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX) for $52 billion and CVS Health Corp's (N:CVS) planned merger with  Aetna Inc  (N:AET) for $69 billion.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google will not allow its artificial intelligence software to be used in weapons or unreasonable surveillance efforts, the Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) unit said Thursday in standards for its business decisions in the nascent field. 
The new restrictions could help Google management defuse months of protest by thousands of employees against the company's work with the U.S. military to identify objects in drone video.
Google will pursue other government contracts including around cybersecurity, military recruitment and search and rescue, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said in a blog post Thursday.
""We want to be clear that while we are not developing AI for use in weapons, we will continue our work with governments and the military in many other areas,"" he said. 
Breakthroughs in the cost and performance of advanced computers have begun to carry AI from research labs into industries such as defense and health. Google and its big technology rivals have become leading sellers of AI tools, which enable computers to review large datasets to make predictions and identify patterns and anomalies faster than humans could.
But the potential of AI systems to pinpoint drone strikes better than military specialists or identify dissidents through mass collection of online communications has sparked concerns among academic ethicists and Google employees.
""Taking a clear and consistent stand against the weaponization of its technologies"" would help Google demonstrate ""its commitment to safeguarding the trust of its international base of customers and users,"" Lucy Suchman, a sociology professor at Lancaster University in England, told Reuters ahead of Thursday's announcement.
Google said it would not pursue AI applications intended to cause physical injury, that tie into surveillance ""violating internationally accepted norms of human rights,"" or that present greater ""material risk of harm"" than countervailing benefits.
Its principles also call for employees as well as customers ""to avoid unjust impacts on people,"" particularly around race, gender, sexual orientation and political or religious belief.
Pichai said Google reserved the right to block applications that violated its principles. 

A Google official described the principles and recommendations as a template that anyone in the AI community could put into immediate use in their own software. Though  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and other firms released AI guidelines earlier, the industry has followed Google's efforts closely because of the internal pushback against the drone imagery deal.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 03:08PM ET</span>",Chinese phone maker ZTE saved from brink after deal with U.S.,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - China’s No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker ZTE (HK:0763) secured a lifeline from the Trump administration on Thursday after agreeing to pay a $1 billion fine and overhaul leadership in a deal that will lift a ban on its doing business with U.S. suppliers.
The agreement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks trade concessions from China and negotiations continue to avoid a trade war between the world's two largest economies. 
Shares of U.S. companies that do business with ZTE rose on Thursday.
U.S. lawmakers immediately attacked the agreement, citing intelligence warnings that ZTE poses a national security threat.
ZTE pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to evade U.S. embargoes by selling U.S. equipment to Iran. The ban on buying U.S. parts was imposed in April after the company lied about disciplining some executives responsible for the violations. ZTE then ceased major operations. 
Under the deal, ZTE will change its board and management within 30 days, pay a $1 billion fine and put an additional $400 million in escrow. The deal also includes a new 10-year ban that is suspended unless there are future violations.
""We will closely monitor ZTE's behavior,"" Ross said in a statement. ""If they commit any further violations, we would again be able to deny them access to U.S. technology as well as collect the additional $400 million in escrow."" 
Reuters reported exclusively on Tuesday that ZTE had signed a preliminary agreement with the Commerce Department, along with the fine and other terms.
Ross said the penalty is the largest the Commerce Department has ever levied. 
The agreement does not take effect until ZTE pays the $1 billion fine and puts the $400 million in escrow, which is likely to take at least a few days, according to a person familiar with the matter.
ZTE did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. 
Under the new agreement, ZTE must also retain a compliance team selected by the Commerce Department for 10 years. The company already has a U.S. court-appointed monitor.
#VeryBadDeal
U.S. senators said they plan legislation to roll back the agreement.
""I assure you with 100 percent confidence that #ZTE is a much greater national security threat than steel from Argentina or Europe,"" Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio tweeted with the hashtag #VeryBadDeal.
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that ZTE poses a ""significant"" national security threat.
""ZTE is a state-controlled telecommunications company that poses significant espionage risks, which this agreement appears to do little to address,"" U.S. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the agreement ""a 180-degree turn away from the president's promise to be tough on China."" 
Eric Hirschhorn, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce who had been involved in the ZTE case, said ""the government is merely setting a price for doing business instead of giving them the punishment they deserve.""
A U.S. investigation into ZTE was launched after Reuters reported in 2012 the company had signed contracts to ship hardware and software worth millions of dollars to Iran from some of the best-known U.S. technology companies. (https://reut.rs/2GbpCmO)
The probe found that ZTE bought U.S. components and incorporated them into its equipment, illegally shipped them to Iran, and devised elaborate schemes to hide the illegal activity. The company pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Texas last year. 
Shenzhen-based ZTE has a subsidiary in Richardson, Texas.
ZTE's survival has been a topic of discussion in high-level U.S.-China trade talks. Trump tweeted on May 14 that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping were working together to help ZTE “get back into business, fast.” 
Trump met with his trade advisers on Tuesday to discuss China's offer to import an extra $70 billion of American goods over a year in hopes of defusing a potential trade war between the world's two largest economies.
One of the U.S. companies caught in the international crossfire is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, whose products account for the lion’s share of chips inside ZTE smartphones. Separately, Qualcomm is trying to get Chinese approval for its pending $44 billion acquisition of  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI).
Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Steven Mollenkopf said on Thursday he hoped the ZTE agreement would pave the way for the NXP approval. Shares of  Qualcomm Inc  rose as much as 4.7 percent while NXP jumped as much as 6.7 percent.

ZTE supplier Oclaro Inc was up 1.3 percent while Acacia Communications Inc was down 0.6 percent. Oclaro got 18 percent of its business from ZTE last year, while 30 percent of Acacia's total revenue was from ZTE.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) $52.4 billion deal to acquire most of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (O:FOXA) assets was ""surgically"" structured on good advice to be submitted to regulators, Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division, said on Thursday. 
""We will see what the investigation shows. (Disney) didn't propose to acquire Fox Sports 1 and 2. They didn't acquire Fox Broadcasting and say, you know what, we will combine this with ABC and don't worry about it we'll have an arbitrator decide if prices for advertisers go up or competition for content creators goes down,"" Delrahim told The Deal’s annual corporate governance conference in New York.
""They had good advice and carved out surgically ... a transaction that might be doable. But again, who knows where that transaction leads,"" Delrahim added.
Antitrust considerations have become especially important as Fox prepares to weigh a rival offer for the assets Disney agreed to buy last December. Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) said last month it was preparing an offer for the Fox assets that would top the deal with Disney.
A regulatory filing in April showed that Comcast offered to acquire Fox's assets for $64 billion last November, before it agreed to sell to Disney. Fox rejected Comcast's offer, even though it was higher, partly because it was concerned it faced a greater risk of regulators shooting it down.
Comcast is waiting to see if a U.S. federal judge will allow AT&T Inc's (N:T) planned $85 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) to proceed before submitting its new offer to Fox, sources have said.

The Department of Justice has sued to block that deal, and Fox has cited the lawsuit as a reason why a tie-up with a cable operator such as Comcast could irk regulators.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is looking to move more jobs than originally envisaged to its new Paris office, in what is expected to be one of the biggest such shifts from London ahead of Brexit, two sources familiar with the matter said.
A first wave of moves from London will begin early next year and will affect roughly 400 jobs in Bank of America's markets, trading, sales and fixed income teams, the sources told Reuters.
Bank of America's Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said in November that about 200 people in sales and trading would move to the European Union and to Paris in particular.
But since then the overall number has risen and the U.S. firm now wanted to fill every desk in Paris, the sources said.
""It is an aggressive plan,"" one told Reuters.
The Wall Street bank is refurbishing an 11,000 square meter office in the French capital to create a European trading hub that will serve clients once Britain leaves the EU in March.
One of the sources said the building has capacity for more than 700 people and that staff in London are being notified about their new base. A source close to the bank said it may sub-let some space, depending on the final Brexit deal.
PASSPORTING RIGHTS
British Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out retaining so-called passporting rights for financial services, but a Brexit deal is still up in the air and she is struggling to unite her party and government over a Brexit strategy. 
Most investment banks are no longer willing to wait for clarity on their post-Brexit future and are taking steps to minimize disruption to their clients.
International banks are planning to build EU outposts to overcome losing passporting rights which enable them to offer financial, advisory and trading services to corporate clients across all EU states via one local license.
In preparation, Bank of America is merging its London-based subsidiary with its Dublin-based Irish entity, which will become its main EU base. 
Reuters previously reported that up to 125 roles will be shifted there in a first phase of moves, while a second phase was likely to involve Paris.
French President Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker, has taken steps to lure finance jobs from London, easing labor rules, cutting a wealth tax to cover only real estate assets, introducing a flat 30 percent tax on capital income and scrapping the highest payroll tax for banks.
HSBC has picked Paris as its main European base, but it recently reduced its estimate for the number of jobs to be shifted from an initial forecast of 1,000.

A Reuters survey of 119 firms in March showed that the number of finance jobs to be shifted out of Britain or created overseas by March 2019 has halved from six months ago, to 5,000.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Some fund managers are avoiding Amazon as it leads U.S. market,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - For most U.S. fund managers, beating the market this year has come down to one decision: whether or not to own shares of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
More than 70 percent of the actively-managed U.S. large-cap funds that are beating the 3.5-percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500 own shares of the Seattle-based e-commerce giant, according to Lipper data. Shares of the company are up nearly 45 percent for the year-to-date, and account for nearly 40 percent of the S&P 500's gain for the year, according to S&P Global. 
Those gains have left even investors like Warren Buffett, who has never invested in Amazon, kicking themselves for missing out on the company's growth.
""I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen,” Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (N:BRKa) annual shareholder meeting in early May.
Amazon has benefited this year from continued growth of e-commerce and is a business that seems largely immune from the threat of a global trade wars. 
Yet with volatility in the stock market expected to continue through the U.S. midterm elections in the fall, Amazon's pricy valuation and high level of fund ownership may leave the stock more vulnerable to a steep decline, analysts warn.
As a result, some outperforming fund managers who have so far avoided Amazon are branching out into companies ranging from Asian e-commerce company  Alibaba  Group Holdings Ltd (N:BABA) to medical device maker Abiomed Inc (O:ABMD), all in an effort to find better values. 
""Not owning Amazon has obviously hurt us this year, but we've been fortunate to own names that have made up the difference,"" said Bob Doll, portfolio manager of the Nuveen Growth fund. 
Doll has avoided Amazon because of its trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 267, a valuation more than ten times that of the broad S&P 500. Instead, he has benefited from positions in MasterCard Inc (N:MA), Red Hat Inc (N:RHT), and  Intuit  Inc (O:INTU), all of which are up more than 30 percent for the year and trade at less than a third of Amazon's valuation. 
""These stocks aren't exactly cheap, they're cheap compared to a concept stock like Amazon where the valuation is so full,"" he said. 
Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager at the Biondo Growth Fund, said that his fund has been increasing its position in Alibaba instead of owning Amazon because he sees it as a cheaper way to invest in the growth of e-commerce. 
""Would we have liked to be in Amazon 5 years ago? Yes. But in last year maybe Alibaba is the way to play it, because you're getting the same growth profile without the same multiple.""
Shares of Alibaba are up 21 percent for the year and trade at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 54.3. 
Fund manager concentration in Amazon may leave the company more vulnerable to sell off if the volatility in the broad market increases this fall ahead of the mid-term elections, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at CFRA Research. 
""We're of the belief that there will be greater market volatility for the duration of 2018 and while in theory that gives active managers a chance to buy in on whatever they have missed out on, that volatility could hit the better performers first,"" he said.
The outsized gain in Amazon relative to other stocks in the S&P 500 suggests that growth is hard to come by in the U.S. market and should benefit more concentrated portfolios, said Daniel Davidowitz, a portfolio manager of the $2.1-billion Polen Growth Fund. 
Davidowitz, whose fund holds only 20 stocks, said he has avoided Amazon because of its high valuation and stretched balance sheet and has instead moved into stocks like Invisalign braces-maker  Align Technology  Inc (O:ALGN) and Adobe Systems Inc (O:ADBE), both of which are up more than 40 percent year-to-date. 

""The average U.S. company is not growing that much. Earnings may be up a lot but a big slug of that is from the benefits of the Trump tax cut,"" he said. ""The only way to outperform is to find companies that are creating their own theme.""

Buffett, who is Berkshire Hathaway's chairman, and JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in the interview that they had selected a person for the healthcare venture's top job.
Famed for his love of junk food, Buffett has described U.S. healthcare costs as a ""tapeworm"" on American businesses, hurting their ability to compete with rivals in other countries. Last month, he said the goal is to challenge the entire healthcare industry, not individual segments.
""We've basically reached agreement,"" Buffett said. ""We should have an announcement on that matter within maybe two weeks.""
While there is no guarantee the venture between Amazon.com, Berkshire and JPMorgan, which collectively employ more than 1 million people, will succeed in lowering costs, Buffett said it was well positioned to try.
""The resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried,"" Buffett said last month. 
Amazon's size and reputation as a disruptor prompted investors to sell shares of companies that might be hurt by the venture when it was announced in January.

These included drugmakers, health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), such as CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX).

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","Canadian railways woo scarce workers with cold, hard loonies","By Allison Lampert and Julie Gordon
MONTREAL/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - In a battle to unclog rail bottlenecks that left Canadian commodities trapped in landlocked western provinces this winter, the country's largest railways are offering C$15,000 ($11,566.93) signing bonuses for experienced workers who can hit the rails right away and get trains moving.
North America's transportation sector is struggling to hire staff amid rising demand from shippers and low unemployment, with some large U.S. railroads offering bonuses as high as $20,000 for experienced train crews in certain states.
The bonuses are a ""new approach"" for Canadian National Railway Co (TO:CNR), which is also bringing back recent retirees and has launched a new two-year management trainee program to deepen its pipeline of future managers, said spokesman Patrick Waldron.
Harsh weather and insufficient capacity snarled service this winter, leaving grain and other commodities stranded in Canada's landlocked prairies.
""The strengthening economy across the board makes the overall job market more competitive,"" Waldron said.
Montreal-based CN initiated the bonuses last year, which its smaller rival  Canadian Pacific Railway  Ltd (TO:CP) then matched, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Waldron would not say how many CN workers were hired through the bonuses which has not been previously reported.
CP declined to comment specifically on the bonuses.
CN is rolling out its largest expansion in decades, including a roughly 20 percent boost to its workforce over two years by the end of 2018. 
CP, which said on Thursday it would invest C$500 million ($385.6 million) on grain transport cars, plans to hire 700 workers, although a spokesman did not specify a time period.
Calgary-based CP offered its engineers and conductors a 9 percent salary hike over four years as part of a tentative agreement reached last week. Experienced conductors earn over C$100,000 ($77,113), although salaries vary widely.
Since new recruits need up to six months of training before hitting the rails, attracting experienced conductors who can work immediately is worth the bonuses' expense, said Edward Jones analyst Dan Sherman, noting it amounts to less than 1 percent of labor costs. ""The idea is to get them out there and get the trains rolling,"" he said.
TALENT WAR
But both railways could face stiff competition from the oil and gas sector, as rebounding oil prices push energy patch salaries back up to the six-figure mark, making those jobs far more attractive for workers, said recruiters. Railways hire from the same labor pool as many oil and gas firms. 
The global oil benchmark Brent (LCOc1) charged past $80 a barrel last month for the first time since 2014, cheering executives in Canada's energy capital of Calgary, Alberta, where a shift is underway from survival mode to cautious expansion.
Oil and gas sector job postings have jumped 159 percent so far this year, compared with 2017, said Matt Munro, Canada manager for UK-based recruiter Petroplan.
Pay too is rising, with the average weekly salary for a Canadian oil and gas extraction employee in the first quarter rising 7.1 percent year-on-year to C$2,878.82 ($2,219.94), Statistics Canada data shows.
Railway employee salaries, by comparison, averaged C$1,337.98 in the first three months of the year.

While not everyone that exited the notoriously cyclical energy sector in the last downturn is ready to run back, ""compensation will always play a significant factor in attracting and retaining top talent,"" said Kati Greenall, Canada Regional Director at Houston-based recruitment firm Airswift. 
Indeed, some newly recruited railway workers are already ready to jump ship. ""I would go back to the energy sector tomorrow if the opportunity came along,"" one recent CP recruit told Reuters.

""This talk about a crisis in emerging markets is just nonsense,"" Dennis, head of global emerging-market strategy at UBS, said on Bloomberg TV.
He’s not alone. Analysts at firms ranging from PGIM Inc. to HSBC Securities say the recent weakness is the exception, not the rule, and that in fact emerging-market assets look pretty attractive now. They say the U.S. dollar rally that started in mid-April will soon run out of steam, while earnings growth, cheaper valuations and widening growth differentials with developed peers will support equities.
It’s all a starkly different tone from Mohamed El-Erian’s warning about playing whack-a-mole with financial crises.
""If one animal gets sick in the zoo that doesn’t mean there will be contagion risk,"" said Anastasia Levashova, a London-based fund manager at Blackfriars Asset Management. ""EM is not in crisis and there is no contagion.""

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. Justice Department probes T-Mobile-Sprint merger effect on smaller wireless companies - sources,"By Sheila Dang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice is examining how the proposed merger between T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp could affect prices for smaller wireless operators, according to two people familiar with the matter.
A T-Mobile and Sprint merger would eliminate competition between the two carriers that have been the dominant players in selling network access to wireless companies that often serve pre-paid or price-conscious consumers, and could lead to higher prices for those users.
The Justice Department, which is evaluating T-Mobile's $26 billion deal to buy Sprint, has been speaking with small wireless operators that buy access to the major wireless networks at wholesale rates, and is seeking their opinions about the merger, the people said, who declined to be named because the talks are confidential.
Antitrust investigations are a normal part of the merger approval process, especially for large deals like T-Mobile's.
A Justice Department spokesman and a T-Mobile spokeswoman declined to comment. Sprint did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Including AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon, there are four major U.S. wireless providers. Since the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division recently refused to commit to keep four carriers after the T-Mobile deal is completed - an issue that contributed to AT&T dropping its pursuit to buy T-Mobile in 2011 - the department's examination of the wholesale market suggests the government is giving the deal a thorough review. 
David Glickman, chief executive of Ultra Mobile and Mint Mobile, two pre-paid wireless brands, also said Justice asked to speak with him about the merger, but said he was not given additional details about what the department wanted to discuss.
""A merger between T-Mobile and Sprint without any concessions would be bad for consumers, businesses and the country,"" said Peter Adderton, founder and former chief executive of Boost Mobile USA, which was acquired by Sprint. Adderton is no longer affiliated with Boost Mobile's business in the United States.
Adderton, who called for formal regulation of wireless wholesale prices after the T-Mobile-Sprint deal was announced, said it was ""encouraging"" to see the Justice Department reach out to learn about how the merger could affect businesses and consumers.
While AT&T and Verizon dominate the U.S. wireless market overall, T-Mobile is the most popular among customers who make less than $75,000 per year, and Sprint’s pre-paid brand Boost counts 83 percent of its users in that income range, according to data from Kagan, S&P Global Market Intelligence data.

T-Mobile has 38 percent of the U.S. pre-paid market, while Sprint has 16 percent, which would give the combined company 54 percent, according to S&P.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 12:21PM ET</span>",Belgium's KBC to limit Iran transactions after U.S. sanctions move,"By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - Belgium's KBC (BR:KBC) will limit Iran-related transactions to only humanitarian trade after the U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, the financial group said, becoming the latest company to scale back activities. 
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran - known as the JCPOA - on May 8 and said he would reimpose sanctions within 180 days, prompting several European companies to announce they would end business with Tehran before the Nov. 4 deadline.
Since then, banks, insurers, shipping companies and European oil refiners have been gradually severing ties with Iran, complicating the efforts of European and other countries to keep the nuclear deal alive.
""Immediately upon the exit by the USA of the JCPOA, KBC Group decided to restrict its policy on Iran to humanitarian goods as defined by OFAC,"" the company said in an emailed statement to Reuters, referring to the U.S. Treasury's sanctions enforcement arm.
""This policy allows also such humanitarian transactions for KBC’s own customers beyond the 4th of November 2018 as long as it complies with OFAC programs.""
KBC said pending transactions for goods other than humanitarian trade would be wound down within the allowed period. 
""KBC never financed any deal with Iran but only processed the settlement of transactions of its customers, taking into account all applicable EU and OFAC sanctions and several other specific conditions,"" it said. 
International sanctions were lifted in 2016 as part of an agreement to limit Iran's nuclear activity. The easing of measures included the removal of some sanctions by the United States such as on Iran's financial sector. 
KBC, which is an integrated bank-insurance group, said it previously decided in 2016 to support well established customers in home markets in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary ""in their genuine trade with Iran, always respecting all EU and U.S. regulations"". 
""Such support is/was restricted to non-U.S. dollar trade only and always subject to an in-depth screening of each transaction and all parties concerned."" 
Kenni Leth, group press officer with Denmark's largest lender  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), said earlier this year the bank had decided to phase out and exit all activities to and from Iran and suspend existing relations with Iran that allowed it to support certain customers in doing business there.
""During recent months the operational and reputational risks associated with doing business in Iran have increased,"" Leth said. 
Last week, Swiss lender Banque de Commerce et de Placements (BCP) told Reuters it had suspended new transactions with Iran and was winding down Iran-related activities, which finance sources said was a blow for Tehran. 
Germany's No.2 lender DZ Bank said last month it would halt financial transactions with Iran in July.

Sanctions specialists say humanitarian business with Iran, which includes the food and medicine trade, was never barred before 2016, but the complexities involved made such activity slow paced due to concerns over dealing with sanctioned entities, together with a ban on U.S. dollar dealings.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 12:14PM ET</span>",GM to sell new electric car batteries to Honda in North America,"By Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will supply advanced batteries to Japan's Honda Motor Co, the companies said Thursday, a move that could significantly reduce the cost of future electric vehicles at both automakers after 2020.
GM said the new batteries, which it has branded EME 1.0 and first described last fall, will be smaller than current EV batteries, can be charged more quickly and will provide more energy.
Battery packs, typically the most expensive component of electric vehicles, can cost $10,000 to $12,000 - nearly a third the price of GM's Chevrolet Bolt EV. GM aims to cut that price nearly in half by 2021, sources told Reuters earlier this year.
GM and Honda on Thursday said they would ""collaborate"" on the batteries, with GM supplying cells and modules, mainly for electric vehicles to be sold by both companies in North America.
A source familiar with GM's plans said its current battery cell supplier, Korea's LG Chem, is expected to provide cells for the new battery, which is mainly a GM design. 
The new batteries are expected to begin production around 2021, the source said.
GM declined to provide further details, and said it had not finalized supplier agreements for the new batteries. LG Chem did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
GM and Honda have a partnership to jointly develop electric vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells that are expected to go on sale in 2020.
Earlier this year, sources told Reuters that a key element of GM's new battery design is slashing the amount of cobalt, the most costly ingredient in current lithium-ion battery cells. Cobalt prices have soared in the past two years in expectation of a surge in demand from automakers.
GM's new battery design increases the amount of nickel, which enables batteries to store and produce more energy, the sources told Reuters. Other battery makers are exploring similar changes in battery chemistry and design.
The GM batteries are an important element in the automaker's plan to dramatically ramp up electric vehicle production after 2020, especially in China.

In addition to the EME 1.0 battery system, GM also is developing a dedicated architecture for future electric vehicles that is modular and flexible enough to accommodate a variety of different vehicle types and sizes.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - An 8 percent surge in European steel imports this year is a direct result of Washington's import tariffs on the metal, which have caused trade flows to be deflected to Europe's shores, European steel industry association Eurofer said on Thursday.
The association called on the European Union to impose safeguards - in the form of both tariffs and quotas - on EU steel imports to prevent a worsening steel import surge that will further harm the sector.
It added, however, that the measure might put Europe's steel exports at risk, as other countries might be tempted to raise their own steel import barriers, causing a domino effect that would harm free trade worldwide.
""This is an absurd situation. Nations that are pro free trade are on (the verge) of starting trade war. But we are where we are. We'll be destroyed if don't stop this tsunami (of steel),"" said Geert van Poelvoorde, Eurofer president and an executive at ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker.
U.S. tariffs of 25 percent on incoming steel and 10 percent on aluminum came into effect on March 23 and have been imposed on Europe, Canada and Mexico since last Friday, June 1, after their exemptions expired.
The EU has said it could impose preliminary measures to safeguard its steel and aluminum industries as early as July, mainly to prevent Asian producers flooding the European market.
Steel is the second biggest industry in the world after oil and gas.
""We should have a (safeguard) quota based on the average (steel import levels) of the last three years. Above that quota, a 25 percent tariff should apply. We can't have symbolic action,"" said van Poelvoorde.
Eurofer estimates that up to 13 million tonnes of steel could be deflected to Europe as a result of the U.S. tariffs. This would be a hefty increase in a market that imports an average 40 million tonnes of steel a year, it says.
Also, Europe exports about 5 million tonnes of steel to the United States each year, but post tariffs, around a third of those exports might remain in Europe as they would likely struggle to find new export markets outside the United States.
""Collateral damage could come if more countries close their markets to European steel. They might take the same (safeguard) measures ... depending on how Europe defines its measures,"" said 
said van Poelvoorde.

EU members have also given broad support to a European Commission plan to set 25 percent duties on up to 2.8 billion euros ($3.3 billion) of U.S. exports in response to what it is sees as illegal U.S. trade action.

(Reuters) - U.S. insurer  AmTrust Financial  Services Inc (O:AFSI) on Thursday agreed to be acquired by a group of investors for a sweetened $2.95 billion deal that also helped secure the support of dissenting shareholder Carl Icahn.
Evergreen Parent, an entity formed by AmTrust's founding family, its chief executive officer and some private equity funds, will pay $14.75 per share in cash, up from its earlier offer of $13.50 per share, the insurer said.
Billionaire investor Icahn, who owns a 9.4 percent stake in the company, had strongly opposed the go-private deal and sued AmTrust and the controlling family, accusing them of trying to take the insurer private at the wrong time and the wrong price.
""By raising the merger price to $14.75, over $100 million of incremental value has been created for public stockholders,"" Icahn said on Thursday.
AmTrust's shares were up 2.7 percent at $14.48 in early trading, still trading below the latest offer.
The revised offer, however, failed to appease another shareholder opposed to the deal - Arca Capital. The firm reiterated that it sees $22 per share as the 'fair value' for AmTrust.
""We are still opposed to the $14.75/shr deal value - we think this still undervalues the company and it's still not enough,"" said Pavol Krúpa, chairman of the Czech-based investment firm told Reuters.
""The increased offer is just a cosmetic change to sway some shareholder's view.""
Arca holds a 2.4 percent stake in the company. It said in a press release that AmTrust's long-term price target lies between $25 and $31, but it was ready to negotiate with the founding family.

""If no deal can be reached, we are very happy for AmTrust to remain public,"" Krúpa said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial regulators should have a formal objective to keep London's banking and insurance sectors globally competitive after Brexit, a senior lawmaker said on Thursday.
The now defunct Financial Services Authority had a requirement to pay heed to competitiveness - which led to criticism that ""lite touch"" regulation fomented the 2007-09 financial crisis.
This remit was not included in objectives of its two successor bodies, the Financial Conduct Authority, and the  Prudential  Regulation Authority (PRA) at the Bank of England.
""I strongly argue that now is the time to re-elevate that objective, that there is now a statutory international competitiveness duty alongside prudential supervision,"" Stephen Hammond, a member of parliament's Treasury Select Committee (TSC) told a City & Financial conference.
""It's important that we don't dilute standards beyond the internationally accepted, but tests of appropriateness, proportionality and international equivalence are key,"" he said.
""It won't make the UK a pariah, but it will make the UK competitive in an international arena.""
Last October the Committee slammed the PRA for being heavy handed in applying EU insurance rules known as Solvency II, saying the watchdog should make changes to benefit the competitive standing of financial services after Brexit.
The PRA has said it does not want a competitiveness objective.
The TSC will publish a follow-up report on insurance by the end of June.
""It is key that within a market, the relative levels of supervision clearly affect cost of operators in that market and therefore internationally that would affect the competitiveness of that market,"" Hammond said.
""We intend to engage further.""
A House of Lords committee said in a report in January that a competitiveness objective for regulators would help London stay a top global financial center after Brexit.
NO HARM
Hammond was speaking to an audience that included David Rule, head of the PRA's insurance division and who said Solvency II has not had a negative impact on policyholders, or the profitability and share prices of insurers.
""We don't think the actual regulation has been a major seachange for UK insurers in terms of resources they have to hold against the risks they are taking,"" Rule said.
Julian Adams, group regulatory and government relations director at insurer Prudential (L:PRU) said Brexit makes the need to find the right trade-off between regulatory toughness and competitiveness more important.
""Unless we follow everything that Europe does, UK regulators become even more powerful,"" said Adams, a former head of insurance regulation at the BoE.
The PRA said on Wednesday it could not comply with a request from the TSC to ease the risk margin rule in Solvency II, blamed for sending business overseas to avoid capital charges.
The PRA said uncertainty over Britain's future trading relations with the EU in financial services meant it could not change the rule for now.

As Business Insider reported following the news Twitter would join the S&P 500, companies  normally spike upon being added to major indexes.

The company's shares are also expected to rise once they begin trading on the new index as funds that track the entire catalog of S&P stocks buy up the stock.

On Thursday, France's Societe Generale named as its new group head of strategy Sebastien Proto, a former Rothschild & Cie managing partner who graduated from France's elite administrative school ENA in 2004, alongside Macron.
Proto previously worked in the French government as chief of staff to budget and labor ministers during the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy.
Marguerite Berard-Andrieu, who was also attended ENA in the same year as Macron was appointed earlier this year by BNP Paribas to oversee the bank's French retail banking operations.
Berard-Andrieu came first in the final 2004 ENA ranking that decides which prestigious government department a graduate joins after school. Proto was second in that year and Emmanuel Macron the fifth, according to Le Monde newspaper.
Many top French politicians and company executives have graduated from the Ecole National d’Administration (ENA) college, which trains top public servants. Students attend ENA after their university education.

French banks, unlike their European rivals, have vowed in the past few years to hang on to a broad array of businesses and even grow market share - a strategy supported by the political establishment who believe France needs to punch above its weight in global financial services.

1355,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Tesla's Surprising Surge Looks Like a Short Squeeze to Analysts,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. analysts say a short-seller squeeze may have been behind the stock’s gain of almost 10 percent on Wednesday, its best performance in more than two years. As  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) put it, the stock move reflected “more on investor positioning” rather than a reaction to “truly incremental data on fundamentals.” While most of the information coming out of the company’s shareholder meeting this week wasn’t new, Wall Street is honing in on Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s commitment to his ambitious Model 3 production goals and forecast for positive net income and cash flow in the second half of the year.
Here’s what analysts are saying:
Morgan Stanley, Adam Jonas
“We think the stock move reflects more on investor positioning (bearish) than truly incremental data on fundamentals.”
Musk saying it’s “quite likely” that Tesla will achieve 5,000 Model 3 production per week by early July is “one year ahead of our expectations.”
“If Tesla were able to achieve 5,000 of weekly production of Model 3 and avoid a significantly dilutive or expensive capital raise, it could trigger a continued squeeze in the name.”
Rates equal-weight, price target $291
Evercore ISI, Arndt Ellinghorst
Notable comments at the meeting that may have led to some short squeeze included all parts of Model 3 production capable of 500 units a day/3,500 a week, and Tesla’s reasonable confidence that a 5,000-units-a-week production rate could be met by the end of the quarter.
Also notes the outlook for positive GAAP net income and cash flow in third and fourth quarters, confirmation of plans to build a factory, battery and vehicle in Shanghai -- with details to be released shortly -- and the teaser of Model Y, which will be revealed next March.
“While we are not sure that any of the above is particularly new news for close Tesla/Elon followers, the reiteration of Model 3 targets as we get closer to the end of the quarter has likely led to some revaluation.”
In line, price target $287
Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi
Tesla’s recently introduced all-wheel-drive and performance edition versions of the Model 3 could “materially impact gross margins.”
“Our analysis suggests that strong adoption of both could boost average selling prices by up to ~$5,000-$11,000 in second half and have marginal contribution of 70 percent to 90 percent, potentially boosting gross margins by a stunning 700-1900 bps relative to ‘near breakeven’ in second quarter.”
“While boosting margins in second half of 2018 through mix could mollify investors, we worry that such a mix are unlikely to be sustainable, and we worry that a continued delay of the $35,000 base model may alienate consumers, leading to increased cancellations, which have purportedly spiked recently.”
Market perform, price target $265
Piper Jaffray, Alexander Potter
The “biggest drivers” of Wednesday’s outperformance included Tesla’s 5,000 Model 3 per week goal, the reiteration of earlier guidance that GAAP net income will be positive in third quarter, with positive cash flow in third and fourth quarter, and Tesla still insisting that no incremental debt or equity will be required.
Potter also notes that an attempt to strip Musk of his chairmanship failed.
Overweight, price target $369

1356,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>",Italy Banks From UniCredit to Intesa May Face Costly Ringfencing,"(Bloomberg) -- Italy’s ruling populist parties have opened the door to separating banks’ trading and deposit-taking operations, a shift that proved expensive to banks in other countries where the split up has been enforced.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, in his first speech to Italy’s lower house of parliament, said that he’ll seek to review recent legislation on cooperative banks and said there is a need distinguish between “banks that provide credit,” and “banks dedicated more to speculation.” Conte was selected by the populist League Party and Five Star Movement.
While short on details, the approach echoes initiatives taken by governments from Europe to the U.S. to protect retail depositors and borrowers from the riskier parts of investment banking in the wake of the financial crisis. The so-called ringfencing in the U.K. imposed heavy costs on the country’s biggest lenders.
“We believe such measures would mostly affect the largest Italian banks,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), UniCredit and possibly Banco BPM,” said Riccardo Rovere, an analyst at Mediobanca SpA. “Given the complete lack of details on how the newly appointed government may overhaul the local banks, it is hard to provide an assessment of the possible impact.”
In the U.K., where investment-banking tends to take up a large part of lenders’ businesses, lawmakers required that investment banking units must be separated from core retail businesses by the end of this year.
British Experience
“A separation of investment-bank operations and retail bank would be extremely costly, as seen in the U.K. with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank and  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) ringfencing charges,” said Marta Bastoni, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in London. “In addition, Italian retail banks are inherently more at risk than European peers due to non-performing loans, so it is difficult to see the rationale.”
Conte’s comments align with a Five Star and League program agreed to last month that led to a market selloff. The accord also calls for a review of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena’s recovery plan, includes measures to reimburse retail shareholders of banks that have been wound down, and calls for a review of Basel banking accords, which the document says “threaten the existence of Italy’s small and medium companies.”
Italian banks have slashed costs, cleaned up balance sheets and strengthened finances in recent years amid pressure from regulators and help from the previous Democratic Party government.
Measures to improve the banks’ governance and competitiveness, including transforming the country’s 10 largest cooperative banks into joint-stock companies and the forced merger of smaller mutual banks into larger groups, are now at risk. A few weeks ago, the League put in a request to both houses of parliament to delay the finalization of the process to combine the mutual banks into two groups.
Shares of Italian banks tumbled as negotiations over a new government dragged on. Italian lenders including UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo posted some of the biggest declines on the Bloomberg Europe Banks Index on Thursday.

The company said its Chief Operating Officer Frederic Lissalde would replace Verrier, effective Aug. 1.
Verrier, who took the helm about five years ago, helped the company build a broad product portfolio, which includes parts used in combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles.
A need for higher fuel efficiency is driving demand for BorgWarner's products, including turbochargers, which help to burn fuel more efficiently by blowing oxygen into engine cylinders.
Verrier has also overseen the company's $950 million deal to buy Remy International Inc, a maker of electric and hybrid motors, to better compete in the fast-growing market for electric and hybrid vehicles.

1358,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Ross Says U.S. Has Deal to Allow ZTE to Get Back in Business,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. has reached a deal that will allow ZTE Corp (HK:0763). to get back in business after it pays a record-large fine and agrees to management changes, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.
“‘We still retain the power to shut them down again,” he said Thursday in an interview on CNBC. He said the Commerce Department is fining the Chinese telecommunications company $1.4 billion, including $400 million in escrow, on top of a $1 billion U.S. penalty a year ago.
The U.S. blocked ZTE’s access to U.S. suppliers in April, saying the company violated a 2017 sanctions settlement related to trading with Iran and North Korea and then lied about the violations. The company announced it was shutting down just weeks after the ban was announced.
Ross said the U.S. will install its “own compliance people” to monitor the company and shareholders will bring in new management and a board. An agreement that allows the crippled company to reopen was seen as a key Chinese demand as the world’s two largest economies try to avoid a trade war that could undermine global growth. The U.S. also needs China’s help negotiating the denuclearization of North Korea ahead of a June 12 summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on at least $50 billion in Chinese imports shortly after publishing a final list of targets on June 15. China has vowed to retaliate on everything from U.S. soybeans to airplanes, and said it will abandon its commitments if the U.S. follows through on its tariff threat.
U.S. goods exported to China last year totaled $130 billion while Chinese imports to the U.S. totaled $506 billion. That left a U.S. deficit of more than $375 billion.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government is also looking at limiting Chinese investment, and will report by the end of this month how it plans to tighten scrutiny of that. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin wants to rely on legislation to tighten controls, instead of an executive move imposing sweeping new limits, according to three people familiar with the matter.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>","Malaysia plans arrest of financier Jho Low, former Goldman banker: Bloomberg","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has issued an arrest warrant for financier Low Taek Jho, wanted for questioning in a graft probe involving former prime minister Najib Razak and state fund 1MDB, Bloomberg said on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Malaysian authorities are also preparing warrants for two more individuals, including a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) banker, Roger Ng, Bloomberg added.
The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has issued an arrest warrant for Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, a director of SRC International, a former unit of 1Malaysia Development Berhad, and is preparing warrants for the fund's ex-chief, Shahrol Halmi, Bloomberg said.
The anti-graft agency, a lawyer for Low, or Jho Low as he is popularly known, and Shahrol did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative of MACC declined to comment to Bloomberg.
Reuters was unable to reach Ng and Nik Faisal immediately.
Bloomberg said the four individuals had not been charged with wrongdoing, and it was not clear what suspicions underpinned the warrants.
On Thursday, MACC issued a notice for Low and Nik Faisal to contact it immediately to help in its investigation. Low, through his lawyers, said he would cooperate.
Empowered by a new government elected last month, the agency has relaunched a probe into why $10.6 million from SRC was transferred into Najib's bank account.
Anti-graft agents have questioned both Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansor, following his shock election defeat last month to former mentor-turned-foe Mahathir Mohamad.
Low was regarded as close to Najib and his family and is seen as a central figure in the 1MDB affair, having allegedly advised on investments and negotiated deals, though he never held any official role in the fund.
The U.S. Department of Justice has alleged that more than $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, and about $700 million of that went to Najib's personal bank accounts.
Najib, who founded 1MDB in 2009, has consistently denied wrongdoing.
Goldman Sachs had helped 1MDB raise $6.5 billion in three bond sales in 2012 and 2013 to invest in energy projects and real estate to boost the Malaysian economy.
Instead, more than $2.5 billion raised from those bonds was misappropriated and used to buy artwork, luxury properties in New York and London and to pay off gambling debts in Las Vegas, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged.
The bank said in November it had received requests from ""various government bodies"" and was cooperating, Bloomberg said.

(Reuters) - Biotech  MiMedx Group Inc  (O:MDXG) said on Thursday it had replaced its chief financial officer and would restate financial statements following an internal investigation into its sales and distribution practices, sending shares 25 percent lower. 
The announcement is the latest sign of trouble at the Marietta, Georgia-based company, which has delayed making previous financial filings and faced a series of attacks by short sellers.
MiMedx said in March that the U.S. Department of Justice was also reviewing the company's practices on a preliminary basis, following media reports of a federal probe into whether the company had overcharged the government for its tissue repair treatments.
On Thursday, the company appointed Edward Borkowski as its interim chief financial officer and said that Michael Senker had stepped down as CFO, along with corporate controller and treasurer, John Cranston.
Borkowski, a pharmaceutical executive with over 31 years of experience in public company audit and accounting, will also oversee the company's legal, finance, and investor and public relations. 
MiMedx said it would restate statements from fiscal 2012 to 2016 as well as for the first three quarters of 2017.
It said that was due to the accounting treatment of practices used by two distributors ""for which certain implicit arrangements modified the explicit terms of the contracts, impacting revenue recognition during specified periods.""
MiMedx also said financial information for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 should not be relied upon.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 08:05AM ET</span>",Euro and bond yields extend rally on ECB while risk appetite grows,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro and bond yields rose on Thursday as investors priced in an early wind-down of European Central Bank stimulus, while renewed risk appetite drove world stocks to a 3-1/2 week high.
The selloff in safe-haven Bunds and U.S. Treasuries drove money into riskier assets, especially financial stocks, despite investor anxiety over how a G7 leaders summit that kicks off on Friday will pan out in view of divisions over global trade.
Bank stocks, which tend to gain from higher bond yields, drove European shares up. The pan-European banks index (SX7P) jumped 0.5 percent, supporting the STOXX 600 (STOXX).
Banks remain the worst-performing sector in Europe year-to-date, however, having been dented by political risk in Italy.
MSCI's index of world stocks (MIWD00000PUS) rose 0.2 percent to its highest since May 14. 
Wall Street was also set for a positive open with Dow Jones and S&P 500 index futures up 0.1 to 0.2 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC), however, was set for a dip from its record high. 
In Europe the single currency (EUR=) hit its highest level since May 15 at $1.1838, and traded up 0.4 percent at $1.1815 in its fourth straight session of gains. It helped drive the dollar index (DXY) down 0.4 percent to 93.295.
Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield  rose in step with the euro, breaching 0.50 percent for the first time in two weeks on signs that the European Central Bank could soon call an end to its stimulus program. 
The selloff in German Bunds spread across the Atlantic as the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield (US10YT=RR) hit a 2-1/2 week high of 2.9940 percent, edging closer to the 3 percent level it breached a month ago. 
The ECB's Chief Economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday that robust growth made the bank increasingly confident inflation was on its way back to target, raising chances it may reveal more about the end of the bond-buying program at next week's meeting.
Praet's comments took the market by surprise, given a recent slowdown in the euro zone economy. 
Data on Thursday showed German industrial orders plunged unexpectedly in April, a fourth consecutive monthly drop.
""It's a complex backdrop where ultimately the economy is not doing badly, but the economic surprises in Europe have not been to the upside,"" said Antoine Lesne, head of EMEA strategy and research at State Street's SPDR ETF.
""Bad momentum has eased the overall backdrop the ECB is navigating - but if you're looking at the broader macro picture it is still positive for risk assets.""
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said Praet's speech showed the central bank was willing to look through the recent soft patch in euro zone data.
TOO BULLISH?
The risk-on moves across markets coincided with a calendar of potentially destabilizing political events. 
The run-up to the G7 summit has been dominated by a widening divide over trade between U.S. President Trump and the club's remaining six members.
But gauges of investor anxiety, including stock volatility, showed little sign of strain, flummoxing some investors. 
The VIX, which measures volatility on the S&P 500 (VIX), was last trading at 11.79. It has fallen from more than 50 to less than 12 in just 83 days - a record decline, traders said. 
""I am amazed to see everyone so bullish,"" said Charles de Boissezon, deputy head of global asset allocation and equity strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). 
""Everyone assumes that ...central banks will be behind the curve by default, but it's not that obvious.""
Commodities continued to climb thanks to a still strong global economy and tight supply.
Copper  hit its highest level this year at $7,295 per tonne, driven up as much as 0.8 percent by supply concerns over disruption at the Escondida mine in Chile. It was on track for its sixth straight day of gains, its longest run since December. 
Oil prices also rose as plunging exports from OPEC member Venezuela crimped supply in the market.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) traded up 1.4 percent at $76.46 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) up 1 percent at $65.39. 
Gold prices edged higher, with spot gold  trading at $1,298.75 per ounce, up 0.2 percent.
In emerging markets, stocks (MSCIEF) climbed 0.4 percent to a three-week high, supported by the weaker dollar. UBS analysts declared ""buying time"" for emerging stocks, upgrading Mexico, Poland and Colombia, while downgrading Brazil.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 07:42AM ET</span>",IKEA to use only renewable and recycled materials by 2030,"By Anna Ringstrom
ALMHULT, Sweden (Reuters) - IKEA, the world's biggest furniture retailer, plans to use only renewable and recycled materials in its products by 2030, in the latest commitment by a global store group to reducing its impact on the environment. 
Inter IKEA, the owner of the brand best known for its low-cost flat-pack furniture, said on Thursday it aimed to reduce the climate impact of each of its products by more than two thirds by the end of next decade. 
Currently, 60 percent of the IKEA range is based on renewable materials, while nearly 10 percent contain recycled materials, an Inter IKEA spokeswoman said. 
""Through our size and reach we have the opportunity to inspire and enable more than one billion people to live better lives, within the limits of the planet,"" Inter IKEA CEO Torbjorn Loof said in a statement to accompany the group's 2030 sustainability strategy document.
""We are committed to taking the lead, working together with everyone – from raw material suppliers all the way to our customers and partners."" 
Inter IKEA joins a growing list of global companies striving to make their operations more environmentally sustainable, although there are question marks over whether enough are taking action and whether they should be doing more. 
The world's 250 biggest listed companies account for a third of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions, but few have concrete goals to limit rising temperatures, a Thomson Reuters Financial & Risk white paper concluded in October.
Inter IKEA's plan is the first to target all IKEA stores - the bulk of which are run by IKEA Group, but some of which are run by other franchisees - as well as the supply chain. 
In total, there are 418 IKEA stores across 49 markets. Retail sales in the year through August 2017 were a combined 38.3 billion euros ($45.3 billion).
Inter IKEA set a so-called science-based target to cut the climate impact of stores and other operations by 80 percent in absolute terms by 2030 compared with 2016. 
Global brands including H&M, Coca-Cola and Sony have also committed to science-based targets, which aim to help limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius - the goal set in the 2015 Paris agreement.
The Science Based Targets Initiative is a collaboration between the Carbon Disclosure Project, the World Resources Institute, the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the United Nations Global Compact. 
Inter IKEA also said it would remove all single-use plastic products from its range and in-store restaurants by 2020, and that IKEA Group would roll out the sale of home solar solutions to 29 markets by 2025.

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Fujifilm could walk away from Xerox deal if no progress for six months,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Fujifilm Holdings Corp (T:4901) said on Thursday it may have no choice but to abandon a $6.1 billion merger with  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX) if there is no progress in talks with the U.S. firm's new board for about half a year.
""I don't have a specific deadline in mind, but it should normally be from several months to six months. If we have nothing by then, it can't be helped,"" Chief Executive Shigetaka Komori said in his first media session since the U.S. photocopier company scrapped their merger deal.
A spokeswoman later clarified this meant Fujifilm could end merger talks.
Xerox could not be reached for comment.
The two companies in January agreed to a complex deal that would merge Xerox into their 56-year-old Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox, which Fujifilm would control with a 50.1 percent stake.
But Xerox scrapped the deal last month in a settlement with activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who opposed the takeover by Fujifilm saying it undervalued the U.S. company.
Fuji Xerox - 75 percent owned by Fujifilm - can grow on its own, but Xerox depends on Fuji Xerox to produce almost all of the U.S. firm's copier machines, Komori said.
Under the current joint venture agreement, Fuji Xerox is focused on Asia Pacific - the region with the highest growth potential - while Xerox covers the rest. The terms on regional coverage expire in March 2021.
Icahn and Deason, who together own about 15 percent of Xerox, had said they would consider an all-cash bid of at least $40 per share.
Fujifilm said the previously agreed deal valued Xerox at $8.6 billion, or an 8 percent premium over the average Xerox stock price of $29.7 per share over a month before the deal was announced. But the value would be higher if benefits from an estimated $1.7 billion worth of synergies is included.
Komori said Fujifilm is ""not opposed to considering any new proposal from the new Xerox board if it's beneficial for both firms,"" but the $40 per share sought by Icahn and Deason is ""too high"".
The typical premium offered in buyout deals is 30 percent but that would not be possible in this case, Komori said.
""We could procure funds, but many shareholders are demanding that money should be used on healthcare businesses,"" he said.

The photocopier business accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm's revenue and operating profit. The firm is seeking growth, however, through buying businesses involved in regenerative medicine and pharmaceuticals.

Gucci, the biggest earnings driver at French conglomerate Kering, did not outline a timeline for its ambition in a presentation posted on Kering's website. 
But it compares to 6.2 billion euros in annual revenue clocked up in 2017, making it the second biggest luxury label in the world behind LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton.
Gucci has so far defied expectations of a gradual slowdown, after its re-invention with a flamboyant new style under designer Alessandro Michele lifted sales. 
The brand added that it aimed to have an operating margin of above 40 percent, compared to around 34 percent in 2017.

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 06:28AM ET</span>","Whereabouts unknown,'Jho Low' offers to assist Malaysia's 1MDB-linked probe","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Elusive financier Low Taek Jho, wanted for questioning in a massive corruption probe focused on Malaysia's former prime minister Najib Razak, has offered to assist investigators, his spokesman said on Thursday.
Empowered by a new government elected last month, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has relaunched a probe into why $10.6 million from SRC International, a former unit of 1Malaysian Development Bhd, was transferred into Najib's bank account.
The amount is tiny compared with the billions of dollars that went missing from 1MDB, but the transfers from SRC were made through Malaysian entities making them easier for investigators to trace.
Anti-graft agents have questioned both Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansor, in the wake of his shock defeat in an election on May 9.
Low, popularly known as Jho Low, was regarded as close to Najib and his family and is regarded as a central figure in the 1MDB affair, having allegedly advised on investments and negotiated deals although he never held any official role in the fund.
The whereabouts of the portly, 37-year-old ethnic Chinese Malaysian has been a mystery since the scandal first erupted three years ago, though he has released statements at various times denying any culpability.
Prior to the scandal, Low had courted publicity by throwing parties attended by A-list Hollywood stars, famous models and celebrities.
The latest statement, issued by an international law firm quoted an unnamed spokesman and omitted any information on Low's location, but said he was ready to help the MACC with its inquiries having read media reports that the agency wanted to speak to him.
""Following this, Mr Low immediately instructed his lawyers to make contact with the MACC today with respect to offering such assistance,"" the spokesperson said, in a statement emailed by Kobre & Kim, a lawfirm with offices in the United States, Britain, the Caribbean and Asia.
Najib founded 1MDB in the early years of his near decade-long rule of Malaysia, and has consistently denied any wrongdoing at the fund.
The MACC had earlier issued a notice asking Low and one other person, SRC International director Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil Nik Othman Arif Kamil, to contact the agency immediately to assist in its investigation.
""The MACC urges anyone who has information or knows both individuals to contact the investigating officer...or the nearest MACC office,"" the commission said.
Scandalised by the scale of the alleged corruption, Malaysians dumped Najib out of office on May 9 in an election that also spelt an end to six decades of unbroken rule by a multi-ethnic coalition led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).
The new government led by 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, who came out of retirement, quit UMNO, and joined the opposition to topple Najib, has vowed to get 1MDB's money back and punish whoever looted the fund.
One of Mahathir's first acts was to bar Najib and his wife from leaving Malaysia, and police have raided apartments linked to the former first couple.
The money trail from 1MDB has led to investigations in half a dozen countries, including the United States where the Department of Justice (DoJ) has made it the biggest probe launched under its anti-kleptocracy program.
Low has been named along with Najib's stepson Riza Aziz in civil lawsuits filed by the DoJ, which alleged that about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB.
Filings by the DoJ also alleged that Low had used funds stolen from 1MDB to arrange for the purchase of nearly $30 million worth of jewelry, including a rare 22-carat diamond set in a necklace, for Najib's wife. 
The DoJ is seeking to seize about $1.7 billion worth of 1MDB-linked assets, including a $250 million super-yacht said to have been purchased by Low. It is also pursuing a criminal probe.

The fashion company did not outline a timeline for its ambition in a presentation posted on Kering's website. More details of its strategy update were due to be released later on Thursday. 
But it compares to 6.2 billion euros in annual revenue clocked up in 2017, when it came behind LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton as the second biggest luxury label in the world. 
Gucci has so far defied expectations of a gradual slowdown, after its re-invention with a flamboyant new style under designer Alessandro Michele lifted sales. 
The brand added that it aimed to have an operating margin of more than 40 percent, compared to around 34 percent in 2017.
Gucci's challenges include ensuring its kooky style will keep customers coming back, as it develops a following for high-margin items like leather handbags. 
Gucci CEO Marco Bizarri and Michele, who both came on board in 2015, gave the brand a top-to-bottom makeover, with new product ranges. 
Stores were redesigned to make them more welcoming, in vivid hues and draped in velvet; resources were ploughed into online sales, including an e-commerce site in China last year which has helped fuel sales growth. 
Gucci said on Thursday it would continue to invest in e-commerce, and aimed to further lift sales densities - a measure of how profitable its stores are. 
These could eventually reach 45,000 euros by square meter on an annual basis, from just over 30,000 euros in 2017, according to the presentation.

More affordable labels have long produced bags, scarves, clothes and shoes in southeastern Europe, but margins are becoming slimmer as Balkan companies jostle for that business with China, Turkey and, increasingly, Africa.
The luxury sector is expected to grow up to 5 percent this year, outpacing fashion as a whole, encouraging southeastern Europe to focus its efforts on attracting more upmarket clients alongside competitors such as Portugal.
""In the more luxury segment you make fewer pieces but they are more profitable, which is why we are now targeting them,"" Hristova said at her factory in Rousse, where some 40 workers stitch dresses, women's tops and trench coats.
She said orders and inquiries from top brands were increasing and she has invested in machines to do the specialized stitches, buttons and ironing they demand alongside hand sewing, which is sometimes done through contractors.
She is also installing a fitness room, new bathrooms and renovating the canteen to hold on to workers tempted by higher paying jobs elsewhere as Bulgaria's economy grows.
For the brands, the cost advantage of nearby countries with the lowest wages in the European Union is not the only factor in an era where word of lapses in quality or poor working conditions spreads fast.
""Convenience and proximity are only two of the precise criteria used by the Group to pick its suppliers; the essential requirements are quality, reliability and the respect of company conduct codes,"" said Italy's Armani, which confirmed it had some suppliers in eastern Europe.
NO JUMPSTART
While top French and Italian luxury houses have experimented with manufacturing outside their home base for years now, it is often for more basic garments such as branded T-shirts.
But the need for small batches of work, done fast, to exacting standards, is growing.
Gone are the days when everything was geared towards a few pre-seasonal catwalk shows giving them months to roll out their collections. Now they depend on social media influencers whose audience is spoilt for choice and hungry for something new.
""You need different producers, more capacities with shorter lead times,"" said Achim Berg, head of global apparel, fashion and luxury practice for management consultants McKinsey.
Almost 80 percent of 200 luxury industry executives it surveyed saw proximity sourcing as a growing trend. It said luxury fashion is expected to grow four to five percent this year, compared with 3.5-4.5 percent rise for fashion as a whole. 
""This is benefiting local producers in the southeastern European region,"" Berg said.
Contracts for the assembly of parts or all of more intricate or big ticket items are on the increase, but brands are not always open about what, and how much, is produced abroad.
Italian down coat maker Moncler (L:MONC), which is pioneering faster production times in the luxury world with monthly launches of limited editions, invested around 5 million euros to set up its own manufacturing plant in Romania in 2016.
It accounts for some 20 percent of its puffer production and will be a research and development centre, CEO Remo Ruffini said.
Hristova declined to give details of what she produced, citing confidentiality agreements. The website of her company, MIK-BG, lists Givenchy and Kenzo, two labels owned by Paris-based luxury conglomerate LVMH's (PA:LVMH). LVMH did not respond to requests to comment.
It was two years ago, she said, when designer brands, often working through French agents place, began placing small orders on more basic items and conducting spot checks on workmanship.
""There is no way to jumpstart with the luxury brands. You start with the lower end, once you prove yourself and deliver on the quality they demand, then you start to receive a higher class of clothes,"" she said, citing production times of four to six weeks.
Mihai Tincu, who runs one of Romania's biggest clothing manufacturers, Rapsodia Conf, said luxury goods firms deliver materials for it to assemble and orders were getting bigger, mentioning Italy's Prada (HK:1913) and French fashion house Maison Margiela.
Prada declined to comment while Maison Margiela said 90 percent of its products were made in Italy with the rest elsewhere, including Romania.
Tincu said his was not the only firm working on the luxury front. ""There are other, smaller production outlets in the (northeastern) Botosani county that produce everything from shirts to suits for the world's majors.""
SKILL SHORTAGE
Clothing exports have been growing strongly in Romania and Bulgaria for years but cost pressures are showing.
In Romania they were 2.6 billion last year, Eurostat data shows, a seven percent dip from a record high the previous year, while Bulgaria exported 1.5 billion euros-worth, a slight dip from its record high a year earlier. Exports from Croatia and Slovenia were much smaller but on the rise.
Bulgarian Association of Apparel and Textile Producers and Exporters chief Radina Bankova said salaries were becoming less competitive, a problem for the textile industry across Europe.
In the first six months of last year, 4,000 people quit the sector, leaving around 88,000, just over half the number a decade ago. ""It is called light industry but it is not light at all. People need a lot of skills. And the people with the right set of skills are getting close to retiring age,"" Hristova said.
Hence the drive upmarket where margins were better.
""If a dress takes 100 minutes to make, the cost is 16 euros for mid-range and 40 euros for luxury brands, she said, adding the mantle of cheap clothing supplier, once held by Bulgaria, had long since moved to China and would shift again. ""The next Bulgaria will be somewhere in Africa, most probably,"" she said.
Bankova listed Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss as companies producing in Bulgaria. Versace said some of its Versus and Versace Collection products were manufactured through suppliers in countries including Bulgaria and Romania. Hugo Boss said it was working with six suppliers in Bulgaria.
Portugal also targets the luxury end. Its clothing exports rose some three percent last year to an all time high of 3.2 billion euros, according to Eurostat.
The head of the Textile and Clothing Association, Paulo Vaz, said while Portuguese salaries were higher than in eastern Europe they were half those in France or Italy and cited lead times of two to five weeks.

(Reuters) - Honolulu could become the first U.S. city to limit fares ride-hailing companies can charge when demand spikes, following a city council vote on Wednesday, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspaper reported. 
Ride-hailing companies such as Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Lyft Inc use a model known as ""surge pricing"" in which the fare for a ride rises when factors such as rush hour and bad weather increase demand for the service. 
The practice could be limited in the future in Hawaii's largest city after the Honolulu City Council approved by a 6-3 vote a bill requiring city officials to cap surge pricing by ride-hailing companies, the newspaper reported. 
For the bill to become law, however, it still needs to be signed by the Mayor Kirk Caldwell, whose administration appears to oppose the measure, Hawaiinewsnow.com reported. 
The city Department of Customer Service said it opposed the measure because ride-hailing company customers already know the fare they will be charged, which is not the case with taxi cabs, the news website reported. 
Uber also made the case that riders know the fare upfront the Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspaper reported, citing a statement from the company. If the measure goes into effect, it would also restrict innovation, limit choice and could jeopardize availability of Uber service on the island, the company said. 
The measure ""is a solution in search of a problem, as we've been told the City hasn't received a single consumer complaint about our dynamic pricing model,"" Tabatha Chow, a senior operations manager, was quoted as saying in the statement. 

Last month, officials from Uber and Lyft Uber told council members that a cap on fares would be the first such limitation imposed in the United States, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.

1402,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",What Brexit? Investors warm to UK stocks as M&A surges,"By Kit Rees
LONDON (Reuters) - Despite a torrid start to 2018 and with Brexit uncertainties looming large, British blue-chip stocks have jumped to record highs thanks to a weak pound, a torrent of mergers and acquisitions, and bouts of political anxiety in the euro zone. 
The benchmark FTSE 100 and mid cap 250 index both bounced back in May from lows hit in March, undaunted by two critical Brexit-related events - a vote on the European Union withdrawal bill in parliament next week and a summit of the bloc's leaders at the end of this month. 
Investors are reconsidering the attractions of UK-listed equities relative to those in the euro zone for a combination of reasons. Sterling remains almost 10 percent below where it was before Britons voted to leave the EU in 2016, helping exporters and boosting London-listed firms' foreign earnings.
On top of that expectations of a long-awaited interest rate increase by the Bank of England are receding and stock valuations are relatively attractive. The disproportionate weighting in FTSE indexes of energy and mining firms has also helped due to buoyant global oil and metals prices.
At the same time, the re-emergence of political uncertainty in Italy and Spain has encouraged investors to reassess their euro zone holdings.
While euro zone stocks ended May with a 2.5 percent loss, the FTSE 100 was the best regional performer, gaining 2.2 percent and returning to positive territory for the year. It was down as much as 10 percent as recently as March.
In some respects, the FTSE is playing catch-up as it underperformed both continental European and U.S. stocks last year. But many investors who have been underweight UK stocks for some time have reconsidered relative positioning, regardless of Brexit and its uncertain consequences. 
""The UK was more or less ticking all of the negative boxes which is why so many fund managers were underweight,"" Fabrice Theveneau, head of equities at Lyxor Asset Management, said.
""Now it is progressively changing,"" he added, saying in a recent interview that his Lyxor Sustainable Equity Europe fund has been reducing its underweight position on the UK market.
May saw the biggest back-to-back monthly increases in allocation to UK equities since before the Brexit vote, despite remaining ""the consensus short"", according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's latest fund manager survey. 
BAML's cross asset strategists have also rotated out of Europe and into British equities, which they see as a better bet in the later stages of an economic expansion thanks to the London market's large weighting in energy, materials and defensive stocks such as health and consumer staples firms. 
DIVORCE TALKS
British equities have had a tough time amid uncertainty surrounding the EU divorce talks. So far 2018 has seen the demise of outsourcer Carillion as well as troubles for high street stalwarts Mothercare, Carpetright and Debenhams, to name a few, as inflation puts pressure on consumer spending.
The comeback has been driven, or at least accompanied, by a flurry of M&A activity. This has hit an all-time year-to-date record in 2018 with the total value of UK deals standing at just over $260 billion, according to data from the Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence team.

Overseas buyers have been lured by the weak pound, with Takeda of Japan acquiring pharma firm Shire for $62 billion.
British supermarket Sainsbury's is also planning a $10 billion acquisition of Walmart's UK-based Asda, and banking group CYBG has bid for rival Virgin Money (LON:VM).
Last month shares of IWG rocketed after the serviced office provider said it had received takeover approaches from three suitors, while on Tuesday Rupert Murdoch's Fox received approval to buy Sky on condition it sold Sky News.
Theveneau said Lyxor Asset Management's biggest overall position in its portfolios is in Shire. 
Some big names have also tempered their sell recommendations on UK equities.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) upgraded its view in May, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Citi and UBS Wealth Management all lifted their recommendations for UK stocks in April.
Justin Onuekwusi, multi-asset fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management, says his firm too has been reducing its underweight in UK stocks in its Multi-Index funds, although for risk-management reasons. Overall, Onuekwusi says that he is not all that positive on UK equities on a medium-term perspective.
""You've got Brexit hanging over the UK, and although we can debate the impact on long-term earnings of UK companies, the immediate transition mechanism for Brexit risk will be through the currency,"" said Onuekwusi.
""We expect sterling to continue to be volatile if there is uncertainty and that in turn will have an impact on the UK stock market.""
But some investors are hoping the worst is now over.
""Over the last two years domestic UK - particularly retail - has come under pressure in stock market terms (with) lots of profits warnings and a few high-profile casualties,"" Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of Europe equity strategy at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, said. ""We think there's scope for that to improve this year.""

Convertible bonds grant holders the right to exchange them for equity above a pre-established price, giving the company scope to reduce coupon payments on the debt.
The company said on Thursday the private placement of senior unsecured notes due 2024 was priced at a 0.25 percent coupon.
The offering is expected to result in about $989 million in net proceeds and settle on June 11, the company said.
There have been 22 convertible offerings by technology companies this year, raising in total almost $9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters IFR.
""The stock price has certainly turned around from where it was last year. ... The momentum in the stock may give investors a reason to at least look at this deal,"" said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
Twitter is taking advantage of strong investor demand for convertible bonds, which allow investors a downside-protected way to participate in the stock. Twitter's stock would need to rise to $77.64 before investors would be eligible to convert into the underlying stock.
The shares closed at $40.10 on Wednesday.
""We assume the main purpose of the new convert will be to pay off the old one,"" wrote Dave King, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.
Concerns about the prospect of more shares coming onto the market sent Twitter's stock down about 2 percent in premarket trade before a recovery that saw it extend Tuesday's rally.
Twitter's 0.25 percent coupon and 42.5 percent conversion premium compare with the 0.125 percent to 0.625 percent and 40 percent to 45 percent respective marketing ranges, sources told IFR on Wednesday.
That would put it at the higher end of recent conversion premiums. Only three of the 22 technology companies that issued convertible bonds this year were in that high range, according to IFR.
This is a popular strategy that other tech companies have used to offset dilution to very high share prices. For instance, financial payments processor Square (N:SQ) last month raised $862.5 million on the sale of a five-year convertible with a conversion premium of 42.5 percent.
Twitter said it will use net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to purchase call spread options to offset future dilution and to repurchase part of a convertible that matures in 2019.
That was part of a two-part convertible issue that Twitter sold in September 2014, comprised of five-year and seven-year tranches, according to IFR data.
""The timing of a convertible bond deal with the company’s entrance into the S&P 500 makes sense,"" said King. ""There will likely be a strong bid for the stock from index funds.""
King said this could offset selling pressure from convertible arbitrageurs trying to establish short positions in Twitter in anticipation of going long on the new convertible bond.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JP Morgan are expected to price the deal later on Wednesday, according to IFR.

(Reuters) - Australia's biggest wealth manager, AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) on Thursday said it faced a fourth class-action lawsuit for allegedly charging fees for services not provided, sending the company's shares to their lowest in more than six years.
Slater and Gordon is suing AMP for wrongfully charging customers citing administrative errors or oversights, when in fact AMP knew they arose from deliberate business practices that had been in place for a long time. 
Three law firms have already filed shareholder class actions against the 169-year old company, amid damaging revelations from a government-ordered inquiry into the financial industry.
""AMP has been served with a class action proceeding filed in the Federal Court (Victorian registry) by Slater and Gordon,"" Catherine Woods, head of media relations at AMP, told Reuters in an email. ""AMP is vigorously defending all proceedings.""
Last month media said two more law firms were considering suing the wealth manager. If all five file suits, they would be the most class actions against an Australian company at one time.
AMP shares were on track for their fifth straight session of declines, down as much as 3 percent at A$3.62, their lowest since Aug 2011.
In a tough year for AMP, three directors quit in May after the departure of its chairman, chief executive and in-house lawyer. The resignations followed revelations at the inquiry that the once-venerable firm had lied to regulators, allegedly doctored an independent report, and charged customers fees for no service.
On May 18, Slater and Gordon and Therium said they would offer shareholder claimants the most competitive funding package of all of the class actions announced against AMP till then.
Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, Melbourne-based firm Phi Finney McDonald and Maurice Blackburn have also filed suits against the Australian wealth manager on behalf of shareholders.

A case management hearing on the class action by Phi Finney McDonald in Melbourne is set for Thursday.

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 12:03AM ET</span>","Daimler fights Tesla, VW with new electric big rig truck","By Eric M. Johnson and Ilona Wissenbach
PORTLAND, Ore./FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) unveiled on Wednesday an all-electric big rig truck it promises to have in production in 2021, as the German automaker mounts a major challenge to European and American rivals, including new entrants like Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
Truck buyers anticipate global regulation to curb pollution from trucks and see advantages from lower fuel and maintenance costs of electric vehicles, but a fleet technology switch is far from certain given challenges of cost, charging infrastructure, range, and the potential for heavy batteries to constrict payloads. 
Daimler's Freightliner eCascadia is an 18-wheeler with a 250-mile (400 km) range, aimed for regional distribution and port services, while Tesla has said that its Semi - which it expects to build by 2020 - will be suited to longer-distance runs with a 500-mile range.
Daimler on Wednesday also unveiled a medium-duty Freightliner eM2 106, with a range of up to 230 miles, designed for local distribution, such as beverage delivery, which some analysts see as the ""sweet spot"" of the emerging electric truck market.
Daimler said it will deliver a total of 30 prototypes on the two models to customers later this year for field-testing and expects to have the trucks in production in 2021.
Daimler, as the world's largest truck maker, has much to lose as competition for electrified trucks intensifies.
The company's Illinois-based rival,  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV), and its partner Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), which is spending $1.7 billion on electric drives, autonomous vehicles and cloud-based systems by 2022, aim to launch their own medium-duty truck in North America by late 2019.
Daimler, with a $66.4 billion market capitalization and best-known for its luxury Mercedes-Benz brand, has a 40 percent share of the roughly $39 billion North American heavy-duty truck market. 
Local delivery ""makes an enormous amount of sense because it doesn't have the long-range requirements, yet puts on enough miles on a daily basis where you can get fuel savings,"" said Tim Denoyer, a senior analyst at consultancy ACT Research.
CRUCIAL BATTERIES
Success for the larger class 8 trucks would hinge on lowering battery costs: ""While electric truck sales will be fairly significant in coming years, I don't think it will displace diesel anytime soon especially in highway, long-haul trucking where obviously battery capacity and range anxiety present itself,"" Denoyer said. 
The company will use batteries from German firm Akasol, a spokesman for Daimler told Reuters. No final sourcing decisions on batteries have been made, however, he said.
Akasol buys lithium cells and adapts them to battery systems used by bus makers Daimler and Volvo among others as well as in industrial vehicles, locomotives and ships. Reuters reported earlier this week, citing sources, that Akasol is preparing for a Frankfurt stock market listing before the summer break.
Daimler Trucks North America Chief Executive Officer Roger Nielsen said the truck's payload had been curbed by the size of batteries.
""Overall, this is an ideal application for customers whose routes have a distinct radius and whose operating model provides time for battery recharge,"" he said.
A heavy-duty commercial truck runs up to 100,000 miles a year, and Tesla has promised a 20-percent saving on current per-mile operating costs, to some skepticism.
Tesla also has more than 450 reservations for its truck and expects to have a head start, although its plans are still developing and the roll-out of its Model 3 sedan has been plagued by production problems. CEO Elon Musk plans to start production in 2020 but there is no Tesla truck factory yet.
Martin Daum, head of Daimler's trucks and buses divisions, took a jab at Tesla when asked during an interview with Reuters whether Daimler would start accepting truck reservations with cash down payments, as Tesla does to raise funds.
""We don't need the down payments to finance our investments,"" Daum said after flashing a smile. ""We give (customers) prototypes. We don't charge for that. It's gaining knowledge on their side, as well as on our side. Then we sell the trucks and then we deliver the trucks. We don't need any pre-orders."" 
Daimler also announced a new research and development center for autonomous driving in Portland, which will work with existing facilities in Stuttgart, Germany, and Bangalore, India on getting self-driving freight trucks on the road.
Stuttgart-based Daimler will invest more than 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in R&D at its truck operations by 2019, with more than 500 million euros earmarked for electric heavy-duty commercial vehicles, connectivity and self-driving technology.
Daimler Trucks expects a strong second half of the year but second-quarter business remains challenging, finance chief Jochen Goetz said, citing problems in the supply chain. He also said the truckmaker would focus on executing its previous savings plan and aim to lower costs by 1.4 billion euros as planned by 2019.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>","Stung by compliance costs, Asia banks urge watchdogs to approve more fintech","By Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Regulators need to do more to allow new technologies that could help in the fight against money laundering, as financial institutions are struggling with ever-growing compliance costs, an Asia finance industry group said on Thursday.
Banks have been slapped with vast sums for not preventing money being laundered through their accounts, and the call for action comes after Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) last week was fined a record US$530 million for breaching money laundering and terror financing laws.
The Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said it would like to see greater use of new technologies in ""know your client"" or KYC anti-money laundering checks, as they promise to drastically cut costs.
""Fintech solutions, facial recognition for example, hold out great hope for the industry, but haven’t been embraced as quickly as some might like by regulators around the world,"" said Mark Austen, chief executive of the association.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Monetary Authority of Singapore said last year they were exploring whether KYC utilities, central repositories of data that banks can tap to save duplication when adding new clients, should be set up.
But the process is taking time amid concerns about who would have liability when data was wrong.
Grappling with compliance and the costs involved has become a onerous task for most banks and brokerages. In 2017, the number of employees working on KYC compliance in financial institutions reached an average of 307, jumping from just 68 a year earlier, the association said in its report.
HSBC (L:HSBA) alone spent $3 billion last year on compliance. It tripled its compliance headcount between 2013 and 2017 and now employs 8,600 compliance staff.
""Whether KYC and AML (anti-money laundering) headcount will fall comes down to whether the institutions can automate - there are a lot trying to as it means they can cut costs and probably actually improve compliance,"" Austen added.
The association called on its members to help regulators understand developments and harmonize standards as different KYC rules across the region raised costs for cross-border financial groups, who were also interpreting those rules in different ways.
""It would be good if financial institutions in Asia at least all thought about the issues around KYC in a similar way,"" said Will Haslet, partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, which contributed to the report.
""When we talk about the longer term solution of technology, consistency is necessary.""

The announcement from Macau's monetary authority late on Wednesday adds to a series of measures being implemented in the Chinese territory as it cracks down on such ""illegal acts"".
The warning to banks came after pawn shops operating in Macau casinos had their UnionPay point-of-sale terminals removed, state broadcaster TDM said this week. 
Macau's gambling industry has revenues of about $3 billion a month. 
A 2014 Reuters investigation found that many mainland Chinese used UnionPay cards to circumvent cash withdrawal limits of 20,000 yuan ($3,200) a day, and either use that money to gamble or transfer it abroad.
Typically, a customer in Macau can go to one of nearly 200 pawn shops inside casinos or on the streets that sell watches or jewelery, and swipe their card to get cash without buying anything, skirting capital controls.
The removal of the point-of-sales machines by Macau banks means that pawn shops inside the casinos are now no longer offering UnionPay cash-back services. 
The Monetary Authority said banks needed to undertake ""ongoing monitoring of the merchants"" in order to prevent the use of point-of-sales (POS) machines ""to conduct illegal activities"".
Union Pay was not immediately available for comment. 
Industry estimates put the monthly withdrawal volume at HK$ 10 billion ($1.27 billion) from ATMs in Macau prior to the introduction of the facial recognition technology.
Only banks, the Postal Savings Office, money changers and remittance companies can provide money exchange and/or remittance services to the public, the authority said, adding that the provision of financial services by other individuals or shops was a ""legal violation"". 
""The impact on gaming demand is difficult to estimate, but it can't be good in our view as it could at least be a modest negative on player psychology if not their abilities to source funds,"" said DS Kim, an analyst at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong.

Icahn's intentions are not clear, though he has been a longtime supporter of Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders, pushing for him in 2013 to become CEO of Forest Laboratories, which through mergers and acquisitions became Allergan.
Icahn, who had invested in Allergan in the past, believes the company's stock is undervalued, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Icahn did not respond to a request for comment. 
""We welcome all investments in the company,"" Allergan spokeswoman Amy Rose said.
Bloomberg News first reported on Icahn's new position in Allergan.
Earlier this week, investment firms Appaloosa LP and Senator Investment Group LP wrote a letter to Allergan's board of directors urging it not to pursue transformative acquisitions but instead shake up its board, including separating the roles of CEO and chairman, which are both held by Saunders. 
The letter came shortly after Allergan said it had concluded a strategic review it launched earlier this year. 
As a result of the review, Allergan is exploring divesting its women's health and infectious disease businesses, opting to focus on areas where it has strong leadership positions. 
It also said it would pursue a more disciplined capital allocation strategy. 
Icahn last showed his support for Saunders in 2016, when he unveiled a stake in Allergan after its planned $150 billion sale to  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) was shot down by changes the U.S. government implemented to the rules on corporate tax inversions. 
In 2016, Allergan sold its generic drug business to Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $40 billion. In April, Allergan said it was considering an offer for rare disease drug maker  Shire  Plc (L:SHP), only to reverse course after Allergan shares plummeted on the news.

It has spent much of the money on stock buybacks, debt reduction and a series of small-to-midsized acquisitions, including medical technology company ZELTIQ Aesthetics Inc and drugmaker Tobira Therapeutics.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 06:43PM ET</span>",Repeat after me: Social Security and Medicare are not insolvent,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - It happens like clockwork each year. The trustees of Social Security and Medicare issue their annual reports on the programs’ health, and doomsayers start talking about insolvency and bankruptcy.
This year is no exception. The reports issued on Tuesday yielded wildly inaccurate news stories  - amplified by the social media echo chamber - suggesting that Medicare and Social Security are headed for insolvency in the not-too-distant future - meaning that they would not be able to pay out the money owed for benefits.
It is true that Social Security and Medicare face financial challenges. But neither is headed for insolvency, bankruptcy or other dire futures. How do I know this? By taking a careful look at the trustee reports - and by considering the various parts of both programs, which have different funding sources and face different challenges.
The trustee reports are the most authoritative sources on the long-term health of both programs. Under federal law, the boards of trustees of both Medicare and Social Security report to Congress each year on the status and long-term financial prospects of each program. The reports are prepared by the professional actuaries who have made careers out of managing the numbers and are signed by three Cabinet secretaries, and the program commissioners.
Social Security and Medicare also are supposed to have two publicly appointed trustees – one Republican, one Democrat - who sign off on the reports. But these spots have been vacant for nearly three years, robbing the reports of key independent oversight and nicking their credibility.
This year, the Social Security trustees report that the combined trust funds for retirement and disability will be depleted in 2034, unchanged from last year’s forecast. That is a problem that needs to be addressed, because if nothing is done, Social Security would be able to pay out only 77 percent of promised benefits from current tax revenue.
In other words, retirees - and future retirees - would lose nearly a quarter of their benefits. But that is not insolvency, and solutions are readily available to avoid that unacceptable outcome. Conservatives favor benefit cuts via higher retirement ages, more means-testing and a less generous annual cost-of-living adjustment. Progressives advocate gradually increasing payroll taxes and lifting the cap on taxable benefits. Considering that middle-class households depend mainly on Social Security for support in retirement, it would be wiser to follow the progressive agenda. (https://reut.rs/2kMIaAU)
SELF-INFLICTED POLICY WOUNDS
Medicare is not spinning out of control, either. The trustees report that one component - the Hospital Insurance trust fund (Part A of Medicare) - will be depleted in 2026, three years earlier than predicted last year. Part A is the only component of Medicare that is prepaid - it is funded mainly through the 2.9 percent payroll tax split by workers and employers. 
The dates of projected depletion tend to bounce around, and trustees note that even if exhaustion occurred in 2026, Medicare would still be able to pay 91 percent of promised benefits. The problem could be addressed by increasing tax rates or by reducing program costs; the trustees estimate that cutting costs by 17 percent could put the fund back in balance.
But expense growth has not been the key issue lately in the hospital trust fund - spending growth has been stable. “Predominantly, the issue is revenue,” Paul Spitalnic, Medicare’s chief actuary, said on Wednesday at a forum on the report at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative think tank.
Instead, Medicare’s trustees blame the more sobering projections on several factors, most related to revenue. Payroll tax revenue is falling due to greater-than-expected weakness in wage growth.
Other causes are self-inflicted policy wounds, rather than shortcomings of Medicare itself. For example, the recently enacted tax law is reducing income taxes on Social Security benefits, some of which go to the HI trust fund. Repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate is increasing the number of uninsured Americans, and driving up Medicare payments for uncompensated care. Congress also has repealed the ACA-created Independent Payment Advisory Board, a review group empowered to put the brakes on excessive cost growth in Medicare. 
Moreover, focusing only on Part A misses the bigger story on Medicare. Part B (outpatient services) and Part D (prescription drugs) are funded through a combination of general revenue and premiums paid by beneficiaries. Rising spending in the program does increase pressure on government spending and retiree pocketbooks, but the contributions are adjusted annually, so their ability to pay benefits is never in question.
Conservative policy experts acknowledge that terms like ""insolvency"" are tossed around carelessly.
“The media has an unfortunate tendency to focus on the hospital insurance fund without considering the bigger picture,” said Robert Moffit, senior fellow in the Heritage Foundation's Center for Health Policy Studies, speaking at the same AEI forum. 
""Saying that Medicare is going bankrupt is not a rational description of what is happening,” he added. ""The hospital fund hasn’t gone bankrupt in the last half century, and I can’t imagine it will in the next half century.""
Medicare and Social Security both face financial challenges that need fixing. But carelessly tossing around inaccurate words like ""insolvency"" creates needless worry for workers and retirees who count on these programs. The solutions are readily available whenever politicians and policymakers decide it is time to act.

1414,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 06:39PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers press Facebook over Chinese data sharing,"By David Shepardson and David Ingram
WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) faced criticism on Wednesday from Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers who demanded that the social media company be more forthcoming about data it has shared with four Chinese firms. 
The bipartisan criticism reflected rising frustration in Congress about how Facebook protects the privacy of the more than 2 billion people who use its services worldwide.
The leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee accused Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg of failing to disclose the company's agreements with the Chinese firms when he appeared before them in April and testified about Facebook's sharing of users' personal information with third parties. 
""Clearly, the company's partnerships with Chinese technology companies and others should have been disclosed before Congress and the American people,"" the panel's Republican chairman, Greg Walden, and top Democrat Frank Pallone said in a statement. 
""We strongly encourage full transparency from Facebook and the entire tech community,"" they wrote. 
Facebook responded that Zuckerberg spent more than 10 hours responding to lawmakers' questions. 
""The arrangements in question had been highly visible for years - with many manufacturers advertising these features. But with fewer and fewer people relying on them, we proactively announced this spring we'd begin winding them down,"" the company said in a statement. 
Facebook has said that the contracts with smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and other Chinese firms were standard industry practice and necessary to ensure that people who bought electronic devices had ready access to Facebook services. 
Facebook said it had control over the data sharing all along and that other tech firms struck similar arrangements with U.S. and Chinese companies in the early days of smartphones. 
Facebook shares closed down nearly 1 percent in New York.
On Tuesday, Facebook said Huawei, computer maker Lenovo Group and smartphone makers OPPO and TCL Corp were among about 60 companies worldwide that received access to some user data after they signed contracts to re-create Facebook-like experiences for their users.
Huawei, the world's third-largest smartphone maker, has come under scrutiny from U.S. intelligence agencies that have said that Chinese telecommunications companies provide an opportunity for foreign espionage and threaten critical U.S. infrastructure, something the Chinese have denied.
Huawei said in a statement, ""Like all leading smartphone providers, Huawei worked with Facebook to make Facebook's service more convenient for users. Huawei has never collected or stored any Facebook user data.""
Francisco Varela, Facebook's vice president of mobile partnerships, said on Tuesday the user data in question was stored on people's devices, not on Huawei's company servers.
Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter, ""Mark Zuckerberg needs to return to Congress and testify why @facebook shared Americans' private information with questionable Chinese companies."" 
Republican Senator Marco Rubio asked on Twitter, ""why didn't @facebook just reveal this data sharing deal with #Huawei months ago? And don't compare this to deals with other telecomms. S.Korea govt doesnt control or use @Samsung the way China controls & uses Huawei.""
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman had no comment. 
Lawmakers expressed concern after The New York Times reported that the data of users' friends could have been accessed without their explicit consent. Facebook denied that, and said the data access was to allow its users to access account features on mobile devices.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which reached a settlement with Facebook in 2011 over its information-sharing practices, declined comment.
In a separate letter on Tuesday, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee pressed Facebook for more information, while the Senate Intelligence Committee's top Democrat urged Facebook to release further details. Facebook said it would address the commerce panel's questions. 
Congressional aides have said Facebook has not answered hundreds of questions from lawmakers after Zuckerberg's April testimony before two committees. Several aides said lawmakers were waiting for Facebook's answers before deciding on whether to hold additional hearings.
Facebook has said that other companies that have used its data sharing include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), HTC Corp,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd.
Several countries are scrutinizing Facebook after it failed to protect the data of some 87 million users that was shared with now-defunct political data firm Cambridge Analytica.

(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT) on Wednesday settled a lawsuit by a transgender former employee in North Carolina who accused the retail giant of unlawfully firing her for complaining about harassment.
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart and the plaintiff, Charlene Bost, did not disclose the terms of the settlement in a joint filing agreeing to dismiss the case in federal court in Greensboro, North Carolina. The company did not admit to wrongdoing. 
Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company does not tolerate discrimination.
""While we have strong anti-discrimination policies, we are glad we could resolve this matter with Ms. Bost,"" he said. 
The Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, a nonprofit that represents Bost, said she was pleased with the settlement. 
Bost sued Wal-Mart in December, claiming her coworkers at a Kannapolis, North Carolina, Sam's Club store called her “sir,” “that thing with an attitude” and “shim,” a slur combining “she” and “him.” She also said her male boss subjected her to unwanted physical advances and referred to her as “it.”
Wal-Mart owns Sam's Club. 
Bost started working at the store in March 2004, and began presenting as a woman at work in 2008, according to her lawsuit.
Bost said she was fired in March 2015 in retaliation for complaining to supervisors about harassment, and because they believed that she suffered from “gender dysphoria,” or distress with the sex she was assigned at birth.
She accused Wal-Mart of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on sex, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
When the lawsuit was filed, the TLDEF said that companies like Wal-Mart should not only have strong anti-discrimination policies, but also make sure they are enforced.
The case is Bost v. Sam’s East Inc, U.S. District Court, Middle District of North Carolina, No. 17-01148.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street indexes rallied on Wednesday with help from financial stocks as investors eyed strong economic data and trade war fears took a back seat while the Nasdaq registered its third straight record closing high. 
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late in the trading day that U.S. President Donald Trump will meet French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a G7 summit this week.
While he said Trump is not backing down from the tough line he has taken on trade, the comments appeared to calm investors. 
Earlier reports citing sources said U.S. officials were weighing an offer by China to import an extra $70 billion of American goods over a year as Beijing tries to defuse a potential trade war.
""The trade rhetoric has once again dialed back,"" said Mona Mahajan, U.S. Investment Strategist, Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, New York. ""It's the on-again off-again threat of protectionism. It's off again."" 
Trump last week pushed on with imposing tariffs - 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum - on Canada, the EU and Mexico, with Mexico retaliating by putting tariffs on American products such as steel, pork and bourbon.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 346.41 points, or 1.4 percent, to 25,146.39, the S&P 500 gained 23.55 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,772.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added 51.38 points, or 0.67 percent, to 7,689.24.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to a near two-week high after data showed that the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly fell to a seven-month low in April, supporting the view of an acceleration of domestic economic growth in the second quarter. [US/] 
The S&P financial sector, which rose 1.8 percent, was the S&P's biggest boost as bank stocks rose along with Treasury yields. Higher interest rates tend to help bank profits. The bank index rose 2.3 percent as the sector was also helped by a rise in mortgage applications for the first time in seven weeks. 
Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois cited economic data and trade news as reasons for the broader market's advance. 
Nasdaq's biggest boost was from Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), whose shares rose 3.8 percent. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares jumped 9.7 percent after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk reassured shareholders that building 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3 cars per week by the end of June was ""quite likely"".
While the technology sector reversed earlier losses to end the session with a 0.5 percent gain, it lagged the broader S&P as well as sectors such as financials. 
""That to me smacks of a rotation to value from growth,"" said Oakbook's Sampson. 
The utilities index was the only one of the S&P's 11 major sectors in the red, with a 2.1 percent decline.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was the biggest drag on the tech sector with a 0.8 percent drop after the social networking company confirmed it collaborated with at least four Chinese companies on sharing user data.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 57 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 278 new highs and 24 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 6.88 billion shares changed hands, compared to the 6.64 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Lundbeck (CO:LUN) said on Wednesday that it will pay $52.6 million to resolve a U.S. probe into its financial support of patient assistance charitable foundations.
The company, formally called H. Lundbeck A/S, said it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, which has investigating drugmakers' support of charities that help Medicare patients cover out-of-pocket drug costs. 
Lundbeck, which develops and distributes drugs for neurological and psychological diseases such as depression and Alzheimer's, said the settlement would include no admission of wrongdoing and is subject to further negotiation.
Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the Medicare government healthcare program for the elderly. But companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent. 
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts has been leading the industry-wide investigation. A spokeswoman for the office declined to comment.
The probe most recently resulted in  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) on May 25 agreeing to pay $23.85 million to resolve claims that it used a purportedly independent charity as a conduit to pay illegal kickbacks to Medicare patients.
In December,  United Therapeutics Corp  (O:UTHR) reached a $210 million settlement to resolve similar allegations it improperly used a charity to cover co-payments.

 Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Plc (O:JAZZ) announced on May 8 that it had reached an agreement to pay $57 million to resolve a related investigation.

1. Jobless Claims, Bloomberg Consumer Confidence Data on Tap 
As investor appetite in risk sentiment remained well supported, further evidence the U.S. economy is on solid footing could strengthen the risk-on rally.
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance due 08:30 am ET for the week ended May June 1, expected to show jobless claims rose to 223,000 from 221,000 the prior week.
The Bloomberg Consumer Confidence Index due 9:45AM ET – which measures views on the condition of the U.S. economy, personal finances and the buying climate – will also be closely monitored.
The reports came ahead of a surge in the 10-year treasury yield to nearly 3% as Treasury prices – which trade inversely to yields – followed European government bonds lower after the European Central Bank's top economist said the central bank would consider scaling back bond purchases.
Market participants are likely monitor whether the 10-year treasury yield can add to its gains and move above the 3% mark.
The dollar retreated Wednesday following a sharp rise in EUR/USD.
2. Natural Gas Inventories, Crude Oil Slump Eyed
Natural gas prices rose on Wednesday a day ahead of data expected to show an increase in natural gas storage.
The Energy Information Agency’s weekly natural gas storage report is expected show gas storage rose by 90 billion cubic feet last week.
Crude oil prices will likely remain in focus as they remained on track to post a third straight week of losses amid a 1.2% fall Wednesday after U.S. government data showed US supplies unexpected increased last week.
That was in contrast to the weekly industry report from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showing a draw in crude supplies.
Crude futures settled 1.21% lower at $64.73 a barrel.
3. Tesla Rally in Focus 
Shares of Tesla rallied nearly 10% Wednesday after CEO Elon Musk said it is ""quite likely"" Tesla will hit its Model 3 production targets. 
During the annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday, Musk said it is ""quite likely"" Tesla will hit a weekly Model 3 production rate of 5,000 cars by the end of June.
Model 3 production bottlenecks have longed weighed down shares of Tesla but Musk's comments appeared to renew investor optimism the company was beginning to alleviate its production headwinds.
Musk also said that he expects Tesla to generate positive net income and cash flow in the third and fourth quarter of the year, easing concerns about the company's cash position.
Shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) closed 9.47% higher at $319.50."
1425,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",U.S. dollar-store shares marked down but specialty discounters thrive,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The shares of so-called dollar stores have suffered as U.S. shoppers have started spending more at bargain retailers with focused concepts and big discount chains.
Once thought to be insulated from the retail industry's challenges, the dollar stores, which got the name because they try to price items for $1 or less, such as  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG),  Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR) and  Big Lots Inc  (N:BIG) derive much of their sales from household staples.
But investors have been drawn to two growing mid-sized chains, Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings Inc (O:OLLI) and  Five Below Inc  (O:FIVE), which have carved out distinct niches within the discount space focusing on discretionary items, analysts said.
Appealing to trend-watchers and bargain hunters has helped Ollie's and Five Below stand out while other discounters face intensifying competition from new entrants such as German chains Aldi and Lidl, analysts and investors said. 
Ollie's sells brand-name overstock items from air conditioners to hair dye, and Five Below caters to teens. 
""They're differentiated concepts,"" said Anthony Chukumba, managing director at Loop Capital in Chicago of Ollie's and Five Below. ""That's one of the reasons they're outperforming.""
Also, investors said, the strong U.S. economy and the federal tax overhaul have given discount shoppers customers more disposable income. As a result, some have shifted their spending to big-box retailers such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT).
Dollar Tree stock has fallen 24.1 percent this year, while shares of Big Lots have plunged 26.6 percent. Shares of Dollar General have risen 1.5 percent but still lag the S&P Composite 1500 Multiline Retail index <.SPCOMMULR>, which includes discount retailers and department stores and has advanced 9.0 percent in the same period.
Ollie's, whose stores are located mainly on the U.S. East Coast, sells closeout and overstock merchandise at deeply discounted prices. The company's shares have climbed 41.0 percent this year. Ollie's shares were little changed on Wednesday after late Tuesday's first-quarter results beat analyst estimates, while the company raised its sales and profit guidance for the 2018 fiscal year.
Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, was persuaded to buy Ollie's shares after coming across the store on a visit to Pennsylvania last year. He compared his trip to Ollie's to a treasure hunt.
""That was the neatest store,"" he said. ""I came back and bought the stock, and ever since, it's gone up and up and up.""
Five Below Inc (O:FIVE), which has locations in 32 U.S. states and caters to pre-teen and teenage consumers with items below $5, has had its shares rise 22.6 percent year to date. The chain has found success capitalizing on teen-centered trends such as slime-making kits and mermaid-themed items, Chukumba said. Five Below is scheduled to report its first-quarter results after the market close on Wednesday.
Last week, shares of all three big dollar discount stores fell after the retailers' quarterly results missed analyst expectations. Dollar Tree and Dollar General attributed their lower-than-expected same-store sales to unusually cold spring weather.
To be sure, they haven't completely lost favor. Loop Capital has a ""buy"" rating for Dollar Tree, and Hodges owns both Dollar Tree and Dollar General shares. Even some investors who are less bullish on the discount segment say the dip in share prices may make them attractive buys.
""With the pullback in the stocks, they're getting close to fair value,"" said Arun Daniel, senior portfolio manager at JO Hambro Capital Management in Boston.
Dollar General and Dollar Tree each have some 15,000 stores throughout most of the United States. Five Below and Ollie's combined have only about 1,000 stores. In Ollie's earnings call on Tuesday, chief executive Mark Butler said the company, which currently has fewer than 300 stores, sees potential to expand to more than 950 locations.
""It's a classic growth story,"" Bradshaw said, in reference to Ollie's. ""Everybody loves to find a deal.""

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares headed for their best day in more than two years on Wednesday after Chief Executive Elon Musk said the car maker was now churning out 500 of its Model 3 sedans a day and should achieve its 5,000 per week target by the end of June.
The move overturned around a third of the impact of a rocky few months for Tesla, which has seen shares fall by a quarter from a peak last September as it battled with production delays and reports of a series of car crashes.
Speaking at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday, Musk offered teasers for upcoming projects, welling up when he spoke of the company's vehicles being made ""with love"" and said his production lines have demonstrated the ability to make 3,500 Model 3 vehicles per week.
Tesla's future profitability hinges on ramping up output of the affordable sedan but the company has fallen short of a series of targets.
""The market is starting to give Elon the benefit of the doubt that he will finally meet his production goal even though it is now six months late,"" Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said.
In April, Tesla said it was making 2,270 vehicles a week.
Musk himself has also stung Tesla shares by warring with critics and journalists on social media and recently declining to answer questions from Wall Street analysts about Tesla's capital requirements, saying they were ""boring"".
A shareholder proposal came up for vote on Tuesday that required Musk to give away his chairman role. More than 80 percent of shareholder votes were against the proposal.
""We have no corporate governance problem with Mr. Musk's dual titles, as ultimately it is about delivering the vehicles profitably,"" CFRA analyst Efraim Levy said.
""We do, however, wish to see more discipline with the CEO's pronouncements, but don't expect much improvement there.""
Tesla also showed a design sketch of the upcoming Model Y SUV although little could be seen in the shadowy image and Musk teased that the car might not even have a steering wheel, stoking some fans' hopes that the car could be fully autonomous.
He said the vehicle would be unveiled in March and begin production in 2020 along with Tesla Semi and the new Roadster.

Throughout its history, Tesla has repeatedly missed aggressive start-of-production targets, and auto experts believe that launching production of three new vehicles within two years is extremely unlikely.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Global foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by almost a quarter to $1.43 trillion last year and the outlook is clouded by risks including trade wars and debt, the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD said on Wednesday.
Preliminary figures released earlier this year showed a 16 percent decline, a surprise downturn led by steep reversals in Britain and the United States.
That has been revised to a 23 percent fall, with growth expected to be less than 10 percent in 2018, well below the average over the past decade.
“The report paints a rather depressing picture,” UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi told a news conference.
UNCTAD investment chief James Zhan said the steeper decline in 2017 was largely caused by a revision of 2016 data, when more funds flowed into U.S. assets than previously thought. 
That year marked the end of a wave of ""tax inversion"" deals, whereby a U.S. firm was acquired by a small foreign business and adopted its domicile to get a lower tax rate.
FDI, a bellwether of globalization and a potential sign of growth of corporate supply chains and future trade ties, faced many risks that were not adequately reflected in economic growth forecasts, Zhan said.
""Aside from trade tensions going into depth and width, geopolitical tension is also going up, and now the debt issue is coming up, not only for emerging markets but also for Europe,"" he told Reuters.
Investments had also slowed because poorer returns and slowdowns in the global value chains that carry over 80 percent of global trade, Zhan said.
Multinationals were doing fewer big equity deals and more licensing, franchising and contract manufacturing, leaving no footprint on foreign soil.
It was too early to measure the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies of economic nationalism, but trade tensions would certainly affect FDI, Zhan said.
FDI inflows - including corporate takeovers and foreign-owned start-up projects - totaled $275 billion in the United States last year, Trump's first year in office, down from $457 billion in 2016. The United States remained comfortably ahead of the No.2 destination, China, which attracted $136 billion. 
FDI into Britain collapsed to $15 billion in 2017 from an anomalous $196 billion in 2016 caused by a few mega-deals. The 2017 figure was less than half of 2015 and a tenth of the average in the boom years before the 2007-08 financial crisis.
It is too soon to know if Britain's planned exit from the European Union in 2019 is affecting FDI, Zhan said. Foreign investment equates to about 63 percent of Britain's GDP, roughly double the foreign stake in French or German business. 

""How to maintain that is a huge challenge,"" said Zhan.

Italy's new prime minister promised on Tuesday to bring radical change to the country as his anti-establishment government sought parliamentary backing, sending debt costs sharply higher.
Italian bonds and banking stocks have come under pressure in recent weeks as investors took fright at the spending plans of a coalition comprising the anti-establishment 5 Star Movement and the far-right League, which also vowed to row back on previous reforms.
""The election has resulted in a majority that brings a message of deep changes. It's not my job to judge but it's obvious that the markets' first reaction has been one of concern,"" UBI CEO Victor Massiah told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.
""This reaction is creating problems, we see that not just from the (bond yield) spread and the stock exchange, but also from what happens on the market for institutional funding, which is less in the spotlight,"" he added.
""There is less talk about it, but it's the biggest concern ... (funding) is crucial, it's oxygen for the banks.""
Market sources have told Reuters that the wholesale funding market has frozen for Italian lenders and will take a while to re-open, with weaker issuers expected to be shut out for longer from institutional funding.
Analysts say this is no immediate threat, as banks have ample liquidity. Massiah also said the situation would only become problematic if it persisted over time.

""I don't want to send a terror message, there is no problem at present, I'm only saying that finding a solution to address market concerns can't take forever.""

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>","Oil vs wild rice: Enbridge, opponents gear up final U.S. pipeline push","By Rod Nickel
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada's  Enbridge  Inc (TO:ENB) faces an indefinite delay to its biggest-ever capital project if a U.S. state regulator denies its preferred pipeline route through Minnesota, but a victory would spell relief for Canadian oil shippers and northern U.S. refiners.
Some pipeline opponents, which include environmental and Native American groups, are trying to convince the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to kill the project. Others oppose only Enbridge's proposed new pipeline route, saying it would consume more land and threaten Native Americans' traditional harvest of wild rice from wetlands.
Enbridge wants to replace the aging 1,031-mile (1,660-km) Line 3 pipeline that runs from Alberta to Wisconsin. 
Worsening bottlenecks in Alberta have steepened a price discount for its heavy crude, and several pipeline projects that could ease the situation face stiff opposition.
Line 3, placed into service in 1968, operates at half its capacity due to integrity concerns. Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day.
Regulatory approval may be pivotal to restoring investor confidence in Enbridge, whose stock is down 18 percent this year, partly on debt concerns, even as the S&P TSX energy index (SPTTEN) is up slightly.
The PUC is set to decide late this month whether the total $7 billion project is necessary and if so, what route it should take. An administrative law judge recommended in April the expanded pipeline should follow the existing route.
Enbridge prefers a new route that bypasses an indigenous reservation, avoids some ecologically sensitive areas and prevents a pipeline shutdown of up to one year. 
It hopes to start construction in Minnesota in November. A different route would require a detailed evaluation that would set back plans to start the added oil flow by late 2019, said Guy Jarvis, Enbridge's executive vice-president of liquids pipelines and major projects. 
""A ruling by the PUC of anything other than our preferred route is clearly going to put the timeline for this project in jeopardy,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
The late stages of Enbridge's biggest-ever, three-year outreach effort will marshal Minnesota's refiners, business and labor groups to lobby state legislators and other ""influencers"" for the project, Jarvis said. To those groups, Line 3 means a $2.5 billion investment in the state, more jobs and less crude traveling by rail.
""It's a full-court press,"" Jarvis said. "".. They can carry the message of what it means in Minnesota better than we can.""
For Flint Hills Resources, a unit of Koch Industries, Line 3 is critical to supplying its Minnesota refinery with adequate volumes of Canadian crude to produce fuel and asphalt, said spokesman Jake Reint.
""We're not getting the crude we need right now.""
FIGHT OVER RICE
Enbridge's opponents have their own gameplan.
Aboriginal environment group Honor the Earth hopes to sway Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton to help kill the project.
The governor has no formal role in the commission's deliberations, but carries valuable influence, said Tara Houska, national campaigns director for Honor the Earth. The state commerce department has already said Enbridge has not shown the project is needed.
A spokesperson for Dayton said the governor has made clear that the PUC operates independently of his administration. Last month, Dayton vetoed a bill that would have allowed Enbridge to bypass the PUC.
Honor the Earth argues that expanding the pipeline tramples on tribal rights to harvest wild rice, hunt and fish in the area. The wild rice issue is ""critical to this decision,"" said Catherine Collentine of Sierra Club, another environmentalist group opposing Line 3. 
The company will work to protect wild rice areas during pipeline construction and operation, Enbridge spokeswoman Suzanne Wilton said.
The Canadian oil industry faces opposition to other pipeline projects, and views approval for this one as a badly needed victory.
""It's very important for the industry to prove they can, not (only) get lines built, but lines increased,"" said Kevin Brent, vice-president of investments at BlueSky Equities, which owns Enbridge stock. 

A loss in Minnesota ""would be terrible for investor sentiment,"" he said.

NEW YORK/SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's sales tax-backed COFINA debt rallied on Wednesday after court filings revealed a new agreement to settle a long-running dispute with general obligation debt creditors over which group has a valid claim on the tax revenues.
The deal was reached among two court-appointed agents who have spent a year litigating over future sales tax revenues.
Late on Tuesday, the parties filed a motion in Manhattan's U.S. District Court announcing the deal and asking for any motions for summary judgments before the court to be held ""in abeyance for a period of 60 days"" or until Aug. 4.
Details of the agreement were not revealed.
""I am pleased with the settlement agreement... It is an enormous significant development,"" Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is overseeing Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, said during a hearing on Wednesday. However Swain did not issue any orders from the bench before breaking for lunch.
GRAPHIC: https://reut.rs/2LtDNq3
The bondholders, who together own about half of bankrupt Puerto Rico's $71.5 billion in bonds, have spent years disputing ownership of future sales tax revenues. The U.S. territory declared the largest ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy in May 2017, under the jurisdiction of the special Puerto Rico financial rescue law known as PROMESA.
""There is a lot of work that remains to be done. We are not at the finish line yet,"" Luc Despins, a lawyer for the unsecured creditors committee told the court, adding details would be taken back to various creditor groups.
Representatives of the financial oversight board created by PROMESA told the court they also supported the 60-day extension.
Senior COFINA debt carrying a 5.25 percent coupon maturing in 2057 rose 7.25 points in price to bid 75.25 <74529JAR6=MSRB>, according to Thomson Reuters data. The 6 percent subordinated COFINA bonds maturing 2042 rose 5.75 points in price to bid 36.25 <74529JHN8=MSRB>.
Puerto Rico's constitutionally backed benchmark 8 percent GO bond maturing in 2035 rose 0.995 points in price to bid 41.50 <74514LE86=MSRB>.
""Because these bonds are in default, the market is assessing the settlement value based upon the agreement revealed in last night's court filing. The effect has been favorable even for the GO bonds,"" said Daniel Berger, senior market strategist Municipal Market Data, a Thomson Reuters company.
In May, the oversight board snubbed a proposed settlement by two bondholder groups that would have split the revenues roughly evenly, calling it ""completely unaffordable.""
Shaun Burgess, a portfolio manager at Sarasota, Florida-based Cumberland Advisors, noted the original deal gave senior COFINA bondholders a 93 to 95 cent on the dollar recovery value versus about 42 cents for the junior COFINA debt.
""If some new deal has been reached you may be closer to that mark, which would fuel the move we have seen today. But without details it is very hard to know what the real driver is, so this move feels very speculative,"" Burgess said. 
Puerto Rico owes about $18 billion each in general obligation and COFINA debt. The dispute between the two sets of creditors is the central legal dispute in the island's bankruptcy.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 01:28PM ET</span>",VW sees production stoppages due to new testing rules,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) faces production stoppages next quarter due to bottlenecks caused by new lab tests for emissions and fuel consumption, and will discuss the implications for workers in the coming days, it said on Wednesday.
Europe's largest automaker said that adapting to meet the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), which is based on real-driving data rather than theoretical scenarios, would require ""a feat of strength.""
Carmakers are rushing to get models through WLTP tests on a limited number of exhaust emission test benches as they won't be able to sell new vehicles after Sept. 1 without the testing. At the German company's VW brand alone, more than 200 models require new emissions and fuel economy readings, it said.
Production at the main Wolfsburg plant, which employs 62,000 staff and builds the Golf, Tiguan and Touran models, will be halted on certain days in August and September, group Chief Executive Herbert Diess told a staff gathering.
""We will only build vehicles in Wolfsburg after the (July 7-27) works holiday that fulfil the new standards,"" Diess said.
Works council chief Bernd Osterloh called on management to find ways to cope with the effects of production disruptions, saying they couldn't be blamed on staff.
""It's not the fault of our colleagues that the company has built too few test rigs over the years and can suddenly not handle the test volume required,"" Osterloh said. ""We will not allow this burden to be borne by the workforce alone at the end of the day.""
Volkswagen's sports-car brand Porsche last week said it would temporarily limit the number of models it sells in Europe due to the switch to WLTP standards, without being more specific.

When publishing its detailed 2017 financial results in March, the VW brand listed WLTP among the potential risks for 2018, alongside the costs for its electric-car program and regulations to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",Your Money: New insurance hacks cyber threats against the rich,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurance is supposed to make you feel safe, but even those who sell special cyber-security protection packages worry about hacking threats. 
What makes Jerry Hourihan lose sleep is that everyone's information already is likely compromised. Hourihan is head of the U.S. private client group for insurer AIG Inc (NYSE:AIG), which last year launched a Family CyberEdge policy, offering coverage for advanced cyber threats. 
When AIG was developing the project, Hourihan said a senior executive volunteered to see what security consultants could dig up about him on the dark web. Within minutes, they purchased his Social Security number for a few dollars. 
""Everyone's information is out there, and the task is to minimize your risk,"" said Hourihan. 
It requires a lot more than just a monthly $9.99 identity theft monitoring service or fraud alerts on your credit card to deal with ransomware, cyberbullying, network infiltration and a whole host of other scary threats. 
If you do not have a corporate-level IT department to call in a pinch, you can now buy that kind of protection. Prices vary based on the coverage, but they are intended for high net-worth families, so expect sticker shock. Along with AIG's CyberEdge, Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd just launched a cyber protection extension to its Masterpiece homeowner policy. 
These policies cover for losses up to $250,0000, if, for instance, you need to replace the entire smart lighting system in your house because it has been hacked. The policies also offer ongoing white-glove consulting services to shore up cyber-defenses and also clean up after any incidents. 
If these policies work for upper-income families, lower-priced coverage will follow, says independent security expert Robert Siciliano.
""They’re testing the waters, and they'll see if it'll be worth it to them to provide it to the masses,"" said Siciliano, chief executive of IDTheftSecurity.com. 
So far, most of AIG's CyberEdge clients are asking questions about best safety practices.
""The goal is to provide a lot of consultation up front, and then avoid most of the issues,"" said Hourihan. 
Chubb's Masterpiece is front-loading its policies with a lot of prevention, including a special wi-fi router from cyber-security firm Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) Corp's Norton, said Mike Tanenbaum, executive vice-president of Chubb's North American cyber practice. 
HOME REMEDIES
Without getting an expensive insurance policy, there are steps you can take to limit risk. 
Change the locks, so to speak, said Mary Qualls of Florida-based Vault Insurance, catering to high net-worth homeowners. That can involve restarting your router to break any ongoing connection a hacker has into your network and also changing all your passwords. 
Siciliano does not understand why everyone does not use a password management program.
""That is pure laziness,"" Siciliano said. 
With no universal reporting, it is hard to get a good grasp on cyber security problems and figure out a way to solve them. Eva Velasquez, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center (idtheftcenter.org), said that if more people reported hacking incidents it would help. 
Recent data from the Federal Trade Commission found that millennials are reporting fraud a lot more often than other groups, with an average loss around $200, Velasquez said. Seniors reported less, but their average loss is $1,200. 
""As you have more resources, your trigger of 'is that painful enough to report?' changes. The thieves know that,"" said Velasquez. 
The result: Hackers keep thefts low enough to fly under the radar and continue to operate with impunity. 
Velasquez, whose organization offers free services for victims of identify theft, said that insurance could be worth it for individuals if they do a cost-benefit analysis. 
""Do your homework, make sure it is legit, and know what's covered,"" Velasquez said. ""If it brings you peace of mind, that can be of value. At the same time, just because you have insurance, you can't abdicate responsibility.""

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 12:53PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank plans to cut investment bank's costs by one billion euros: CFO,"By Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) investment banking arm will bear more than half of the group's planned cost cuts, its chief financial officer said on Wednesday, as he admitted that the lender would continue to lag peers in the second quarter.
""Of the 2 billion euros ($2.36 billion) planned cost reductions between 2017 and 2019, more than half is expected to come from the corporate and investment bank,"" James von Moltke told a conference.
""Our lack of profitability is still holding us back,"" he acknowledged, adding that while peers are expecting flat revenues in the second quarter, Deutsche Bank's performance would likely be ""a little worse"" given the bank's current transition.
""We have the resources and we need to succeed. We simply need to gain positive momentum.""
 Deutsche Bank  has said it plans to cut costs to 22 billion euros ($26 billion) by the end of 2019 and has announced plans to reduce headcount to below 90,000 from 97,000, with a 25 percent cut in equities sales and trading jobs, which are mainly in New York and London and where it has been losing ground to U.S. rivals.. 
In a first step, group headcount is to fall to below 93,000 by year-end, von Moltke said, adding this would help increase Deutsche's profitability. It is targeting a return on tangible equity of more than 4 percent next year and of around 10 percent by 2021.
By comparison, large U.S. banks have recently posted returns of 10-12 percent.
""While some of you have argued that our plans are not radical enough, we believe that our plan, if successfully executed, should generate the best possible return profile for our shareholders,"" von Moltke said.
Christian Sewing, a Deutsche Bank 'lifer' who was appointed CEO in April after the removal of predecessor John Cryan, reiterated at a different event in Berlin that the bank will withdraw from business areas where it is no longer relevant enough.
Past misadventures in high-risk investment banking have haunted his attempt to refocus the bank onto its more staid corporate banking roots. 
Last week, Deutsche Bank's shares reached an all-time low following a report on Thursday that the U.S. regulator viewed the lender as ""troubled"" last year, while Sewing said on Wednesday that all the bank's subsidiaries in the United States were ""very healthy"".
Separately, ratings agency Scope on Wednesday downgraded Deutsche Bank's rating outlook to ""negative"" from ""stable"", citing steep challenges for the bank's business-model as well as risk from the legacy of past activities. 
That followed a downgrade of Deutsche's credit rating by Standard & Poor's to BBB+ from A- on Friday, which had prompted the ECB and Deutsche's biggest investor to reassure shareholders and staff of the lender's financial strength. 
Sewing admitted last week that the newsflow was ""not good"" as S&P questioned his ability to get Deutsche Bank back to profit after three years of losses by scaling back its global investment bank and refocusing on Europe and Germany.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) on Wednesday lowered its second quarter profit forecast due to rising fuel costs, and its shares fell as much as nearly 4 percent before trimming those losses.
The Atlanta-based carrier said it now expects to earn between $1.65 and $1.75 per share, down from its earlier projection of up to $2 per share.
Its pre-tax margin will now fall somewhere in the 13 percent to 14 percent range, from its prior view of between 14 percent and 16 percent, the carrier said in a Wednesday report.
The airline's shares were down 1.5 percent at $53.83 after earlier falling as low as $52.63, extending about a 5 percent year-to-date loss. The Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index (DJUSAR) was down 0.5 percent and off nearly 12 percent for the year.
Delta said jet fuel prices have risen some 50 percent since last year and about 12 percent since the beginning of the quarter.
The rising cost of jet fuel is weighing on earnings across the U.S. sector, cutting into summer profits and prompting air fare increases. 

Delta and its competitors are hoping strong demand, higher ticket prices and benefits from reductions in the U.S. corporate tax rate will eventually offset the impact of higher fuel prices. Rival American Airlines (O:AAL) cut its profit forecast in April, also citing higher fuel costs.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks closed flat on Wednesday at the end of a choppy session during which hawkish comments by the European Central Bank lifted the euro and bond yields. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index ended the day unchanged with bourses closing in different directions across the continent. 
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) was up 0.3 percent, Paris' CAC 40 (FCHI) was down 0.1 percent and London's FTSE (FTSE) up 0.3 percent. 
The ECB's chief economist said robust growth was making the central bank increasingly confident that inflation is on its way back to target, raising the likelihood it may use a meeting next week to reveal more about the end of its bond-buying program.
That prospect pushed bond yields across the euro zone higher, making stocks chosen for their generous dividends less attractive in comparison. 
The rise of the euro to a 10-day high also weighed on European companies which have large revenues in dollars.
Consumer groups L'Oreal (PA:OREP), Unilever (AS:UNc) and Imperial Brands (L:IMB) were the worst performers among blue chips, losing between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. 
Banking stocks (SX7P), which typically benefit from higher interest rates, rose 0.7 percent with Italian lenders recovering further from political instability in the country. 
Commodities stocks (SXPP) rose close to 2 percent due to strong copper prices while the recent rally in tech stocks (SX8P) continued its course, adding 0.2 percent. 

Among individual stocks, RPC (L:RPC) was the biggest faller, tumbling about 12 percent after the plastic packaging leader said it was looking to sell assets.

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Farmer pressure forces Trump biofuel policy suspension; credit prices jump,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice
(Reuters) - Under pressure from U.S. lawmakers in farming states, President Donald Trump has abandoned an overhaul of biofuels policy aimed at reducing costs for the oil industry, sending U.S. renewable fuel credit prices soaring more than 40 percent on Wednesday.
The White House had been poised to announce proposed changes to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) this week after hosting months of difficult negotiations between representatives of Big Oil and Big Corn, but delayed the announcement indefinitely, two sources familiar with the matter said late on Tuesday.
Trump abandoned the efforts on Tuesday after learning that farmers in the important Midwestern constituency were uneasy with part of the proposal, one of the sources said. This was confirmed to Reuters by another source on Wednesday.
Pressure to reform the program eased in recent weeks as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took steps that resulted in significantly lower compliance costs for merchant refiners.
The White House and the EPA did not immediately respond to requests on Wednesday for comment on the policy suspension.
Ethanol groups Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association praised the move.
Renewable fuel credit prices traded as high as 29 cents early Wednesday on the news, up from 20 cents Tuesday afternoon, traders said. Prices eased back to 26 cents mid-morning.
The RFS requires oil refiners to mix increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into fuel each year, and prove compliance by earning or acquiring the credits and handing them in to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The law has helped corn farmers in the Midwest by creating a 15-billion-gallon-a-year market for ethanol, but refining companies have complained that compliance costs are too high and threaten the type of blue-collar jobs Trump has promised to preserve.
The White House deal would have eased pressure on the refining industry by allowing biofuels exports to count toward the annual volumes quotas. It would also have expanded sales of high-ethanol gasoline, in a concession to biofuels producers.
Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of corn state Iowa both praised Trump on Twitter on Tuesday evening for dropping the export plan - which they had argued would have cut into domestic demand for ethanol.
But oil companies also have reason to cheer.
Despite Wednesday's spike in renewable fuel credit prices, they are down sharply since late last year after Trump's EPA handed out an unusually high number of waivers exempting small oil refineries from the RFS on the grounds complying would have caused them financial stress. 

That decline has saved the oil industry billions of dollars in compliance costs, according to a Reuters analysis.

1453,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 12:28PM ET</span>","Euro climbs, yields rise after hawkish ECB comments","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro rose to a nearly two-week high while the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a 1-1/2-week peak on Wednesday after officials said the European Central Bank could wind down its stimulus program by the end of the year.
Robust growth is making the central bank increasingly confident that inflation is on its way back to target, ECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday, raising the likelihood it may use a meeting next week to reveal more about the end of its bond-buying program.
The comments boosted the euro. The euro was up 0.47 percent to $1.1772. The dollar index fell 0.32 percent.
Jitters that the ECB would buy fewer bonds triggered a broad sell-off in German Bunds and other European government debt, which spilled over to the Treasuries sector, analysts said.
The yield on Germany's benchmark 10-year bond up nearly eight basis points to 0.44 percent, on track for their biggest daily rise in nearly a year.
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 15/32 in price to yield 2.9717 percent, from 2.919 percent late on Tuesday.
""Bunds were leading the sell-off,"" said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in New York. Praet's comments ""pulled forward the ECB move in some people's mind.""
Wall Street stocks climbed, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc gaining after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk reassured shareholders that building 5,000 of its mass-market Model 3 cars per week by the end of June was ""quite likely.""
The Nasdaq hit another record intraday high.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 226.61 points, or 0.91 percent, to 25,026.59, the S&P 500 gained 11.66 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,760.46 and the Nasdaq Composite added 17.77 points, or 0.23 percent, to 7,655.64.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.07 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.53 percent.
Investors said the new Italian government's big-spending fiscal plans, a major worry for markets over the last few weeks, were unlikely to be helped by the ECB tightening its own policy.
Oil prices fell on signs Saudi Arabia and other big producers may increase production. U.S. crude fell more than 1 percent on a surprise build in domestic crude stockpiles.

U.S. crude fell 1.25 percent to $64.70 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.97, down 0.54 percent.

The company said the jobs will be in head office, research and development, web services and operations roles.
Apart from nationwide goods deliveries, Amazon's services include video streaming and a digital home assistant known as Alexa.
""We're committed to the UK, we're continuing to invest in the UK,"" Doug Gurr, Amazon's UK Country Manager, told reporters.
Amazon has invested over 9.3 billion pounds ($12.5 billion) in its UK operations since 2010, he said, but declined to break down that figure between capital expenditure and operating costs.
The company already announced in January that it would create 400 jobs at a new fulfilment center in Rugby, central England. 
Gurr was unconcerned by Britain's impending exit from the European Union.
""We'll wait and see what happens and we'll adapt as necessary,"" he said. 
He declined to comment on a media report that Amazon had made an unsuccessful informal attempt to buy upmarket British supermarket chain Waitrose [JLPLC.UL] late last year. 
Amazon has also been linked with a big move on the UK grocery market in the wake of Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) agreed 7.3 billion pound takeover of Walmart's (N:WMT) Asda that would create a combined group larger than current market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO).
Though Amazon is slowly rolling out the same-day delivery AmazonFresh service it launched in June 2016 its overall share of the UK grocery market remains tiny.
It currently has a wholesale deal with No. 4 UK player Morrisons (L:MRW) and last year bought upscale U.S. grocer Whole Foods.

U.S. President Donald Trump last week imposed import duties on metals from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. In retaliation, Mexico slapped a 25 percent levy on bourbon imports, with other trade partners saying they would impose duties on American goods including Jack Daniel's whiskey.
""It's a tough, tricky situation that we've been watching now for months. It seems like every day we wake up and it takes a little bit of a twist and turn,"" outgoing CEO Paul Varga said on a conference call while discussing the company's fourth-quarter results.
Brown-Forman gets 18 percent of its net sales from the UK, Germany, Poland and France, while Mexico and Canada contribute about 5 percent and 1 percent, respectively.
Shares of the Kentucky-based company fell 5.4 percent to $52.85 in late morning trading.
Varga said the company has gained more flexibility in managing trade risks by moving shipments to markets where it has its own distribution, rather than depending on third-party distributors.
The company which also makes Finlandia vodka said higher wood, agave and freight costs would lead to a modest decline in gross margins in fiscal 2019. 
Excluding the impact of any potential tariffs, Brown-Foreman expects earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.85 in fiscal year 2019, with midpoint of the range coming in below the analysts' forecast of $1.82 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Net income for the company fell to $110 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter ended April 30, from $144 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier.

Net sales rose 5.6 percent to $733 million. Analysts had expected the company to earn 22 cents per share on revenue of $755.4 million in the quarter.

Starwood's bid could have sped up a shift of powers in the region after residential property groups Conwert and Buwog were recently taken over by German market leader Vonovia (DE:VNAn).
CA Immo and Immofinanz, two out of three remaining listed Austrian property groups, had agreed in 2016 to merge and create a heavyweight but the plan fell through this year after pressure from an activist investor. 
Shortly after that, Starwood offered to buy up to 26 percent in CA Immo and up to 5 percent in Immofinanz. But only 0.2 percent of each firm's shareholders tendered their stakes by the end of the acceptance period on May 30, the companies said.
Starwood was ready to pay CA Immo shareholders 26.70 euros per share, and Immofinanz shareholders 2.03 euros per share. 
CA Immo traded at 29.24 euros and Immofinanz at 2.08 euros at 1350 GMT on Wednesday, indicating investors hoped for more. 
Analysts and the property groups have said consolidating the remaining groups would make sense as it would increase sales power and financial strength. 
There were several parties looking to buy, a property banker familiar with the matter said in March.
CA Immo's 4.3 billion euro portfolio comprises offices and shops in Austria, Germany and eastern Europe. Immofinanz's portfolio is comparable in value and geographical focus but some of the portfolio is less attractive, according to analysts. 
A third listed property firm, S Immo (VI:SIAG), is also included in some consolidation scenarios. Immofinanz already holds 29 percent in S Immo, which return has a 12 percent stake in Immofinanz and a 6 percent stake in CA Immo. 
While CA Immo had welcomed Starwood's interest. But Immofinanz had dismissed the offer as too low and, after the Starwood bid, put its 26 percent stake in CA Immo on the block, inviting investors to express interest by the end of April.
Immofinanz declined to comment on the sales process on Wednesday. A decision is expected in summer.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",More U.S. companies shelve refinancings as markets turn choppy,"By Jonathan Schwarzberg and Yun Li
NEW YORK (LPC) - At least two more US companies have postponed opportunistic leveraged loan refinancings after failing to attract investors at the proposed terms on heightened worries about global volatility, sources told Thomson Reuters LPC.
Looking to be better compensated for their risk, lenders stood on the sidelines as tactical and operational equipment logistics company ADS Tactical and decorative lighting company VC GB Holdings marketed a total of US$925m in refinancing loans, adding to a handful of other deals that have been shelved in recent weeks.
Lenders this year have generally been willing to allow companies to lower the pricing on their existing loan holdings, as values in the secondary market have strengthened, rather than allow companies to do full-on refinancings and potentially losing the paper.
As a bevy of new deals hit the market over the last month and secondary prices have dipped, investors have been focusing on which credits they really want to own. 
“I think managers are just figuring out right now what they need to sell,” an investor said. “On top of that, you had a little volatility in the background while this was happening, which caused the overall risk environment to pause just a little bit.”
Meager supply for loans and a large appetite for floating-rate assets has left little room for pushback this year, but political turmoil in Italy and tensions with North Korea over potential denuclearization have tipped the balance. When paired with increased deal activity, investors now have the option to be choosy.
“You have a little bit of weakness as you start to push back on some of the repricings so you can focus your time on the ones you like the most,” a portfolio manager said. “There’s a lot of stuff on the market.”
The SMi100, an index that tracks the 100 most widely held loans, dropped slightly to 98.4 on June 4 from 98.6 on May 1. 
MARKET FATIGUE
In addition to global macroeconomic concerns, these issuers came to market at a time when investors were showing fatigue at simply allowing issuers to reprice loans at will, several sources said. 
Gaming and entertainment property owner VICI Properties, automotive supplies producer American Axle & Manufacturing, and handling systems maker MHS Holdings all postponed repricings in late May, as previously reported by Thomson Reuters LPC.
ADS Tactical originally proposed a new US$330m seven-year term loan to refinance its existing term loan due in 2022 and senior secured notes due in 2022. Guidance initially went out at 425bp over Libor, and after receiving pushback the company increased the spread to 525bp over Libor and revised the structure to include a US$250m term loan and a US$75m secured note, but the deal was ultimately shelved.
“We were just testing the waters,” said John Dunn, chief financial officer at ADS. ""It just wasn’t good enough for us to pull the trigger to move forward with it.” 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) led the ADS deal and did not return a request for comment. 
VC GB Holdings, known as Visual Comfort, also postponed a US$595m covenant-lite seven-year term loan B. The company circulated guidance of 325bp over Libor on the loan, which was slated to pay down a US$505m first-lien term loan due in 2024 and a US$150m second-lien term loan due in 2025.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) led this transaction and declined comment. Visual Comfort did not return requests for comment.
The market's disinterest in the deals does not reflect investors' concerns with the credits or an obvious weakness in the credit markets. Rather these deals represent a rebalancing of the market, a banker said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England (BoE) has rejected calls from British lawmakers and insurers to ease a European Union insurance capital requirement rule, blaming Brexit uncertainty.
BoE Deputy Governor Sam Woods has studied possible changes to how the ""risk margin"" is calculated in EU rules known as Solvency II. It refers to what a third party would need to take over an insurer's policies if it went bust.
Lawmakers on parliament's Treasury Select Committee said last October the rule should be changed because it was forcing insurers in Britain to reinsure business offshore to benefit from lower capital charges.
The BoE has failed to persuade the EU to make speedy changes to the rule, leaving it with an option of unilateral action that Woods ruled out on Wednesday, citing Brexit.
Woods considered ways to mitigate the impact of the risk margin and how it was calculated.
""However, in the context of the ongoing uncertainty about our future relationship with the EU in relation to financial services we do not yet see a durable way to implement a change with sufficient certainty for firms to be able to rely on it for pricing, capital planning and use of reinsurance,"" he said in a letter to the Treasury Committee.
""We will keep this position under review and will update the committee as soon as we can see a clear way forward.""
British insurers called on the BoE in March to ease the rule which they say costs them 50 billion pounds ($67 billion) in extra capital charges.
Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said on Wednesday he was very disappointed.
""While it is a step forward for them to confirm a technical solution to the problem exists within the current Solvency II framework, that only makes it more frustrating to hear that uncertainty about Brexit has prevented the regulator acting in a way that makes sense for UK plc,"" Evans said.
Woods said the build-up of the stock of offshore reinsurance was an unintended consequence of the risk margin rule and, if left unconstrained, would become a significant prudential concern.
""Our supervisory reviews of firms' reinsurance activities have not, however, brought to light significant immediate concerns about the way in which that reinsurance is being conducted,"" he said.
There does not appear to be any harmful effects on policyholders via annuity prices either, he added.

1475,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 11:17AM ET</span>",Athenahealth CEO steps down; company considers sale,"By Manas Mishra and Ankur Banerjee
(Reuters) - Athenahealth Inc's (O:ATHN) Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Bush stepped down on Wednesday and the healthcare software maker said it was exploring options, including selling itself, following pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.
The company is in talks with third parties regarding a potential deal and the board has started looking for a replacement for Bush, it said.
Athenahealth's shares rose as much as 8 percent to $163.94 in early trading. Elliott in May proposed an offer of $160 per share in cash for the company, valuing it at about $6.9 billion.
""It is easy for me to see that the very things that made me useful to the company ... are now exactly the things that are in the way,"" Bush said in a statement.
Bush, a nephew of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, founded Athenahealth in 1997 and has been in the spotlight following media reports https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-04/athenahealth-ceo-bush-faces-new-allegations-as-video-emerges of inappropriate comments.
Last week, Bush issued an apology after a report in U.K.'s Daily Mail newspaper said that he had assaulted his former wife 14 years ago.
Athenahealth spokeswoman Victoria Gavaza declined to comment on the reason for Bush's departure.
""The resignation of the CEO will likely have a negative impact on the business. However, given the emergence in the press of several personal items, we understand the need to step aside,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Close said.
The company, which has been under pressure from Elliott since it took a stake in the company last year, has in the past year cut jobs, hired former  General Electric  (N:GE) CEO Jeff Immelt as chairman and named a new finance head. 
Immelt will now become executive chairman, the company said on Wednesday.
A spokesman for Elliott, which has an 8.9 percent stake in Athenahealth, said the company's decision to explore strategic alternatives was ""the right one"", adding that the hedge fund looked forward to participating as a bidder in the process.
""The company's uneven performance over the past few years likely pushed Athenahealth's major shareholders to advocate for exploring strategic alternatives,"" Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said, adding that the company is unlikely to remain an independent entity.
Athenahealth, whose cloud-based service is used to track revenue from patients, physicians and hospitals, said CFO Marc Levine will assume greater day-to-day operational responsibilities.
Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper said a sale could fetch a higher valuation following the company's announcement.
""We assume any sale of the company will be equal or greater than Elliott's current offer of $160 per share,"" Halper wrote in a note.

Lazard and Centerview Partners are the company's financial advisers, and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is providing legal counsel.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",PetSmart taps advisers to trim $8 billion debt pile: sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - PetSmart Inc, the largest U.S. pet retailer, has hired restructuring advisers to explore ways to trim its debt pile of more than $8 billion as it continues to face falling profits, according to people familiar with the matter.
The move comes as PetSmart's debt trades at a deep discount to its full value amid concerns the brick-and-mortar retailer's big bet on online commerce has yet to pay off. PetSmart told investors in its bonds on Monday it would move part of its ownership of e-commerce website Chewy Inc away from the reach of its creditors.
PetSmart is working with investment bank  Houlihan Lokey Inc  (N:HLI) as it weighs its next steps, the sources said this week. While the company faces no significant debt maturities until 2022, it hopes to take advantage of the decline in the value of its bonds to trim its debt burden, the sources added, without specifying which specific course of action the company will take.
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. PetSmart and Houlihan Lokey did not return requests for comment.
PetSmart's woes come as the retail sector continues to struggle with the shift to online commerce and rapidly changing consumer tastes. More than 15 U.S. retailers, including Toys ""R"" Us Inc, filed for bankruptcy last year.
Private equity firm BC Partners Inc acquired PetSmart for $8.7 billion in 2014, as it sought to capitalize on consumers lavishing their pets with expensive treats and gear. However, the company quickly faced strong headwinds as many customers snubbed its stores for the convenience of online shopping.
In response, PetSmart acquired Chewy last year for $3.35 billion, the highest price ever paid for an e-commerce site. It was a bold move, with PetSmart adding $2 billion to its debt load to do the deal.
But Chewy has continued to lose money as it spends more on customer acquisition in order to boost its market share.
PetSmart's bonds due in 2023 are now trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
PetSmart moved 20 percent of Chewy to its private equity owners as a dividend, and another 16.5 percent to an unrestricted subsidiary, leaving existing creditors with a reduced claim on the e-commerce shop.

Debt-laden stressed retailers J. Crew Group Inc and Neiman Marcus Group Ltd have also moved collateral away from creditors as they try to slash their debt loads. J. Crew completed its debt restructuring out of court last year. Neiman Marcus has yet to address its debt.

It's Valar's second investment in the company. Valar, Thiel's early-stage venture-capital company,  took part in a $10 million funding round for Coya last August. e.ventures, La Famiglia, and Yabeo also took part in the latest round.
Coya, founded in 2016, is planning to build a digital insurance product pitched at millennials, and the latest cash injection is aimed at supporting the cost of getting regulated by BaFin, Germany's finance regulator. It hopes to launch later this summer.
""The funding provides the fuel to develop digitally focused insurance solutions that are fairer, faster, and future ready,"" Coya's founders said in a joint statement.
Thiel, who is best known for cofounding PayPal and being an early investor in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), has been an active investor in European financial technology, or fintech, over recent years.
The billionaire was an early investor in the UK money-transfer business TransferWise and the  UK insurance-technology  startup Brolly, as well as backing the German fintech startups  N26 and  Deposit Solutions.
""We see huge potential in Coya,"" James Fitzgerald, a partner at Valar Ventures, said in a statement. ""Building an insurance company for the current century requires the right balance of insurance and technology expertise, something that others — both incumbents and many insuretech startups — have not been able to achieve.
""Coya's determination to build a fully licensed and integrated insurance offering from the ground up, rather than rely on third parties, sets them apart in the space.""
Coya was founded by two veterans of the hot German lending startup Kreditech alongside Dr. Peter Hagen, the former CEO of Vienna Insurance Group. It has 55 employees in Berlin."

He contrasted Tesla against other auto companies, whose vehicles he characterized as being driven by financial considerations.

Musk characterized recent months, which have brought questions about Tesla's financial health, production process, and workplace conditions as ""the most excruciating, hellish several months I've maybe ever had.""
At the beginning of the meeting, Tesla  shareholders voted to keep CEO Elon Musk as the chairman of the company's board of directors. A shareholder had proposed that the company replace Musk, who has served as the chairman of Tesla's board of directors since 2004 and its CEO since 2008, with an independent chairman. Tesla's board of directors did not support the proposal and said Musk's role as the company's chairman has been essential to Tesla's success so far and will allow the company to quickly adapt to new challenges.

Musk reaffirmed his forecasts for second-half profit and cash generation based on that target, and said he still sees no need to raise more capital.
“It’s very difficult to become a mass-manufacturing car company,” Musk, 46, said Tuesday after shareholders voted down a measure that would have required an independent director replace him as chairman. “No one has succeeded in doing this in a very long time in United States.”
Manufacturing has befuddled Tesla ever since Musk predicted 11 months ago that “production hell” would be ahead for the first car the company was trying to make in high volumes. Missed targets for the Model 3 contributed to the company burning through more than $1 billion in three of the last four quarters. An activist investor group cited failures to meet goals with the sedan as one of the reasons shareholders should have opposed re-electing three directors to the board during Tuesday’s annual meeting, but its bid failed.
Tesla shares climbed as much as 5.9 percent -- the biggest intraday jump in eight weeks -- paring most of this year’s 6.5 percent slide through Tuesday.
Third Line
One of the reasons for Musk’s assurance that Tesla is turning the corner on manufacturing is the addition of a third general assembly line that completes the process of putting together the Model 3. The company started building the third line about two weeks ago, and the initial cars are moving through “crazy fast,” he said.
“The biggest constraint on output is general assembly,” Musk said. “We can probably get to 5,000 a week with the current two general assembly lines. But with the third one, I’m highly confident that we can exceed 5,000 units per week.”
Tesla is also now turning its attention toward expanding its manufacturing capacity by adding another plant, which will produce cars, battery packs and powertrains in Shanghai. The company may announce more details about that factory as soon as next month, Musk said, then reveal plans for another to be built somewhere in Europe toward the end of 2018.
The comments by Musk followed shareholders’ votes to reappoint three directors who were up for election during the meeting: private equity investor Antonio Gracias, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. CEO James Murdoch, and food industry entrepreneur Kimbal Musk, Elon’s brother.
Investors also defeated a proposal to require that the chairman be an independent director, according to Todd Maron, Tesla’s general counsel, who said the company will release voting results in a regulatory filing within four business days. Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund backed the unsuccessful measure, which would have split Musk’s combined chairman and CEO roles.
Next Products
The all-wheel drive version of the Model 3 will come out next month, Musk said. The shorter-range battery version of the car that starts at $35,000 will start to arrive late this year, though the company may not reach volume production of that iteration until the first quarter of 2019.
Tesla then plans to unveil the Model Y crossover in March. That will go into production in the first half of 2020, along with the Semi truck and Roadster models, Musk said.
Musk still thinks manufacturing will become a competitive advantage for the company in the long term. He acknowledged this was a counterintuitive prediction after Tesla’s trying experiences over the last year.
“It’s like, I will tell you, the most excruciating, hellish several months I’ve maybe ever had -- and a lot of other people at Tesla,” Musk said during the meeting, before inviting several of his top deputies to share the stage. “But I think we’re getting there.”

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's federal police will again ask AirAsia Group's (KL:AIRA) chief to appear for questioning over allegations the airline broke rules to obtain a flying license in the country, a source said on Wednesday, after he failed to answer a previous request.
On Friday a police source told Reuters the airline's chief executive, Tony Fernandes, had been asked to appear before India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on June 6. AirAsia, however, said it had received no such summons, which had also been reported by other media.
""We wish to state categorically that neither AirAsia Group nor Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, in his personal capacity, has received any such notice as of today,"" the company said in a statement on Tuesday.
When asked on Wednesday, the federal police source repeated that a summons had been made, but declined to comment on whether it had been delivered as a written notice or in another form, saying that such details of the investigation were confidential.
A second summons would be issued once a date was decided, the source said. He added that if Fernandes did not appear again ""suitable action will be taken as per law"", which he said could include issuing an arrest warrant.
Representatives for AirAsia earlier on Wednesday did not respond to emailed requests to clarify whether there had been any contact from India's CBI.
The CBI last month accused the airline, some of its employees and third parties of violating foreign direct investment rules while obtaining its license to fly, and of bribing government officials in an attempt to get regulations relaxed to allow AirAsia's India unit to fly international routes.
AirAsia's statement on Tuesday said that ""if and when"" the company received a notice from CBI through official channels, it would act in accordance with Malaysian laws and cooperate fully with Indian authorities.
The CBI has said it has searched five AirAsia locations in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, seizing certain documents.
The Malaysian low-cost carrier launched domestic flight operations in India in 2014 with local joint venture partner Tata Sons.

CBI's allegations come at a time when Fernandes is under fire for supporting Malaysia's former prime minister in recent general elections and is being investigated over the cancellation of flights that could have transported voters home.

The six listed open-ended funds (LOF), with a lock-up period of three years, will be allowed to become ""strategic investors"" in upcoming listings of high-tech firms.
Like cornerstone investors in overseas markets, strategic investors in Chinese IPOs seek long-term gains from companies with growth potential, Shi Bo, vice general manager at China Southern Asset Management, said in a statement.
China is encouraging overseas-listed Chinese companies to launch secondary listings in the domestic market through the issuance of China Depositary Receipts (CDRs), modeled after the popular ADRs in the United States.
Firms planning China listings include Xiaomi [IPO-XMGP.HK], U.S.-listed  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and JD.com (O:JD).
Domestic investors currently have limited access to some of China's most prominent tech giants.
The new funds will be managed by mutual fund houses including China Southern, China AMC, E Fund, Harvest, China Universal and China Merchants Fund, according to statements by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
The funds will raise money from retail investors as well as institutions, including China's National Social Security Fund, pension funds and annuity funds.
The six funds aim to raise up to 50 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) each from investors, the Shanghai Securities News reported on Wednesday.
The subscription period for retail investors will be from June 11 to June 15, while institutional investors can subscribe to the funds on June 19, the report said.
The management fee would be less than one-tenth of an ordinary mutual fund product during the lock-up period, according to E Fund Management Co.

Europe's biggest budget airline averted widespread strikes before last Christmas with a last-minute u-turn on union recognition, but has since struggled to reach agreement on terms in some countries. 
It has found most success in Italy and followed up a deal in March to recognize pilots by signing its first crew union recognition agreement with the ANPAC and ANPAV unions, which it said made up around 20 percent of its total cabin crew.
""We are making good progress with other cabin crew unions across Europe and we hope to sign more recognition agreements with both pilot and cabin crew unions in the coming weeks,"" Ryanair Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said in a statement.
Spanish pilots' union SEPLA broke off its recognition talks last month while the airline has experienced minor disruption in Portugal due to industrial action and faces a threat of strike action in its home market of Ireland.
The union representing Ryanair pilots in Britain, the only other market where a recognition deal has been struck, also threatened possible strike action last week unless the company implements a transparent system to manage promotions and transfers. The airline operates in 37 countries.

The new funding will bring total assets managed by Pfizer Ventures to over $1 billion, the company said in a statement.
The announcement comes six months after the U.S. drugmaker said it was abandoning research to find new drugs aimed at treating Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Several drugmakers, including Pfizer, have cut back on neuroscience research after a string of costly trials yielded disappointing results, with some of them betting on startups that are focusing on such areas.
Pfizer has already invested in six neuroscience companies and, alongside drugmakers such as GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and Eli Lilly (N:LLY), is part of the Dementia Discovery Fund, which has raised more than $190 million since its 2015 launch.

Pfizer Ventures will seek to invest $150 million in early-stage neuroscience companies, particularly those focusing on neuro-degeneration, neuro-inflammation and neuro-metabolic disorders.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",NRG sheds U.S. power plants to focus on retail customers,"(Reuters) - U.S. power company  NRG Energy Inc  (N:NRG) wants to boost the size of its retail business as it sheds more than half of its power plants, Chief Executive Mauricio Gutierrez told Reuters.
""NRG started as a generation company that moved into retail and some people still think of NRG in terms of (power plants),"" Gutierrez said.
""But when you think about NRG in the future, I invite you to think about the company in terms of the number of customers we serve,"" he said. NRG serves around three million homes and businesses.
In the past, NRG racked up billions of dollars of debt by diving into the renewable energy business at the same time U.S. power prices sank as cheap and abundant natural gas from shale formations flooded the market.
Concern about those debts, among other things, led NRG to replace its former CEO David Crane in 2015 and to ultimately agree to sell most of its renewable portfolio, held by its stake in NRG Yield Inc (N:NYLDa), to Global Infrastructure Partners in February.
That deal, along with the sale of some coal and gas plants in Louisiana and Texas and other assets will provide the company with about $3 billion in proceeds and remove around $7 billion in debt, NRG said.
In addition to the asset sales, NRG's GenOn unit is working through bankruptcy proceedings that will see the unit separated from NRG, taking with it much of the company's coal-fired plants.
Gutierrez said he expects the sale of NRG Yield and separation of GenOn to occur in the fourth quarter.
Those transactions will cut NRG's generation portfolio from over 50,000 megawatts in 2015, before Gutierrez started transforming the company, to around 24,000 MW. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes.
""When I became CEO, it was clear we were trying to be too many things to too many people,"" Gutierrez said in a letter to shareholders on Wednesday.
He wants to grow the retail business, especially in the Northeast where NRG still has more generation than it needs to serve customers.
Gutierrez said he wants to increase the size of the retail business through organic growth, but will consider acquisitions if the right opportunity presents itself, like its purchase of retail provider Xoom Energy earlier this year.
""Our retail business is going to inform the size of our generation business,"" Gutierrez said.
NRG shares are up about 18 percent so far this year, after surging 132 percent last year.

Global carmakers have faced a regulatory clamp-down since Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted to deliberately cheating diesel emissions tests in 2015.
Scheuer questioned Zetsche at a closed-door meeting last week over how many Mercedes-Benz vans and cars need to be fixed after a regulator found illegal software in its Vito vans.
German weekly Der Spiegel said there was considerable evidence that diesel engines of the Mercedes C-Class models were also affected.
It said on Friday that Scheuer threatened to fine Daimler up to 5,000 euros per affected car, which it said could total 3.75 billion euros ($4.4 billion) if as many as 750,000 vehicles are involved.
German weekly Die Zeit on Wednesday cited sources as saying that the number of cars affected could be even higher, at up to 900,000.
Die Zeit also said that software updates to Daimler's diesel vehicles would take until 2020. Initially, the updates were to be completed by the end of 2018, it said..
Daimler declined to comment on how many cars could be affected by the diesel emissions issue or to say how long software updates on the diesel vehicles would take.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 06:49AM ET</span>",Airlines struggle with global pilot shortage,"By Jamie Freed, Chayut Setboonsarng and Allison Lampert
SYDNEY/BANGKOK/MONTREAL (Reuters) - A growing shortage of airline pilots is putting the industry's recent growth at risk as planes sit idle, higher salaries cut into profits and unions across the globe push for more benefits.
Carriers such as Emirates and Australia's Qantas Airways (AX:QAN) have poured resources into hiring, but struggled in recent months to use their jets as often as their business plans dictate because of training bottlenecks.
Pilots at Ireland's Ryanair (I:RYA) are forming unions across Europe seeking better working conditions, and those at Air France (PA:AIRF) are striking over pay.
In the United States, pilots who took pay cuts when carriers went bankrupt a decade ago are receiving big raises under new contracts now that airlines are posting strong profits.
The surge in employee costs, which rival fuel as the biggest strain on an airline's finances, comes as higher oil prices are already squeezing margins. Airlines say ticket prices have not kept pace with costs.
""These cost pressures are not about to stop imminently,"" International Air Transport Association (IATA) chief economist Brian Pearce said at the trade group's annual meeting in Sydney, where IATA lowered its airline profit forecast by 12 percent, citing higher fuel and labor costs.
""It's the symptom of a wider issue. If we look at developed economies, unemployment in the OECD has fallen to lows and we are starting to get wage pressures, of which pilot shortages are a symptom in our industry,"" he told airline bosses, many of whom expressed concern about a shortage on the sidelines of the IATA annual meeting this week.
Inflation is beginning to take hold in OECD economies after years of lying dormant, and pilot wages also reflect that, Pearce added.
The high cost of pilot training and several years of earlier hiring freezes in markets like the United States and Australia have deterred potential aviators from entering an industry that Boeing (NYSE:BA) says will need 637,000 more pilots over the next 20 years. 
IATA estimates airline traffic will nearly double during that period, so companies like Canadian training group  CAE  Inc (TO:CAE) and L3 Technologies (N:LLL) are building new flight simulators to cash in on training demand.
Planemakers Airbus and Boeing are also expanding into services like training, where margins are potentially higher than building jets.
And some airlines are planning to expand in-house training programs. Qantas says it will invest A$20 million ($15.26 million) in a new flying school to ensure a supply of pilots amid high turnover in its regional arm QantasLink. Emirates opened a $135 million fight training academy in November for up to 600 cadets.
""We have a social responsibility,"" Qantas Domestic CEO Andrew David said. ""We can continue to take pilots from smaller players in this country and elsewhere but we need to give back and that is part of what we are doing here as well.""
BIDDING WAR
Other airlines are having to look outside their home markets, competing with China, where experienced foreign captains are in high demand and airlines offer annual salaries of up to $314,000 - tax free.
""There is not so much a shortage of pilots as a rising cost of attracting and retaining the pilots you need, particularly the experienced ones,"" said Andrew Herdman, director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. ""There is a bidding war going on.""
In countries where average wages are relatively low, pilots are being offered much cushier pay packages than other professions because they are internationally mobile and must speak English, the global language of aviation.
SriLankan Airlines has lost a ""steady trickle"" of pilots to Gulf carriers, SriLankan CEO Suren Ratwatte, who was an Emirates pilot, told Reuters.
""We pay pretty well because the pilots going (away from the company) go mainly to the Middle East, and we tend to get very close to Gulf salaries except (we are) living in Sri Lanka,"" he said. ""Your lifestyle is pretty decent.""
Thailand's Bangkok Airways PCL (BK:BA) is raising pilot salaries and benefits and hiring foreigners for international flying, President Puttipong Prasarttong-Osot said. 
Pilot unions are taking advantage of shortages to ask for better conditions for their members.
Dan Adamus, president of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) Canada, said Canadian pilots are generally getting pay raises, although salaries at U.S. mainline carriers are higher than at  Air Canada  (TO:AC). 
""It's certainly harder for airlines to recruit qualified pilots,"" he said, which has led carriers to raise pay. ""The pilots are going to go where there is better pay.""
He estimates that about 1,000 Canadian pilots are flying for carriers overseas such as Emirates.
Airlines considered top employers in their home country, such as Qantas and IAG-owned British Airways, are not yet facing shortages of qualified applicants. 
IAG (L:ICAG) Chief Executive Willie Walsh, a former pilot at Ireland's Aer Lingus, said that there were signs of ""pinch points"" within the broader industry but that he did not believe there was a shortage.
""The day you see me back flying is the day you know there's a pilot shortage,"" he said.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",Airlines warned against complacency after dream safety run,"By Jamie Freed and Victoria Bryan
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global airlines, coming off a record-low accident rate in 2017, need to guard against complacency over safety as heavy growth in travel demand stretches the air transport system, industry leaders warned at a conference this week.
There were no jet crashes in 2017 and 19 fatalities across the sector, while some 301 passengers have died in five crashes over just the first five months of 2018, including the first fatality on a U.S. airline since 2009. The other fatal accidents occurred in Cuba, Russia, Iran and Nepal.
Air transportation advocates say it is still by far the safest form of travel. But the industry also needs to modernize a fragmented infrastructure and adopt new technology to keep it safe even as demand balloons, delegates at annual talks of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said.
Alexandre de Juniac, director-general of the group of 280 airlines, called for a continued rigid focus on safety.
""No arrogance in any case: (we need) humility and work,"" he said after IATA's three-day meeting in Sydney.
With IATA forecasting passenger traffic will nearly double by 2036, there are worries over whether the industry will be able to attract and train enough capable pilots and engineers.
Rising congestion in airspace and at airports, some of which are operating above capacity, and poor air traffic control are already posing challenges.
A deadly plane crash in Nepal in March is a case in point.
Airline and airport authorities in Kathmandu have blamed each other after the US-Bangla Airlines crash that killed 49 in what is the Himalayan nation's worst air disaster since 1992.
The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but a transcript of pilot radio conversations with the ground revealed confusion over the designated runway.
Aviation remains a ""very, very safe industry"" despite the accidents this year, but there is concern over whether systems can keep pace with future growth, said Peter Harbison, executive chairman of Sydney-based CAPA Centre for Aviation.
""There are worries about having lesser-trained pilots and that creating more risk, or congested airspace, air traffic control that is not adequate to support the services going through,"" he said.

NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR SAFER SKIES
IATA executives said new air traffic technology is one of the keys to keeping busy skies safe.
""Implementing technology is expensive and difficult but it is available now,"" IATA's senior vice president of safety and flight operations, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, said on the sidelines of the industry's biggest annual gathering.
""It is allowing us to reduce separation safely,"" he said, referring to the ability for jets to fly closer together in a crowded airspace.
IATA called for airlines to share more safety data and use predictive analytics to prevent accidents.
""We are always on edge, always looking to see what we can learn, what we can improve,"" said Alan Joyce, outgoing chairman of the IATA and also the CEO of Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN), which has not had a hull loss since the dawn of the jet age. 
Although accidents are rare in air travel, with the numbers dropping over the past 15 years, they can lead to significant financial and reputational consequences. 

For example, Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) expects its second-quarter unit revenue to drop by about 3 percent, hurt by lower bookings after a fatal engine blowout in April.

The proposal, which was defeated in a vote at Tesla's annual meeting of stockholders on Tuesday, represented the strongest challenge yet to Musk's grip on the Silicon Valley car company.
Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which runs the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, favors dividing the roles of CEO and chairman to boost corporate governance.
The fund also voted against the re-election of board member Antonio Gracias, but backed the reappointment of James Murdoch as well as Elon Musk's brother Kimbal.
NBIM in March voted against Elon Musk's proposed pay package, which was valued by Tesla at $2.6 billion and may ultimately become worth much more, although it was still approved by a majority of shareholders.
The Norwegian fund, which owns 1.4 percent of all globally listed shares, held a 0.48 percent stake in Tesla at the end of 2017, worth $252.5 million, according to the fund's own data.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",Air Baltic's hurry for Bombardier CSeries deal foreshadows jet selling spree,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Latvia-based AirBaltic hastened a deal for Bombardier (TO:BBDb) CSeries planes before Airbus formally takes over the Canadian planemaker because it was worried about securing the right delivery slots, the carrier's chief executive said on Wednesday. 
Airbus (PA:AIR) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier's troubled CSeries jetliner program in October last year after the high-tech plane failed to win enough buyers.
While the Airbus backing gives the CSeries financial stability, most industry sources have said potential customers are waiting for the deal to close before placing orders.
But Air Baltic's move to buck the trend suggests some assume Airbus will speed up sales once the deal closes.
""We could have waited, but we were of the opinion that we better buy them now to secure these (delivery) positions, not to risk that after the takeover somebody else takes (them),"" Martin Gauss told Reuters at a CAPA-Centre for Aviation conference.
""That was, for us, the rationale to say, 'Let's close it now,' because we need the first two aircraft at the end of 2019."" 
Air Baltic's firm order for 30 CS300 aircraft, announced last week, is part of a strategy to move to a harmonized fleet and boost traffic and revenue by 2025. 
The order included options for a further 30 aircraft, potentially taking the fleet to 80 jets by 2025.
""If Airbus sells more in the future then they would have maybe wanted to sell the slots which we have now secured for ourselves,"" Gauss added, referring to the expected pick-up in orders once the takeover is completed.
One issue for the CSeries' second largest customer is that Air Baltic doesn't know what the plane will be called after the takeover. Industry sources say Airbus is considering renaming it the A200, although a decision has not been reached. 
""I have no idea what our aircraft will be called next week. They said they will send stickers to Riga,"" Gauss told CAPA delegates.
The carrier mainly flies Bombardier Q400 turboprop planes and Gauss said that on routes such Riga to Brussels, operating costs are 57 percent lower with the C Series, as it can carry more passengers, fly faster and has more efficient engines. 
Air Baltic has not yet decided how to finance the planes.

""As it is now, it will be a mixture of financed aircraft on the balance sheet and sale-and-leaseback,"" he said. ""We will decide as we go along.""

1546,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",Malaysia's new attorney general vows 'no cover ups' in 1MDB case,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's newly appointed attorney-general Tommy Thomas said on Wednesday there would be ""no cover ups"" as he promised to institute criminal and civil action over a graft scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
At least six countries, including the United States, Singapore and Switzerland, are investigating claims that $4.5 billion was siphoned out of 1MDB, founded by former premier Najib Razak.
""I have therefore to study all the papers in that scandal. We will institute criminal and civil proceedings in our courts against the alleged wrongdoers,"" Thomas told reporters on his first day in office.
""All are equal before the law and no one is spared. There will be no cover up.""
He also said he would immediately contact authorities in other countries investigating 1MDB, with the aim of returning billions of dollars allegedly stolen from the fund.
Other tasks on his immediate agenda included repealing oppressive laws, and reviewing Malaysia's contracts with other countries. 
""On my part, I promise to do the right thing, that is to tell the truth and to do justice. Justice must not only be done but it must also be seen to be done,"" he said. 
Thomas is the country's first non-Muslim attorney-general in decades, and his appointment had been opposed by some sections of the majority ethnic Malay community.
""Free speech means everybody can criticize you, so I am happy for everybody to criticize me,"" Thomas said in response.
He was appointed on Tuesday to replace Mohamed Apandi Ali, who in 2016 had cleared Najib of any wrongdoing in the 1MDB case. 
Mohamed Apandi was ordered to go on leave by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, shortly after Najib's coalition was defeated in a shock election result last month. 
Mahathir also reopened 1MDB investigations and barred Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, from leaving the country. 
Malaysia's anti-corruption commission has questioned both Najib and Rosmah in connection with a graft probe into SRC International, a former unit of 1MDB. 

Najib has denied any wrongdoing and said in 2016 that the Malaysian government would cooperate with U.S. investigations. Rosmah's lawyer said she would cooperate fully with investigators in the case.
